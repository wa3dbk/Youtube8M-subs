echo little miniature guy just loving
these<00:00:21.420> little<00:00:21.660> dudes<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:22.109> flying<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.680> stuff

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
these little dudes for flying and stuff

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.700 
these little dudes for flying and stuff
this<00:00:23.160> one's<00:00:23.369> pretty<00:00:23.550> cool<00:00:23.670> TWA<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.900> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
this one's pretty cool TWA and so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.769 
this one's pretty cool TWA and so
basically<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.609> echo<00:00:27.060> your

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
basically you have your echo your

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.240 
basically you have your echo your
intensity<00:00:28.380> which<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.619> kind<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.099> your

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
intensity which is kind of like your

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.930 
intensity which is kind of like your
feedback<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.109> then<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.650> know<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.949> delay

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
feedback and then you know the delay

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:44.869 
feedback and then you know the delay
rate<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.360> kick<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:38.510> faster<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:42.030> slower<00:00:43.879> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
rate so kick it on faster and slower and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
rate so kick it on faster and slower and
then<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> intensity<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> echo

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
then the intensity so this is the echo

00:00:47.010 --> 00:01:48.700 
then the intensity so this is the echo
so<00:00:47.760> volume

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.230 

cool<00:01:49.710> thing<00:01:49.830> about<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.280> when<00:01:50.580> you<00:01:50.640> when

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
cool thing about this is when you when

00:01:51.240 --> 00:03:14.610 
cool thing about this is when you when
you<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:54.200> crazy

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.200 

little<00:03:15.700> travel<00:03:16.700> delay<00:03:17.540> check<00:03:17.960> it<00:03:18.080> out
