00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 start felling only after making sure 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.710
 required amount of fuel mixture in 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.859
 tank 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.170
 as well as chain lubricants 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.280
 tree and think what factors can 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.410
 affect roll 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.960
 is the tree standing exactly or is it inclined 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.220
 which way the wind blows which way 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.600
 the side should fall tree 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.939
 clear the area around the tree from 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.670
 non- absorbing undergrowth 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.890
 remove branches and other interfering subject 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.810
 from land for directional rolls 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 necessary at the beginning with a saw 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 do on a tree trunk 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.770
 which will determine the direction of the fall 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.230
 the tree at the beginning is made oblique 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
 upper forest at an angle of about 60 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.719
 degrees needed pro before tree 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 by about 20 25 percent of it 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.320
 diameter 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.590
 after that a horizontal cut is made 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.809
 which should converge with the top further 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.260
 you must perform a horizontal cut 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.609
 drank a little higher saw 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.680
 extremely important to stop sawing 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.019
 just before going 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150
 reach the guide cut and leave 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.220
 the so-called not finished not finished 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.320
 keep the tree trunk on the stump 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.570
 and ensures the tree falls into a given 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 direction thickness not finished 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.119
 make up 10 percent tree diameter 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.130
 or at least two centimeters 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.130
 let's first define how 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.530
 do if the saw bar is longer 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.290
 tree diameter 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.360
 stand with your legs apart shoulder-width apart 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.640
 lean on a tree trunk with your shoulder 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.130
 not to leave too high a stump 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.080
 make a guide as far as you can 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.610
 below 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.650
 hold the saw at the right angle and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.200
 guide it to your chosen landmark 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.240
 on the ground he must match up with 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.240
 guiding risks on the body of the saw 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.130
 start the engine and start sawing 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.740
 check from time to time saved 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.530
 whether the correct angle of inclination and direction 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.079
 drank did not remain in the same position 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.909
 make a lower cut for beer make sure 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.369
 that it exactly matches the top 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.179
 oblique cut now itâ€™s time 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.179
 make cuts 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.750
 use either top or bottom 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.760
 cut the tire until it is 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.459
 there will be enough space to insert 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.840
 cooker spatula 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.790
 make sure that the feller blade is not 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.370
 concerns rotating chain 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.560
 when you continue to cut leave 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.860
 uniform in width did not finish as far as 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.860
 it is possible 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.320
 pull out the saw and work feller and 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.520
 blades until the tree starts 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.960
 falling into the night blade is a tool 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.790
 for felling small trees 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.440
 you can use it to prevent 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.510
 fall tree in unwanted 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.720
 direction and clamping the saw 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.670
 apparatus while sawing is now speech 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.890
 will go about working with big trees 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.450
 still need to create 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.090
 proper working area 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.670
 you may need to remove the branches below 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.670
 trunk most secure way 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.420
 make it work the bottom of the tire 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.860
 top down 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.200
 use the barrel as protection 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.580
 between you and the saw never cut 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.410
 branches above shoulder level 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.790
 if the tree has root flows 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.790
 better to remove them 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.060
 in this case the tire is shorter than the diameter 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.660
 the tree is therefore required to apply 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.160
 somewhat complicated technique rolls 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.530
 because the tire won't pass through the trunk 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.420
 the tree fully complete the rail 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.970
 will have to file from the opposite 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.250
 the sides of the tree make sure that the new cuts 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.820
 Same as before 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.840
 exactly 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.840
 as much as possible 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.140
 but 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.810
 the reception you see is called in 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.450
 Ryazan them running the engine to the full 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.090
 power start to insert the bottom 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.549
 the tip of the tire into the barrel directly behind 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.739
 supposed not finished them be 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.440
 careful don't touch the tree at the top 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.660
 tire tip parts when foam tip 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.520
 the barrel will be slightly submerged carefully 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.800
 turn the pilot so that her position 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.990
 it was parallel guiding u will sign 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.080
 push the tire so that it enters 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.080
 tree 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.400
 after that go on a small 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.449
 distance from not finished up approximately 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.669
 for tire width 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.250
 thanks to this you can avoid 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.729
 risk of crashing into not finished when turning 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.240
 saw and carefully go saw around 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.639
 the trunk 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.099
 reaching the middle insert shaft full-time 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.750
 wedge is the best tool for rolls large 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.310
 of trees 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.530
 continue to cut by porridge does not take 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.479
 position parallel to the guide under 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.479
 saw on the opposite side of the trunk 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.870
 if a tree is stuck in the fall 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.240
 another tree 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.520
 You should also ask for help. 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.800
 to a professional if necessary 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.240
 ask for help do not leave 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.240
 tree unattended 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.150
 if the tire is stuck in the trunk do not try 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.070
 pull out the saw stop the engine and 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.860
 push the barrel on both sides 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.160
 cut until the saw comes out 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.160
 out of him
