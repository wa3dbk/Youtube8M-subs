00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
spawn my day e because everyone's been

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
spawn my day e because everyone's been
looking<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.730> palm<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.360> she's<00:00:57.960> nowhere<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.469> be

found<00:00:59.510> it's<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.629> coincidence<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
found it's a coincidence that this is a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
found it's a coincidence that this is a
human<00:01:03.140> that<00:01:04.610> was<00:01:05.610> cool<00:01:05.909> couple<00:01:06.330> days<00:01:06.510> ago<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
human that was cool couple days ago and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.679 
human that was cool couple days ago and
the<00:01:07.080> only<00:01:07.380> person<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:07.950> missing<00:01:08.189> from<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the only person that's missing from the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
the only person that's missing from the
whole<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.170> guns<00:01:11.100> crew<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.030> palm<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> my<00:01:14.400> guess

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
whole of guns crew is palm so my guess

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.649 
whole of guns crew is palm so my guess
is<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.210> palm<00:01:15.780> has<00:01:16.110> been<00:01:16.380> captured<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.659> they

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
is that palm has been captured and they

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
is that palm has been captured and they
think<00:01:18.900> he's<00:01:19.080> been<00:01:19.350> has<00:01:19.770> been<00:01:19.799> killed<00:01:20.460> I've

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
think he's been has been killed I've

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.179 
think he's been has been killed I've
been<00:01:20.909> turned<00:01:21.390> into<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.860> an<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:25.259> another
