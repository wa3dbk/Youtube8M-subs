00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of heeling over and the boat is very

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.219 
of heeling over and the boat is very
twitchy<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:41.580> boats<00:01:41.789> going<00:01:42.060> sideways<00:01:42.479> almost

twitchy the boats going sideways almost

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.380 
twitchy the boats going sideways almost
as<00:01:43.380> fast<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.799> she's<00:01:43.950> moving<00:01:44.250> forward<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.880> if

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
as fast as she's moving forward and if

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.180 
as fast as she's moving forward and if
there<00:01:45.569> was<00:01:45.630> much<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:46.049> wind<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.830> would<00:01:46.979> find

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
there was much more wind we would find

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.280 
there was much more wind we would find
it<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.340> difficult<00:01:47.789> to<00:01:48.149> tack<00:01:48.390> through<00:01:48.690> it

this is greg brown's lovely mark 2gb r35
she's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> very<00:01:57.090> standard<00:01:57.570> boat<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.440> there<00:01:58.560> are

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
she's a very standard boat but there are

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.290 
she's a very standard boat but there are
a<00:01:58.740> few<00:01:58.950> things<00:01:59.160> that<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.550> do<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.150> will

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
a few things that you can do that will

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.840 
a few things that you can do that will
make<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.450> difference<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.080> water<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> can

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
make a difference on the water you can

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.670 
make a difference on the water you can
see<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> mainsail<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.960> set<00:02:04.140> quite<00:02:04.440> high

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
see that the mainsail is set quite high

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.890 
see that the mainsail is set quite high
and<00:02:04.980> I'd<00:02:05.430> recommend<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> Selby<00:02:06.600> lowered

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
and I'd recommend that the Selby lowered

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.620 
and I'd recommend that the Selby lowered
to<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.050> above<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.650> boom<00:02:07.800> fitting<00:02:08.450> once<00:02:09.450> this

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
to just above the boom fitting once this

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.030 
to just above the boom fitting once this
is<00:02:09.810> done<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.140> back<00:02:10.290> of<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> boom<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.710> be

earlier<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:39.630> first<00:02:39.840> thing<00:02:40.020> we'll<00:02:40.140> do<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.530> add

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
earlier the first thing we'll do is add

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.910 
earlier the first thing we'll do is add
some<00:02:40.950> shape<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.610> sails<00:02:42.530> under<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.620> clamp

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
some shape to the sails under the clamp

some shape to the sails under the clamp
on<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.220> back<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.550> your<00:02:44.670> jib<00:02:44.970> boom<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.510> slide

on the back of your jib boom and slide
it<00:02:46.020> towards<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.500> front<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.950> few<00:02:47.250> millimetres

it towards the front a few millimetres

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.790 
it towards the front a few millimetres
this<00:02:48.780> puts<00:02:49.020> camber<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:49.800> shape<00:02:50.459> into<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.000> sail

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
this puts camber or shape into the sail

this puts camber or shape into the sail

the micro magic seems to like quite a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
bit of camber in the jib next we'll do

more there is the more you should ease

the<00:03:13.320> boom<00:03:13.680> out<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.850> end<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.269> jib<00:03:15.480> boom

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the boom out the end of the jib boom

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.479 
the boom out the end of the jib boom
should<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.110> about<00:03:16.320> halfway<00:03:16.650> between<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
should be about halfway between the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.140 
should be about halfway between the
center<00:03:17.880> line<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.660> edge<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.110> deck

center line and the edge of the deck
now<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.209> have<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> basic<00:03:21.870> slot<00:03:22.170> between<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.620> jib

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
now we have a basic slot between the jib

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.309 
now we have a basic slot between the jib
and<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.129> main<00:03:23.310> cell<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:24.750> next<00:03:24.870> thing<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.230> do

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
and the main cell the next thing to do

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.630 
and the main cell the next thing to do
is<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.590> set<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.830> twist<00:03:26.190> up

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
is to set the twist up

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.820 
is to set the twist up
we<00:03:27.239> need<00:03:27.420> twist<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:27.989> acceleration<00:03:28.470> and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
we need twist for acceleration and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.680 
we need twist for acceleration and
because<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.430> wind<00:03:29.610> speed<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:30.030> higher<00:03:30.269> towards

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
because the wind speed is higher towards

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.470 
because the wind speed is higher towards
the<00:03:30.780> top<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.200> sail<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:32.640> do<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:32.970> we<00:03:33.180> attach

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
the top of the sail to do this we attach

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.030 
the top of the sail to do this we attach
a<00:03:33.599> line<00:03:33.810> from<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.080> back<00:03:34.230> end<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.680> jib<00:03:34.860> boom

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
a line from the back end of the jib boom

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.490 
a line from the back end of the jib boom
which<00:03:35.670> we<00:03:35.849> can<00:03:36.000> tighten<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:36.989> induces

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
which we can tighten and this induces

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.369 
which we can tighten and this induces
twists<00:03:37.860> into<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.310> sail<00:03:38.660> we<00:03:39.660> now<00:03:39.810> match<00:03:40.110> this

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
twists into the sail we now match this

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.530 
twists into the sail we now match this
twist<00:03:40.769> in<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.099> main<00:03:41.250> cell<00:03:41.549> by<00:03:42.030> twisting<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
twist in the main cell by twisting the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.350 
twist in the main cell by twisting the
bottle<00:03:42.840> screws<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.590> main<00:03:43.769> boom<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:45.060> trick

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
bottle screws on the main boom the trick

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.210 
bottle screws on the main boom the trick
here<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.810> try<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.200> get<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.530> same<00:03:46.709> twist<00:03:47.069> in

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
here is to try and get the same twist in

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.420 
here is to try and get the same twist in
each<00:03:47.370> sail<00:03:47.959> look<00:03:48.959> down<00:03:49.230> from<00:03:49.530> above<00:03:49.799> so<00:03:50.099> you

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
each sail look down from above so you

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.030 
each sail look down from above so you
can<00:03:50.610> see<00:03:50.790> how<00:03:50.940> much<00:03:51.120> effect<00:03:51.269> you're<00:03:51.690> having

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
can see how much effect you're having
