00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.810 

paper<00:05:41.990> i<00:05:42.380> told<00:05:42.890> you<00:05:42.980> i've<00:05:43.100> never<00:05:43.340> done<00:05:43.610> this

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820

paper i told you i've never done this
before<00:05:44.030> right<00:05:44.300> so<00:05:45.169> I'm<00:05:45.590> kind<00:05:45.890> of<00:05:45.980> learning<00:05:46.340> my

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
before right so I'm kind of learning my

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.510 
before right so I'm kind of learning my
techniques<00:05:47.450> as<00:05:47.720> I<00:05:47.840> know<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:48.919> see<00:05:49.100> if<00:05:49.130> there's<00:05:49.430> a

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
techniques as I know to see if there's a

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.830 
techniques as I know to see if there's a
a<00:05:50.020> good<00:05:51.020> way<00:05:51.200> to<00:05:51.260> do<00:05:51.590> this<00:05:51.800> but<00:05:52.790> so<00:05:53.450> it's<00:05:53.600> kind

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
a good way to do this but so it's kind

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.730 
a good way to do this but so it's kind
of<00:05:53.870> like<00:05:54.020> a<00:05:54.080> splatter<00:05:55.210> sort<00:05:56.210> of<00:05:56.360> looking<00:05:56.930> thing

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
of like a splatter sort of looking thing

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.540 
of like a splatter sort of looking thing
but<00:05:58.360> I'm<00:05:59.360> going<00:05:59.750> to<00:05:59.810> actually<00:06:00.020> do<00:06:00.470> a<00:06:00.500> piece<00:06:01.220> of

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
but I'm going to actually do a piece of

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.140 
but I'm going to actually do a piece of
art<00:06:02.210> that<00:06:03.040> looks<00:06:04.040> a<00:06:04.160> little<00:06:04.190> bit<00:06:04.520> like<00:06:04.730> my<00:06:04.940> art

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
art that looks a little bit like my art

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.640 
art that looks a little bit like my art
last<00:06:05.390> year<00:06:05.570> I<00:06:05.600> think<00:06:05.870> I'm<00:06:06.020> kind<00:06:06.290> of<00:06:06.350> like<00:06:06.530> the

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
last year I think I'm kind of like the

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.070 
last year I think I'm kind of like the
one<00:06:06.680> trick<00:06:07.130> pony<00:06:07.460> when<00:06:07.760> it<00:06:07.880> comes<00:06:08.060> to<00:06:08.300> painting

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
one trick pony when it comes to painting

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.880 
one trick pony when it comes to painting
but<00:06:09.530> I<00:06:09.830> have<00:06:10.280> this<00:06:10.370> idea<00:06:11.230> it<00:06:12.230> might<00:06:12.410> take<00:06:12.680> me

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
but I have this idea it might take me

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.250 
but I have this idea it might take me
ten<00:06:13.100> or<00:06:13.250> fifteen<00:06:13.580> minutes<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:14.000> do<00:06:14.270> so<00:06:14.540> I'm

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
ten or fifteen minutes to do so I'm

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.630 
ten or fifteen minutes to do so I'm
going<00:06:15.410> to<00:06:15.440> keep<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.680> camera<00:06:16.100> on<00:06:16.130> but<00:06:16.550> i'll

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
going to keep the camera on but i'll

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.700
