billion can't understand which is to

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.270 
billion can't understand which is to
blame<00:03:21.599> but<00:03:22.200> what<00:03:22.349> happens<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.130> on<00:03:23.250> a

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
blame but what happens is this is on a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.120 
blame but what happens is this is on a
maximum<00:03:23.730> DPM<00:03:24.150> which<00:03:24.389> is<00:03:24.889> 3200<00:03:25.940> 3003<00:03:26.940> 200<00:03:27.450> DPI

maximum DPM which is 3200 3003 200 DPI
okay<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.519> what<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> correct<00:03:30.030> much<00:03:30.180> because<00:03:30.660> as

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
okay just what I correct much because as

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.000 
okay just what I correct much because as
well<00:03:30.900> see<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.139> previous<00:03:31.410> video<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.769> made<00:03:31.950> a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
well see the previous video I made a

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.039 
well see the previous video I made a
mistake<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:32.669> 2000<00:03:33.269> when<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.870> should<00:03:34.019> have

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
mistake and so 2000 when it should have

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.490 
mistake and so 2000 when it should have
been<00:03:34.579> 3200

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
been 3200

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.110 
been 3200
and<00:03:37.500> obviously<00:03:38.040> dipping<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.670> little<00:03:38.940> there

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
and obviously dipping a little there

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.500 
and obviously dipping a little there
will<00:03:40.019> be<00:03:40.170> minus<00:03:40.379> around<00:03:40.890> applause<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.480> is

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
will be minus around applause so this is
