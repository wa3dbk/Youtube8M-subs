we're<00:00:01.380> asked<00:00:01.709> in<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:01.890> problem<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.370> determine

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
we're asked in this problem to determine

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.420 
we're asked in this problem to determine
the<00:00:02.939> domain<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.570> range<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.799> function<00:00:04.830> f

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
the domain and range of the function f

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.330 
the domain and range of the function f
of<00:00:05.640> X<00:00:05.879> equals<00:00:06.359> negative<00:00:06.629> 2x<00:00:07.049> squared<00:00:07.470> minus<00:00:08.099> 6

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
of X equals negative 2x squared minus 6

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580 
of X equals negative 2x squared minus 6
I'm<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.210> start<00:00:09.540> by<00:00:09.750> graphing<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.380> on

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
I'm going to start by graphing this on

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.190 
I'm going to start by graphing this on
my<00:00:10.889> graphing<00:00:11.309> calculator<00:00:11.599> so<00:00:12.599> if<00:00:12.960> there's

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
my graphing calculator so if there's

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.180 
my graphing calculator so if there's
anything<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.950> y1<00:00:14.460> or<00:00:14.790> any<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.420> other<00:00:15.540> Y

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
anything in the y1 or any of the other Y

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.130 
anything in the y1 or any of the other Y
equations<00:00:17.190> go<00:00:17.400> ahead<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.789> clear<00:00:18.779> those<00:00:18.930> out

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
equations go ahead and clear those out

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.980 
equations go ahead and clear those out
and<00:00:19.470> then<00:00:20.039> let's<00:00:20.490> enter<00:00:20.970> our<00:00:21.600> function

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and then let's enter our function

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.189 
and then let's enter our function
negative<00:00:23.359> 2x<00:00:24.359> squared<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:26.840> -6

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
negative 2x squared and -6

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.870 
negative 2x squared and -6
I'm<00:00:28.320> gonna<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.650> ahead<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.920> graph<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
I'm gonna go ahead and graph that on a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.490 
I'm gonna go ahead and graph that on a
standard<00:00:30.449> window<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.050> let<00:00:31.170> me<00:00:31.260> check<00:00:31.439> my

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
standard window so let me check my

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.940 
standard window so let me check my
window<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.850> get<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> 10<00:00:33.300> -<00:00:33.510> 10<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:34.110> X<00:00:34.320> min<00:00:34.620> x

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
window and I get a 10 - 10 for X min x

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.440 
window and I get a 10 - 10 for X min x
max<00:00:35.190> Y<00:00:36.090> min<00:00:36.390> Y<00:00:36.630> max<00:00:36.960> I'm<00:00:37.320> gonna<00:00:37.710> press<00:00:37.950> graph<00:00:38.450> so

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
max Y min Y max I'm gonna press graph so

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.720 
max Y min Y max I'm gonna press graph so
that's<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> give<00:00:40.649> me<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.309> pretty<00:00:41.640> good

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
that's going to give me a pretty good

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760 
that's going to give me a pretty good
idea<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> graph<00:00:43.170> looks<00:00:43.260> like

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
idea of what the graph looks like

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.350 
idea of what the graph looks like
there's<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> whole<00:00:44.250> lot<00:00:44.430> more<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:45.059> down

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
there's a whole lot more going on down

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.170 
there's a whole lot more going on down
here<00:00:45.469> but<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:46.649> our<00:00:47.039> window<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.969> now

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
here but because our window here is now

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.580 
here but because our window here is now
equivalent<00:00:48.570> I'm<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> leave<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
equivalent I'm just going to leave it

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.549 
equivalent I'm just going to leave it
but<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.879> ascertain<00:00:51.629> some<00:00:51.899> things<00:00:52.170> from<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
but I can ascertain some things from the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.910 
but I can ascertain some things from the
graph<00:00:52.860> first<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> look<00:00:55.710> at

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
graph first of all I can take a look at

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.090 
graph first of all I can take a look at
the<00:00:56.719> vertical<00:00:57.719> intercept<00:00:58.199> which<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> this

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the vertical intercept which in this

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.810 
the vertical intercept which in this
case<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.760> 0<00:01:00.420> negative<00:01:01.050> 6<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.160> verify<00:01:02.399> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
case is 0 negative 6 I can verify that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
case is 0 negative 6 I can verify that
by<00:01:03.390> looking<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> function<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.339> C

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
by looking at the function here the C

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.260 
by looking at the function here the C
value<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.180> negative<00:01:06.630> 6<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.520> vertical

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
value is negative 6 so the vertical

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
value is negative 6 so the vertical
intercept<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:16.040> 0<00:01:17.040> negative<00:01:17.640> 6<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:19.110> going

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
intercept is 0 negative 6 so I'm going

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.609 
intercept is 0 negative 6 so I'm going
to<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:19.439> ahead<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.070> graph<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.280> 1<00:01:20.939> 2<00:01:21.150> 3<00:01:21.450> 4<00:01:21.900> 5<00:01:22.229> 6

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
to go ahead and graph that 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
to go ahead and graph that 1 2 3 4 5 6
so<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.460> my<00:01:23.700> vertical<00:01:24.030> intercept<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.840> have

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
so there is my vertical intercept I have

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.469 
so there is my vertical intercept I have
a<00:01:25.080> hunch<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.369> also<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> equal

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
a hunch that that's also going to equal

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.770 
a hunch that that's also going to equal
the<00:01:27.689> vertex<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.829> I'm<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.310> positive<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.180> I'm

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the vertex but I'm not positive so I'm

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960 
the vertex but I'm not positive so I'm
going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.110> ahead<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.680> check<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
going to go ahead and check so the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.679 
going to go ahead and check so the
vertex<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.259> need<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.040> look<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.000> input

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
vertex now I need to look at the input

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.210 
vertex now I need to look at the input
which<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.680> x<00:01:38.159> equals<00:01:38.850> negative<00:01:39.299> B<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:40.020> 2a<00:01:40.860> in

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
which is x equals negative B over 2a in

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.429 
which is x equals negative B over 2a in
this<00:01:41.579> case<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.659> no<00:01:42.990> X<00:01:43.320> term<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.430> B<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.450> 0

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
this case there is no X term so B is 0

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.800 
this case there is no X term so B is 0
over<00:01:47.340> 2<00:01:48.240> times<00:01:49.340> negative<00:01:50.340> 2<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.240> that's<00:01:51.600> just

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
over 2 times negative 2 and that's just

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.190 
over 2 times negative 2 and that's just
going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> give<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.350> 0<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.670> when<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.030> input<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.780> 0

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
going to give me 0 so when my input is 0

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.969 
going to give me 0 so when my input is 0
my<00:01:55.920> output<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.850> already<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.869> negative<00:01:58.680> 6

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
my output I already know is negative 6

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.550 
my output I already know is negative 6
so<00:01:59.280> indeed<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.329> vertical<00:02:00.750> intercepts<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so indeed the vertical intercepts and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.020 
so indeed the vertical intercepts and
the<00:02:01.829> vertex<00:02:02.430> are<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.840> same<00:02:04.170> point<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.280> can

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the vertex are the same point I can

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.700 
the vertex are the same point I can
graph<00:02:06.270> down<00:02:06.659> from<00:02:07.049> here

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
graph down from here

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.520 
graph down from here
based<00:02:08.099> upon<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.759> shape<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.720> shown<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
based upon the shape that's shown on the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.619 
based upon the shape that's shown on the
calculator<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.970> looks<00:02:12.180> something<00:02:12.450> like

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
calculator so it looks something like

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.520 
calculator so it looks something like
that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.150 
that
so<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.220> want<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.880> find<00:02:15.210> then<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.260> domain<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
so I want to find then the domain and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.670 
so I want to find then the domain and
the<00:02:17.340> range<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.150> function<00:02:18.530> remember<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the range for this function remember the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.750 
the range for this function remember the
domain<00:02:19.860> deals<00:02:20.640> with<00:02:20.970> input<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.490> when<00:02:23.490> you're

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
domain deals with input and when you're

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.030 
domain deals with input and when you're
working<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.720> quadratic<00:02:25.230> function<00:02:25.410> you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
working with the quadratic function you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.080 
working with the quadratic function you
can<00:02:26.250> use<00:02:26.460> any<00:02:26.870> value<00:02:27.870> for<00:02:28.080> x<00:02:28.140> as<00:02:28.650> input<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
can use any value for x as input and the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.750 
can use any value for x as input and the
way<00:02:30.270> we<00:02:30.480> write<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.930> as<00:02:30.990> domain<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.490> say

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
way we write that as domain is we say

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
way we write that as domain is we say
all<00:02:33.090> real<00:02:33.930> numbers<00:02:35.150> there's<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.270> couple<00:02:36.660> of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
all real numbers there's a couple of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.810 
all real numbers there's a couple of
other<00:02:36.930> ways<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.530> can<00:02:37.770> write<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.340> you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
other ways that you can write that you

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.230 
other ways that you can write that you
can<00:02:39.030> say<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:40.040> using<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.280> inequality

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
can say that using this inequality

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.680 
can say that using this inequality
notation<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:43.560> X<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.790> any<00:02:45.120> value<00:02:45.240> greater

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
notation that X can be any value greater

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.500 
notation that X can be any value greater
than<00:02:46.200> negative<00:02:46.620> infinity<00:02:47.430> less<00:02:48.239> than

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
than negative infinity less than

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.380 
than negative infinity less than
infinity<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.310> also<00:02:50.550> use<00:02:51.030> what's<00:02:51.330> called

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
infinity you can also use what's called

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.990 
infinity you can also use what's called
interval<00:02:52.110> notation<00:02:52.800> which<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.580> kind<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.910> a

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
interval notation which is kind of a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
interval notation which is kind of a
shorthand<00:02:54.360> for<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.950> inequality<00:02:56.670> notation

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
shorthand for this inequality notation

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.430 
shorthand for this inequality notation
here<00:02:58.400> now<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.820> find<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.270> range<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> little

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
here now to find the range is a little

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.610 
here now to find the range is a little
bit<00:03:01.560> trickier<00:03:02.070> because<00:03:02.510> my<00:03:03.510> graph<00:03:03.780> opens<00:03:04.350> down

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
bit trickier because my graph opens down

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.850 
bit trickier because my graph opens down
all<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.580> my<00:03:06.150> outputs<00:03:06.780> are<00:03:07.050> either<00:03:07.380> going<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.650> be

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
all of my outputs are either going to be

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.810 
all of my outputs are either going to be
negative<00:03:08.340> 6<00:03:08.700> or<00:03:09.110> below<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.739> anything<00:03:11.370> less

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
negative 6 or below so anything less

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.500 
negative 6 or below so anything less
than<00:03:12.209> or<00:03:12.650> including<00:03:13.650> negative<00:03:14.130> 6<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.760> going<00:03:15.450> to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
than or including negative 6 is going to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.020 
than or including negative 6 is going to
be<00:03:15.690> part<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.260> my<00:03:16.470> range<00:03:16.800> so<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> could<00:03:17.610> write<00:03:17.880> it

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
be part of my range so I could write it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.900 
be part of my range so I could write it
this<00:03:18.209> way<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.900> could<00:03:19.680> say<00:03:19.860> negative<00:03:20.130> infinity

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
this way I could say negative infinity

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.100 
this way I could say negative infinity
is<00:03:21.150> less<00:03:21.660> than<00:03:21.930> f<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.560> X<00:03:23.060> is<00:03:24.060> less<00:03:24.120> than<00:03:24.900> or

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
is less than f of X is less than or

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.550 
is less than f of X is less than or
equal<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.980> negative<00:03:26.640> 6<00:03:26.970> because<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:28.320> can

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
equal to negative 6 because I can

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.490 
equal to negative 6 because I can
actually<00:03:28.860> use<00:03:29.519> negative<00:03:30.000> 6<00:03:30.299> notice<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.230> can't

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
actually use negative 6 notice I can't

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.220 
actually use negative 6 notice I can't
use<00:03:31.709> any<00:03:32.040> output<00:03:32.640> value<00:03:33.390> or<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.630> should<00:03:33.900> say<00:03:34.049> no

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
use any output value or I should say no

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.949 
use any output value or I should say no
output<00:03:34.739> value<00:03:35.100> will<00:03:35.280> be<00:03:35.430> obtained<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.750> is

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
output value will be obtained that is

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.860 
output value will be obtained that is
bigger<00:03:37.260> than<00:03:37.860> negative<00:03:38.130> 6<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.510> would<00:03:39.690> be

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
bigger than negative 6 so here would be

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.890 
bigger than negative 6 so here would be
inequality<00:03:40.709> notation<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.610> can<00:03:41.940> also<00:03:42.390> take<00:03:42.870> that

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
inequality notation I can also take that

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.610 
inequality notation I can also take that
and<00:03:43.380> write<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.829> using<00:03:43.980> interval<00:03:44.610> notation

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
and write it using interval notation

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.910 
and write it using interval notation
this<00:03:46.620> way<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.579> if<00:03:47.940> your<00:03:48.120> parabola<00:03:48.590> opens<00:03:49.590> down

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
this way so if your parabola opens down

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.060 
this way so if your parabola opens down
then<00:03:50.549> your<00:03:50.790> maximum<00:03:51.660> range<00:03:51.989> value<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.799> going

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
then your maximum range value is going

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.390 
then your maximum range value is going
to<00:03:53.130> be<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.600> y-value<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.660> your<00:03:55.110> vertex<00:03:55.560> if<00:03:55.860> your

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
to be the y-value of your vertex if your

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.050 
to be the y-value of your vertex if your
parabola<00:03:56.760> opens<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.900> then<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.070> minimum<00:03:59.519> value

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
parabola opens up then the minimum value

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.850 
parabola opens up then the minimum value
of<00:04:00.299> your<00:04:00.480> range<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:01.079> going<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.410> be<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.680> y

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
of your range is going to be the y

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.030 
of your range is going to be the y
coordinate<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:02.640> your<00:04:02.760> vertex
