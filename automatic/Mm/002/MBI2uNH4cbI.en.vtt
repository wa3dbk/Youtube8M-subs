00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
do we need to improve efficiency you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
do we need to improve efficiency you
know<00:00:58.469> things<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.769> running<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.339> agility<00:01:00.170> we

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
know things like running and agility we

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840 
know things like running and agility we
also<00:01:01.319> need<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.190> power<00:01:02.460> endurance

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
also need to have that power endurance

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.760 
also need to have that power endurance
as<00:01:03.149> such<00:01:03.299> as<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.569> call<00:01:03.749> or<00:01:03.899> explosive<00:01:04.470> efforts

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
as such as we call or explosive efforts

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:12.250 
as such as we call or explosive efforts
under<00:01:05.010> fatigue<00:01:05.160> so<00:01:06.320> yeah<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.440> still<00:01:07.620> use<00:01:07.770> them

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.020 

it's<00:01:13.260> virtually<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.980> know<00:01:14.100> started<00:01:14.550> like<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it's virtually you know started like a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's virtually you know started like a
general<00:01:15.450> phase<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.860> wanted<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.280> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
general phase we wanted to to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.930 
general phase we wanted to to
consciously<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> boys<00:01:19.170> bigger<00:01:19.940> in

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
consciously get the boys bigger in

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.250 
consciously get the boys bigger in
pre-season<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.690> we<00:01:21.810> use<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.050> lot<00:01:22.230> of

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
pre-season so we use a lot of

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.350 
pre-season so we use a lot of
hypertrophy<00:01:22.920> methods<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.060> sort<00:01:24.300> of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
hypertrophy methods and and that sort of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
hypertrophy methods and and that sort of
thing<00:01:24.540> integrated<00:01:25.230> with<00:01:25.320> Fitness<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> we

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
thing integrated with Fitness and we

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.010 
thing integrated with Fitness and we
wanted<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.250> make<00:01:26.850> sure<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
wanted to make sure that we got that and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.560 
wanted to make sure that we got that and
now<00:01:28.200> we're<00:01:28.350> moving<00:01:28.560> towards<00:01:29.010> sort<00:01:29.160> of<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
now we're moving towards sort of the

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.520 
now we're moving towards sort of the
specifics<00:01:30.570> more<00:01:31.170> sort<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.500> rugby<00:01:31.740> fitness

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.080 

you've<00:01:36.530> got<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.799> realize<00:01:36.920> it<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:37.579> might<00:01:37.880> be<00:01:38.060> out

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
you've got to realize it we might be out

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.700 
you've got to realize it we might be out
there<00:01:38.360> for<00:01:38.630> eight<00:01:39.140> weeks<00:01:39.170> if<00:01:39.530> we're

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
there for eight weeks if we're

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.010 
there for eight weeks if we're
successful<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.579> eight<00:01:40.970> weeks<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.509> keep<00:01:41.930> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
successful so eight weeks to keep the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.960 
successful so eight weeks to keep the
maintenance<00:01:42.229> phase<00:01:42.590> up<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.579> probably<00:01:43.729> not

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
maintenance phase up it's probably not

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.569 
maintenance phase up it's probably not
productive<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.680> know<00:01:45.770> we<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.340> have<00:01:46.369> to

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
productive so you know we do have to

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.310 
productive so you know we do have to
have<00:01:46.729> top<00:01:46.939> ups<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.329> terms<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.750> fitness<00:01:47.930> and

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
have top ups in terms of fitness and

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.960 
have top ups in terms of fitness and
sometimes<00:01:48.950> we've<00:01:49.100> got<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.610> know<00:01:49.700> bigger

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
sometimes we've got you know bigger

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.520 
sometimes we've got you know bigger
turnarounds<00:01:50.509> two-week<00:01:50.810> turnaround<00:01:50.960> rather

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
turnarounds two-week turnaround rather

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.440 
turnarounds two-week turnaround rather
than<00:01:51.679> one<00:01:51.830> week<00:01:52.039> so<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.909> know<00:01:52.939> we<00:01:53.090> will<00:01:53.270> do

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
than one week so you know we will do

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.060 
than one week so you know we will do
top-up<00:01:53.840> fitness<00:01:54.229> sessions<00:01:54.409> to<00:01:54.740> ensure<00:01:55.039> that

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
top-up fitness sessions to ensure that

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.859 
top-up fitness sessions to ensure that
we're<00:01:55.700> still<00:01:55.909> up<00:01:56.030> there<00:01:56.060> rather<00:01:56.450> than<00:01:56.659> just

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
we're still up there rather than just

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.940 
we're still up there rather than just
sort<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.289> maintenance<00:02:02.049> yeah<00:02:03.049> definitely

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
sort of maintenance yeah definitely

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.620 
sort of maintenance yeah definitely
individuals<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.640> know<00:02:04.759> we<00:02:04.909> track

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
individuals you know we track

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.059 
individuals you know we track
individuals<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.500> terms<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.799> their<00:02:06.920> physical

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
individuals in terms of their physical

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.400 
individuals in terms of their physical
quality<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:07.819> we<00:02:07.909> do<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.780> know<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.929> large<00:02:09.170> sort

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
quality so we do you know a large sort

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.470 
quality so we do you know a large sort
of<00:02:09.470> physical<00:02:09.830> quality<00:02:10.220> Diagnostics<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.420> know

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
of physical quality Diagnostics you know

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.449 
of physical quality Diagnostics you know
we<00:02:11.600> have<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> look<00:02:11.989> at<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.560> know<00:02:12.590> endurance<00:02:13.220> and

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
we have a look at you know endurance and

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.970 
we have a look at you know endurance and
strength<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.090> power<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:14.690> speed<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.350> then

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
strength and power and speed and then

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.710 
strength and power and speed and then
you<00:02:16.190> know<00:02:16.340> we<00:02:16.459> do<00:02:16.610> give<00:02:16.790> individual<00:02:17.269> programs

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
you know we do give individual programs

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.080 
you know we do give individual programs
they<00:02:18.230> tend<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.620> gravitate<00:02:18.860> towards<00:02:19.819> sort<00:02:20.000> of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
they tend to gravitate towards sort of

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.479 
they tend to gravitate towards sort of
the<00:02:20.269> positional<00:02:21.010> areas<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.220> players<00:02:23.440> but

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
the positional areas of the players but

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.470 
the positional areas of the players but
realistically<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.700> boys<00:02:25.880> are<00:02:26.060> all<00:02:26.209> getting

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
realistically the boys are all getting

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.240 
realistically the boys are all getting
that<00:02:26.599> really<00:02:26.930> big<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.620> know<00:02:27.709> there's<00:02:27.920> there's

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
that really big you know there's there's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.160 
that really big you know there's there's
not<00:02:28.549> too<00:02:28.760> many<00:02:28.940> players<00:02:29.269> sort<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.720> under<00:02:29.959> six

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
not too many players sort of under six

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.800 
not too many players sort of under six
foot<00:02:30.349> anymore<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.130> they<00:02:31.760> all<00:02:32.030> sometimes<00:02:32.630> you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
foot anymore so they all sometimes you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.690 
foot anymore so they all sometimes you
know<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.049> centres<00:02:33.410> look<00:02:33.620> like<00:02:33.769> back<00:02:33.980> rows<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
know the centres look like back rows and

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.699 
know the centres look like back rows and
and<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.120> sort<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.390> thing<00:02:35.569> so<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:36.650> know

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
and that sort of thing so you know

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.390 
and that sort of thing so you know
they're<00:02:37.099> big<00:02:37.310> big<00:02:37.640> monsters<00:02:38.060> these<00:02:38.209> days
