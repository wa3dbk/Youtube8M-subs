00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 speaks guys this is the first man is 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.740
 combat the grandson of the program that 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.810
 people will have the biggest clashes of 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.790
 pop and today we will decide who is the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.590
 best man in theaters and I go 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.969
 Defend the Indian Garfield and I will 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.200
 defending the problem now is because it plays 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.880
 very young does not know what is good about 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.540
 true there you can not only cry that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.540
 I drank water 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.750
 ai will play because it is the best park 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.059
 first because it 's a lot more expensive 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.829
 charismatic I have hurt myself charisma 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.690
 is synonymous with Peter Spiderman 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.329
 parker and play football in a guy 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.940
 both on-screen and off-screen. 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.739
 her and he's a much nerd 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.449
 that the spider man than the peter parker 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.640
 the tournament wait to see that in the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.430
 scenes from the movie he builds is himself 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 and no web is born. 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 nothing on the guy's wrist already starts there 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.600
 another thing that he is a p park has 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.270
 much more a direct relationship with the aunt 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.280
 Mei understood he plays with her and I called him 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.630
 likes to be with her more than 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.490
 a release that we do not see many 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 sometimes they take water instead of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.640
 patience also that he is a p park that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.580
 is much more identified with the generation 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.840
 who today read the spider man much more 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.630
 of what other people really wanted 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.310
 time he is a nerd and a lot more guy 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.520
 similar to the younger people 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.680
 understood sum up in playing soccer pt 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.420
 rock much better than drinking water because 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.040
 it is much more current and does not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.670
 replicating man was created in the years 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670
 60 and 70 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.400
 since you're talking about fidelity 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.500
 there in the comics and if I was a kid 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.080
 What do you like is this spider man who 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.440
 speaks to the young people who are involved 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.540
 such 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.000
 He is ten years old at the most and Peter 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.880
 parker of the tone of heartache and that nerd 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.500
 more gourd even he is almost 50 years old 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.210
 he is much older than 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.130
 trigger have excuse trigger 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.680
 mechanical loom is very comprehensive 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.479
 It's not like a 15-year-old kid to do 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.399
 a business of that technology so 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.200
 that having organized his arm I 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.539
 I find this quite normal from the hymns 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.539
 I'll tear you down from the radio. 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.150
 not to mention that in 2002 make 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.920
 He was younger now than I am. 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.170
 bottle of when he has already done and he is 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.720
 american andrew garfield english 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.760
 he is not American as peter pays no 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.370
 let me talk about charisma peter parker 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.290
 to take he cries he gets excited 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.680
 along with us with the adventures of 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.680
 Spider man 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.490
 that is to say, while the average 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:50.900
 gabriel mala with no handle to take goal and 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:52.340
 how are we going to play because it 's the 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.230
 best spider man first because he 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.850
 It is much funnier at the time of action and 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.380
 this is something that in all 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.850
 spiderman comic has always been 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.770
 a very strong feature of the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.750
 character you can see that in both 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.350
 movies although the movies are not very 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.850
 Good 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.440
 the action scenes as they are very 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.030
 mostly funny that scene 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.920
 what about the policeman who stays 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.510
 playing with the knife is already there 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.160
 still talking about the scenes of 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.830
 action is that the spectacular Spider-Man 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.960
 people have the best action scenes of 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.060
 spider man franchise we can see 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.980
 the elektro scene in the spectacular man 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.080
 spider 2 that even in the very first film 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.970
 with hc the very cool scenes that 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.570
 that is there appears the library is very 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.780
 best 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.190
 and to finish we have something 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.140
 that is the uniform of the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.390
 spectacular spider man who is very 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.700
 better than that awful uniform 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.700
 which was used in the three films of the rays 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.280
 uniform of the spectacular spider man in 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.320
 play 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.489
 it's the best uniform they've ever done 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.320
 Spiderman in theaters 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.290
 do not have the slightest comparison when taking 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.940
 from the fabric to the shape of the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.739
 I wish I could remember that one too. 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.830
 initial scene the spectacular spider man 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.000
 2 that the best scene of the spider in the cinema 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.800
 Look, I wanted to say that you do not have the slightest 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.440
 condition you compare effects 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.330
 visual effects of 2012 when in 2002 it is 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.150
 that the sock will look much more 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.100
 efficient and verisimilious flying and jumping 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.750
 and struggling now they talk in uniform do not 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.580
 come talk about the uniform of the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.810
 Spectacular Spider-Man 1 looks made 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.130
 basketball ball 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.500
 It has no way to be better than 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.080
 technology, they recognized it 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.990
 and the spider man 2 clothing is a fusion 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.790
 of the new mask with the old tom clothes 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.720
 of sorrow, that is, they recognized that 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.370
 before was much better 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.260
 and speaking on the action scene sorry to say 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.450
 but can not compare with the scene of the 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.280
 training the Spider Man 2 when it to 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.900
 the training taking in the buildings 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.300
 we know the spider man by 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.340
 sacrifice he sacrifices he delivers 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.840
 his secret identity to save 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.730
 and he ends up charged by the crowd 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.350
 Sorry to say but I've never seen between the 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.350
 gaucho being carried by people 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.190
 and speaking on the scene, there's no way 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.380
 forget the kiss on the head that the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.030
 tone of sorrow inherited there at the 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.590
 lawyer is not the boring behind the 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.280
 water and he gets her killed 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.280
 at the movies 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:15.530
 Diguinho was one of the main things 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.540
 For you to have a good acting in the cinema is 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.920
 you incorporate the character into life 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.960
 we can see what the 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.030
 tony stark robert downey junior where 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.310
 cat even turned a fan of man 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.440
 spider or the spider man in san 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.600
 Diego Comic-Con when we saw him there and 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.330
 appearing and taking off a face mask 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.310
 very charismatic and the face of the FARC and en 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.890
 let us also remember that he has the 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.270
 best romantic vinegar chemistry in 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.120
 spiderman movies because nobody 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.900
 tolerate the tolima goya and those in dance 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.900
 It's for God's sake. 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.630
 and let's also combine that the cast of 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.340
 garfield support is much better doing 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.430
 with which he has a much more 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.990
 convincing and crying take up mourning and how 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.000
 We already said that in the other rounds 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.470
 he is a spider man much more 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.060
 funny that gives you believe 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.860
 much more that it is within the 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.420
 even than to take now is a guy 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.880
 who cries all the time and looks like 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.500
 old despite the cat of his 28 years 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.030
 in the end we can see that 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.070
 he is a much better actor to take 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.400
 now when he is English and plays a role 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.360
 American very well playing in the fund is 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.360
 best spider man in the cinema 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.560
 they look just wanted to say who 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.110
 cries does not have to cry 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.150
 beautiful the tone of heartache cries fair more 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.100
 He does not cry as hard as the cat who 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.290
 the guy who only knows how to cry practically 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.210
 already took now no he is happy 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.700
 he dances with the raindrops when 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.890
 play the song he's convinced 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.350
 how it is produced by the symbiont is the 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.750
 face that is much more versatile he did 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.700
 in three films several transformations that 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.770
 really convinced that even though he 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.050
 have aged he was still young 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.560
 jovial as well as peter parker from 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.630
 comic books 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.190
 already the gaucho of that face that represents 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.170
 Today's kids who grew up 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.240
 with rose milk he does not have to go through 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.890
 by pm none meanwhile take goya 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.360
 who is a real nerd because he lives 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.010
 in the shadow of his best friend that the 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.050
 leonardo de caprio still had to 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.300
 face the face of the flash that was the 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.760
 jonas jackson from the trilogy we never 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.900
 Are you going to forget that? 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.850
 haha ha 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.070
 ah ah ah the guy got through 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.199
 fernando since on top and also in the village 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.850
 liner who was a big green sick 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:23.020
 much better than that green elf who 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.340
 He barely got out of bed. 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.340
 these in the cause 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.150
 dra
