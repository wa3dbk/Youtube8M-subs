00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.230
 to 60 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.380
 wafer 31 m with the first as you have 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.420
 seen in the title and good the key to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.089
 be basically all the time in the area 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.289
 of cep we are already seeing me for this 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.230
 area will always be in this house 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.900
 spinning the mouse or watching me is that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.970
 on this map I do not know what but the steps 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.460
 they are the footsteps of the enemies 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.510
 I am an absolute barbarity that is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.850
 amazing as good for tele 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.620
 to listen to steps and also as you see 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.960
 they took situation form but when 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.210
 they give me all the advantages, it's a h 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.610
 it is as you hear in the report of 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.050
 situation but in that deserted area very 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.420
 awesome and get now I'm by 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.770
 but here I am going to go there 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.930
 for the area of a novel I have with 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.030
 muffler and rapid fire the truth the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.400
 I was testing with silencers 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.640
 large chargers but you have to give it 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.160
 many many bullets to kill or 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.140
 I prefer that he kill me more and have less 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.630
 to have more so that it costs more to kill 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.460
 the truth today is caught also does the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.990
 soil that I'm going to do is three pages 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.810
 with them but basically the mega time 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.930
 is with the 9 pm if you remember the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.870
 beginning of this game the pm 9 was like 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.790
 the most painful weapon that there was but the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.580
 true that we help each other 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.280
 so bad and if you remember updated and 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.900
 so when you get the specialist 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.150
 of cousin 9 as I take it with 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.530
 silencer and rapid fire to me the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.920
 I really love it is a weapon that I see 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.200
 to go to sack russian 2 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.520
 stopping from the hip to the butt the truth 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.439
 I love how this weapon goes and also 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.220
 after the update I think that 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.380
 she's even a little girl now that she 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.759
 it kills very well up close even with 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.530
 specialist also kills well from afar 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.289
 but good to see how I put myself here 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.840
 cee area where I tell you 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.130
 they listen to the steps to stop and good to 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.140
 listen to the past ones I would have to 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.390
 silent but I will say it's a 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.430
 exaggeration with how he listens to the steps 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.280
 here right away I know where the enemy is 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.420
 and also with the stars you hear everything 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.039
 very well but as you know it had come out 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.590
 between yesterday yesterday new information came out 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.069
 of the ship all zombie ksa mode and the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.810
 uncle that with the fmf 9 I think it was I do not know 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.640
 if it was that weapon but hey it did not look and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.100
 basically the important thing to go to the mode 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.110
 zombie mode cinema the truth me 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.720
 it seems very good that there has been a ceim ha mode 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.400
 called zombies now me for example 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.400
 for the people we climb that involves 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.980
 then we can take the game out of the way 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.440
 cinema we can made it escape free 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.610
 that we can do many things and today 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.860
 a new gameplay has also come out 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.319
 you basically see an uncle in a bar and 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.329
 take and go to the bar and take it as a 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.749
 one is to take the drinks with a 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.060
 cart of these and this they already saw 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:53.010
 American but basically what is going to 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.069
 consist that in game mode 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.859
 transit is what it says in campaign mode and 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.780
 they call it in many ways that the 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.370
 that we go with the bus I think it goes 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.709
 to have many different accessories by 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.450
 We will be able to combine the map 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.129
 if you remember in the trailer in the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.980
 first they took out would be the shield 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.260
 riot gear with a lot of things the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.739
 true that I believe that is what goes 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:21.389
 to have a lot of accessories by 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.540
 all the map we are going to be able to go 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:27.359
 putting together flames then overcame as well as 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.790
 on a table they cross their fingers as 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.629
 does normally to improve in the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.709
 zombies and there's already the accessory and 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.959
 does it maybe not only can be done 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.540
 the shield can be made and what else 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.549
 things exist today they are going to make weapons 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.590
 different putting together the when we know 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.620
 study 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.450
 a theory would be pretty good I think 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.610
 that will be very good when here the 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.110
 fashion 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.629
 very handsome first when the game the 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.870
 zombies mode or muffled but good 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.110
 and on November 13 there is less left here 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.299
 you see the fashion was an exploits the motorcycle be 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.670
 I'm going to let it cool until until 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.290
 kill me from the streak of love it lowers 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.930
 What a sad agreement in those times 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.570
 when the agency took out master to the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.540
 people and the enemies stayed in the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.200
 departure was the host who killed you with 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:32.220
 a girl despite taking people out 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.139
 love cable but right away it's going to 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.520
 finish by the way tomorrow I want that 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.979
 raise the nuclear reactor in good that 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.510
 few people saw the video of episode 5 and 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.880
 what I want, I'll leave it at the end of 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.110
 video the annotation of the nuclear and what 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.460
 What I want is for you to tell me what you want 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.680
 that goes up 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.009
 a nuclear barrett a nuclear 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.630
 intervention and I always respect that 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.389
 decision is so nothing here kill me 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.520
 the gameplay is over to tell me what it is 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.139
 the nuclear that you want to raise the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.099
 vote it our favorites and we do not see in 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.099
 7 video goodbye 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.999
 the mind
