appreciate this adds 22 Juke move I'm
pretty<00:02:12.170> sure<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:12.800> full<00:02:13.069> card<00:02:15.489> let's<00:02:16.489> cool

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
pretty sure to this full card let's cool

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.900 
pretty sure to this full card let's cool
down<00:02:16.700> here<00:02:16.849> injury<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.930> an<00:02:18.590> 85<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.489> it's

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
down here injury is an 85 so that it's

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.140 
down here injury is an 85 so that it's
something<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.209> got<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.360> watch<00:02:20.599> for<00:02:22.150> because

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
something you got to watch for because

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.880 
something you got to watch for because
he's<00:02:23.690> prone<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.959> get<00:02:24.140> injured<00:02:24.410> if<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.620> run<00:02:24.770> it

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
he's prone to get injured if you run it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.870 
he's prone to get injured if you run it
with<00:02:25.010> them<00:02:25.130> too<00:02:25.250> much<00:02:25.400> he'll<00:02:25.700> definitely

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
with them too much he'll definitely

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.960 
with them too much he'll definitely
fumble<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.660> he'll<00:02:27.080> get<00:02:27.200> hurt<00:02:27.410> really<00:02:27.709> easy

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
fumble it and he'll get hurt really easy

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.020 
fumble it and he'll get hurt really easy
so<00:02:28.970> thor-<00:02:29.690> what's<00:02:30.200> big<00:02:30.739> here<00:02:31.099> throw<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
so thor- what's big here throw on the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.070 
so thor- what's big here throw on the
run<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.540> 96<00:02:33.400> short<00:02:34.400> passes<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:34.880> 93<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.930> he

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
run is in 96 short passes in 93 so he

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.930 
run is in 96 short passes in 93 so he
can<00:02:36.560> throw<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.040> run<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.760> we're<00:02:37.849> gonna

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
can throw and run so we're gonna

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.570 
can throw and run so we're gonna
compared<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.360> my<00:02:38.450> cam<00:02:38.690> newton<00:02:38.989> here

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
compared to my cam newton here

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.090 
compared to my cam newton here
speeds<00:02:40.390> ups<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.720> better<00:02:40.930> awareness<00:02:41.830> is

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
speeds ups you better awareness is

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.590 
speeds ups you better awareness is
obviously<00:02:42.400> better<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.700> throw<00:02:42.910> power<00:02:43.210> up<00:02:43.390> cam

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
obviously better to throw power up cam

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.020 
obviously better to throw power up cam
newton<00:02:43.960> is<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.110> little<00:02:44.410> better<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
newton is a little better but that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.400 
newton is a little better but that
really<00:02:46.150> doesn't<00:02:46.330> matter<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.900> griffin<00:02:47.200> card

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
really doesn't matter the griffin card

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.950 
really doesn't matter the griffin card
is<00:02:47.530> obviously<00:02:48.570> better<00:02:49.710> overall<00:02:51.420> Cam<00:02:52.420> Newton<00:02:52.810> I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
is obviously better overall Cam Newton I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.420 
is obviously better overall Cam Newton I
would<00:02:53.500> definitely<00:02:53.680> love<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.070> get<00:02:54.310> this
