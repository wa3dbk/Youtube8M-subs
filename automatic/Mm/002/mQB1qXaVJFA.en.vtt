00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.320
 a terrible thing happened 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:14.940
 the range airplane in the ims model hervÃ¡s in 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:18.439
 320 model air but a320 that fell in the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.580
 French alps with six crew members and 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.949
 146 passengers 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 expectations are very much because of this 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.310
 it seems that there are no survivors 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 The pilot of flight 495 25 sent 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.200
 emergency but there is actually a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.940
 small confusion because who sent signals 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.730
 was the control tower 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.190
 because he had lost contact with the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.950
 crew and the wreck plane have already been 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.350
 found and milan revell that seems 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.350
 that there are really no survivors in the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.110
 year reveals is a remote village in the south 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.309
 of france in the french alps 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.850
 we still do not know if there are survivors 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.730
 but everything leads one to believe that the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.829
 We regret our families but I can not 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.129
 stop criticizing the press 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.220
 international media and the national press 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.500
 sensational since morning 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.960
 whole so far 12 36 thousand days in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.580
 third cars do not stop talking 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.460
 call flight experts from 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.490
 control psychologists do not stop with this 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.150
 story is amazing and it's all 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.960
 channels we will see here in abc for example 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:37.530
 the guys did not to the maps where it was like 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.479
 It was a detail here of how it decayed. 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.159
 and ground or whether this is the great 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 difference between youtube and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.829
 fpf antenna cable 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.840
 you become enslaved in the news 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.380
 on slave television you do not have 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.170
 how to get out says where you are looking for is 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.979
 so talking about it but already on youtube 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.780
 Do you watch the news and then? 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.040
 you can to the other you do not stay 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.409
 enslaved then this is the great 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.869
 difference plus a tragedy is really 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.490
 a great tragedy the Europeans 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.460
 really care 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.550
 the question of maintaining an airplane is the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.350
 airplane is not it is not judged by time 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.490
 of his existence but last 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.620
 maintenance 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.080
 so it's an airplane that's always 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.840
 always very well maintained 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.940
 not yet known the reasons some 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.970
 claim that there has been a depressurising 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.450
 inside the plane the fall was a fall 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.460
 very fast then there's the news 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.330
 registered a tragedy 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.330
 the angles
