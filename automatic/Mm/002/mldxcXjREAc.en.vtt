00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:09.000
 made supreme although the blood sausage is 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.129
 twisted you always have to do all 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.019
 the slices cuts for vÃ©lez the 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.789
 slice where the thickness when we 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.680
 let's find the threads we have to follow 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.859
 always the cut although we see the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 difficulty in the appearance of the slice what 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.460
 that we will always try is that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.859
 cut be proportional according 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.449
 we put the slices separated so that 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.650
 do not stick to each other and gild 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.270
 perfectly and we put it in a way that 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.010
 195 degrees 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 approximately in a minute and a half two 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.840
 minutes we will have the slice here has 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.810
 what to do 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.270
 show how the cut looks like 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.320
 always be white when we see the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.980
 rice and when the rice is already fried 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.950
 It has a yellowish golden color 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.230
 your optimum frying point let's 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.170
 wait for an invite in memory 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.369
 I repeat very hot oil that makes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.430
 crusts at 190 to 95 degrees to prevent 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.650
 the sausage absorbs oils our 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.990
 product in the rice was stuffed in 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.330
 raw to be embedded in the raw what 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.130
 we are avoiding is to put water inside 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 of the gut therefore that contrast 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.200
 of temperature will prevent it from jumping and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.810
 break when we are asking for a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.149
 portion at so much temperature we will make a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.619
 outside writing bark and a 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.420
 internal juiciness 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 let's see how the product is 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.009
 scarce two minutes we have the product 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.810
 finished according to the temperature 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.190
 I repeat 180 to 190 95 degrees abundant 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.530
 oil and you can also do the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.810
 plates we will see as though 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.000
 we have made a cut in any of the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.940
 areas of blood sausage the cut be 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 beveled we will find as the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.720
 aspect that I have been the blood sausage 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.170
 from frying and everything was for everyone 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.170
 the sites
