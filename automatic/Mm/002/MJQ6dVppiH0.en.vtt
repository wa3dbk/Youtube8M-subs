Hi,
I'm Yaron Meishar, the owner and founder of

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.359
the website rokdim.co.il
Your arrival at this site is an indication

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.900
that dance and the folk dance culture are
in your soul and you must be searching the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.280
internet for videos of dances that you've
just learned and that you want to accurately

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.330
recall the steps.
This time, you've come to just the right place!

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.860
Wait with me until the end of the video and
I will explain everything to you.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.960
You probably already know how many videos
there are on YouTube and how hard it is to

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.720
choose and know which video is most accurate
and reliable. Who is actually demonstrating

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.980
and teaching you on YouTube? Is he/she presenting
the dance correctly and clearly?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.910
With us, this question is irrelevant.
The "Rokdim" website contains the largest

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.340
and most reliable online library. Our goal
is to provide the dance community and the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.719
dance instructors with the best dance videos.
Currently the "Rokdim" website contains thousands

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.910
of instructional dance videos, always the
correct original versions, taught and demonstrated

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.400
by either the dance choreographers or by teachers
who have been authorized by them to present

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.790
the dance.
Only the Rokdim website respects the copyrights

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.680
of the composers, singers, recording companies
and dance choreographers and pays royalties

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.310
for the rights to use the music and the dances.
Now, you can go online and freely watch the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.500
videos of your choice.
You can also join the "Rokdim - Nirkoda Club"

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.939
- Our club members receive discounts of up
to 50% when purchasing our products. You can

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.110
register to receive our free newsletter; you
will receive free information on dance sessions

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.400
and other events both in Israel and worldwide.
You can read articles about folk dance culture

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.119
and much more.
So, "take the right step", log-in now to the

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.530
"Rokdim" website and joined the tens of thousands
of people who are already enjoying the great

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.790
information located here.
I look forward to seeing you on the site and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.650
at various events.
Thank you for your attention.
