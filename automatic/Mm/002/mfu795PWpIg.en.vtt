00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
that the addition of the electric motor

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.820 
that the addition of the electric motor
didn't<00:02:34.910> didn't<00:02:35.910> bog<00:02:36.240> down<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.960> car<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.310 
didn't didn't bog down the car it
actually<00:02:38.270> improved<00:02:39.270> performance<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.200> it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
actually improved performance and it

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.590 
actually improved performance and it
actually<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.740> was<00:02:40.890> there<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.430> improve<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
actually it was there to improve the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.990 
actually it was there to improve the
performance<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.340> honest<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.640> can't

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
performance and to be honest you can't

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.470 
performance and to be honest you can't
really<00:02:45.180> tell<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.470> Forza<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.730> you

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
really tell in in Forza that the you

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
this car is its handling its handling is

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.229 
this car is its handling its handling is
very<00:03:18.330> planted<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.440> very<00:03:19.620> smooth<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.880> got

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
very planted and very smooth it's got

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.600 
very planted and very smooth it's got
it's<00:03:21.570> not<00:03:21.810> understeer<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.739> like<00:03:22.950> some<00:03:23.340> other

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.640 
it's not understeer you like some other
front-wheel<00:03:24.209> drive<00:03:24.239> cars<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.440> cool

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
front-wheel drive cars and the cool

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.650 
front-wheel drive cars and the cool
thing<00:03:25.680> about<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.310> since<00:03:26.550> it<00:03:26.850> has<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
thing about it is since it has the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.660 
thing about it is since it has the
little<00:03:28.260> bit<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.470> weight<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.980> back<00:03:29.250> because

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
little bit of weight in the back because

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.070 
little bit of weight in the back because
that's<00:03:30.000> where<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.390> batteries<00:03:30.840> are

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
that's where the batteries are

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.810 
that's where the batteries are
it's<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.980> got<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.310> weight<00:03:32.489> in<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.670> front

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
it's you got the weight in the front

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.640 
it's you got the weight in the front
from<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.090> engine<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.630> you've<00:03:34.140> also<00:03:34.320> got<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
from the engine and you've also got the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.350 
from the engine and you've also got the
weight<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.980> back<00:03:35.190> from<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.910> batteries

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
weight in the back from the batteries

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.330 
weight in the back from the batteries
what's<00:03:36.600> cool<00:03:36.900> about<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.310> gives

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
what's cool about that is that it gives

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.430 
what's cool about that is that it gives
it<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:38.970> nice<00:03:39.450> balance<00:03:40.050> which<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.260> can

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
it this nice balance which you can

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.690 
it this nice balance which you can
really<00:03:40.739> feel<00:03:41.100> in<00:03:42.050> it<00:03:43.130> when<00:03:44.130> you're<00:03:44.250> driving<00:03:44.610> it

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
really feel in it when you're driving it

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.390 
really feel in it when you're driving it
in<00:03:44.820> Forza<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.420> it<00:03:46.050> really<00:03:46.380> it<00:03:46.739> not<00:03:47.280> only

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
in Forza and it really it not only

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.430 
in Forza and it really it not only
allows<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.790> car<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.300> be<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.080> little<00:03:49.320> more

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
allows the car to be a little more

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.320 
allows the car to be a little more
maneuverable<00:03:50.070> but<00:03:50.220> as<00:03:50.610> you've<00:03:50.790> been<00:03:50.850> seeing

the fact that it that it's a hybrid sort
of<00:04:44.650> discounts<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.400> in<00:04:45.490> your<00:04:45.640> book<00:04:45.820> entirely

like hybrids at all but the thing about
the<00:04:53.830> thing<00:04:54.040> about<00:04:54.250> hybrids<00:04:54.670> is<00:04:54.790> that<00:04:54.970> they're

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
the thing about hybrids is that they're

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.700 
the thing about hybrids is that they're
normally<00:04:55.480> always<00:04:55.630> associated<00:04:56.260> with<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.680> know

eco and stuff like that which I'm not

eco and stuff like that which I'm not
interested<00:05:00.490> in<00:05:00.610> at<00:05:00.760> all<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:00.940> don't<00:05:01.240> really<00:05:01.390> care

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
interested in at all I don't really care

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.830 
interested in at all I don't really care
about<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:02.080> but<00:05:02.820> when<00:05:03.820> you<00:05:03.940> use<00:05:04.330> it<00:05:04.360> in<00:05:04.660> this

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
about it but when you use it in this

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.230 
about it but when you use it in this
sense<00:05:05.140> when<00:05:05.320> you<00:05:05.410> use<00:05:05.650> electricity<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.970> help

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
sense when you use electricity to help

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.180 
sense when you use electricity to help
increase<00:05:07.690> performance<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.470> help<00:05:08.740> make<00:05:08.980> the

increase performance and help make the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.680 
increase performance and help make the
car<00:05:09.460> faster<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.900> more<00:05:11.080> performance<00:05:11.890> oriented

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
car faster and more performance oriented

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.610 
car faster and more performance oriented
then<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.990> starts<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.380> get<00:05:14.560> interesting

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
then it starts to get interesting

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.150 
then it starts to get interesting
because<00:05:15.300> Ferrari<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.540> doing<00:05:16.870> it<00:05:16.990> now<00:05:17.160> McLaren

hyper car manufacturers are starting to

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.110 
hyper car manufacturers are starting to
get<00:05:25.510> into<00:05:25.810> this<00:05:25.960> this<00:05:26.650> trend<00:05:27.130> of<00:05:27.250> using<00:05:27.970> the

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
hybrid type powerplant in a more

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.810 
hybrid type powerplant in a more
performance<00:05:32.740> focused<00:05:33.250> way<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.580> I<00:05:33.640> think

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
performance focused way and I think

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.340 
performance focused way and I think
that's<00:05:33.940> very<00:05:34.000> interesting<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:35.050> if<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:35.230> guys

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350
