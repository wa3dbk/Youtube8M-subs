put<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> real<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.960> macro<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.070> mean<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
put a real like macro I mean to put a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.110 
put a real like macro I mean to put a
real<00:00:57.090> wide<00:00:57.420> angle<00:00:57.719> lens<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.760> such<00:00:59.760> as<00:00:59.969> my

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
real wide angle lens on such as my

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:12.560 
real wide angle lens on such as my
samsung<00:01:00.750> HMX<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> 10<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:03.359> bag<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.500> goodies

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
little magnetic ring that comes with it

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.380 
little magnetic ring that comes with it
and<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:25.840> put<00:01:25.869> it<00:01:26.200> right<00:01:26.350> on<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.619> lens<00:01:26.799> I

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.180 

so<00:02:01.900> right<00:02:02.110> now<00:02:02.140> here<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.620> have<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.010> wide

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
so right now here you have the wide

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:11.180 
so right now here you have the wide
angle<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:06.190> can<00:02:06.370> see<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:09.580> made<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:10.179> on

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
angle as you can see it made the on

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.820 
angle as you can see it made the on
video<00:02:12.190> camera<00:02:12.610> capture<00:02:13.150> more<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.840> area

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
video camera capture more of the area

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.199 
video camera capture more of the area
that<00:02:15.370> you're<00:02:15.430> recording<00:02:15.910> with<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:21.209> um

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
that you're recording with with that um

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.360 
that you're recording with with that um
the<00:02:23.200> macro<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.940> really<00:02:24.940> really<00:02:25.120> good<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.370> also

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
the macro is really really good and also

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.199 
the macro is really really good and also
the<00:02:27.959> lens<00:02:28.959> helps<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.470> focus<00:02:29.980> see<00:02:30.760> as<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.060> can

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
the lens helps it focus see as you can

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.650 
the lens helps it focus see as you can
see<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.720> lot<00:02:31.930> more<00:02:31.959> clear<00:02:33.570> compared<00:02:34.570> to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
see it's a lot more clear compared to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.340 
see it's a lot more clear compared to
this<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.950> with<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> built-in<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.450> macro<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
this so with the built-in on macro it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.860 
this so with the built-in on macro it
helps<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.739> focus<00:02:42.130> better<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.720> wide

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
helps it focus better with the wide

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.660 
helps it focus better with the wide
angle<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:46.380> yeah<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:51.040> let's<00:02:51.280> cut<00:02:51.519> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
angle so yeah and now let's cut the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.940 
angle so yeah and now let's cut the
macro<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.900> can<00:02:53.050> see<00:02:53.260> when<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.530> go<00:02:53.680> close

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
macro as you can see when you go close

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.150 
macro as you can see when you go close
you<00:02:54.160> can't<00:02:54.400> see<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.170> gets<00:02:56.470> worse<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:57.040> I

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
you can't see it and it gets worse if I

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.840 
you can't see it and it gets worse if I
take<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.519> off<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.440> now<00:03:00.130> what<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.670> is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
take it off so now what you do is

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.670 
take it off so now what you do is
unscrew<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:02.260> wider<00:03:02.530> angle<00:03:02.709> put<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:07.500> then<00:03:08.500> it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
unscrew the wider angle put it then it

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.240 
unscrew the wider angle put it then it
gets<00:03:08.769> blurry<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.840> then<00:03:13.739> look<00:03:14.739> how<00:03:14.890> clear<00:03:15.220> that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
gets blurry and then look how clear that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:25.300 
gets blurry and then look how clear that
is

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.760 

yes<00:03:26.310> very<00:03:26.910> clear<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:30.020> let's<00:03:31.020> see<00:03:31.320> if<00:03:31.440> we<00:03:31.560> could

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
yes very clear and let's see if we could

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.480 
yes very clear and let's see if we could
get<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.040> fabric<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.550> this<00:03:32.760> cloth<00:03:35.720> yep<00:03:37.490> see
