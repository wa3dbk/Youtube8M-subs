00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
lengthen lashes dramatically so the tube

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.179 
lengthen lashes dramatically so the tube
looks<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.680> dumb<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it's not like a regular mascara barrel I

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.179 
it's not like a regular mascara barrel I
think<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:30.360> makeup<00:01:30.689> designer<00:01:31.229> e<00:01:31.409> mud<00:01:31.710> has<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
think that makeup designer e mud has it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.340 
think that makeup designer e mud has it
so<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> wand<00:01:33.630> looks<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.200> it

so this is what the wand looks like it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.719 
so this is what the wand looks like it
looks<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> standard<00:01:34.979> wand<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:36.570> I

that's<00:03:43.709> what<00:03:43.859> it<00:03:43.980> feels<00:03:44.160> like<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.819> is

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
that's what it feels like and that is

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.970 
that's what it feels like and that is
not<00:03:45.510> comfortable<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:47.209> hey<00:03:48.209> sometimes<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
not comfortable so hey sometimes the the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.830 
not comfortable so hey sometimes the the
pros<00:03:50.220> outweigh<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.730> cons<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.329> sometimes<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
pros outweigh the cons and sometimes the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.069 
pros outweigh the cons and sometimes the
time<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.260> outweigh<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.709> pros<00:03:53.160> um<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:53.940> can't<00:03:54.810> say

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
time to outweigh the pros um I can't say

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.960 
time to outweigh the pros um I can't say
how<00:03:55.319> often<00:03:55.650> i'll<00:03:55.769> be<00:03:55.889> using<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.430> because<00:03:56.940> of

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
how often i'll be using this because of

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.629 
how often i'll be using this because of
that<00:03:57.680> precisely<00:03:58.680> because<00:03:58.859> i<00:03:59.280> don't<00:03:59.549> like

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
that precisely because i don't like

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.849 
that precisely because i don't like
getting<00:03:59.910> things<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.959> my<00:04:01.170> eye<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.560> I'm<00:04:01.680> not

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
getting things in my eye and I'm not

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.970 
getting things in my eye and I'm not
sure<00:04:01.889> that<00:04:02.370> anybody<00:04:02.579> else<00:04:03.090> does<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:03.980> didn't

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
sure that anybody else does I didn't

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.920 
sure that anybody else does I didn't
apply<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.310> any<00:04:05.579> differently<00:04:06.060> than<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.420> apply

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
apply it any differently than I apply

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.920 
apply it any differently than I apply
any<00:04:07.200> other<00:04:07.440> mascara<00:04:08.069> so<00:04:08.400> I'm<00:04:08.519> not<00:04:08.549> sure

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
any other mascara so I'm not sure

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.330 
any other mascara so I'm not sure
there's<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.989> different<00:04:10.500> way<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:11.010> need<00:04:11.190> to

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
there's a different way that you need to

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.870 
there's a different way that you need to
apply<00:04:11.639> this<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.019> does<00:04:13.230> not<00:04:13.380> happen

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
apply this so that that does not happen

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.420 
apply this so that that does not happen
so<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.180> other<00:04:15.329> con<00:04:15.690> is<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.049> went<00:04:16.440> out<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:17.039> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
so the other con is I went out to the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.830 
so the other con is I went out to the
office<00:04:17.549> either<00:04:17.940> takes<00:04:18.269> care<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.690> some

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
office either takes care of some

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.020 
office either takes care of some
paperwork<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:19.890> went<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.519> did<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.700> real

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
paperwork so I went and did that real

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.500 
paperwork so I went and did that real

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
do this review and I had all these

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.870 
do this review and I had all these
fibers<00:04:32.930> underneath<00:04:33.320> my<00:04:33.620> eyes<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:34.580> know<00:04:34.700> how

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
fibers underneath my eyes you know how

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.940 
fibers underneath my eyes you know how
it<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:35.120> when<00:04:35.360> your<00:04:35.630> mascaras<00:04:36.440> drying<00:04:36.710> out<00:04:36.920> and

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
it is when your mascaras drying out and

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.820 
it is when your mascaras drying out and
it<00:04:37.220> flakes<00:04:37.490> it<00:04:38.000> was<00:04:38.750> like<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.110> times<00:04:39.410> 10<00:04:39.680> but

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
it flakes it was like that times 10 but

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.100 
it flakes it was like that times 10 but
it<00:04:39.920> looks<00:04:40.070> like<00:04:40.190> a<00:04:40.220> bunch<00:04:40.490> of<00:04:40.610> eyelashes<00:04:41.390> on<00:04:41.630> my

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
it looks like a bunch of eyelashes on my

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.990 
it looks like a bunch of eyelashes on my
underneath<00:04:42.830> my<00:04:43.010> eyes<00:04:43.130> because<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.640> fibers

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
underneath my eyes because the fibers

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.960 
underneath my eyes because the fibers
actually<00:04:44.420> look<00:04:44.600> like<00:04:44.630> pieces<00:04:45.140> of<00:04:45.320> eyelash<00:04:45.970> um

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
actually look like pieces of eyelash um

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.270 
actually look like pieces of eyelash um
you<00:04:47.870> can<00:04:48.080> kind<00:04:48.350> of<00:04:48.440> feel<00:04:48.620> my<00:04:48.800> like<00:04:49.130> my

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
you can kind of feel my like my

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.500 
you can kind of feel my like my
eyelashes<00:04:49.790> kind<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.060> feel<00:04:50.210> like<00:04:50.240> they're

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
eyelashes kind of feel like they're

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.390 
eyelashes kind of feel like they're
sticking<00:04:50.900> together<00:04:51.050> in<00:04:51.440> certain<00:04:51.800> points<00:04:52.190> too

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
sticking together in certain points too

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.980 
sticking together in certain points too
because<00:04:52.760> I<00:04:52.880> guess<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.180> fibers<00:04:53.570> are<00:04:53.810> grabbing

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
because I guess the fibers are grabbing

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.680 
because I guess the fibers are grabbing
on<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.440> each<00:04:54.650> other<00:04:54.860> somehow<00:04:55.480> so<00:04:56.480> that's

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
on to each other somehow so that's

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.020 
on to each other somehow so that's
another<00:04:56.930> con<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.560> mean<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.400> little<00:04:58.610> fibers

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
another con I mean the little fibers

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.490 
another con I mean the little fibers
that<00:04:59.180> fell<00:04:59.390> down<00:04:59.570> here<00:04:59.810> I<00:04:59.840> just<00:04:59.900> brush<00:05:00.320> them

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
that fell down here I just brush them

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.500 
that fell down here I just brush them
away<00:05:00.710> with<00:05:00.890> my<00:05:01.070> kabuki<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:01.790> it<00:05:01.940> wasn't<00:05:02.300> that

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
away with my kabuki so it wasn't that

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.690 
away with my kabuki so it wasn't that
big<00:05:02.930> of<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.170> deal<00:05:03.380> but<00:05:03.950> say<00:05:04.160> you're<00:05:04.310> out<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.520> work

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
big of a deal but say you're out of work

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.330 
big of a deal but say you're out of work
or<00:05:05.030> something<00:05:05.390> or<00:05:05.510> out<00:05:05.660> dancing<00:05:06.470> away<00:05:06.590> will

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
or something or out dancing away will

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.260 
or something or out dancing away will
those<00:05:07.520> fibers<00:05:07.970> fall<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.600> can't<00:05:09.470> say<00:05:09.770> I<00:05:10.120> can<00:05:11.120> wear

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
those fibers fall I can't say I can wear

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.580 
those fibers fall I can't say I can wear
this<00:05:11.480> when<00:05:11.660> I<00:05:11.690> go<00:05:11.840> out<00:05:11.900> one<00:05:12.170> night<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.350> then

that it gives my eyes but then I'd rate

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.450 
that it gives my eyes but then I'd rate
it<00:05:31.550> like<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.330> one<00:05:32.810> for<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:34.040> way<00:05:34.160> that<00:05:34.370> it

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
it like a one for the way that it

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.630 
it like a one for the way that it
performs<00:05:35.000> thus<00:05:35.690> far<00:05:35.960> now<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.890> also<00:05:37.190> want<00:05:37.580> to

haven't told you yet um I actually put
on<00:05:44.300> four<00:05:44.690> coats<00:05:45.140> of<00:05:45.380> this<00:05:46.360> earlier<00:05:47.360> and<00:05:47.660> then<00:05:48.290> I

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
on four coats of this earlier and then I

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.760 
on four coats of this earlier and then I
put<00:05:49.040> another<00:05:49.520> two<00:05:50.090> on<00:05:50.120> while<00:05:50.780> sitting<00:05:51.050> here<00:05:51.620> I

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
put another two on while sitting here I

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.250 
put another two on while sitting here I
did<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.820> already<00:05:53.000> did<00:05:53.150> this<00:05:53.420> video<00:05:53.720> and<00:05:54.050> then<00:05:54.110> I

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
did I already did this video and then I

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.990 
did I already did this video and then I
really<00:05:54.680> wasn't<00:05:54.860> happy<00:05:55.700> with<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:55.880> way<00:05:55.970> it

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
really wasn't happy with the way it

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.870 
really wasn't happy with the way it
turned<00:05:56.090> out<00:05:56.420> because<00:05:56.990> I<00:05:57.560> put<00:05:58.070> on<00:05:58.310> some<00:05:58.610> more

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
turned out because I put on some more

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.790 
turned out because I put on some more
and<00:05:59.180> my<00:05:59.540> last<00:05:59.720> she's<00:05:59.930> got<00:06:00.080> like<00:06:00.230> ten<00:06:00.620> times

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
and my last she's got like ten times

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.370 
and my last she's got like ten times
bigger<00:06:01.100> so<00:06:02.060> what<00:06:02.270> I<00:06:02.300> think<00:06:02.690> you<00:06:02.840> need<00:06:03.020> to<00:06:03.050> do

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
bigger so what I think you need to do

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.220 
bigger so what I think you need to do
with<00:06:03.560> this<00:06:03.680> mascara<00:06:04.190> is<00:06:04.810> completely<00:06:05.810> let<00:06:06.080> the

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
with this mascara is completely let the

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.160 
with this mascara is completely let the
lashes<00:06:06.650> dry<00:06:06.920> in<00:06:07.160> between<00:06:07.190> coats<00:06:07.900> so<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:09.080> it

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
lashes dry in between coats so that it

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.100 
lashes dry in between coats so that it
grabs<00:06:09.500> on<00:06:09.920> and<00:06:10.460> makes<00:06:10.700> them<00:06:10.910> bigger<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.480> think

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
grabs on and makes them bigger I think

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.750 
grabs on and makes them bigger I think
when<00:06:12.260> it's<00:06:12.410> wet<00:06:12.650> it<00:06:12.860> just<00:06:13.070> doesn't<00:06:13.250> do<00:06:13.550> much<00:06:13.700> of

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
when it's wet it just doesn't do much of

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.200 
when it's wet it just doesn't do much of
anything<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:14.810> i<00:06:15.080> have<00:06:15.260> a<00:06:15.290> total<00:06:15.650> of<00:06:16.070> almost<00:06:16.730> six

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
anything so i have a total of almost six

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.150 
anything so i have a total of almost six
coats<00:06:17.480> of<00:06:17.720> this<00:06:17.870> mascara<00:06:18.290> on<00:06:18.440> so<00:06:18.770> it<00:06:18.890> does<00:06:19.130> take

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
coats of this mascara on so it does take

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.750 
coats of this mascara on so it does take
quite<00:06:19.700> a<00:06:19.820> bit<00:06:20.030> of<00:06:20.090> mascara<00:06:20.600> to<00:06:20.900> get<00:06:21.140> this<00:06:22.070> this

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
quite a bit of mascara to get this this

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.750 
quite a bit of mascara to get this this
look<00:06:23.060> of<00:06:23.210> the<00:06:23.330> lash<00:06:23.510> softly<00:06:24.200> all<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.530> time

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
look of the lash softly all the time

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.170 
look of the lash softly all the time
so<00:06:26.760> they're<00:06:27.150> big<00:06:27.540> and<00:06:28.730> I<00:06:29.730> think<00:06:30.030> it's

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
so they're big and I think it's

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.330 
so they're big and I think it's
beautiful<00:06:30.540> and<00:06:31.020> i<00:06:31.110> love<00:06:31.140> it<00:06:31.530> i<00:06:31.740> haven't<00:06:32.010> on<00:06:32.100> top

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
beautiful and i love it i haven't on top

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.100 
beautiful and i love it i haven't on top
and<00:06:32.580> bottom<00:06:33.060> lash<00:06:33.680> and<00:06:34.940> I<00:06:35.940> mean<00:06:36.180> this<00:06:36.720> is<00:06:36.930> the

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
and bottom lash and I mean this is the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.800 
and bottom lash and I mean this is the
biggest<00:06:37.800> that<00:06:38.430> I've<00:06:38.580> had<00:06:38.850> them<00:06:39.090> and<00:06:39.300> they're

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
biggest that I've had them and they're

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.990 
biggest that I've had them and they're
not<00:06:40.020> crunchy<00:06:40.680> feeling<00:06:41.100> like<00:06:41.310> they<00:06:41.460> don't<00:06:41.730> feel

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
not crunchy feeling like they don't feel

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.140 
not crunchy feeling like they don't feel
crunchy<00:06:42.540> they<00:06:42.690> feel<00:06:42.960> nice<00:06:43.350> and<00:06:43.740> pretty<00:06:44.250> like

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
crunchy they feel nice and pretty like

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.970 
crunchy they feel nice and pretty like
like<00:06:45.510> my<00:06:45.660> lashes<00:06:45.930> would<00:06:46.260> normally<00:06:46.590> feel<00:06:46.800> it

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
like my lashes would normally feel it

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.610 
like my lashes would normally feel it
really<00:06:47.190> gives<00:06:47.310> you<00:06:47.460> like<00:06:47.640> a<00:06:47.670> false<00:06:48.060> false<00:06:48.840> lash

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
really gives you like a false false lash

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.890 
look this may not be something I use all
the<00:07:05.460> time<00:07:05.580> it<00:07:06.000> may<00:07:06.120> be<00:07:06.180> something<00:07:06.510> I<00:07:06.690> use

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
the time it may be something I use

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.580

sometimes<00:07:07.590> I<00:07:08.220> do<00:07:08.580> like<00:07:09.120> the<00:07:09.480> look<00:07:10.170> I<00:07:10.440> don't

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
sometimes I do like the look I don't

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.100 
sometimes I do like the look I don't
like<00:07:11.100> what<00:07:11.310> happens<00:07:11.670> with<00:07:11.820> the<00:07:11.910> fibers<00:07:12.120> so<00:07:12.780> I'm

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 
like what happens with the fibers so I'm

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.140 
like what happens with the fibers so I'm
thinking<00:07:13.770> maybe<00:07:13.920> after<00:07:14.370> it<00:07:14.490> sits<00:07:14.820> a<00:07:15.000> little

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
thinking maybe after it sits a little

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.960 
thinking maybe after it sits a little
bit<00:07:15.450> maybe<00:07:15.750> it<00:07:15.990> won't<00:07:16.140> do<00:07:16.410> that<00:07:16.440> anymore<00:07:16.970> I'm

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
bit maybe it won't do that anymore I'm

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.880 
bit maybe it won't do that anymore I'm
not<00:07:18.180> sure<00:07:18.240> though<00:07:18.660> I<00:07:18.870> can<00:07:19.080> update<00:07:19.260> that<00:07:19.710> as
