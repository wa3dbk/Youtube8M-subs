 Start him and want to grant didier 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.760
 the multiplayer is your start for 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.100
 Zombies arrived in multiplayer searches 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.630
 then you have a server from it 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.820
 you remember best names are still there 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.500
 not so many servers and then says 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.930
 those who want to play with you too 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.730
 the server name and then you all have to 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.920
 Join this server I do that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.170

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.439

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.979
 Wish are now on a server advantage 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.319
 of course if you have teach server 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.600
 it is better so small cuts 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.819
 the laptop is done with loading now 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.840
 we are still on a server and 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.600
 then we can do it again 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.369
 go out and just any game 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.959

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.209
 bug gets that one no connection 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.670

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.999
