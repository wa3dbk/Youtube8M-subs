00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello youtube on the internet and wants to come 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.810
 to a mod presentation and two 's 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:14.040
 here around this semitrailer this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:15.929
 American that is a thin one 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.029
 semi-trailer , it takes the whole so 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.180
 we can use it to the manure to the field 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.880
 transport 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 yes quite a bit of chrome here 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 already violently reflects the whole is then 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.700
 but a bit pixelated I think 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.020
 what is that supposed to be that too 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.430
 to be dane 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.899
 which claim nothing wrong 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:48.739
 In any case, he likes me very much 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 here are the bases just outside 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 are quasi then the wheel arches 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:05.400
 again for the tractor of the text 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.060
 Tournee is fine in any case beautiful 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060
 pictures installed 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.770
 you look at the light 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.780
 you look at the same day again 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.020
 nice stickers yes as I have seen 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.060
 also the axis that directs any with and 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.240
 I do not have that function for yet 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.520
 found the thing 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.270
 not always that winter was over 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.450
 works if the thing is fully loaded so 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.450
 we have something for the good 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.750
 the problems with handbrake 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 there you are okay 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.320
 couple it 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.840
 yes you can already see here in front of 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.840
 dropouts remains yes 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.120
 I can shine so small 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.630
 and then you are nothing now 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.630
 not so tragic 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.130
 ok and above is another one 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.130
 light up the whole time 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.280
 to have a bit darker now time 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.280
 the flashes are antist 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 what is difficult is the camera itself 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:02.740
 at the length of sun 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:05.370
 I'm going to pour that out again 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.370
 blinker 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:17.719
 or I'll get it again angle like that 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.719
 good as blinkers run refeet throwers 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:32.790
 and brake light and turn signal brake light 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.790
 even now not yet 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.129
 ok then 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.400
 and we make a little one 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.450
 test drive 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.780
 I hope I can get off the road 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.780
 it 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.260
 without already has proud length it is one 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.260
 a bit unhappy 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.280
 I think I can overlook it 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.280
 about the comfort 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.490
 so 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.860
 Although I wanted to try then again 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.860
 if that works well with the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.240
 So overfill a steering axle that went 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.190
 not because I 'm back then too 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.190
 this warning still 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.569
 no idea if the German at all 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.569
 would get approval 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.460
 the times interesting to know but if 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.270
 you know one of you from 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.040
 the post 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.060
 on such a thick Germany 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.660
 be allowed 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.660
 then moving edge 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:32.080
 and let's see if we are with ours 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:40.230
 Loaded cool cars get pretty 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.230
 experienced hoses from both sides 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:06:00.490
 but I would say so now 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:06:03.580
 we'll just test the question with you 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.180
 the semitrailer or for my purposes he 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.180
 but 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:15.439
 of course more comfortable in any case 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.539
 so 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.650
 ok that looks good 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.879
 is working 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.929
 he can hose or tint it 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:41.719
 somehow still on it but that must be yes 

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:43.159
 not always be and i already imposing 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.349
 So the size really great and if 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:49.189
 especially the American maps 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.629
 I 'm sure you play a lot there 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:55.240
 fun is whether I thank you for watching 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:55.240
 and see you next time
