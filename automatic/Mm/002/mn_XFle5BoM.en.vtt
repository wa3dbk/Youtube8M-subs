 Good evening I was making the tree 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.670
 the other day yesterday practically when 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.190
 never rang the bell has arrived 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:24.980
 courier of the upi s who brought me 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:24.980
 this envelope containing this box 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:34.219

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:53.789
 containing containing a won ipad mini 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.539
 the mad price auction a month ago 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.539
 about 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:08.340
 here it is this the content on 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.909
 content of the shoe we go to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.909
 to open 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.259
 Here we are once we create the box and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:29.250
 let's see I know there is behind that you don't 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:34.799

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.340
 here this is the life part of the auction 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.340
 crazy prices 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.740
 don't ask me why I don't know 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.020
 made automatic bets that 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.950
 they happened at the right time because 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.170
 when I returned I saw that the star 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.259
 a ended and that I was the last to have 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.930
 pointed and then I won it 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.500
 with forty euros 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.750
 he and some races seem to me an object 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:22.730
 worth 320 and passes the euro 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:24.110
 let's turn it on to confirm the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 functionality 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:33.050

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.790
 lemon creation

 yes yes he is just a mini ipad that 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.540
 perhaps even more comfortable than the part 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.820
 the big one because this is held 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.989

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:15.410
 little and leave out of the picture and yes 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.310
