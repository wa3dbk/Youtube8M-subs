00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
reason why this garden would have to be

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.700 
reason why this garden would have to be
walking<00:01:57.280> up<00:01:57.549> stairs<00:01:57.789> if<00:01:58.149> he<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.020> docked<00:01:59.469> on

walking up stairs if he just docked on

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.649 
walking up stairs if he just docked on
the<00:01:59.920> top<00:02:00.159> portion<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:00.820> maybe<00:02:00.999> he<00:02:01.149> talks<00:02:01.390> on<00:02:01.570> the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
the top portion so maybe he talks on the

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.539 
the top portion so maybe he talks on the
bottom<00:02:01.929> gets<00:02:02.140> off<00:02:02.289> his<00:02:02.439> ship<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.829> walks

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
bottom gets off his ship and walks

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.310 
bottom gets off his ship and walks

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
Queen we have the new look we have the

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.150 
Queen we have the new look we have the
emblem<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:25.660> are<00:03:25.810> very<00:03:26.349> discussed<00:03:26.829> in<00:03:27.040> the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
emblem that we are very discussed in the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.500 
emblem that we are very discussed in the
factions<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.730> new<00:03:27.849> factions<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.299> we<00:03:28.449> were

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
factions the new factions that we were

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.180 
factions the new factions that we were
going<00:03:28.599> to<00:03:28.660> be<00:03:28.780> talking<00:03:28.930> about<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.410> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
going to be talking about and the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.220 
going to be talking about and the
background<00:03:30.669> shows<00:03:30.879> us<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.060> little<00:03:31.510> display<00:03:31.930> of

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
background shows us a little display of

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.460 
background shows us a little display of
a<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.940> know<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.060> display<00:03:34.569> I've<00:03:34.780> seen<00:03:35.079> on<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
a you know I display I've seen on the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.009 
a you know I display I've seen on the
catch<00:03:35.739> which<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> part<00:03:36.669> of<00:03:36.849> portion<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.510> the

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
catch which is a part of portion of the

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.409 
catch which is a part of portion of the
destiny<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.919> you<00:03:39.459> were<00:03:39.549> able<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:40.000> glitch<00:03:40.239> in

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
destiny that you were able to glitch in

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.300 
destiny that you were able to glitch in
through<00:03:40.629> the<00:03:40.780> moon<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.530> that's<00:03:41.829> very<00:03:41.919> very

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
through the moon so that's very very

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.680 
through the moon so that's very very
interesting<00:03:42.849> because<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.209> screens<00:03:43.510> look

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
interesting because the screens look

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.659 
interesting because the screens look
exactly<00:03:44.470> like<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.739> ones<00:03:44.949> found<00:03:45.040> in<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.489> catch

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
exactly like the ones found in the catch

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.280 
exactly like the ones found in the catch
so<00:03:46.389> it<00:03:46.480> tells<00:03:46.660> us<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.840> we're<00:03:46.959> going<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.169> be

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
so it tells us that we're going to be

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.599 
so it tells us that we're going to be
seeing<00:03:47.440> new<00:03:47.620> characters<00:03:48.010> as<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.220> see<00:03:48.370> here

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609
