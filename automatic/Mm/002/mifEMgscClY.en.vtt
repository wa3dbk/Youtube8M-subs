00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello people i do a check today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.000
 tournament with eight base tab is once 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.809
 nas-server a pretty good attack 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 spey then we have a city carrier 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.640
 endurance type and I start the best 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.640
 Immediately to fight with it 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.910
 have fun watching 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.750
 this fight could be dropped altogether 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.670
 It will be a bit exciting ever 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:58.670
 after how hard that beats itself 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.670
 it could be exciting 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:11.210
 the winner of the first match is lasotta 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.210
 then we'll do that in the next match 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.710
 This time it looks pretty balanced 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.790
 can just be bad if 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:43.990
 once brought out of balance 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.310
 but this time it has that's it for him 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.200
 managed to keep his position 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.570
 as soon as we see what's going on 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.240
 But I think this fight is 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.530
 is over and you and the last one 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.530
 fight will decide 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:11.170
 Well, I think the fight over this time 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.350
 lasseter has now has in this 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.920

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.920

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.930
