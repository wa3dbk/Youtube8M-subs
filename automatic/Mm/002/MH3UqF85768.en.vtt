wreak thanks to conventions of how you
play<00:02:08.429> zelda<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.780> don't<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> complete

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
play zelda so you don't have to complete

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.870 
play zelda so you don't have to complete
dungeons<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:12.300> certain<00:02:12.570> order<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.110> also<00:02:13.880> you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
dungeons in a certain order and also you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.520

don't<00:02:15.060> play<00:02:15.360> by<00:02:15.480> yourself<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.170> makes<00:02:16.320> me

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
don't play by yourself so it makes me

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.070 
don't play by yourself so it makes me
think<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.830> it's<00:02:17.520> going<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.790> be
