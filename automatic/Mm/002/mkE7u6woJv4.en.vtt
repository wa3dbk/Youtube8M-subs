00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 To value a hand Sim pt continues with the United States as well in both stroke 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.730
 I need it. 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.410
 Within the Strobing practice, the most basic practice methods for such a blessing 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.619
 I will introduce you. 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.420
 You also probably know a lot inde story basically means you gotta two won 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 Cantal cheese is going to nyangnyang about 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:31.109
 Do you have any pills ? 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:36.960
 If it's fast, it's going to be very fast. 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.530
 So what is important here is to make sure the river is literally given the ltd 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 That's it. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.920
 The remaining approximately approximately approximately less literally 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.320
 Gollum should be small . 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:54.780
 4 If you try to make the motion itself too small , 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.340
 You can hit it with a slight bb feel 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.660
 Not exactly 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:06.290
 You have to use your wrists and fingers to control it. 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.290
 So the river is about medicine 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:19.610
 These days are not sure now about the middle of the river dynamics occurred about mid-drug controls 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:26.380
 But certainly it looks to do.You and constant practice to come to the University College of Pharmacy 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.380
 Point, but after my left hand here, I now have these grooves. 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:44.520
 Keep your hand tight and hold the grip tightly so you can control the stick 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.340
 The scene gets very fast 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.910
 And the motion itself is very hard and naturally makes the sound harder . 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:59.520
 So if you want to do this smoothly, 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:02.250
 Hasineunge the mayor work on the left and right stroke is the most important practice 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.740
 I am not good at tee compared to sheep. 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:12.770
 That's why we practice every little bit often every day. 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.240
 This is the best practice method , 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.470
 right hand 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.470
 And left hand 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:31.550
 If you try to balance this way and practice, you will have a great training 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.550
 Better still gonna sound kind of course in accordance with its own
