00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 I have eggplant seeds I liked it 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
 that's it in the small terrines and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.589
 after that it becomes an eggplant no y'a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.150
 other actions nothing 3.2 three 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.550
 actions meanwhile before tasting 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.719
 eggplant first eggplant is 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.969
 a vegetable of the sun 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.870
 yes so who fears the cold it wants 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.279
 to say I will not be able to put it to the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.869
 vegetable garden directly you will use 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.590
 these seeds you're going to leave but at 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.619
 interior 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 at home using the potting soil for 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.519
 started using the protections 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.880
 that we have here you are going to have the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.260
 pleasure to see there the sprouted seed 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 started pushing your eggplant that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.250
 will grow and in fashion but there you 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 will be able to install it in the ground 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.570
 You told me you wanted to sow 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.800
 eggplant and tomatoes wise place 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.660
 in what does not it fit very well 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.030
 like that we'll put it in a little 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 terrine here provided for this purpose is this 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.789
 that it is necessary to pack the earth right away 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.079
 not immediately we the round cup 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.710
 after a time the seed will be in 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.030
 square 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.620
 we're going to make some eggplants and a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.289
 few tomatoes phase go it works 1 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.539
 where is it to be placed in the 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.579
 house in front of the window so that there 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.829
 have as much light as possible and at a 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.110
 temperature of about 20 degrees then 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.339
 some small greenhouses are equipped 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.010
 a lid 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.790
 we start with the eggplant yes then 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.310
 we will go slowly 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.600
 what you can what you can 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.810
 do it too it's just a little hole 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.580
 like this ok I'm doing the following and so 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.159
 unlike a bulb the dance and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.200
 these seeds there it is no 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.090
 forth no to put the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.439
 throw back the eggplants that are 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.670
 earlier and that i do what i can the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.619
 put in the pot like that it bothers 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.689
 not very well we know that the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.149
 first row these are the aubergines I 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.450
 keep my package and the tomatoes the 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.009
 tomatoes've given my clothes 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.810
 I'm doing the same thing as 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.549
 aubergines the two or three maxi 1 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
 and you know what I miss alas and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 peppers and peppers what 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.420
 to be watered as when 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.250
 plant 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.049
 yes then at most of the most delicately 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.659
 water at room temperature 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.189
 we are going to install this little this 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.289
 little terrine inside it makes 20 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.819
 degrees the water must be at 20 degrees and 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.459
 I do it like that, we'll see the 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.799
 potting color change that's fine 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.079
 wii then we'll go back because it's 20 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.310
 degrees in the house I'm going to install 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.869
 his terrines I will learn it had to 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.239
 take him to the window 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.530
 and then we water we will do the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.730
 turn every day to see if the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.579
 terroir changes a little color and there 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.739
 we re humidify rats and if everything happens 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.170
 good game but eggplant crops 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.389
