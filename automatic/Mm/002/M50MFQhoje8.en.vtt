00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
really wear cologne or anything so I

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.560 
really wear cologne or anything so I
smell<00:03:51.980> pretty<00:03:52.190> neutral<00:03:52.610> like<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:54.050> think<00:03:55.570> not

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
smell pretty neutral like so I think not

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:04.350

bad

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.490 

you

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.260 

sometimes<00:04:07.370> hear<00:04:07.550> that<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.730> know<00:04:07.790> foreigners

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
sometimes hear that you know foreigners

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.260 
sometimes hear that you know foreigners
are<00:04:08.480> really<00:04:08.690> big<00:04:09.020> like<00:04:09.440> American<00:04:10.190> sizing<00:04:10.970> so

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
are really big like American sizing so

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.000 
are really big like American sizing so
Japanese<00:04:11.690> people<00:04:11.990> can't<00:04:12.200> fit<00:04:12.410> into<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.770> seats

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
Japanese people can't fit into the seats

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.590 
Japanese people can't fit into the seats
but<00:04:13.400> also<00:04:13.610> that<00:04:13.910> doesn't<00:04:14.180> make<00:04:14.240> sense<00:04:14.300> because

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
but also that doesn't make sense because

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.090 
but also that doesn't make sense because
there's<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.930> lot<00:04:15.080> of<00:04:15.110> foreigners<00:04:15.530> who<00:04:15.740> are<00:04:15.860> tall
