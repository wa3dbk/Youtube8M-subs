00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.170
 hello it's rock giguère gardeners 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.240
 enthusiasts 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.480
 so today we will talk about 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.070
 orchids so often when we see in 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.769
 orchids we think it's a plant 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.369
 difficult to cultivate 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.830
 Outside 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.360
 but no then the next time 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.880
 you will see a beautiful orchid like 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.190
 we see here then we see the flower and 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.430
 as task is a bit in the middle there 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.620
 in others here keep a nice stern 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.359
 move we see the two colors so we 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.999
 sees a very large variety of flowers 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.319
 and especially a long period of 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.999
 flowering 

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:41.929
 there are about twenty-five thousand 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.300
 Orchid species 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.339
 it is certain that we must choose it 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.710
 for example if we want our culture 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.109
 be easy so here we have the fans and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.170
 9.6 these are the most orchids 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.359
 easy to cultivate and these are these 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.699
 that will bloom again easily 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.260
 because that's maybe what's the 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.510
 more difficult is not to buy a 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.220
 Orchid in bloom and steel to keep 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.860
 it was well worth it 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.500
 then what exactly 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.380
 bloom again if you want to taste these 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.520
 works of art them for a long time 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.960
 so today we will talk a little bit about 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.880
 this culture there we lie to you in you 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.040
 showing what we need for the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.510
 cultivate then here we will not go 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.420
 start with my pots or so these are 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.720
 special pots the orchids we know 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.010
 that must not be rotten roots 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.390
 that is to say that it is always in 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.330
 the water so often we will see deposits 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.030
 who are going to have outlets here holes 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.920
 drainage on the side and of course 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.720
 below we go there are all 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.700
 kinds if I have some decorative then 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.370
 you see here we see that moisture 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 able to escape 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.150
 the surplus of militating for not that 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.080
 rotten roots here is a host too 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.090
 you do not want the pot to be too fat 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.770
 sometimes we tend to want a very 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.800
 great pau if pot and muslims 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.290
 big then ours that must be 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.570
 develop to foliage and we will not have 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.000
 of flowers the second important point 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.560
 it is the substrate plantations then here 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.520
 we do not have a potting soil with two pairs 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.000
 to be ordinary 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.709
 we're going to have a potting soil or a substrate at 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.469
 kivu is composed mainly of 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.420
 organic materials like that all 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.890
 kinds of coconut bark of Contents 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.800
 pine bark 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.900
 and it's hero I encourage you to 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.240
 take a substrate that is already 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.790
 prepared in a garden center but you can 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.590
 do yours 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.500
 then we'll talk about watering then 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.220
 of course their screams of one should 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.950
 avoid dew on the leaves and 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.680
 on the floor we can spray the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.360
 leaves quietly in the morning to 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.820
 precisely that it evaporates in the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.750
 day and you can also spray 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.100
 rooted aside here to change the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.420
 roots finally happened it's the 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.480
 roots that need moisture 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.300
 so we can also put countries in 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.519
 below with a good scoop puts 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.100
 the water for pau who touches the pot and there 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.959
 it's going to keep the moisture under the pot that 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.230
 will be necessary for good culture 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.660
 of their ideas then worth talking about the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.730
 size of the flower stalk 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.250
 it's really an important step 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.120
 so we see here we see a bud 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.610
 floral here who is a dorman 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.140
 here we see a bud if the flower 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.480
 faded who fell then must 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.920
 start at the first flower bud in 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.220
 dormancy then there are some who will cut 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.590
 that here to a feeling for against 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.030
 recommend cutting lower because 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.280
 that they have dried up too much to know 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.430
 force the plant unnecessarily then my 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.920
 drawing and there are two buds 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.890
 flower then I have one here I have one 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.470
 here then I'm going to a centimeter 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.230
 of this second flower bud the water 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.970
 so that's going to issue a floral notice 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.390
 who will bloom give back at least one 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.489
 twenty or so flowers and then when 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.420
 this one you're a fan and I'm going to size 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.739
 and the stem at its base cass 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.570
 these little games the year put more than 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.820
 news if I do not like being over 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.790
 new floral beaujon and there is a 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.280
 other little game that should have been put 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.360
 by the place against for the 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.060
 missions of this cij 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.049
 it must cause stress in the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.950
 plant then what should I do 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.180
 I see the cold clear at night and at 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.860
 the heat the day it takes a 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.560
 difference of about five degrees 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.849
 centigrade to allow a raid 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.669
 then praying that I will stop 1 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.099
 little waterings I will lengthen them 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.249
 the period for her to offer herself a little 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:42.129
 little in your shopping let it dry 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:46.770
 authorship and finally I'm going a little 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:49.419
 also stop fertilizing for 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.360
 stress the board for precisely what 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.589
 is his floral stem and after that you 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.279
 go see her you'll see a little 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:55.659
 birth 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.659
 when we see the stem birth 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.089
 resumes normal sprinklers is taken 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:03.669
 fertilization fertilization a 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:08.679
 small slabs or a fertilizer 10 15 10 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:11.349
 then once a month or fertilizers 

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:11.979
 liquid that you will put at each 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.959
 spray 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.519
 so you see it's a culture that 

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:17.289
 is still easy that looks like 

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:19.300
 many other shots but on the other hand 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.249
 to go enjoy a flowering that last 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.139
 at least three or four 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:26.159
 so it's a rock giguère that you 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.159
 wish good gardening
