00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.379
 there is a pebble here too 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.830
 It not is not written on the board bakery 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.550
 plaque bakery hardware yes 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.090
 dust cloud 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.830
 it is not because we lost that bakery is the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.630
 surname of my family understood my 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.880
 father was called antonio bakery and when 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.920
 He was about to die last bed. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.599
 I wanted him to use the name of the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.900
 family here in the name of my shop 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:44.030
 Hardware to do what my father is not 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:46.190
 I just took my father, it's good to win anything here. 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.489
 It's not a shit you ran out of bread yourself 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.489
 ended 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.519
 here is the Arabic bread as it is because it is the 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.640
 that gave to me does not have can not 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.320
 absorb a bakery reaped year is one 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.729
 That's why I do not agree with you. 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.590
 if this were a bakery what would 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.479
 obviously not written there flávio 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.430
 now it's written bakery hardware with 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.109
 Hardware word written in upper case 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.880
 in a bold red font in bold 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.500
 italic underlined with the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.509
 Screw part designed in a plate 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.310
 low we are not a bakery but 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.079
 Why then do you lay the egg that my 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.820
 father died and when I was in bed 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.039
 of death and asked us to put the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.890
 name of the family in this store bensaud 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.020
 only that is one 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.450
 that is not paying here to eat is not 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.460
 a trena is not churros not only that is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.020
 the level that that wheat screw does not 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.310
 only wants to sell a painting in the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.439
 wall on the right place 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.380
 now just want to eat breakfast place 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:50.109
 wrong and lack of education I will not be back 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:53.630
 but the class has a sigh 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.179
 no, I'm not here just a hardware store 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.630
 hardware 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.729
 here do not pay and do not listen here 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.770
 country is misleading advertisement paying 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.630
 misleading because my sky god you 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.130
 announces this here as a hardware store 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.250
 as bakery not that 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.200
 it's not a bakery has five plates over there 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.459
 with different variations of this 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.020
 same sentence that it seems that people 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.120
 do not understand that this store here in the green 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.400
 bread with pliers so why not take 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.140
 bakery of the name because it had a body 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.360
 my family tree that solved 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.459
 use bakery as surname to understand the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.959
 cancer did not kill my father's sentinel before 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.709
 that he asked me to put this shit 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.959
 of this name 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.700
 in my store this store that I open with 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.019
 my savings without using a little 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.069
 from that old whore's viaduct 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.709
 so this is not a blue band here 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.629
 Jesus for the death of Zapata said that the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.250
 massacre in the baguette does not break 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.989
 serve that brief age because it is 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.030
 foresight is capable of making a dog 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.040
 hot to know how to play here one 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.900

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.269
 shit here look there look he's a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.500
 concerned citizen on the spot entered the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.840
 hardware store is buying a 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.389

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.840

 start that aluminum ladder there myself 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.700
 I'm going to stick it, I'm going to open it and give it a tent. 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:18.970
 Flemish camping in Chinese you come from 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.970
 a pair of pliers 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.750
 what the entity will eat the advent that 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.690

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.220
