00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you can install this and once you run it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you can actually overclocked to 1.9

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
you can actually overclocked to 1.9
gigahertz<00:01:11.400> now<00:01:12.180> before<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.810> set<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.320> boot

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
gigahertz now before you set it on boot

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.149 
gigahertz now before you set it on boot
that<00:01:14.040> means<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.430> gonna<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:16.130> set<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that means it's gonna actually set to

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.130 
that means it's gonna actually set to
one<00:01:17.700> point<00:01:17.850> ninety<00:01:18.270> years<00:01:18.450> when<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:18.900> phone

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
one point ninety years when your phone

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.560 
one point ninety years when your phone
boots<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.670> don't<00:01:20.729> want<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.240> too

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
boots up you don't want to do that too

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.980 
boots up you don't want to do that too
you<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.320> try<00:01:22.799> running<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.630> quadrant<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.840> one

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you know try running a quadrant at one

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
you know try running a quadrant at one
point<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.350> without<00:01:25.770> setting<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.580> boot<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
point now without setting it on boot so

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.810 
point now without setting it on boot so
let's<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:27.659> try<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.290> running<00:01:28.590> at

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
let's actually try that is running at

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.749 
let's actually try that is running at
1.9<00:01:29.820> gigahertz<00:01:30.119> now<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.460> last

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
1.9 gigahertz now and you can see last

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.060 
1.9 gigahertz now and you can see last
run<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> got<00:01:33.360> 70<00:01:33.780> 125<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.590> pretty<00:01:37.590> fairly<00:01:38.479> fast

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
run I got 70 125 so pretty fairly fast

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
run I got 70 125 so pretty fairly fast
kernel<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:42.899> like

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
kernel here and if you want to get like

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.289 
kernel here and if you want to get like
super<00:01:43.920> fast<00:01:44.189> beats<00:01:44.490> definitely<00:01:45.000> check<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
super fast beats definitely check this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
super fast beats definitely check this
one<00:01:45.360> out<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.259> probably<00:01:46.470> install<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
one out and you can probably install it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
one out and you can probably install it
on<00:01:47.340> those<00:01:47.579> custom<00:01:48.149> roms<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.630> running

android 4.1.1 or 4.1.2 and you know I
don't<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.170> recommend<00:01:55.350> running<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.009> fast

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
don't really recommend running that fast
