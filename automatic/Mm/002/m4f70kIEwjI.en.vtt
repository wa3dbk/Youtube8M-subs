00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.880
 everything that is speculated everything that is 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.030
 says all the arrogances that come out are 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.920
 of the means are yours 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.360
 moises muñoz already put the scream in the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.769
 sky got tired of the means you 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.779
 stick the america with tube bucket and 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.189
 volition every defeat and make sure that 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.439
 the airs between the yellows are of 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.939
 greatness and superiority according to muñoz 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.400
 they never said they were 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.829
 invincible superiors and less a 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.599
 ferrari this is something that was already taken from 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.509
 some way good joke us like 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.520
 comrades, we take it as a joke 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.890
 what about the ferrari I say this was ripped off in 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.079
 the first dates and still continue 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.309
 putting things in the press that 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.110
 opened the ferrari that the ferrari does not 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.629
 start that got stuck they have it 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.399
 decomposed and all this does the 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.620
 press say we do not 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.170
 as players then this kind of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.539
 things done around America 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.179
 they have always existed and will continue 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.800
 existing we walk well we walk average 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.109
 table let's walk in the last places 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.269
 worse yet but we are used to 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.190
 and that's what I mean 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.260
 When I tell you, many are created 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.390
 expectations or too much talk of 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.700
 team when we play or when we win 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.409
 the three matches on the line that after 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.990
 we lose one yourselves are the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.300
 responsible for bursting us and throwing us 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.060
 when we on the court 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.410
 our dressing room we have kept 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.960
 calm knowing that we can win 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.810
 we can lose and we can also tie 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.550
 simple and simple like this I have never 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.740
 listened to some companion that comes and 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.650
 declare we are the best and no one 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.240
 wins and we are going to be two-time champions 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.970
 we pass over all that they say 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.710
 you then when you yourselves 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.650
 they create this atmosphere and suddenly 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.020
 we lose they give us everything 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.420
 which is very understandable because America is 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.830
 the most mediatic team but we 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.840
 we have always kept the same 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.970
 balance and in the personal aspect the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.650
 cancerbero is known at a great moment not 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.050
 I want stress in called the tri for 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.030
 play gold cup or cup america but never 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.310
 conditioning its call to the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.060
 ownership I feel good I think I've 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.660
 had good tournaments I felt 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.270
 physically I felt good 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.490
 mentally good football and zinc 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.240
 soccer forgiveness also I 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.880
 He was in good condition then as 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.610
 I keep adding up as much as I can with my 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.260
 team trying to get triumphs of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.030
 harvest points reach one more line 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.940
 get another championship 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.400
 and during this process comes a call 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.990
 to welcome selection and hopefully have 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.030
 the opportunity to be there I say 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.890
 I love to be in Copa America 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.500
 gold cup either of the two me 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.150
 would love to play really is that I think 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.290
 that I have shown that I have the ability 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.480
 to be able to defend the tricolor arch and 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.160
 if it comes that good I will accept it with much 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.140
 responsibility and otherwise 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.489
 I will also respect him as always 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.780
 the fact and I will continue to support the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.780
 selection as Mexican no 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.680
 no no no no I can not demand a 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.269
 ownership of the selection I think 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.349
 no player can demand a 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.349
 ownership in your selection
