compared<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> McDonald's<00:00:59.460> wraps<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.850> believe

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
compared to McDonald's wraps I believe

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
compared to McDonald's wraps I believe
they<00:01:00.149> used<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.510> 8<00:01:00.719> inch<00:01:00.899> tortilla<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.010> one

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
they used an 8 inch tortilla this one

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.650 
they used an 8 inch tortilla this one
looks<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:03.059> bigger<00:01:03.270> than<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.539> I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
looks a little bit bigger than that I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
looks a little bit bigger than that I
mean<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.199> nice<00:01:04.409> generous<00:01:04.979> sized<00:01:05.220> wrap<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
mean it's a nice generous sized wrap and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.190 
mean it's a nice generous sized wrap and
it<00:01:05.880> looks<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> whole<00:01:06.420> grain<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> wheat

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it looks like a whole grain or a wheat

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.530 
it looks like a whole grain or a wheat
tortilla<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> always<00:01:08.280> nice<00:01:08.640> let's<00:01:09.450> go

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
tortilla which is always nice let's go

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
tortilla which is always nice let's go
ahead<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> look<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> inside<00:01:10.830> here

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
ahead and take a look on the inside here

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
ahead and take a look on the inside here
so<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> ingredients<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.659> supposed<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so the ingredients are supposed to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.740 
so the ingredients are supposed to
consist<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.680> iceberg<00:01:14.280> lettuce<00:01:14.460> ripe<00:01:15.180> tomatoes

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
consist of iceberg lettuce ripe tomatoes

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
consist of iceberg lettuce ripe tomatoes
mozzarella<00:01:16.170> cheese<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.400> basil<00:01:17.759> sauce

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
mozzarella cheese and that basil sauce

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.450 
mozzarella cheese and that basil sauce
now<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.930> actual<00:01:19.320> basil<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
now it's not actual basil in this as I

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.080 
now it's not actual basil in this as I
expected

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
expected

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850 
expected

it's more of an Italian dressing with

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
it's more of an Italian dressing with
basil<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.240> having<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.689> hard<00:01:24.720> time

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
basil in it and I'm having a hard time

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.140 
basil in it and I'm having a hard time
spotting<00:01:25.409> any<00:01:25.830> mozzarella<00:01:26.430> cheese<00:01:26.759> which<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
spotting any mozzarella cheese which is

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.580 
spotting any mozzarella cheese which is
kind<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> letdown<00:01:27.810> because<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.259> sounded

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
kind of a letdown because that sounded

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
kind of a letdown because that sounded
really<00:01:28.740> delicious<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.390> rap<00:01:30.600> my

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
really delicious so in my rap my

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.060 
really delicious so in my rap my
mozzarella<00:01:30.990> cheese<00:01:31.560> seems<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.950> be

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
mozzarella cheese seems to be

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
mozzarella cheese seems to be
non-existent<00:01:32.430> which<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.630> sure<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
non-existent which I'm not sure if it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.690 
non-existent which I'm not sure if it
comes<00:01:34.170> shredded<00:01:34.650> sliced<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
comes shredded sliced or what but I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.160 
comes shredded sliced or what but I
honestly<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.509> any<00:01:36.689> cheese<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
honestly do not see any cheese in that

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.780 
honestly do not see any cheese in that
at<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.860> either<00:01:38.040> way<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:38.430> gonna<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.700> ahead

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
at all but either way I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.450 
at all but either way I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:39.060> wrap<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.750> see<00:01:40.170> how<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.290> tastes<00:01:40.710> ok

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and wrap it up and see how it tastes ok

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460 
and wrap it up and see how it tastes ok

just<00:02:37.850> see<00:02:38.000> absolutely<00:02:38.630> no<00:02:38.840> kind<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.260> cheese

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
just see absolutely no kind of cheese

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.890 
just see absolutely no kind of cheese
which<00:02:40.730> really<00:02:41.000> doesn't<00:02:41.300> make<00:02:41.360> much<00:02:41.540> sense<00:02:41.570> to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
which really doesn't make much sense to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.020 
which really doesn't make much sense to
me<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.140> mean<00:02:42.500> how<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:43.490> supposed<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.760> say<00:02:43.910> this

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
me I mean how it's supposed to say this

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.790 
me I mean how it's supposed to say this
mozzarella<00:02:44.450> cheese<00:02:44.690> when<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.050> not<00:02:45.320> even

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
mozzarella cheese when it's not even

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830 
mozzarella cheese when it's not even
noticeable<00:02:46.310> but<00:02:47.030> supposedly<00:02:47.510> there<00:02:47.810> is

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
noticeable but supposedly there is

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.540 
noticeable but supposedly there is
mozzarella<00:02:48.290> cheese<00:02:48.709> in<00:02:48.920> there<00:02:49.130> somewhere<00:02:49.400> I

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
mozzarella cheese in there somewhere I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.040 
mozzarella cheese in there somewhere I
don't<00:02:49.760> know<00:02:49.970> really<00:02:50.330> how<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:50.810> either<00:02:50.900> way

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
don't know really how but either way

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.360 
don't know really how but either way
I'll<00:02:51.170> wrap<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:51.470> back<00:02:51.560> up<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.010> see<00:02:52.190> how<00:02:52.250> it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
I'll wrap it back up and see how it

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.370 
I'll wrap it back up and see how it
tastes<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.360> for<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.570> crispy<00:02:53.870> chicken<00:02:53.900> basil

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
tastes so for the crispy chicken basil

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.320 
tastes so for the crispy chicken basil
wrap<00:02:54.709> from<00:02:54.920> Burger<00:02:55.310> King<00:02:55.580> it's<00:02:55.910> definitely<00:02:56.300> a

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.370 
dressing of course got some on the side
right<00:03:04.910> here<00:03:05.030> tried<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.510> out<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:05.900> basically<00:03:06.260> a

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
right here tried it out it's basically a

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.900 
right here tried it out it's basically a
creamy<00:03:06.650> Italian<00:03:06.830> with<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> little<00:03:07.580> bit<00:03:07.700> more<00:03:07.820> of

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
creamy Italian with a little bit more of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.699 
creamy Italian with a little bit more of
an<00:03:08.000> herbal<00:03:08.300> taste<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.660> basil<00:03:08.930> kind<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.500> hint

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
an herbal taste that basil kind of hint

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.710 
an herbal taste that basil kind of hint
and<00:03:09.980> all<00:03:10.580> in<00:03:10.730> all<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:11.000> worked<00:03:11.180> out<00:03:11.300> pretty<00:03:11.450> well

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
and all in all it worked out pretty well

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.420 
and all in all it worked out pretty well
with<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.050> chicken<00:03:12.260> now<00:03:12.560> like<00:03:12.770> I<00:03:12.890> said<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.160> don't

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
with the chicken now like I said I don't

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.729 
with the chicken now like I said I don't
see<00:03:13.790> any<00:03:14.120> mozzarella<00:03:14.600> on<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:15.050> whatsoever<00:03:15.440> I

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
see any mozzarella on this whatsoever I

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.020 
see any mozzarella on this whatsoever I
could<00:03:16.010> not<00:03:16.160> find<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.610> that's<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.850> whole

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
could not find it and that's the whole

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.280 
could not find it and that's the whole
reason<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.300> went<00:03:17.390> back<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.720> got<00:03:17.780> another<00:03:18.050> one

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
reason I went back and got another one

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.560 
reason I went back and got another one
and<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:19.040> still<00:03:19.280> non-existent<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:20.150> my<00:03:20.360> wrap

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
and it's still non-existent on my wrap

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.940 
and it's still non-existent on my wrap
but<00:03:20.989> I'm<00:03:21.050> guessing<00:03:21.350> if<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:21.530> get<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> sandwich

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
but I'm guessing if you get a sandwich

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.500 
but I'm guessing if you get a sandwich
it'll<00:03:22.400> probably<00:03:22.580> be<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.850> little<00:03:23.090> bit<00:03:23.239> more

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
it'll probably be a little bit more

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.030 
it'll probably be a little bit more
there<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:24.019> it'll<00:03:24.140> be<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.290> lot<00:03:24.410> more<00:03:24.590> obvious

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
there and it'll be a lot more obvious

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.100 
there and it'll be a lot more obvious
than<00:03:25.400> what<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.880> with<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.360> wrap<00:03:26.600> but<00:03:26.959> for

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
than what it is with this wrap but for

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.540 
than what it is with this wrap but for
the<00:03:27.170> wrap<00:03:27.320> as<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.530> whole<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:27.830> mean<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> crispy

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.050 
with a nice wheat tortilla which was
also<00:03:39.769> pretty<00:03:40.100> good<00:03:40.220> now<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.580> lettuce<00:03:40.940> and

were<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.730> little<00:03:43.880> bit<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.239> disgrace<00:03:44.750> they're

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
were a little bit of a disgrace they're

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.690 
were a little bit of a disgrace they're
very<00:03:45.590> very<00:03:45.739> small<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.340> absolutely

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
very very small and absolutely

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.970 
very very small and absolutely
flavorless<00:03:47.239> but<00:03:47.510> that<00:03:47.660> nice<00:03:47.870> dressing<00:03:48.650> goes

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
flavorless but that nice dressing goes

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.560 
flavorless but that nice dressing goes
amazing<00:03:49.700> with<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.940> chicken<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.480> only

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
amazing with the chicken and and only

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.320 
amazing with the chicken and and only
$1.99<00:03:51.290> it's<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.739> pretty<00:03:51.920> good<00:03:52.130> value<00:03:52.459> as<00:03:52.670> well<00:03:53.030> I

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
$1.99 it's a pretty good value as well I

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.030 
$1.99 it's a pretty good value as well I
personally<00:03:53.870> like<00:03:53.989> wraps<00:03:54.230> two<00:03:54.410> sandwiches<00:03:54.680> but

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
personally like wraps two sandwiches but

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.650 
personally like wraps two sandwiches but
I<00:03:55.070> think<00:03:55.340> for<00:03:55.489> this<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.850> would<00:03:55.940> actually<00:03:56.540> rather

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
I think for this I would actually rather

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.360 
I think for this I would actually rather
go<00:03:57.019> with<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.350> sandwich<00:03:57.769> because<00:03:57.920> then<00:03:58.100> I<00:03:58.130> think

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
go with a sandwich because then I think

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.890 
go with a sandwich because then I think
you'd<00:03:58.489> actually<00:03:58.640> get<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.000> hint<00:03:59.209> of<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.570> cheese

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
you'd actually get a hint of that cheese

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.270 
you'd actually get a hint of that cheese
now<00:04:00.140> I<00:04:00.170> think<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> mozzarella<00:04:00.860> cheese<00:04:01.040> wasn't

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
now I think I mozzarella cheese wasn't

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.040 
now I think I mozzarella cheese wasn't
this<00:04:01.489> it'd<00:04:01.730> definitely<00:04:02.030> be<00:04:02.269> an<00:04:02.450> easy<00:04:02.630> 10<00:04:02.959> out

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
this it'd definitely be an easy 10 out

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.720 
this it'd definitely be an easy 10 out
of<00:04:03.140> 10<00:04:03.350> but<00:04:03.860> since<00:04:04.040> I'm<00:04:04.190> not<00:04:04.220> really<00:04:04.489> getting

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
of 10 but since I'm not really getting

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.729 
of 10 but since I'm not really getting
much<00:04:04.880> of<00:04:05.180> any<00:04:05.300> mozzarella<00:04:05.810> cheese<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.410> I<00:04:06.500> kind

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
much of any mozzarella cheese and I kind

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.530 
much of any mozzarella cheese and I kind
of<00:04:06.769> feel<00:04:06.980> like<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.760> wrap<00:04:07.940> would<00:04:08.090> be<00:04:08.209> even

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
of feel like the wrap would be even

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.300 
of feel like the wrap would be even
better<00:04:08.570> with<00:04:08.900> it<00:04:09.170> it's<00:04:09.560> only<00:04:09.650> gonna<00:04:09.799> be<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.980> 7

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
better with it it's only gonna be a 7

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.670 
better with it it's only gonna be a 7
out<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.459> 10<00:04:10.610> for<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.150> taste<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.350> sandwich

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
out of 10 for the taste but the sandwich

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.199 
out of 10 for the taste but the sandwich
I<00:04:12.830> think<00:04:13.070> would<00:04:13.220> be<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.340> little<00:04:13.640> bit<00:04:13.700> better<00:04:13.910> and

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
I think would be a little bit better and

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.120 
I think would be a little bit better and
it's<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.480> great<00:04:14.660> value<00:04:14.870> 8<00:04:15.350> out<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.560> 10<00:04:15.739> for<00:04:16.010> the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
it's a great value 8 out of 10 for the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.909 
it's a great value 8 out of 10 for the
value<00:04:16.459> because<00:04:16.900> 199<00:04:17.900> it's<00:04:18.229> a<00:04:18.350> decent<00:04:18.739> sized

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
value because 199 it's a decent sized

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.440 
value because 199 it's a decent sized
decent<00:04:19.430> amount<00:04:19.609> of<00:04:19.669> chicken<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.270> it<00:04:20.359> would

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
decent amount of chicken and it would

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.819 
decent amount of chicken and it would
definitely<00:04:20.780> fill<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:20.989> up

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
definitely fill you up

definitely fill you up
