a ton of different scenarios a lot of
game<00:02:06.490> like<00:02:06.729> situations<00:02:07.420> puts<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.590> suspended

situation and expects us to perform and
I<00:02:11.709> think<00:02:12.010> that's<00:02:12.160> great<00:02:12.340> for<00:02:12.550> mental

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
I think that's great for mental

important for the members of the
offensive<00:02:39.340> line<00:02:39.370> we're<00:02:40.030> five<00:02:40.750> guys<00:02:40.989> working

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
offensive line we're five guys working

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.350 
offensive line we're five guys working
together<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.549> takes<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.880> while<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.269> get

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
together and it takes a while to get

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.850 
together and it takes a while to get
that<00:02:43.510> cohesiveness<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.350> get<00:02:44.709> that

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
that cohesiveness and get that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.410 
that cohesiveness and get that
camaraderie<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.579> know<00:02:45.730> exactly<00:02:45.910> where

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
camaraderie and know exactly where

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.860 
camaraderie and know exactly where
everybody's<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.280> calls<00:02:48.280> down<00:02:48.760> and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
everybody's going to be calls down and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.030 
everybody's going to be calls down and
kind<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.989> communicate<00:02:50.950> without

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
kind of communicate without

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.250 
kind of communicate without
communicating<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:52.360> think<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.900> takes<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.140> lot

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
communicating I think that takes a lot

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.100 
communicating I think that takes a lot
of<00:02:53.320> reps<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:54.430> lot<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.910> lot<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> practice<00:02:55.930> so

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
of reps and a lot of lot of practice so

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.930 
of reps and a lot of lot of practice so
it's<00:02:56.230> very<00:02:56.350> very<00:02:56.500> important<00:02:57.100> for<00:02:57.250> all<00:02:57.700> five

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
it's very very important for all five

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.030 
it's very very important for all five
guys<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.209> are<00:02:58.600> starting<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.470> working

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
guys that are starting to be working

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.039 
guys that are starting to be working
together<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.370> lot<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:00.640> get<00:03:01.510> all<00:03:01.600> those<00:03:01.690> reps<00:03:01.959> in

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.259 
together a lot and get all those reps in
practice<00:03:02.110> which<00:03:02.950> will<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:03.400> turn<00:03:03.430> eventually

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
practice which will in turn eventually

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.060 
practice which will in turn eventually
provide<00:03:04.570> better<00:03:04.840> protection<00:03:04.959> for<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.680> passer

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070
