00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.500
 Not yet arrived in Brazil, it would arrive soon. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.670
 It will not be easy in the car, you will not. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.529
 regret 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.609

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.189
 new mm3 here the car and the brakes of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.730
 Special ceramics are fantastic 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.710
 here on the track of portimÃ£o in portugal 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.040
 where I take journalists and you 'll see 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.690
 the whole day of the car the three always in the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.040
 maximum performance without losing without 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.750
 pedal london stay 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.289
 so really a great job here 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.329
 below we have what makes the new 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.670
 m3 a special car 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.410
 the car is completely what I said 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 revised much lighter you have a 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.870
 Electronic steering box here one 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.910
 power steering which gives a feeling of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.160
 steering wheel and kitchen in the race car 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.430
 to expobonito some work that bmw 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.010
 spent a lot of time and leave all 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.070
 car front chassis more 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.600
 rigid a way that the pilot when 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.360
 takes the car itself on the limit 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.210
 feels that the car does not 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.180
 has that gelatin made click pole 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.130
 Come on, come on. We've got here. 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.470
 a drive shaft of the car 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.630
 completely in carbon fiber is the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.840
 which is much lighter much more 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.909
 efficient and in the end the differential 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.880
 differential is the same 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.850
 used in 596 which helps and facilitates 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.680
 very sad the car coming out of there 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.780
 so here on the track you hang up still 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.729
 could be turned on I felt the car a lot 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.579
 more naive a very easy car 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.380
 controlling this is thanks to the differential 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.880
 of traffic outside that has the tires 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.979
 michelin that were developed 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.479
 especially for the new test in 4 and 3 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.159
 then the old car building cable 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 Talk to me again soon, I'll train 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.780
 conditioning will leave Brazil not 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.790
 ask go there and preventative 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.790
