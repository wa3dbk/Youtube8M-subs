00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.120
 we have tired of the color of our 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.410
 We are going to paint it in white 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.860
 first thing to do is remove 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.860
 all the furniture 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.210
 to paint it for the interior you go to 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.310
 need the following tools 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.400
 cardboard paper bodybuilder tape one 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.200
 lengthening wire roller brushes and 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.429
 our premium talÃ©ns plastic paint 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.750
 mate 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:34.009
 once cleared the room with paper 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.009
 carton we will protect the floor 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.190
 with bodybuilder tape we will protect 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.500
 the singular points from appliques 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.500
 point of light all foot doors 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.560
 be careful when you go to 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.420
 paint not ride on the wall because 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.400
 when we remove the tape it would be the piece 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.980
 they seem to paint with what when it happens 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.560
 this correct tape and the cop and always 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.450
 just to haunt it gives life once we have 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.050
 all protected let's prepare our 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.990
 painting 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.240
 for this we open the container we take the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.850
 paint and pour it in the bucket 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.500
 for dilution of the plastic with 200 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.020
 milliliters that the amount of grapes the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.490
 water is enough to beat the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.700
 plastic with water we can help 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.119
 of the grid simply by shaking with 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.880
 the grid will incorporate the water to the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.799
 painting we will begin by the cuts 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.700
 that it's about painting with a brush where 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.700
 do not come with the roller 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.510
 once we have all the cuts 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.610
 made with a lengthener and the roller 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.650
 we will help ourselves to paint what we are going 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.330
 to do is lightly wet the roller and 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.100
 we will begin to always paint a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.570
 corner forward in this case let's 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.420
 to work in the form of m 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.970
 that is, we will discharge paint towards 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.970
 up we will spread forward 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.200
 and we'll give it a little paint 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.200
 backwards 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.450
 and once distributed what we're going to 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.450
 to do is to comb the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.000
 and this step we will be doing 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.000
 successively 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.860
 when we talk about combing the paint it 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.180
 deal with the unloaded roller 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.180
 pass it gently over 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.250
 with that what we get is that 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.250
 a very fine engraving 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.790
 well it 's been about 68 hours we are going 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.170
 to do second hand is about repeating 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.060
 the same step that we have done before 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.330
 we will start cutting and then knee 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.330
 will 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.910
 immediately after we finish painting 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.400
 we removed the tape it will cost us a lot 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.260
 less work we have already given the change 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.220
 we have painted the room in white that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.220
 with it we will gain luminosity 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.670
 Y
