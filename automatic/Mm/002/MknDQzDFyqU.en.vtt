00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:24.420
 but it happens but how to make it even more 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:26.609
 special assure you that it is not clear to 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 all the boys are one of the least one 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.779
 video of hicks walls one of my most 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.700
 great idols of human history 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.530
 I am very happy to comment on 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.000
 gameplay of this very valiant 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.640
 call of duty player 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 we are on call of duty black ops 2 i believe 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.120
 I never understand why I am so 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.770
 all the same and we are commenting on one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 of the most impressive matches in history 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.520
 of the Italian community made by adults 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.260
 hicks murri we say he wanted me in 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 this game to play mine 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
 special commentary also in the memo 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.190
 destruction of fauna and flora that we will see 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.050
 definitely in this game that is the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.489
 first time I see but I am 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.930
 sure enough it will give us some 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.150
 incredible emotions 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.530
 we see that hicks walls is running like 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.380
 a grinder probably wanted 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.670
 specializing in this work is in 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.830
 around the map to sharpen knives 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.750
 of the other players and one of the jobs 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.310
 more profitable than this period 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.689
 surely but we see that there is also the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.850
 indeed competition has just been 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.590
 killed by another knife sharpener this is one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.450
 how you probably have them a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.460
 arrangement only of row weapons 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.409
 in fact I believe that knives are chefs 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.060
 Tony will enter the game very soon 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.310
 will succeed in killing everyone with miracle 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.130
 plaid 3 which is absolutely the most weapon 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.960
 imposing of this modality we are 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.880
 by playing on the computer we are playing in 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.409
 a map that was also present on call 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.180
 of duty black ops here we see that hicks 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.680
 walls is exploded for unknown reasons 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.390
 probably it is the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.310
 very famous spontaneous combustion of the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.899
 griffin and we see them there is a grinder 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.040
 who dies like an idiot 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.479
 we also see what is happening 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040
 something I have no idea why me 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.780
 I see people explode left and right 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.729
 but it's not important anyway 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.110
 Lords has already passed one minute and thirty 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.700
 but I see that there is an epic in this 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.799
 game that is absolutely impressive 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.960
 let's see the wall hicks that is standing 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.909
 absolutely dominating the market of 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.710
 supply and demand refining him 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.209
 before any other person all 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.630
 knives but we see that there are also the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.390
 wicked who launch cold 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.280
 to destroy absolutely everything 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.810
 I believe the commentary will start at 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.940
 short 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.110
 I generally have to get it started 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.090
 definitely in mid-game because if there 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.130
 I start my ropes from the beginning 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.070
 vowels decide to go to the other 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.500
 world of suicide spontaneously 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.510
 here we see that there is perhaps shock and tones 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.040
 maybe baskets arrived in the game again 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.750
 you cannot understand but in any case 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.390
 we are in a game that the gentlemen is 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.860
 taking enough folds 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.720
 difficult to explain why there are 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.090
 sharpeners that obviously in the situation 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.620
 of European financial crisis of this 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.180
 period are finding new ways 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.920
 in other words, to sharpen knives 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.690
 those explosive arrows that though 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.820
 certainly could bring discomfort 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.200
 but in the market, sir, I believe that 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.070
 the time has come to start with the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.070
 our commentary 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.959
 it is the former who moves in this 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.310
 game where everyone has to 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.510
 kill yourself with the knives that they are 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.829
 actually some grinders that are 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.390
 trying to sharpen the others that 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.860
 jump and explode common of ata that 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.819
 I don't know that he's running, he jumped happily 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.860
 probably an Australian kangaroo 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.420
 keep doing the zigzag that it is 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.280
 probably doing the zig zag a 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.870
 PokÃ©mon game agents came out 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.459
 directly from there it came out directly 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.349
 he knows what those from the barrels are 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.060
 everything in the far west is exploding 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.689
 that one throws in opposite that 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.069
 takes the knife 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.629
 now somewhere else I was 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.799
 doing maybe he was making a bidet 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.420
 because he's gone backwards without 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.010
 show her there are dummies 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.019
 who is moving to the stoner for 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.849
 destroy everything and explode nkis 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.109
 mourinho understands that nothing hicks walls 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.849
 keep on fighting keep running 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.470
 here I see another is the kangaroo 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.389
 first it has still not arrived the advent 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.280
 tony chef tony chef will come like 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.170
 jesus because he wants to do something like that 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.430
 the Christian one and would like to do it 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.810
 suddenly on the cross 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.430
 here you do not understand anything anymore 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.139
 what is happening born on 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.120
 kangaroo jumped again the kangaroo is 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.230
 skipped the other as well the grinder continues 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.099
 still throwing knives are 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.389
 back to the back 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.040
 a wonderful car this 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.120
 machine costs at least 50 thousand euros 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.560
 VAT excluded 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.730
 here he continues to go to all the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.769
 parts that hid in the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.419
 drink distributor or my god is 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.709
 a corpse flew you saw it all 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.359
 how many gentlemen he was attending 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.160
 probably at a rally race 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.419
 if there had been pine walk it would have 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.400
 said he blew up like one 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.989
 catapult here is dying new ones 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.970
 walls but even if they are really dying 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.409
 this is only a tactic he wants to do 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.239
 pretend to be dead and then kill 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.949
 everyone will not be able to save himself 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.330
 no one street cone and probably 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.590
 on this road they are also doing 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.849
 driving school but don't want to do it 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.680
 understand to other people therefore not 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.289
 they are secretly doing what he is doing 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.940
 this one threw himself like an idiot 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.560
 here are the walls that died stabbing the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.180
 sword of damocles that pierced him into 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.440
 full face the radar tells us the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.210
 location of other enemies and hicks 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.919
 walls is absolutely dominating this 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.810
 game is absolutely invisible 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.460
 an alien spaceship have arrived as well 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.780
 the aliens to play has arrived chef 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.070
 tony and the aliens and the war of the worlds 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.720
 it is not clear that nothing probably 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.340
 there is also steven spielberg that now 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.720
 that appears from that window 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.430
 still continues to jump goroni 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.169
 idiot and steven spielberg the new ones 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.979
 characters explodes hicks walls jumps 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.740
 studios that crashed the south with 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.620
 the ex morini camera i think if 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.270
 success that wants to die of that too 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.949
 what is it in kong in skyscrapers 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.750
 they are the smallest skyscrapers I have 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.240
 never seen and here it is arrived 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.710
 first put away the aliens 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.360
 and arrived as well in kong that devastates 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.340
 the skyscrapers of new york the grinder 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.900
 number 2 wants to die there too 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.080
 takes the crossbow and launches it with 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.389
 christ one does not understand the lady an 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.190
 delirium what he was doing that 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.949
 was going to that will be drunk as 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.810
 minimum 5 cocktails 56 are due to rise 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.569
 we all have all of us 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.479
 ok sir let's say you didn't understand one 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.849
 fuck 10 3 there were gods 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.770
 however, some rather unusual events 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.120
 that the commentary did you like one 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.800
 of the commentary in which I do not have 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.889
 I understood nothing either 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.330
 however, gentlemen are ultra le 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.580
 subscribe to the wall channel though 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.770

 see next video I hope to 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.199
 return to comment another 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.159
 exciting match of morri 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.159
 next hi guys
