you<00:01:40.099> Jonas<00:01:41.099> Valanciunas<00:01:41.249> the<00:01:42.119> fact<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.450> he's

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599 
you Jonas Valanciunas the fact that he's

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.229 
you Jonas Valanciunas the fact that he's

roster<00:01:45.810> updates<00:01:46.169> or<00:01:46.349> roster<00:01:47.099> shares<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.759> guess

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
roster updates or roster shares I guess

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.269

what<00:01:48.989> they<00:01:49.139> had<00:01:49.319> is<00:01:49.499> basically<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.130> had

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279 
what they had is basically they had

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.789 
what they had is basically they had
black<00:01:50.609> arms<00:01:50.999> and<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.899> face<00:01:52.229> didn't<00:01:52.619> match

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
black arms and the face didn't match

in association I started a new

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.960 
in association I started a new
association<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.350> Raptors<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.760> have

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970

Jonas<00:03:45.360> Valanciunas<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:46.140> my<00:03:46.320> squad<00:03:46.590> as<00:03:46.830> you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
Jonas Valanciunas on my squad as you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.300 
Jonas Valanciunas on my squad as you
could<00:03:47.130> see<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.660> great<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.530> I'm<00:03:49.860> sure<00:03:49.950> it

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
could see and it's great and I'm sure it

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.850 
could see and it's great and I'm sure it
works<00:03:50.550> for<00:03:50.670> my<00:03:50.910> player<00:03:51.180> but<00:03:51.930> unfortunately<00:03:52.710> it

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
works for my player but unfortunately it

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.950 
works for my player but unfortunately it
does<00:03:53.070> not<00:03:53.340> work<00:03:53.550> for<00:03:53.610> create<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.210> legend<00:03:54.690> for

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
does not work for create a legend for

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.570 
does not work for create a legend for
some<00:03:55.110> reason<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.620> think<00:03:56.310> there<00:03:56.460> is<00:03:56.490> a

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
some reason I think there is a

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.720 
some reason I think there is a
workaround<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.680> could<00:03:58.860> do<00:03:59.040> I'm<00:03:59.550> gonna

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
workaround that you could do I'm gonna

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.120 
workaround that you could do I'm gonna
link<00:04:00.060> I'm<00:04:00.390> gonna<00:04:00.630> link<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.020> a<00:04:01.140> video<00:04:01.350> made

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
link I'm gonna link you to a video made

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.300 
link I'm gonna link you to a video made
by<00:04:02.160> Blink<00:04:02.640> fro<00:04:02.880> so<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:03.930> guys<00:04:04.080> could<00:04:04.320> do<00:04:05.130> the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
by Blink fro so you guys could do the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.370 
by Blink fro so you guys could do the
workaround<00:04:05.880> but<00:04:06.030> basically<00:04:06.630> what<00:04:06.900> happened

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
workaround but basically what happened

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.190 
workaround but basically what happened
was<00:04:07.760> when<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:08.880> go<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.060> create<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> legend<00:04:09.930> and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
was when you go to create a legend and

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.870 
was when you go to create a legend and
you<00:04:10.350> pick<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> team<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.190> want<00:04:11.400> right<00:04:11.640> here

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
you pick a team that you want right here

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.120 
you pick a team that you want right here
I'm<00:04:11.970> going<00:04:12.209> for<00:04:12.540> Jonas<00:04:12.990> Valanciunas<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.770> as

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
I'm going for Jonas Valanciunas and as

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.580 
I'm going for Jonas Valanciunas and as
you<00:04:14.250> can<00:04:14.400> see<00:04:14.550> he's<00:04:14.760> not<00:04:14.910> there<00:04:15.209> unfortunately

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
you can see he's not there unfortunately

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.440 
you can see he's not there unfortunately
but<00:04:16.590> there<00:04:16.980> is<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.160> work<00:04:17.459> workaround<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.239> you

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
but there is a work workaround that you

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.300 
but there is a work workaround that you
could<00:04:18.630> do<00:04:18.780> just<00:04:18.989> watch<00:04:19.410> blink<00:04:19.770> for<00:04:19.920> this<00:04:20.040> video

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
could do just watch blink for this video

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.099 
could do just watch blink for this video
