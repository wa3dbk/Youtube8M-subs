00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:29.170
 let's see now how to exercise the hand 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.529
 right these dynamic changes 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.860
 let's start with a basic pattern one 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.820
 simple and intuitive rhythm sequence in 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:43.870
 four quarters and all played no beams 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.550
 where we hear every eighth beat 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.730
 cast in June dictated among the various 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.830
 instead with the plata in su then big 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.830
 way a figure of the kind 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:07.990
 we try to give a stronger body into 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.060
 correspondence of the symbol precisely 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 of the accent that the angle brackets 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.760
 closed where there is that symbol we play 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.990
 with more strength ok so you can hear 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.280
 a difference between the centralized body and 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.280
 the one not ascertained 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.900
 so for example 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.650
 let's try reading to play some of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.730
 these examples so to have a sort 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:45.140
 of input accent on running up 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.140
 each of the four quarters 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.450
 other figure 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.450
 other figure 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.670
 other figure 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.680
 but what good to note that they are very 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.490
 these figures differ from one another 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.900
 despite having the same metric ie 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.770
 always playing the eighths in a manner 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.320
 so it's up to you now 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.320
 train yourself and find so many figures 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.320
 possibilities are very good work
