00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
three new sets in the game and I think

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.950 
three new sets in the game and I think
the<00:00:18.750> most<00:00:19.410> anticipated<00:00:20.130> set<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.449> mystery

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the most anticipated set is this mystery

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.380 
the most anticipated set is this mystery
MVP<00:00:22.740> set<00:00:23.039> since<00:00:23.340> added<00:00:23.640> 20<00:00:23.970> super<00:00:24.240> bowl

MVP set since added 20 super bowl

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.730 
MVP set since added 20 super bowl
