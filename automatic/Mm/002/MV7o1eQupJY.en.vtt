00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.350
 Nine people I'm one piece started to 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.269
 a new video marginal today 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.280
 finally the eater he is 21 time 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.330
 finally the weapons give money and we 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.720
 start now 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.460
 the damage is 25 to 18 so the state 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.380
 Damage of a storm rifle that makes 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 two to three hits in the head four 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.390
 to six in the chest and five to 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.189
 Six in the legs of the drop off start 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.619
 is at eight meters that is up on 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.900
 meter make a damage of 25 dollars 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.000
 damage up to 55 meters and then have 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.079
 we achieved the minima damage of 18 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.840
 the fire rate is even slightly lower with 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.090
 In 601 she gave one to the bottom 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.649
 food chain has reached even lower 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.170
 as the kh which is a higher one 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.640
 damage model does have the advantage 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 that the residue is not noticeable 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.750
 but also close combat takes forever 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.390
 until you opponent environment the cow 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.399
 Speed ​​is 650 meters per 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.050
 Seconds but quite good so the balls 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.239
 fly nice fast aim on distance 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.490
 You can meet well and reach 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.740
 of 175 meters will of course reach 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.420
 but can know it for distance 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.729
 the weapon is definitely suitable 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.890
 The capacity is 30 plus one shot 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.330
 standard in any case also good in the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.770
 one can already work with the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.530
 After a long time is not more 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.659
 quite as much with 23 seconds was still 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.150
 a cow is in progress and 3.4 seconds 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.040
 if the weapon is completely empty takes 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.560
 the course unique piece longer 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.240
 as many other weapons there are 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.900
 this is negotiated with distance is the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.040
 not too bad either 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.460
 for that, the two recoil the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.140
 absolute top weapons upwards of 0.18 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.950
 Low has not believed me yet 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.540
 to the left 0 2 to the right 02 clock notes 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.759
 you hardly recoil we watch what's ahead 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.549
 recoil is hardly to be seen 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.850
 recognize the multiplier of 18 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.930
 which is actually still quite low 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.040
 we barely conclude with the weapon 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.630
 The stream had to be a bit stupid at first 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.399
 I thought she had the sets of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.469
 pulte weapon because it looked so similar 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.149
 but apparently she has this network 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.310
 does not see the sets of a normal one 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.440
 Sturmgewehrs that means in sight 02 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.720
 if she should not move me and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.190
 10 if she should move so if 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.740
 I am very precise 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.220
 if I move rather less 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.930
 it is probably standard there but well what 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.400
 maybe you'll do half of it 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.300
 Something wrong so came with the weapon 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.310
 rarely use 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.120
 The increase in control is also easy 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.590
 wow so 0 078 is incredibly low 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.960
 So you can burst properly long 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.880
 make and the weapon that remains accurate 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.620
 Both put on like a variant 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.060
 it is easy to switch quickly with 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.260
 the quixote believe that we are 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.450
 here what after 10 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.610
 so there is no need for a long time 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.190
 Of course you can play again afterwards 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.810
 to resort to amplifiers or such 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.030
 things he intended for distance 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.010
 in laser or intact light 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.840
 just do not just not on this weapon 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.060
 let it work has no meaning to her 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.650
 does not need a laser in close combat if you 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.170
 says you make the fight and after 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.150
 Ok again but hardly forgotten 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.640
 you can prefer him with such a weapon 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.710
 leave out completely afterwards I say 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.510
 necessarily serious run because the thing 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.730
 has hardly slippery up the heavier 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.950
 running increased a bit ok, you realize 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.600
 but minimal for the cottage precision 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.670
 you realize clearly that's one 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.860
 weapon was difficult to run and what is good 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.360
 weapons which you already extreme upward 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.930
 Turn down there is more of a hindrance 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.640
 but such a clear top I have in 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.709
 wrapped handle that does not have to 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.780
 necessarily because the multiplier 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.280
 is not that high you are so normal to me 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.780
 which heavy running i try 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.700
 most of the angled handle to be 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.130
 Take is not at all necessary here 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.080
 definitely recommended 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.310
 Great I can handle it super 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.120
 and i can definitely 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.230
 Recommend 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.660
 otherwise I would say it to 21 of the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.450
 Fed's negative is just her 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.370
 shoots so slowly that is in the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.260
 melee are so old out of it 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.150
 distance of course thinks so great again 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.769
 but it takes time here 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.519
 even at a distance from eternity to 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.500
 fall over 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.769
 Of course we can say that 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.810
 Hardly recoil so I really little and 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.130
 so that the weapon is also super precise 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.350
 Almost and laser with the man 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.000
 can shoot and for beginners still 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.560
 practiced are actually super to 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.750
 Control because it is very easy 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.340
 but kills very slowly 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.900
 can take a bit against 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.500
 Often the chance to be in winter too 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.200
 reach 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.410
 is so thick stream negative for it 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.730
 but also on distance already very much 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.580
 well yes that was it with this year to 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.520
 s21 was once paid now it should be the 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.870
 I'm going to be annoying too 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.210
 So just lose it 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.570
 and yes that was it with this video skin 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.570
 three people
