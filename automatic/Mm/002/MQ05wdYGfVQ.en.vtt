00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello welcome to make my 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.299
 day 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.670
 Halloween is coming soon 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.580
 we thought about it and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.040
 although they make cupcakes like frankenstein 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 I have my normal one here 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.300
 chocolate cupcakes the chocolate cupcake 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.340
 basic recipe I have here below 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 times linked for you if we 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.949
 focus only on us today 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.960
 beat time 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:36.780
 For that we take butter cheese first 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.160
 and mix that with each other and then 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.579
 comes the sifted powdered sugar 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.579
 to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.340
 so the frosting is actually already like that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.900
 pretty much done I know frosting 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.730
 is that always a thing i have in 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.340
 read the comments partly wales 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.200
 post with you too liquid or so if 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.970
 such a thing does not seem to matter 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.010
 you can basically say if yours 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.630
 Frosting is too fluid then just do it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.060
 a little more powdered sugar 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.340
 until it has the desired consistency or 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.020
 if it is too hard on what happen 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
 can then just a very small 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.710
 in milk and then it should 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.270
 be better later 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.979
 I have the frosting in the now 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.720
 Refrigerator done so beautifully 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.190
 stays and in time we take care of each other 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.880
 around the eyes of the frankenstein 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.020
 monster 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.380
 for that I have marzipan here the formula 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.200
 I can be in such small spheres 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.910
 also use it from there and then 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.369
 I'll take a smart to you here 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:41.180
 a red that looks so pure then 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.180
 the whole thing 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.070
 would now have two red eyes now do 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.710
 I once again with browns parties two 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.299
 brown eyes so we have the eyes 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.729
 Now and now it continues 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.560
 The casting is now dyed green 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.909
 take action here for color 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.700
 but there are also completely different ones 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.409
 different kinds of food coloring 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.360
 you can take that too 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.220
 below a link to a list where 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.350
 Different types are listed 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.610
 you can also inform yourself and 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.410
 then I take a first here now 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.250
 little tip of and look like yourself 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.250
 that behaves 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.950
 that looks pretty good 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.320
 the frankenstein green is me 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.480
 presented 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.130
 So that's the finished frankenstein 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.450
 green 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.650
 I am now here again in a 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.220
 injection bag a little help 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.220
 use 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.960
 and now I'm doing such a big one here 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.960
 stain on the capo 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.200
 and now 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.770
 prank just as smooth 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.770
 possible 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.819
 and also on 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.620
 a bit chubby 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.290
 be patient when we get together now 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.740
 Here a green hood made like that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.750
 to have 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.410
 then the hair will come next 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.600

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.720

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.080

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.170

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.959

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.780

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:57.630
