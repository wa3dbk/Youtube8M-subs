one of the rotor trim and craft cutters

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.339 
one of the rotor trim and craft cutters
just<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.939> give<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.300> deckled<00:00:27.810> edge<00:00:27.960> going

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
just to give it a deckled edge going

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.290 
just to give it a deckled edge going
across<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.740> edge<00:00:28.920> which<00:00:29.820> will<00:00:29.970> look<00:00:30.119> nice

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
across the edge which will look nice

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.299 
across the edge which will look nice
went<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> finished<00:00:31.140> stretched<00:00:31.679> items<00:00:32.099> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
went on the finished stretched items so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.680 
went on the finished stretched items so
we're<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> big<00:00:33.420> purple<00:00:33.780> ruler

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
we're going to use the big purple ruler

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.380 
we're going to use the big purple ruler
bring<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.520> few<00:00:38.520> millimeters<00:00:39.000> from<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
bring it in a few millimeters from the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.049 
bring it in a few millimeters from the
edge<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> print<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.670> idea<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
edge of the print with this the idea of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.630 
edge of the print with this the idea of
the<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.410> cutter<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.399> comes<00:00:44.579> with

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the the the cutter is that it comes with

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.010 
the the the cutter is that it comes with
various<00:00:45.120> different<00:00:45.420> wheels<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:45.870> give

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
various different wheels that will give

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
various different wheels that will give
you<00:00:46.110> different<00:00:46.260> jagged<00:00:46.739> edges<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.219> we've<00:00:48.120> got

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you different jagged edges so we've got

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.569 
you different jagged edges so we've got
it<00:00:48.360> set<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.930> holding<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> nice<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.250> firm<00:00:52.579> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it set up holding it nice and firm you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.529 
it set up holding it nice and firm you
can<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.530> just<00:00:55.530> cut<00:00:55.739> through<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.949> again

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.410 

it's<00:01:00.539> given<00:01:00.870> us<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.079> nice<00:01:01.260> deckled<00:01:02.160> edge<00:01:02.420> okay

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it's given us a nice deckled edge okay

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.789 
it's given us a nice deckled edge okay
so<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.840> show<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.170> nicely<00:01:04.379> when<00:01:04.710> we

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
so that will show up nicely when we

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.960 
so that will show up nicely when we
actually<00:01:04.920> stretch<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> around<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> wooden

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
actually stretch it around the wooden

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.030 
actually stretch it around the wooden
stretcher<00:01:06.180> frame<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> next<00:01:07.830> thing<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
stretcher frame so the next thing that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
stretcher frame so the next thing that
we<00:01:08.189> need<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.180> laminate<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> surface

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
we need to do is to laminate the surface

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.719 
we need to do is to laminate the surface
of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.409> print<00:01:10.650> you'll<00:01:11.130> notice<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.520> we're

than the print the idea for this is this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.289 
than the print the idea for this is this
actually<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.909> heat-seal<00:01:33.270> film

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
actually that this the heat-seal film

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.359 
actually that this the heat-seal film
and<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.200> canvas<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.829> stretched<00:01:35.189> around

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and the canvas will get stretched around

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
and the canvas will get stretched around
the<00:01:35.579> back<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.420> wooden<00:01:36.689> stretcher

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the first thing that we do we'll flip it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.930 
the first thing that we do we'll flip it
over<00:01:43.250> will

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
over will

going to damage the printer tool so

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.170 
going to damage the printer tool so
that's<00:02:16.000> nice<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.360> clean<00:02:16.570> we<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:18.180> take

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
that's nice and clean we can then take

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.010 
that's nice and clean we can then take
the<00:02:19.330> heat-seal<00:02:19.690> film<00:02:21.330> position<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.480> you'll

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
the heat-seal film position it you'll

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.390 
the heat-seal film position it you'll
notice<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.710> actual<00:02:23.920> heat-seal<00:02:24.340> film

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
notice that the actual heat-seal film

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.550 
notice that the actual heat-seal film
has<00:02:24.700> got<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.540> release<00:02:25.780> liner<00:02:25.990> underneath<00:02:26.200> has

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
has got the release liner underneath has

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.410 
has got the release liner underneath has
got<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.740> grid<00:02:26.980> on<00:02:27.010> there<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:27.910> helps<00:02:28.270> us

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
got a grid on there so that helps us

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.590 
got a grid on there so that helps us
line<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:29.250> where<00:02:30.250> we<00:02:30.400> need<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.700> be<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.390> we<00:02:31.480> can

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
line up where we need it to be so we can

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.390 
line up where we need it to be so we can
smooth<00:02:31.900> at<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.740> leading<00:02:32.950> edge<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.340> the

finger onto the heat-seal film you'll

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.830 
finger onto the heat-seal film you'll
notice<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.880> heat<00:02:55.090> from<00:02:55.239> my<00:02:55.330> finger

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
notice that the heat from my finger

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.660 
notice that the heat from my finger
actually<00:02:56.290> bonds<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.280> heat-seal<00:02:57.640> film

actually bonds that the heat-seal film
onto<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.150> surface<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.690> print<00:02:58.959> we<00:02:59.590> can

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
onto the surface of the print we can

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.740 
onto the surface of the print we can
then<00:03:00.780> flip<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.840> back<00:03:02.020> up<00:03:02.459> if<00:03:03.459> there<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.540> any

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
then flip it back up if there is any

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.990 
then flip it back up if there is any
creases<00:03:05.200> we<00:03:05.320> can<00:03:05.440> actually<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:06.520> can<00:03:06.670> take<00:03:06.850> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
creases we can actually you can take the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.490 
creases we can actually you can take the
remove<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> release<00:03:07.810> liner<00:03:07.959> away<00:03:08.260> at<00:03:08.350> this

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
remove the release liner away at this

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.670 
remove the release liner away at this
stage<00:03:09.750> throw<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.900> heat-seal<00:03:11.230> film<00:03:11.260> away<00:03:11.590> at

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
stage throw the heat-seal film away at

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.410 
stage throw the heat-seal film away at
this<00:03:11.800> stage<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.250> smooth<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.940> back<00:03:13.120> out<00:03:13.270> so

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
this stage and smooth it back out so

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.720 
this stage and smooth it back out so
it's<00:03:13.570> nice<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:13.750> smooth<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.980> idea<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.430> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
it's nice and smooth the idea for the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.220 
it's nice and smooth the idea for the
release<00:03:15.970> paper<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.390> stay<00:03:16.600> underneath<00:03:16.900> is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
release paper to stay underneath is

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.410 
release paper to stay underneath is
because<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.370> we've<00:03:18.519> got<00:03:18.700> quite<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.180> large

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
because that we've got quite a large

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.720 
because that we've got quite a large
border<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:19.959> heat-seal<00:03:20.350> film<00:03:20.380> not<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.370> bad<00:03:21.519> now

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
border of heat-seal film not so bad now

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.729 
border of heat-seal film not so bad now
when<00:03:22.510> there's<00:03:22.660> no<00:03:22.810> heat<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.320> product<00:03:23.650> at

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
when there's no heat on the product at

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.560 
when there's no heat on the product at
all<00:03:23.920> but<00:03:24.489> when<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.700> comes<00:03:24.940> out<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.269> press

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
all but when it comes out to the press

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.720 
all but when it comes out to the press
the<00:03:25.930> likelihood<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:27.250> heat-seal

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
the likelihood is that this heat-seal

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.009 
the likelihood is that this heat-seal
film<00:03:27.760> will<00:03:28.060> want<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.269> fold<00:03:28.480> back<00:03:28.630> over<00:03:28.930> on

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
film will want to fold back over on

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.600 
film will want to fold back over on
itself<00:03:29.290> it's<00:03:29.890> just<00:03:30.070> going<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.220> be<00:03:30.280> easier

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
itself it's just going to be easier

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.759 
itself it's just going to be easier
making<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.970> little<00:03:31.090> envelope<00:03:31.540> like<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.930> so

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
making a little envelope like this so

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.160 
making a little envelope like this so
this<00:03:32.800> is<00:03:33.040> ready<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.340> go<00:03:33.430> into<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.700> press<00:03:34.170> just

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
this is ready to go into the press just

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.479 
this is ready to go into the press just
quickly<00:03:35.380> in<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.680> press<00:03:35.890> you'll<00:03:36.100> notice<00:03:36.459> that

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
quickly in the press you'll notice that

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.890 
quickly in the press you'll notice that
we've<00:03:36.700> flipped<00:03:36.940> everything<00:03:37.120> over<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:37.750> the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
we've flipped everything over so the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.900 
we've flipped everything over so the
foam<00:03:38.110> is<00:03:38.290> now<00:03:38.410> on<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.560> top<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.550> silicone

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
foam is now on the top and the silicone

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.699 
foam is now on the top and the silicone
release<00:03:40.000> film<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.450> now<00:03:40.570> on<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.720> bottom<00:03:41.019> so

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
release film is now on the bottom so

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.110 
release film is now on the bottom so

paper prints and photographic prints a

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.130 
paper prints and photographic prints a
processed<00:05:13.490> at<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.970> start<00:05:14.270> in<00:05:14.540> exactly<00:05:15.020> the

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
processed at the start in exactly the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.409 
processed at the start in exactly the
same<00:05:15.169> way<00:05:15.350> so<00:05:15.500> they're<00:05:16.070> both<00:05:16.250> heat<00:05:16.520> sealed<00:05:16.790> but

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
same way so they're both heat sealed but

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.640 
same way so they're both heat sealed but
this<00:05:17.540> is<00:05:17.660> where<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.930> process<00:05:18.320> slightly

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
this is where the process slightly

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.470 
this is where the process slightly
changes<00:05:19.100> so<00:05:19.280> we've<00:05:19.700> got<00:05:19.850> one<00:05:19.970> heat<00:05:20.150> seen<00:05:20.360> in

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
changes so we've got one heat seen in

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.330 
changes so we've got one heat seen in
the<00:05:20.660> press<00:05:20.900> we're<00:05:21.650> going<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.860> show<00:05:22.010> you<00:05:22.070> how<00:05:22.280> to

this one off so we turn it over and
you'll<00:05:26.900> notice<00:05:27.169> that<00:05:27.350> we<00:05:27.919> need<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.100> take<00:05:28.220> off

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
you'll notice that we need to take off

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.190 
you'll notice that we need to take off
the<00:05:28.820> silicon<00:05:29.240> release<00:05:29.450> paper<00:05:29.690> that's<00:05:29.960> on<00:05:30.080> the

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
the silicon release paper that's on the

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.070 
the silicon release paper that's on the
back<00:05:30.350> of<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.560> print

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.390 

okay<00:05:35.770> fingernails<00:05:36.770> are<00:05:36.949> obviously<00:05:37.220> quite

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
okay fingernails are obviously quite

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.489 
okay fingernails are obviously quite
good<00:05:37.669> in<00:05:38.629> this<00:05:38.870> scenario

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:45.499 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:49.759 

okay<00:05:46.499> so<00:05:46.559> we<00:05:46.739> just<00:05:46.889> remove<00:05:47.879> the<00:05:48.469> silicone<00:05:49.469> back

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:49.769 
okay so we just remove the silicone back

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:52.759 
okay so we just remove the silicone back
into<00:05:49.979> the<00:05:50.069> paper<00:05:50.300> we<00:05:51.300> can<00:05:51.449> discard<00:05:51.779> that<00:05:52.019> now

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:52.769 
into the paper we can discard that now

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.979 
into the paper we can discard that now
while<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.699> picture<00:05:54.029> is<00:05:54.179> still<00:05:54.389> face<00:05:54.689> down

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:54.989 
while the picture is still face down

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:57.379 
while the picture is still face down
what<00:05:55.769> we<00:05:55.889> want<00:05:56.039> to<00:05:56.129> do<00:05:56.249> the<00:05:56.550> idea<00:05:56.669> here<00:05:57.209> is<00:05:57.239> that

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
what we want to do the idea here is that

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:58.969 
what we want to do the idea here is that
this<00:05:57.659> is<00:05:57.839> actually<00:05:58.050> going<00:05:58.319> to<00:05:58.409> go<00:05:58.469> into<00:05:58.649> a<00:05:58.739> bath

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
this is actually going to go into a bath

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.040 
this is actually going to go into a bath
of<00:05:59.189> water<00:05:59.369> which<00:05:59.639> is<00:05:59.669> the<00:05:59.939> the<00:06:00.629> bath<00:06:00.779> of<00:06:00.929> water

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
of water which is the the bath of water

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.839 
of water which is the the bath of water
that<00:06:01.229> we've<00:06:01.349> got<00:06:01.469> sat<00:06:01.679> in<00:06:01.830> front<00:06:01.979> of<00:06:02.189> us<00:06:02.249> the

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
that we've got sat in front of us the

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.209 
that we've got sat in front of us the
idea<00:06:03.149> is<00:06:03.209> that<00:06:03.419> the<00:06:03.929> actual<00:06:04.199> water<00:06:04.469> soaks<00:06:04.979> into

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
idea is that the actual water soaks into

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.279 
idea is that the actual water soaks into
the<00:06:05.339> print<00:06:05.699> and<00:06:06.479> we're<00:06:06.869> going<00:06:06.989> to<00:06:07.050> do<00:06:07.139> almost

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
the print and we're going to do almost

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.689 
the print and we're going to do almost
like<00:06:07.499> an<00:06:07.589> image<00:06:07.800> transfer<00:06:08.249> so<00:06:08.399> we're<00:06:08.519> going<00:06:08.610> to

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
like an image transfer so we're going to

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.850 
like an image transfer so we're going to
take<00:06:08.909> we're<00:06:09.719> going<00:06:09.809> to<00:06:09.869> remove<00:06:10.319> the<00:06:10.379> heat-seal

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
take we're going to remove the heat-seal

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.859 
take we're going to remove the heat-seal
film<00:06:10.919> or<00:06:11.339> the<00:06:11.519> heat<00:06:11.669> set<00:06:11.849> laminate<00:06:12.209> off<00:06:12.360> the

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:12.869 
film or the heat set laminate off the

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:14.329 
film or the heat set laminate off the
surface<00:06:13.050> of<00:06:13.319> the<00:06:13.379> print<00:06:13.619> that's<00:06:14.039> going<00:06:14.279> to

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:14.339 
surface of the print that's going to

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:15.859 
surface of the print that's going to
take<00:06:14.489> basically<00:06:14.909> that<00:06:15.059> the<00:06:15.419> top<00:06:15.659> surface

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:15.869 
take basically that the top surface

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:18.350 
take basically that the top surface
layer<00:06:16.229> of<00:06:16.379> the<00:06:16.439> print<00:06:16.649> away<00:06:16.860> with<00:06:17.009> it<00:06:17.360> what

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
layer of the print away with it what

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.309 
layer of the print away with it what
we're<00:06:18.449> going<00:06:18.539> to<00:06:18.659> do<00:06:18.719> first<00:06:18.749> is<00:06:19.139> we're<00:06:19.199> going

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
we're going to do first is we're going

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.040 
we're going to do first is we're going
to<00:06:19.379> very<00:06:19.649> lightly<00:06:20.209> PS<00:06:21.209> the<00:06:21.419> back<00:06:21.569> of<00:06:21.719> the<00:06:21.809> print

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
to very lightly PS the back of the print

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.229 
to very lightly PS the back of the print
so<00:06:22.589> that<00:06:22.769> water<00:06:22.949> will<00:06:23.219> migrate<00:06:23.429> and<00:06:23.909> absorb

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:24.239 
so that water will migrate and absorb

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:25.639 
so that water will migrate and absorb
into<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.599> fibers<00:06:24.959> of<00:06:24.989> the<00:06:25.079> paper<00:06:25.139> very

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:25.649 
into the fibers of the paper very

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:28.009 
into the fibers of the paper very
quickly<00:06:25.919> so<00:06:26.579> again<00:06:27.029> using<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:27.389> piercing<00:06:27.809> tool

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:28.019 
quickly so again using the piercing tool

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:29.929 
quickly so again using the piercing tool
but<00:06:28.619> very<00:06:28.979> very<00:06:29.099> likely<00:06:29.459> we're<00:06:29.669> not<00:06:29.759> going<00:06:29.879> to

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:29.939 
but very very likely we're not going to

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:31.429 
but very very likely we're not going to
put<00:06:30.029> any<00:06:30.149> pressure<00:06:30.329> on<00:06:30.539> this<00:06:30.719> at<00:06:30.899> all<00:06:31.050> I'm

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:31.439 
put any pressure on this at all I'm

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:35.540 
put any pressure on this at all I'm
basically<00:06:31.949> just<00:06:32.189> gonna<00:06:33.949> allow<00:06:34.949> the<00:06:35.009> piercing

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
basically just gonna allow the piercing

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.430 
basically just gonna allow the piercing
tool<00:06:36.769> just<00:06:37.769> to<00:06:37.889> go<00:06:38.039> over<00:06:38.069> the<00:06:38.399> surface

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
tool just to go over the surface

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.040 
tool just to go over the surface
other<00:06:41.440> paper<00:06:41.740> listen<00:06:42.370> I<00:06:42.430> really<00:06:42.930> give<00:06:43.930> it<00:06:44.020> a

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
other paper listen I really give it a

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.770 
other paper listen I really give it a
good<00:06:44.200> Pearson<00:06:44.680> over<00:06:46.440> over<00:06:47.440> the<00:06:47.530> back<00:06:47.710> there

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
good Pearson over over the back there

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.950 
good Pearson over over the back there
okay<00:06:51.180> as<00:06:52.180> long<00:06:52.270> as<00:06:52.420> you're<00:06:52.510> not<00:06:52.540> putting<00:06:52.780> any

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
okay as long as you're not putting any

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.540 
okay as long as you're not putting any
pressure<00:06:53.020> on<00:06:53.410> there<00:06:53.680> nothing's<00:06:54.310> going<00:06:54.490> to

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
pressure on there nothing's going to

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.400 
pressure on there nothing's going to
start<00:06:54.760> showing<00:06:55.060> through<00:06:55.240> at<00:06:55.360> the<00:06:55.450> front<00:06:55.690> okay

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
start showing through at the front okay

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.350 
start showing through at the front okay
so<00:06:56.470> that's<00:06:56.710> nicely<00:06:57.460> pierced<00:06:57.970> it's<00:06:58.120> got<00:06:58.240> all

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
so that's nicely pierced it's got all

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.000 
so that's nicely pierced it's got all
little<00:06:58.600> holes<00:06:58.780> in<00:06:58.990> the<00:06:59.050> back<00:06:59.230> what<00:06:59.920> we're

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
little holes in the back what we're

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.520 
little holes in the back what we're
going<00:07:00.100> to<00:07:00.190> do<00:07:00.310> is<00:07:00.430> put<00:07:00.640> this<00:07:00.760> into<00:07:00.970> the<00:07:01.530> the

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
going to do is put this into the the

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:09.270 
going to do is put this into the the
tray<00:07:02.860> and<00:07:03.780> allow<00:07:04.780> it<00:07:04.930> to<00:07:05.430> soak<00:07:06.430> in<00:07:07.110> okay<00:07:08.280> just

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
tray and allow it to soak in okay just

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.880 
tray and allow it to soak in okay just
pop<00:07:09.520> up<00:07:09.700> push<00:07:09.940> that<00:07:10.090> down<00:07:10.300> and<00:07:10.620> you'll<00:07:11.620> notice

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:11.890 
pop up push that down and you'll notice

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.250 
pop up push that down and you'll notice
straightaway<00:07:12.310> that<00:07:13.240> the<00:07:13.330> water<00:07:13.540> is<00:07:13.690> flooding

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260 
straightaway that the water is flooding

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.740 
straightaway that the water is flooding
into<00:07:14.410> those<00:07:14.530> holes<00:07:15.180> and<00:07:16.180> if<00:07:16.330> you've<00:07:16.450> pierced

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
into those holes and if you've pierced

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.480 
into those holes and if you've pierced
it<00:07:16.960> well<00:07:17.470> enough<00:07:17.710> that's<00:07:17.980> probably<00:07:18.280> going<00:07:18.400> to

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
it well enough that's probably going to

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.490 
it well enough that's probably going to
take<00:07:18.669> right<00:07:19.270> about<00:07:19.450> five<00:07:19.720> or<00:07:19.900> ten<00:07:20.110> minutes<00:07:20.140> in

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
take right about five or ten minutes in

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.670 
take right about five or ten minutes in
the<00:07:20.620> water<00:07:21.450> okay<00:07:22.450> well<00:07:22.690> go<00:07:23.169> over<00:07:23.200> onto<00:07:23.650> the

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 
the water okay well go over onto the

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.030 
the water okay well go over onto the
photographic<00:07:24.250> print<00:07:24.460> walnuts<00:07:24.760> okay
