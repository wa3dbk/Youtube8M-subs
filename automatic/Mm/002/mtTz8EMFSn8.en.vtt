you some tips and tricks on how to build
your<00:00:15.599> own<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.260> you're<00:00:16.410> looking<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.010> is

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
your own what you're looking at here is

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.820 
your own what you're looking at here is
what<00:00:17.880> was<00:00:18.510> originally<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:19.140> garage<00:00:19.470> door<00:00:19.770> opener

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
what was originally a garage door opener

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.179 
what was originally a garage door opener
motor<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.529> removed<00:00:22.980> all

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
motor and when I got this I removed all

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.060 
motor and when I got this I removed all
the<00:00:23.250> circuitry<00:00:24.029> boards<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.960> wiring<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.800> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the circuitry boards and wiring and I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.370 
the circuitry boards and wiring and I
even<00:00:26.550> remove<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> old<00:00:27.300> capacitor<00:00:27.960> because

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
even remove the old capacitor because

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.009 
even remove the old capacitor because
it's<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.800> really<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.250> necessary<00:00:30.019> but

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
it's just really not necessary but

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.190 
it's just really not necessary but
anyways<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:33.149> does<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.870> motor

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
anyways what this does is this motor

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.889 
anyways what this does is this motor
moves<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.980> big<00:00:35.219> pulley<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.880> then<00:00:36.570> this

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
moves this big pulley and then this

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.229 
moves this big pulley and then this
pulley<00:00:37.230> goes<00:00:37.800> down<00:00:38.129> through<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> shaft<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
pulley goes down through a shaft and

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.209 
pulley goes down through a shaft and
actually<00:00:39.629> underneath<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> little

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
actually underneath this is a little

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.840 
actually underneath this is a little
sprocket<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.899> sprocket<00:00:43.530> moves<00:00:44.430> this

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
sprocket and that sprocket moves this

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.950 
sprocket and that sprocket moves this
big<00:00:45.300> chain<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.300> then<00:00:48.300> here's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
big chain which you see and then here's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
big chain which you see and then here's
my<00:00:49.170> little<00:00:49.379> tightener<00:00:50.510> sprocket<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.600> made<00:00:51.840> with

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
my little tightener sprocket I made with

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.709 
my little tightener sprocket I made with
a<00:00:52.129> spring<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> keep<00:00:54.149> tension<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
a spring on it just to keep tension on

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.540 
a spring on it just to keep tension on
the<00:00:54.780> chain<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.980> anyways<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:57.030> chain<00:00:58.010> goes<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the chain but anyways this chain goes to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.729 
the chain but anyways this chain goes to
this<00:00:59.820> bicycle<00:01:00.510> center<00:01:01.050> piece<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
this bicycle center piece what you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.119 
this bicycle center piece what you
actually<00:01:01.920> pedal<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.199> is<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.949> does

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
actually pedal on and is what that does

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.300 
actually pedal on and is what that does
is<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.549> chain<00:01:05.970> turns<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.799> this<00:01:07.799> arm<00:01:08.159> that

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
is as the chain turns this this arm that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.490 
is as the chain turns this this arm that
used<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.939> connected<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> pedal<00:01:09.990> moves

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
used to be connected to the pedal moves

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.880 
used to be connected to the pedal moves
around<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.520> around<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.540> what<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.409> does<00:01:13.650> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
around and around as what that does is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.060 
around and around as what that does is
that<00:01:13.950> pushes<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:16.530> crushing

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that pushes in and out this crushing

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.399 
that pushes in and out this crushing
piston<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:18.180> basically<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.930> crushes

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
piston and that's basically what crushes

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.969 
piston and that's basically what crushes
the<00:01:19.560> cans<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:21.020> really<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.140> pretty<00:01:22.350> simple

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the cans and really it's pretty simple

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.120 
the cans and really it's pretty simple
it<00:01:23.250> works<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.820> good<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> only

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it works really good and the only

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850 
it works really good and the only
problem<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.580> had<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> originally<00:01:28.680> got

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
problem I had was when I originally got

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.090 
problem I had was when I originally got
this<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.939> garage<00:01:30.570> door<00:01:31.020> opener<00:01:31.409> motor<00:01:31.650> had<00:01:31.950> an

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
this the garage door opener motor had an

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.649 
this the garage door opener motor had an
instant<00:01:32.640> reverse<00:01:33.470> setting<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:35.630> capability<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
instant reverse setting or capability I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.710 
instant reverse setting or capability I
guess<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.200> would<00:01:37.320> call<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.430> whenever<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
guess you would call it that whenever it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
guess you would call it that whenever it
got<00:01:39.990> under<00:01:40.320> tension<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.670> actually

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
got under tension it would actually

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.359 
got under tension it would actually
instant<00:01:42.509> reverse<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.649> course<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
instant reverse and of course this is a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.480 
instant reverse and of course this is a
big<00:01:44.640> problem<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.799> every<00:01:46.799> time<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.340> would

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
big problem because every time it would

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.010 
big problem because every time it would
start<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> cross<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.810> would<00:01:48.899> in

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
start to cross the can it would in

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.210 
start to cross the can it would in
servers<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.880> had<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:53.009> motor

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
servers so that had to go and the motor

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760 
servers so that had to go and the motor
I<00:01:53.310> currently<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.270> here<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.079> fan<00:01:55.409> for

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
I currently have on here and the fan for

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.069 
I currently have on here and the fan for
a<00:01:55.799> furnace<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.570> works<00:01:57.960> really

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
a furnace but it actually works really

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.959 
a furnace but it actually works really
good<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> doesn't<00:01:59.729> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
good because of course it doesn't in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.999 
good because of course it doesn't in
Traverse<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.200> means<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.829> can

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
Traverse and that means that it can

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.300 
Traverse and that means that it can
actually<00:02:02.640> crush<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.560> but<00:02:04.560> ever<00:02:04.829> since<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
actually crush the can but ever since I

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910 
actually crush the can but ever since I
replaced<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.969> motor<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.750> been<00:02:07.380> working

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
replaced this motor it's been working

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.190 
replaced this motor it's been working
really<00:02:08.129> good<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.479> pull<00:02:09.660> those<00:02:09.810> switch

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
really good and I just pull those switch

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.430 
really good and I just pull those switch
and<00:02:10.440> hit<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:10.920> about<00:02:11.220> it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
and hit that's about it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.850 
and hit that's about it
hopefully<00:02:13.440> this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
hopefully this
