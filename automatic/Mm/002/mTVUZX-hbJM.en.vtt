Wireless easy transfers now there's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
Wireless easy transfers now there's
still<00:01:12.840> whatever<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.220> connects

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
still whatever here it actually connects

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.980 
still whatever here it actually connects
a<00:01:14.670> battery<00:01:14.970> pack<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.509> gives<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> few

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
a battery pack which gives you a few

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
a battery pack which gives you a few
hours<00:01:16.020> worth<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.650> endurance<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.820> still<00:01:18.030> needs

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
hours worth of endurance but still needs

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.179 
hours worth of endurance but still needs
a<00:01:18.540> connection<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> power<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
a connection to get the power from the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.340 
a connection to get the power from the
battery<00:01:20.490> onto<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.900> also<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.259> have

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
battery onto here you also don't have

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.800 
battery onto here you also don't have
audio<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.000> why<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.390> two<00:01:24.570> cables

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
audio so this is why we have two cables

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.499 
audio so this is why we have two cables
connected<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> set<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.030> for

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
