of not he said I had a head gasket
problem<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.950> he<00:01:07.950> let<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> sit<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:08.670> it

problem and he let it sit and then it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.870 
problem and he let it sit and then it
wouldn't<00:01:09.060> start<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:10.290> don't<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.820> he

obviously<00:01:14.070> its<00:01:14.460> right-hand<00:01:14.760> drive<00:01:14.939> because

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
obviously its right-hand drive because

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
obviously its right-hand drive because
they<00:01:15.299> didn't<00:01:15.479> make<00:01:15.540> any<00:01:15.720> left-hand<00:01:16.049> Drive<00:01:16.229> r30

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
they didn't make any left-hand Drive r30

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.390 
they didn't make any left-hand Drive r30
force<00:01:18.439> I'm<00:01:19.439> kind<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.770> wondering<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> could

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
force I'm kind of wondering if you could

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.469 
force I'm kind of wondering if you could
convert<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> somehow<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.689> maybe<00:01:23.330> cut<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
convert it somehow like maybe cut the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
convert it somehow like maybe cut the
bottom<00:01:24.780> end<00:01:24.960> off<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:27.439> like<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.650> cut<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
bottom end off of like you know cut the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.630 
bottom end off of like you know cut the
hole<00:01:29.280> cut<00:01:29.670> everything<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> frame<00:01:30.600> up

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.770 

everything<00:01:35.640> from<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> frame<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.540> like

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
everything from the frame up and like

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.109 
everything from the frame up and like
put<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> Maxima<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.579> technically<00:01:38.970> it's

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
put it on a Maxima and technically it's

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.510 
put it on a Maxima and technically it's
a<00:01:39.180> Maxima<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.680> Maxima<00:01:41.100> engine<00:01:41.400> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a Maxima but then the Maxima engine is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.730 
a Maxima but then the Maxima engine is
mounted

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
mounted

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.300

newly<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.939> could<00:01:48.090> say<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.420> right<00:01:48.630> where

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
newly if I could say that right where

newly if I could say that right where
it's<00:01:49.259> mounted<00:01:49.590> sideways<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:53.189> engine<00:01:53.520> is

it's mounted sideways this engine is
longitudinally<00:01:54.299> mounted<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.049> long<00:01:55.229> ways

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
longitudinally mounted so it's long ways

rear wheel drive that would be a that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120 
rear wheel drive that would be a that
would<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.820> issue<00:02:00.110> but<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> could<00:02:01.950> put

would be an issue but if you could put

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
would be an issue but if you could put

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
it on that frame I'm kind of wondering

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719 
it on that frame I'm kind of wondering
if<00:02:04.110> that's<00:02:04.259> possible<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:04.920> pull<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
if that's possible or just pull like the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.930 
if that's possible or just pull like the
Maxima<00:02:06.180> -<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.630> firewall

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
Maxima - and firewall

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.030 
Maxima - and firewall
and<00:02:08.030> cut<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.479> weld<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.110> don't<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:09.950> if

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
and cut and weld it in I don't know if

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.260 
and cut and weld it in I don't know if
the<00:02:10.130> curve<00:02:10.310> would<00:02:10.460> line<00:02:10.940> up<00:02:11.090> with<00:02:11.210> the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
the curve would line up with the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.300 
the curve would line up with the
windshield<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:12.680> mean<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:12.920> way<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.100> can

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
windshield but I mean that way you can

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.040 
windshield but I mean that way you can
use<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.550> airbag<00:02:13.850> system<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.510> all<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.600> stuff

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
use the airbag system and all that stuff

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.300 
use the airbag system and all that stuff
