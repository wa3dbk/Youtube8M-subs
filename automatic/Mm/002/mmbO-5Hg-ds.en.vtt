the second time we've told me that this

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.890 
the second time we've told me that this
is<00:03:42.210> much<00:03:42.390> about<00:03:42.570> me<00:03:42.780> as<00:03:42.990> it<00:03:43.110> as<00:03:43.230> William<00:03:43.530> I

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
is much about me as it as William I

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:59.240 
is much about me as it as William I
broke<00:03:45.900> up<00:03:45.990> with<00:03:46.050> him<00:03:46.260> today<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:47.840> did<00:03:48.890> yeah

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.740 

I<00:03:59.280> thought<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.000> only<00:04:00.060> reason<00:04:00.330> when<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.480> he<00:04:00.660> was

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
I thought the only reason when I he was

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.990 
I thought the only reason when I he was
with<00:04:00.870> me<00:04:01.020> was<00:04:01.170> because<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.530> baby<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.790> he

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
with me was because the baby and that he

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.570 
with me was because the baby and that he
never<00:04:03.150> really<00:04:03.360> loved<00:04:03.540> me

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.990 

yeah<00:04:07.120> we<00:04:07.240> all<00:04:07.360> thought<00:04:07.540> that

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.940 

but<00:04:10.570> when<00:04:10.690> he<00:04:10.780> came<00:04:10.930> by<00:04:11.080> today<00:04:11.260> he<00:04:11.500> told<00:04:11.800> me

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
but when he came by today he told me

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.360 
but when he came by today he told me
that<00:04:12.130> he<00:04:12.280> didn't<00:04:12.520> wanna<00:04:12.670> break<00:04:12.820> up

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
that he didn't wanna break up

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.590 
that he didn't wanna break up
probably<00:04:15.060> skill<00:04:15.300> talking<00:04:15.500> maybe<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:17.600> don't

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
probably skill talking maybe I don't

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.000 
probably skill talking maybe I don't
think<00:04:18.750> so

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
think so

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.400 
think so
you<00:04:20.580> think<00:04:20.790> he<00:04:20.880> loved<00:04:21.060> you

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.720 

I<00:04:24.440> think<00:04:25.100> he<00:04:25.160> was<00:04:25.250> willing<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.490> try<00:04:25.640> the

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
I think he was willing to try the

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.290 
I think he was willing to try the
relationship<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:27.850> think<00:04:28.850> he<00:04:28.970> really<00:04:29.150> liked

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
relationship and I think he really liked

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.200 
relationship and I think he really liked
the<00:04:29.420> idea<00:04:29.660> of<00:04:29.720> being<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:30.020> father
