on<00:01:30.930> their<00:01:31.170> own<00:01:31.700> okay<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.759> I've<00:01:33.060> completed<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
on their own okay so I've completed the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.060 
on their own okay so I've completed the
front<00:01:34.650> part<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.310> Derek's<00:01:36.060> rack<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:37.040> what<00:01:38.040> I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
front part of Derek's rack and what I

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.480 
front part of Derek's rack and what I
used<00:01:38.430> was<00:01:38.930> -<00:01:39.930> 36<00:01:40.500> inch<00:01:40.680> curved<00:01:40.920> bars<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
used was - 36 inch curved bars for the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.350 
used was - 36 inch curved bars for the
verticals<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.210> SC<00:01:42.570> GPR<00:01:43.140> 36<00:01:43.649> C<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.880> used<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
verticals the SC GPR 36 C and I used a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.289 
verticals the SC GPR 36 C and I used a
40<00:01:45.810> 40<00:01:46.439> inch<00:01:46.590> curved<00:01:46.860> bar<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> horizontal

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
40 40 inch curved bar for the horizontal

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.679 
40 40 inch curved bar for the horizontal
the<00:01:48.600> SC<00:01:49.020> GPR<00:01:49.619> 40<00:01:50.009> C<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.509> connected

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the SC GPR 40 C and I just connected

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.280 
the SC GPR 40 C and I just connected
them<00:01:51.930> together<00:01:52.640> with<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.899> Crone<00:01:55.140> right

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
them together with the the Crone right

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.679 
them together with the the Crone right
angle<00:01:55.530> clamp<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> SC<00:01:56.490> gr<00:01:56.820> SCRA

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
angle clamp that we have the SC gr SCRA

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.399 
angle clamp that we have the SC gr SCRA
and<00:01:58.320> how<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> got<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.700> angle<00:02:00.200> was<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> just

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
and how I got that angle was that I just

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.030 
and how I got that angle was that I just
took<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.860> normal<00:02:02.189> T<00:02:02.369> leg<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.770> clamp

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
took the normal T leg and the clamp

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.580 
took the normal T leg and the clamp
makes<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.030> where<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.320> clamshell

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
makes it to where it's it's a clamshell

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.279 
makes it to where it's it's a clamshell
so<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.459> swivel<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.450> left<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.869> right<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
so you can swivel it left and right and

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.869 
so you can swivel it left and right and
all<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> did<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:10.920> swivel<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
all I did was just swivel it to the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.860 
all I did was just swivel it to the
outside<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.440> comedy

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
outside so what a comedy

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.600 
outside so what a comedy
this<00:02:14.019> tube<00:02:14.230> going<00:02:14.530> straight<00:02:14.830> up<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.190> by<00:02:15.580> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
this tube going straight up and by the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.940 
this tube going straight up and by the
time<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.030> curve<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:17.230> know<00:02:17.349> gets<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.739> very

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
time the curve you know gets to the very

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.309 
time the curve you know gets to the very
end<00:02:18.099> of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.700> tube<00:02:18.910> it's<00:02:19.750> straight<00:02:20.050> up<00:02:20.170> and

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
end of the the tube it's straight up and

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.190 
end of the the tube it's straight up and
down<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.819> gives<00:02:21.940> us<00:02:22.150> kind<00:02:22.629> of<00:02:22.750> Boeing

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
down and it gives us kind of Boeing

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.119 
down and it gives us kind of Boeing
effect<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.780> what<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.810> did<00:02:26.080> was<00:02:26.349> have<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> look

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
effect and what I did was have a look

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.009 
effect and what I did was have a look
very<00:02:27.340> closely<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:27.819> will<00:02:28.030> really<00:02:28.390> kick<00:02:28.870> you

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
very closely this will really kick you

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.990 
very closely this will really kick you
in<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.140> ass<00:02:29.230> later<00:02:29.680> if<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.459> don't<00:02:30.640> do<00:02:30.790> this

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
in the ass later if you don't do this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.539 
in the ass later if you don't do this
while<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.900> are<00:02:32.019> building<00:02:32.260> your<00:02:32.769> rack<00:02:33.250> make

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
while you are building your rack make

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.580 
while you are building your rack make
sure<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.000> put<00:02:34.599> all<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.840> memory<00:02:35.110> locks<00:02:35.319> on<00:02:35.560> it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
sure you put all the memory locks on it

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.170 
sure you put all the memory locks on it
that<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.980> are<00:02:36.069> going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.549> need<00:02:36.790> for<00:02:37.060> that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
that you are going to need for that

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.300 
that you are going to need for that
particular<00:02:37.390> tube<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.140> know<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.950> I'm<00:02:39.040> going<00:02:39.220> to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
particular tube I know that I'm going to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.780 
particular tube I know that I'm going to
add<00:02:39.489> another<00:02:40.799> right<00:02:41.799> angle<00:02:42.040> clamp<00:02:42.069> right

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
add another right angle clamp right

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.729 
add another right angle clamp right
underneath<00:02:43.030> there<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.360> connect<00:02:43.720> each<00:02:44.410> side

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
underneath there to connect each side

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.949 
underneath there to connect each side
too<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.640> added<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.680> third<00:02:48.569> memory<00:02:49.569> lock<00:02:49.750> on

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
too so I added a third memory lock on

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.420 
too so I added a third memory lock on
there<00:02:50.200> already<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.829> accommodate<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.370> I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
there already to accommodate that I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.309 
there already to accommodate that I
can't<00:02:51.730> tell<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.000> how<00:02:52.120> many<00:02:52.180> times<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:53.230> when

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
can't tell you how many times that when

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.120 
can't tell you how many times that when
I<00:02:53.380> first<00:02:53.560> started<00:02:53.890> doing<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:56.130> forgot

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
I first started doing this it I forgot

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.460 
I first started doing this it I forgot
to<00:02:57.280> put<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:58.390> memory<00:02:58.540> lock<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:59.019> there<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.379> I

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
to put the memory lock on there and I

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.410 
to put the memory lock on there and I
had<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.680> pull<00:02:59.860> everything<00:03:00.129> apart<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.910> redo<00:03:01.239> it

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
had to pull everything apart and redo it

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.360 
had to pull everything apart and redo it
all<00:03:01.629> it<00:03:01.780> was<00:03:01.900> very<00:03:01.959> annoying<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:02.739> this<00:03:03.220> will

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
all it was very annoying so this will

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.360 
all it was very annoying so this will
save<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.730> lot<00:03:03.849> of<00:03:03.910> time<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:05.010> what<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.040> did

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
save you a lot of time and what I did

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.170 
save you a lot of time and what I did
was<00:03:06.849> I<00:03:06.970> also<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.870> measured<00:03:08.709> all<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.790> difference

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
was I also I measured all the difference

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.509 
was I also I measured all the difference
the<00:03:10.930> distance<00:03:11.319> between<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.920> top<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.430> that

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
the distance between the top and that

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.150 
the distance between the top and that
clamp<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:14.079> same<00:03:14.290> for<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.650> side<00:03:14.920> and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
clamp and the same for this side and

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.780 
clamp and the same for this side and
then<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:16.090> had<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.140> put<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.620> level<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.400> make<00:03:18.579> sure

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
then I had to put a level and make sure

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.789 
then I had to put a level and make sure
that<00:03:19.030> there<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.930> was<00:03:20.049> level<00:03:20.350> in<00:03:20.440> all<00:03:20.560> three

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
that there it was level in all three

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.470 
that there it was level in all three
points<00:03:21.010> because<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:21.579> is<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.700> curved<00:03:21.970> bar

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
points because this is a curved bar

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.430 
points because this is a curved bar
it<00:03:22.989> may<00:03:23.230> be<00:03:23.290> level<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.859> middle<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.790> it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
it may be level in the middle but it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.690 
it may be level in the middle but it
might<00:03:26.440> not<00:03:26.470> be<00:03:26.650> level<00:03:27.040> on<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.280> outsides

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
might not be level on the outsides

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.699 
might not be level on the outsides
because<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.930> know<00:03:29.049> if<00:03:29.109> the<00:03:29.230> curved<00:03:29.440> bar<00:03:29.620> is

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
because you know if the curved bar is

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.960 
because you know if the curved bar is
not<00:03:29.950> exactly<00:03:30.310> like<00:03:30.489> laying<00:03:30.700> on<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.819> flat

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
not exactly like laying on a flat

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.940 
not exactly like laying on a flat
surface<00:03:31.239> it's<00:03:32.079> not<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.560> be<00:03:32.620> level<00:03:32.859> in

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
surface it's not going to be level in

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.800 
surface it's not going to be level in
all<00:03:33.040> three<00:03:33.250> spots<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.209> order<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.420> keep<00:03:34.630> your

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
all three spots so in order to keep your

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.050 
all three spots so in order to keep your
rack<00:03:34.989> from<00:03:35.170> bowing<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.769> weird<00:03:35.980> directions<00:03:36.069> you

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
rack from bowing in weird directions you

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.150 
rack from bowing in weird directions you
need<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.420> make<00:03:37.569> sure<00:03:37.599> it<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.170> level<00:03:38.349> in<00:03:38.650> every

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
need to make sure it is level in every

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.420 
need to make sure it is level in every
single<00:03:39.510> place<00:03:40.510> on<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:40.870> bar<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:44.099> have<00:03:45.099> finished

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430

used was a 24 inch curved tube the SC

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.059 
used was a 24 inch curved tube the SC
GPR<00:04:05.230> 24<00:04:05.680> C<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.669> used<00:04:06.970> our<00:04:07.569> Chrome<00:04:08.530> mini<00:04:08.799> T

GPR 24 C and I used our Chrome mini T

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.240 
GPR 24 C and I used our Chrome mini T
leg<00:04:09.340> but<00:04:10.000> what<00:04:10.329> I<00:04:10.359> had<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.780> do<00:04:10.959> was<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.680> had<00:04:11.980> to

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
leg but what I had to do was I had to

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.039 
leg but what I had to do was I had to
remove<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.569> actual

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
remove the actual

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.050 
remove the actual
T<00:04:14.680> leg<00:04:14.859> clamp<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.519> add<00:04:15.819> our<00:04:17.820> adjustable<00:04:18.820> right

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
T leg clamp and add our adjustable right

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.260 
T leg clamp and add our adjustable right
angle<00:04:19.359> clamp<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.590> could<00:04:20.889> get<00:04:21.039> this<00:04:21.190> angle<00:04:21.700> I

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
angle clamp so I could get this angle I

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.610 
angle clamp so I could get this angle I
wanted<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:23.080> do<00:04:23.200> something<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.590> little

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
wanted to do something a little

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.670 
wanted to do something a little
different<00:04:24.159> for<00:04:24.310> Derek<00:04:24.640> to<00:04:25.210> stand<00:04:25.780> out<00:04:25.960> from<00:04:25.990> a

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
different for Derek to stand out from a

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.750 
different for Derek to stand out from a
lot<00:04:27.130> of<00:04:27.190> other<00:04:27.370> place

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
lot of other place

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.830 
lot of other place
Aires<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.420> I<00:04:29.070> made<00:04:30.070> this<00:04:30.330> teal<00:04:31.330> egg<00:04:31.480> curved

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
Aires so I made this teal egg curved

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.440 
Aires so I made this teal egg curved
inward<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.470> then<00:04:32.590> back<00:04:32.830> out<00:04:33.040> so<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:33.970> needed<00:04:34.330> to

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
inward and then back out so I needed to

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.470 
inward and then back out so I needed to
use<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.870> SC<00:04:35.200> g<00:04:35.410> RS<00:04:35.680> CA<00:04:36.100> RA<00:04:36.550> in<00:04:36.940> order<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.330> do

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
use the SC g RS CA RA in order to do

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.350 
use the SC g RS CA RA in order to do
that<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:39.190> added<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:41.100> front<00:04:42.100> T<00:04:42.280> leg<00:04:42.520> right

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
that and I added a front T leg right

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.170 
that and I added a front T leg right
here<00:04:43.390> it's<00:04:43.840> curved<00:04:44.230> it's<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.950> 36<00:04:45.370> inch<00:04:45.580> curved

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
here it's curved it's a 36 inch curved

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.730 
here it's curved it's a 36 inch curved
bar<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.600> did<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.840> exact<00:04:47.110> same<00:04:47.140> thing<00:04:47.560> with

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
bar and I did the exact same thing with

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.730 
bar and I did the exact same thing with
this<00:04:48.480> foot<00:04:49.480> as<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:49.870> did<00:04:50.050> with<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.320> back<00:04:50.470> foot

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
this foot as I did with the back foot

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.540 
this foot as I did with the back foot
had<00:04:51.700> a<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.970> SC<00:04:52.360> g<00:04:52.600> RS<00:04:52.900> CA<00:04:53.380> ra<00:04:53.830> onto<00:04:54.310> it<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.520> I

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
had a the SC g RS CA ra onto it and I

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.360 
had a the SC g RS CA ra onto it and I
was<00:04:54.700> just<00:04:54.730> able<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.120> get<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.420> angle<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:56.370> this

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
was just able to get that angle so this

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.940 
was just able to get that angle so this
this<00:04:57.790> whole<00:04:58.000> side<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.510> can<00:04:58.660> disconnect<00:04:59.020> from

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
this whole side you can disconnect from

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.610 
this whole side you can disconnect from
right<00:05:00.190> here<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.700> then<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:02.050> like<00:05:02.320> its<00:05:02.530> own

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
right here and then this is like its own

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.050 
right here and then this is like its own
little<00:05:02.680> side<00:05:03.130> rack<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.520> it'll<00:05:03.670> stand<00:05:03.910> by

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
little side rack and it'll stand by

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.370 
little side rack and it'll stand by
itself<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:05.550> what<00:05:06.550> I'm<00:05:06.640> gonna<00:05:06.760> do<00:05:07.030> is<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.870> am

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
itself so what I'm gonna do is I am

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.160 
itself so what I'm gonna do is I am
going<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:09.000> build<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.270> other<00:05:10.420> side<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.930> it<00:05:11.050> and

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
going to build the other side of it and

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.900 
going to build the other side of it and
I'll<00:05:11.950> show<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.160> what<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.520> whole<00:05:12.670> thing<00:05:12.880> looks

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
I'll show you what the whole thing looks

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.040 
I'll show you what the whole thing looks
like<00:05:13.150> once<00:05:13.480> that's<00:05:13.660> done<00:05:15.330> okay<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:16.390> now<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:16.750> have

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
I did was just mirror the left side now

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.710 
I did was just mirror the left side now
as<00:05:26.350> you<00:05:26.470> can<00:05:26.590> see<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:27.010> front<00:05:27.280> of<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:28.540> rack

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
as you can see the front of the rack

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
adding these T legs in front gives that

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.870 
adding these T legs in front gives that
that<00:05:41.830> side<00:05:42.070> of<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.250> rack<00:05:42.400> much<00:05:42.670> more

stability<00:05:43.090> you<00:05:43.620> don't<00:05:44.620> really<00:05:44.830> need<00:05:45.070> them<00:05:45.250> but

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
stability you don't really need them but

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.130 
stability you don't really need them but
it<00:05:45.730> does<00:05:45.940> add<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.270> little<00:05:46.510> bit<00:05:46.720> more<00:05:46.750> stability

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
it does add a little bit more stability

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.460 
it does add a little bit more stability
and<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:47.950> just<00:05:48.220> adds<00:05:48.640> a<00:05:48.790> cool<00:05:49.000> effect<00:05:49.470> so

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
and it just adds a cool effect so

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.170
