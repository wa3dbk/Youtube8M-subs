been taking the art world by storm I

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.330 
been taking the art world by storm I
wanted<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.699> see<00:00:46.940> if<00:00:47.059> it<00:00:47.210> could<00:00:47.660> be<00:00:47.720> done

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
wanted to see if it could be done

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.100 
wanted to see if it could be done
exhibiting<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.430> rain<00:00:49.640> cloud<00:00:49.910> that<00:00:50.090> idea<00:00:50.570> like

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
exhibiting a rain cloud that idea like

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.600 
exhibiting a rain cloud that idea like
walking<00:00:51.500> in<00:00:51.620> an<00:00:51.710> empty<00:00:51.949> Hall<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:52.309> it<00:00:52.400> would<00:00:52.489> be

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
walking in an empty Hall and it would be

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.840 
walking in an empty Hall and it would be
just<00:00:52.640> be<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:53.030> rain<00:00:53.809> cloud<00:00:53.960> there<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:55.100> no<00:00:55.309> art<00:00:55.580> or

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
just be a rain cloud there and no art or

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.599 
just be a rain cloud there and no art or
anything<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:56.480> just<00:00:56.870> that

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
anything but just that

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.599 
anything but just that
I<00:00:58.640> use<00:00:59.269> a<00:00:59.300> smoke<00:00:59.690> machine<00:00:59.839> and<00:01:00.289> I<00:01:00.800> can't<00:01:01.280> change

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
I use a smoke machine and I can't change

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.149 
I use a smoke machine and I can't change
the<00:01:01.820> space<00:01:02.089> of<00:01:02.269> it<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:02.600> make<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.899> space<00:01:03.170> damp

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
the space of it so I make the space damp

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.850 
the space of it so I make the space damp
wet<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.030> here<00:01:05.509> you<00:01:05.630> can<00:01:05.810> see<00:01:05.990> I<00:01:06.020> taped<00:01:06.649> down

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
wet and here you can see I taped down

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.200 
wet and here you can see I taped down
the<00:01:07.159> fence<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:09.770> reduce<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.250> air<00:01:10.399> going<00:01:11.149> around

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
the fence to reduce the air going around

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.350 
the fence to reduce the air going around
one<00:01:14.210> less<00:01:14.479> thing<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.810> air<00:01:14.990> now<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.470> basically

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
one less thing the air now and basically

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.870 
one less thing the air now and basically
the<00:01:17.360> moist<00:01:17.899> will<00:01:18.680> stick<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.220> smoke<00:01:19.520> making

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
the moist will stick to the smoke making

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.330 
the moist will stick to the smoke making
it<00:01:20.119> heavier<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:21.140> therefore<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.560> can<00:01:21.860> kind<00:01:22.220> of

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
it heavier and therefore I can kind of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.419 
it heavier and therefore I can kind of
shape<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.090> form<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.450> cloud<00:01:23.659> a<00:01:23.899> bit<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.399> I

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
shape and form the cloud a bit and so I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.969 
shape and form the cloud a bit and so I
hope<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:25.909> will<00:01:26.090> well<00:01:26.630> once<00:01:27.380> position<00:01:27.860> is

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
hope that it will well once position is

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.219 
hope that it will well once position is
somewhere<00:01:28.280> here<00:01:28.509> so<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.630> smoke<00:01:29.869> will<00:01:30.049> bump

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
somewhere here so the smoke will bump

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:30.969 
somewhere here so the smoke will bump
into<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.649> water

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
into the water

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.880 
into the water
some<00:01:31.940> kind<00:01:32.179> of<00:01:32.240> magic<00:01:32.420> spray<00:01:32.929> then<00:01:33.200> no<00:01:33.740> it's

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
some kind of magic spray then no it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.639 
some kind of magic spray then no it's
just<00:01:34.130> water<00:01:34.399> magic<00:01:34.909> water<00:01:35.270> now<00:01:35.960> at<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.319> small

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
just water magic water now at the small

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.680 
just water magic water now at the small
droplets<00:01:37.039> it<00:01:37.280> has<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.970> be<00:01:38.060> cold<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.479> damp

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
droplets it has to be cold and damp

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.590 
droplets it has to be cold and damp
really<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:39.770> really<00:01:39.979> wet<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.250> that<00:01:40.520> helps<00:01:41.390> so

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
really and really wet and that helps so

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:53.679 
really and really wet and that helps so
I'm<00:01:41.810> watching<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.500> as<00:01:42.670> much<00:01:43.670> as<00:01:43.850> possible

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.090 

by<00:01:54.689> moist<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> air<00:01:55.289> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.649> watch<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
by moist in the air you can watch you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.710 
by moist in the air you can watch you
can<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.700> keep<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.939> together<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.270> bit<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
can you can keep it together a bit and

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.600 
can you can keep it together a bit and
the<00:01:57.780> moist<00:01:57.990> makes<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.409> smoke<00:01:58.649> heavier<00:01:59.039> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the moist makes the smoke heavier so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.919 
the moist makes the smoke heavier so
what<00:01:59.729> you're<00:01:59.850> looking<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.179> here<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.539> strings

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
what you're looking at here the strings

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.990 
what you're looking at here the strings
underneath<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.649> doubt<00:02:02.219> what<00:02:02.520> gets<00:02:02.729> poured

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
underneath the doubt what gets poured

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240 
underneath the doubt what gets poured
down<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.409> right<00:02:04.710> um<00:02:04.860> stem<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
down but then on the right um stem the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.399 
down but then on the right um stem the
circumstance<00:02:05.789> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> bowl<00:02:06.179> will<00:02:06.659> stay<00:02:06.869> for<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
circumstance of the bowl will stay for a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.440 
circumstance of the bowl will stay for a
few<00:02:08.009> seconds<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.640> then<00:02:08.759> will<00:02:08.940> fall<00:02:09.149> apart<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.809 

cannot<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.690> control<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.410> cloud<00:02:17.340> because

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
cannot really control the cloud because

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.580 
cannot really control the cloud because
it's<00:02:18.030> different<00:02:18.360> every<00:02:19.019> time

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
it's different every time

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.800 
it's different every time
also<00:02:20.280> in<00:02:20.400> shape<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.910> light<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.510> therefore<00:02:21.630> I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
also in shape and light and therefore I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.270 
also in shape and light and therefore I
make<00:02:21.989> hundreds<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.590> hundreds<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.069> just

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
make hundreds and hundreds and just

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.729 
make hundreds and hundreds and just
select<00:02:23.489> one<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.180> bigger<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.650> of

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
select one to be the bigger a bit of

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:35.600 
select one to be the bigger a bit of
work

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.880 

that's<00:02:36.570> for<00:02:36.780> me<00:02:36.900> that's<00:02:37.050> interesting<00:02:37.650> about

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
that's for me that's interesting about

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400 
that's for me that's interesting about
it<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.460> very<00:02:38.490> temporary<00:02:39.420> making<00:02:40.320> the

it that is very temporary making the
event<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.550> hole<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:41.940> something

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
event in the in the hole it's something

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.670 
event in the in the hole it's something
different<00:02:42.390> for<00:02:42.690> me<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> work<00:02:43.440> but

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
different for me this is the work but

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.850 
different for me this is the work but
that's<00:02:43.860> more<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:45.380> like<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> collective

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
that's more like a like a collective

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.280 
that's more like a like a collective
memory<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.310> have<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:48.390> very<00:02:48.600> short<00:02:48.810> moment

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
memory I have for very short moment

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.080 
memory I have for very short moment
people<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.010> space<00:02:50.190> connected<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.940> that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
people in that space connected to that

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.390 
people in that space connected to that
space<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:52.410> also<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.040> more<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.370> a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
space and this also this is more like a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.860 
space and this also this is more like a
document<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.090> something<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.540> happened

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
document of something that happened

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.230 
document of something that happened
there<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.320> now<00:02:55.470> gone

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
there and is now gone

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.700 
there and is now gone
if<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.420> re-enter<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.930> space<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.500> just

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
if you re-enter the space it's just

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.170 
if you re-enter the space it's just
empty<00:02:58.950> now<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.300> one<00:03:00.540> was<00:03:00.870> once
