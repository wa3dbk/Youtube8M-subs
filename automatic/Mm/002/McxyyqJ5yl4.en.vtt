but due to 1.3 maybe because of all the
changes<00:01:43.299> it<00:01:43.539> has<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.859> big<00:01:45.279> problem<00:01:45.549> when<00:01:45.880> it

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:46.029 
changes it has a big problem when it

blows up which didn't for some reason

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.039 
blows up which didn't for some reason
but<00:01:48.459> let<00:01:48.579> me<00:01:48.609> try<00:01:48.880> again<00:01:51.419> so<00:01:52.419> it<00:01:52.599> just<00:01:52.630> stays

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
but let me try again so it just stays

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.959 
but let me try again so it just stays
like<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.289> if<00:01:53.859> you<00:01:54.099> look<00:01:54.279> at<00:01:54.399> it<00:01:54.429> like<00:01:54.609> this<00:01:54.669> it

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
like that if you look at it like this it

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.659 
like that if you look at it like this it
sort<00:01:55.119> of<00:01:55.179> looks<00:01:55.329> like<00:01:55.389> he's<00:01:55.569> chunky<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:57.369> he<00:01:57.639> I

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:57.669 
sort of looks like he's chunky but he I

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:00.989 
sort of looks like he's chunky but he I
bet<00:01:57.999> he's<00:01:58.179> in<00:01:58.359> extreme<00:01:58.749> pain<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.520> there<00:02:00.969> is

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999 
bet he's in extreme pain so there is

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.249 
bet he's in extreme pain so there is
also<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:02.289> ender<00:02:03.039> bike<00:02:03.310> which<00:02:04.229> changed<00:02:05.229> the

also the ender bike which changed the

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.440 
also the ender bike which changed the
wrong<00:02:05.439> thing<00:02:05.709> by<00:02:05.889> accident<00:02:06.399> there's<00:02:06.999> also<00:02:07.209> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
wrong thing by accident there's also the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.210 
wrong thing by accident there's also the
ender<00:02:07.840> bike<00:02:08.020> which<00:02:08.229> has<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.739> ability<00:02:09.190> to

actually<00:02:09.880> teleport<00:02:10.869> if<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.110> click<00:02:11.349> space<00:02:11.650> so

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
actually teleport if you click space so

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.300 
actually teleport if you click space so
it'll<00:02:12.700> just<00:02:12.730> teleport<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> random<00:02:13.720> place

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
it'll just teleport to a random place

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
it'll just teleport to a random place
there's<00:02:15.310> also<00:02:15.550> an<00:02:15.880> odd<00:02:16.060> bike<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.570> this<00:02:16.690> mod

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
thing so let me just try to kill it I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.720 
thing so let me just try to kill it I
feel<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:33.830> bad<00:02:34.040> for<00:02:34.250> killing<00:02:34.550> notch<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:37.340> here's

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
feel so bad for killing notch so here's

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.480 
feel so bad for killing notch so here's
the<00:02:37.970> reindeer<00:02:38.600> bike<00:02:38.840> which<00:02:39.560> actually<00:02:39.860> I'm<00:02:40.280> not

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
the reindeer bike which actually I'm not

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.160 
the reindeer bike which actually I'm not
going<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.670> try<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:40.880> fly<00:02:41.150> because<00:02:41.420> if<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.990> start

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
going to try to fly because if you start

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.680 
going to try to fly because if you start
flying<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.770> there's<00:02:43.070> going<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.340> be<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.820> big

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
flying it there's going to be a big

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.600 
flying it there's going to be a big
crash<00:02:45.290> due<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.860> 1.3<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.990> here<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:49.190> snow

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
crash due to 1.3 so here is the snow

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.730 
crash due to 1.3 so here is the snow
golem<00:02:50.030> bike<00:02:50.270> which<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.870> certain<00:02:51.200> looks<00:02:51.380> really

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
golem bike which is certain looks really

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.510 
golem bike which is certain looks really
odd<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.209> actually<00:02:53.480> has<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.959> ability<00:02:54.320> to

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
odd but it actually has the ability to

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.830 
odd but it actually has the ability to
throw<00:02:55.520> snowballs<00:02:57.880> so<00:02:58.880> here's<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.330> gas<00:02:59.570> bike

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
throw snowballs so here's the gas bike

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.720 
throw snowballs so here's the gas bike
which<00:03:00.050> actually<00:03:00.260> has<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.620> ability<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.280> fly

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
which actually has the ability to fly

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.400 
which actually has the ability to fly
which<00:03:02.239> is<00:03:02.390> not<00:03:02.540> bad<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.780> doesn't<00:03:03.050> have<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
which is not bad it doesn't have the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.190 
which is not bad it doesn't have the
ability<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.830> shoot<00:03:04.489> any<00:03:04.730> fireballs<00:03:05.420> or<00:03:05.780> gas

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
ability to shoot any fireballs or gas

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.510 
ability to shoot any fireballs or gas
balls<00:03:06.560> or<00:03:06.770> whatever<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.160> want<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.340> call<00:03:07.459> them

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
balls or whatever you want to call them

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.190 
balls or whatever you want to call them
but<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.300> still<00:03:08.480> pretty<00:03:09.080> cool<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:10.070> have

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
but it's still pretty cool like to have

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.050 
but it's still pretty cool like to have
so<00:03:12.200> here<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.800> iron<00:03:12.980> golem<00:03:13.520> bike<00:03:13.700> which

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
so here is the iron golem bike which

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.820 
so here is the iron golem bike which
doesn't<00:03:14.660> have<00:03:14.780> really<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.110> special<00:03:15.320> ability

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
doesn't have really a special ability

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.550 
doesn't have really a special ability
except<00:03:16.130> for<00:03:16.280> going<00:03:16.370> really<00:03:16.700> slow<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.560> I

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
except for going really slow so I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.650 
except for going really slow so I
wouldn't<00:03:19.310> use<00:03:19.489> this<00:03:19.700> bike<00:03:19.910> personally<00:03:20.480> but

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
wouldn't use this bike personally but

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.539 
wouldn't use this bike personally but
that's<00:03:20.870> up<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:22.730> here<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:24.549> bunny

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
that's up to you so here is the bunny

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.789 
that's up to you so here is the bunny
bike<00:03:25.850> which<00:03:26.660> actually<00:03:26.930> has<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.380> ability<00:03:27.769> to

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
bike which actually has the ability to

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.820 
bike which actually has the ability to
drop<00:03:28.340> items<00:03:28.549> sometimes<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:30.230> mostly<00:03:30.620> it's

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
drop items sometimes so mostly it's

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.759 
drop items sometimes so mostly it's
mostly<00:03:30.920> eggs<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.959> but<00:03:33.470> if<00:03:33.590> you're

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
mostly eggs like that but if you're

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.620 
mostly eggs like that but if you're
lucky<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.220> will<00:03:34.400> drop<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.700> tnt<00:03:35.269> which<00:03:35.299> is

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
lucky it will drop a tnt which is

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.000 
lucky it will drop a tnt which is
actually<00:03:35.780> good<00:03:36.080> at<00:03:36.200> night<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.830> night

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
actually good at night in the night

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.100 
actually good at night in the night
because<00:03:37.250> they<00:03:37.549> will<00:03:37.700> destroy<00:03:38.110> other

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
because they will destroy other

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.039 
because they will destroy other
creatures<00:03:39.650> around<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:40.880> thankfully<00:03:41.870> it

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
creatures around you but thankfully it

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.100 
creatures around you but thankfully it
doesn't<00:03:42.380> destroy<00:03:42.680> any<00:03:42.920> land<00:03:43.330> so<00:03:44.330> here<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:44.840> the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
doesn't destroy any land so here is the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.520 
doesn't destroy any land so here is the
pony<00:03:45.500> bike<00:03:45.769> which<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:47.390> most<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.290> them<00:03:48.440> are

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
pony bike which just most of them are

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.920 
pony bike which just most of them are
now<00:03:48.799> have<00:03:49.100> wings<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.060> can<00:03:50.330> just<00:03:50.360> fly<00:03:50.810> them

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
now have wings so you can just fly them

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.080 
now have wings so you can just fly them
they<00:03:51.620> don't<00:03:51.799> fly<00:03:52.070> very<00:03:52.100> high<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:55.430> here<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:56.030> a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
they don't fly very high so here is a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.570 
they don't fly very high so here is a
good<00:03:56.510> one<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.230> it's<00:03:57.380> called<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.920> Dino<00:03:58.280> bite

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
good one and it's called the Dino bite

good one and it's called the Dino bite
it<00:03:58.790> has<00:03:59.360> four<00:03:59.690> types<00:03:59.959> of<00:04:00.200> dinosaurs<00:04:00.380> here<00:04:01.220> is

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
it has four types of dinosaurs here is

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.710 
it has four types of dinosaurs here is
if<00:04:01.850> I'm<00:04:02.030> not<00:04:02.150> well<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.830> Triceratops<00:04:03.830> which

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
if I'm not well the Triceratops which

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.720 
if I'm not well the Triceratops which
actually<00:04:05.720> all<00:04:06.200> all<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.130> dinosaurs<00:04:07.610> have

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
actually all all of the dinosaurs have

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.479 
actually all all of the dinosaurs have
the<00:04:07.850> same<00:04:08.030> ability<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:08.720> it's<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.049> do<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.489> you

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
the same ability and it's to do this you

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.199 
the same ability and it's to do this you
basically<00:04:10.700> just<00:04:11.030> eat<00:04:12.370> cows<00:04:13.370> it's<00:04:13.790> actually<00:04:14.150> a

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
basically just eat cows it's actually a

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.210 
basically just eat cows it's actually a
good<00:04:14.450> way<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.750> actually<00:04:15.140> bring<00:04:15.500> cows<00:04:15.830> into<00:04:16.100> a

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
good way to actually bring cows into a

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.819 
good way to actually bring cows into a
farm<00:04:16.489> instead<00:04:16.669> of<00:04:16.940> week<00:04:17.229> so<00:04:18.229> it's<00:04:18.530> still

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
farm instead of week so it's still

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.849 
farm instead of week so it's still
pretty<00:04:18.979> good<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.430> next<00:04:19.609> one<00:04:20.419> is<00:04:20.600> the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
pretty good the next one is the
