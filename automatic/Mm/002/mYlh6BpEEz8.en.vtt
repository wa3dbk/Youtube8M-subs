00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
market I'm not too sure about that I

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.960 
market I'm not too sure about that I
think<00:00:55.630> that's<00:00:55.750> a<00:00:55.840> little<00:00:56.170> steep<00:00:56.890> I<00:00:57.190> wouldn't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
think that's a little steep I wouldn't

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.060 
think that's a little steep I wouldn't
mind<00:00:58.120> 800<00:00:58.720> I<00:00:58.840> would<00:00:58.960> blow<00:00:59.170> ton<00:00:59.530> of<00:00:59.739> cartel

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
mind 800 I would blow ton of cartel

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.120 
mind 800 I would blow ton of cartel
coins<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:00.579> was<00:01:00.730> 800<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.390> just<00:01:01.540> buy<00:01:01.780> them<00:01:01.930> all

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
coins it was 800 and just buy them all

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.100 
coins it was 800 and just buy them all
however<00:01:03.130> 1500<00:01:03.820> is<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:04.329> little<00:01:04.629> bit<00:01:04.720> more<00:01:04.839> steep

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
however 1500 is a little bit more steep

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.770 
however 1500 is a little bit more steep
so<00:01:05.770> I'm<00:01:06.189> hoping<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:06.670> they<00:01:06.939> buy<00:01:07.420> as<00:01:07.630> an

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
so I'm hoping that they buy as an

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.570 
so I'm hoping that they buy as an
unlocked<00:01:08.140> I<00:01:08.290> mean<00:01:08.439> obviously<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:09.280> won't<00:01:09.370> let

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580

heavy laser cannon quad laser cannon

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.390 
heavy laser cannon quad laser cannon
quad<00:02:11.170> laser<00:02:11.439> yeah<00:02:11.709> they're<00:02:12.010> all<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:12.370> same

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
quad laser yeah they're all the same

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.080 
quad laser yeah they're all the same
right<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:14.200> some<00:02:14.499> things<00:02:14.739> may<00:02:15.069> not<00:02:15.279> be<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
right but some things may not be so the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.000 
right but some things may not be so the
example<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.019> saw<00:02:17.169> earlier<00:02:17.529> was<00:02:17.590> on<00:02:17.799> this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
example I saw earlier was on this

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.610 
example I saw earlier was on this
Scout<00:02:18.189> this<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:18.519> has<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.909> burst<00:02:19.810> laser<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
Scout this one has the burst laser the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.190 
Scout this one has the burst laser the
rapid<00:02:21.040> fire<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.640> laser<00:02:21.879> or<00:02:22.360> light<00:02:22.689> laser<00:02:22.900> and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
rapid fire the laser or light laser and

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.319 
rapid fire the laser or light laser and
then<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.409> quad<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:24.549> one<00:02:24.730> doesn't<00:02:24.909> have<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
then the quad this one doesn't have the

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.890 
then the quad this one doesn't have the
burst<00:02:25.629> which<00:02:26.620> isn't<00:02:27.159> necessarily<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.790> problem

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
burst which isn't necessarily a problem

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.569 
burst which isn't necessarily a problem
right<00:02:28.900> because<00:02:29.140> there<00:02:29.739> are<00:02:29.860> others<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.250> do

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
right because there are others that do

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.399 
right because there are others that do
like<00:02:30.819> this<00:02:31.000> one<00:02:31.209> does<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.019> there<00:02:32.200> are<00:02:32.230> other

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
like this one does so there are other

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.430 
like this one does so there are other
ships<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.220> buy<00:02:33.790> without<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:35.319> know

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
ships that you can buy without you know

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.780 
ships that you can buy without you know
having<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.799> spend<00:02:36.040> cartel<00:02:36.370> coins<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.700> have

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
having to spend cartel coins that have

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.880 
having to spend cartel coins that have
some<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.269> these<00:02:37.360> things<00:02:37.629> all<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.620> does

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
some of these things all of this does

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.550 
some of these things all of this does
anyways<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.579> just<00:02:39.909> preference<00:02:40.239> for<00:02:41.140> for

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
anyways this is just preference for for

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.160 
anyways this is just preference for for
example<00:02:41.890> let's<00:02:42.069> go<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:43.329> my<00:02:43.420> primary<00:02:43.810> weapon

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
example let's go to my primary weapon

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.009 
example let's go to my primary weapon
some<00:02:44.859> people<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:46.060> I've<00:02:46.269> talked<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.840> that

some people that I've talked to that
have<00:02:47.140> been<00:02:47.260> playing<00:02:47.500> galactic<00:02:48.040> starfighter<00:02:48.430> a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
have been playing galactic starfighter a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.229 
have been playing galactic starfighter a
bunch<00:02:49.120> really<00:02:50.019> like<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.890> rapid<00:02:51.730> fire<00:02:51.879> and<00:02:52.150> the

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
bunch really like the rapid fire and the

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.089 
bunch really like the rapid fire and the
heavy<00:02:52.420> which<00:02:52.659> is<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> standard<00:02:53.560> ones<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:53.890> get

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
heavy which is the standard ones you get

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.520 
heavy which is the standard ones you get
and<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:55.329> this<00:02:55.720> version<00:02:56.139> of<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.260> strike

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
and the this version of the strike

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.379 
and the this version of the strike
fighter<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.889> have<00:02:57.010> two<00:02:57.129> primary<00:02:57.400> weapons<00:02:58.030> as

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
fighter can have two primary weapons as

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.449 
fighter can have two primary weapons as
opposed<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.959> this<00:02:59.620> one<00:02:59.829> that<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.190> have<00:03:00.310> two

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
opposed to this one that can have two

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.069 
opposed to this one that can have two
secondary<00:03:00.970> weapons<00:03:01.359> which<00:03:01.659> is<00:03:01.780> pretty<00:03:01.870> cool

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
secondary weapons which is pretty cool

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.610 
secondary weapons which is pretty cool
so<00:03:02.920> at<00:03:03.609> least<00:03:03.790> did<00:03:04.420> they<00:03:04.540> change<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.959> no<00:03:05.409> they

didn't<00:03:05.889> oh<00:03:06.010> thank<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.579> because<00:03:07.030> that's<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
didn't oh thank you because that's the

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.449

one<00:03:07.389> I<00:03:07.420> want<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.629> buy<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:07.959> had<00:03:08.139> to<00:03:08.200> make<00:03:08.349> sure<00:03:08.459> so

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
one I want to buy I had to make sure so

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.990 
one I want to buy I had to make sure so
the<00:03:09.900> thing<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:10.930> i<00:03:11.319> prefer<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.310> quad<00:03:12.730> laser

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
the thing is i prefer the quad laser

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.670 
the thing is i prefer the quad laser
cannon<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:13.930> really<00:03:14.170> quick<00:03:14.349> i<00:03:14.500> like

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
cannon because it's really quick i like

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.199 
cannon because it's really quick i like
quick<00:03:14.980> firing<00:03:15.250> weapons<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.909> i'm<00:03:16.030> upgrading

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
quick firing weapons and i'm upgrading

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.809 
quick firing weapons and i'm upgrading
it<00:03:16.659> so<00:03:16.810> it's<00:03:17.230> half<00:03:17.440> has<00:03:17.859> more<00:03:18.099> range<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.700> it

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
it so it's half has more range and it

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.080 
it so it's half has more range and it
fires<00:03:19.000> quicker<00:03:19.420> right<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:21.340> secondary

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
fires quicker right but the secondary

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.849 
fires quicker right but the secondary
weapons<00:03:22.480> I've<00:03:22.900> seen<00:03:23.139> a<00:03:23.169> lot<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.379> people<00:03:23.650> using

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
weapons I've seen a lot of people using

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.439 
weapons I've seen a lot of people using
the<00:03:24.069> concussion<00:03:24.519> missiles<00:03:24.819> because<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.299> does

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
the concussion missiles because it does

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:27.240 
the concussion missiles because it does
more<00:03:25.569> damage<00:03:25.629> I've<00:03:26.620> also<00:03:26.829> seen<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.069> lot<00:03:27.220> of

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
more damage I've also seen a lot of

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.430 
more damage I've also seen a lot of
people<00:03:27.519> using<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:27.910> proton<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.449> personally<00:03:29.139> use

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
people using the proton I personally use

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.430 
people using the proton I personally use
the<00:03:29.919> cluster<00:03:30.310> because<00:03:30.879> it<00:03:31.569> locks<00:03:31.930> on<00:03:32.169> quicker

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
the cluster because it locks on quicker

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.369 
the cluster because it locks on quicker
and<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:33.549> find<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.090> when<00:03:34.150> dog<00:03:34.720> fighting<00:03:34.989> people

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
and I find that when dog fighting people

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.900 
and I find that when dog fighting people
you<00:03:35.829> need<00:03:35.949> to<00:03:36.069> have<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.340> lock<00:03:36.459> on<00:03:36.669> quick

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
you need to have it lock on quick

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.460 
you need to have it lock on quick
because<00:03:37.690> they're<00:03:37.959> just<00:03:38.109> going<00:03:38.199> to<00:03:38.290> try<00:03:38.440> to

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
because they're just going to try to

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.930 
because they're just going to try to
boost<00:03:38.680> away<00:03:38.919> the<00:03:39.040> second<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.400> hear<00:03:39.549> that<00:03:39.699> sound

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
boost away the second I hear that sound

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.409 
boost away the second I hear that sound
anyways<00:03:40.379> so<00:03:41.379> basically<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.910> ship

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
anyways so basically this ship

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.500 
anyways so basically this ship
configuration<00:03:44.230> while<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.340> very<00:03:46.120> similar

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
configuration while it is very similar

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.199 
configuration while it is very similar
to<00:03:46.720> what<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.230> already<00:03:47.349> on<00:03:47.859> you<00:03:48.639> know<00:03:48.760> this<00:03:49.000> one

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
to what is already on you know this one

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.119 
to what is already on you know this one
it's<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:50.500> has<00:03:50.769> some<00:03:51.160> different<00:03:51.549> things<00:03:51.579> and

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
it's it has some different things and

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.830 
it's it has some different things and
for<00:03:54.129> the<00:03:54.190> most<00:03:54.340> part<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:54.879> just<00:03:55.329> things<00:03:55.569> that

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
for the most part it's just things that

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.869 
for the most part it's just things that
if<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.530> really<00:03:57.010> wanted<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.489> you<00:03:57.519> could

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
if you really wanted it you could

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.670 
if you really wanted it you could
probably<00:03:58.090> get<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.540> on<00:03:58.780> yet<00:03:59.109> another<00:03:59.230> ship

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
probably get it on yet another ship

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.220 
probably get it on yet another ship
that's<00:03:59.949> probably<00:04:00.549> already<00:04:00.760> here<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:01.389> it's

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
that's probably already here so it's

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.899 
that's probably already here so it's
it's<00:04:02.560> preference<00:04:03.099> more<00:04:03.519> than<00:04:03.639> anything

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
it's preference more than anything

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.789 
it's preference more than anything
you're<00:04:04.180> not<00:04:04.209> buying<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.870> more<00:04:05.079> powerful<00:04:05.260> ship

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
you're not buying a more powerful ship

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.470 
you're not buying a more powerful ship
because<00:04:06.430> none<00:04:06.639> of<00:04:06.669> these<00:04:06.849> are<00:04:07.030> more<00:04:07.180> powerful

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
because none of these are more powerful

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.210 
because none of these are more powerful
than<00:04:07.659> others<00:04:08.109> unless<00:04:08.409> you're<00:04:08.680> sitting<00:04:09.099> there

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
than others unless you're sitting there

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.039 
than others unless you're sitting there
upgrading<00:04:09.849> them<00:04:09.970> which<00:04:10.510> if<00:04:10.720> you're<00:04:10.870> upgrading

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
upgrading them which if you're upgrading

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.809 
upgrading them which if you're upgrading
them<00:04:11.440> you've<00:04:11.620> probably<00:04:11.919> already<00:04:12.310> found<00:04:12.669> a

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
them you've probably already found a

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.159 
them you've probably already found a
ship<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.299> like<00:04:13.540> like<00:04:13.810> maybe<00:04:13.989> you've

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
ship that you like like maybe you've

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.539 
ship that you like like maybe you've
bought<00:04:14.379> this<00:04:14.560> one<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:14.889> you're<00:04:14.949> upgrading<00:04:15.129> the

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
bought this one and you're upgrading the

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.520 
bought this one and you're upgrading the
components<00:04:16.030> for<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.570> which<00:04:17.139> case<00:04:17.169> that's

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
components for it in which case that's

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.529 
components for it in which case that's
cool<00:04:17.709> but<00:04:18.280> just<00:04:18.669> keep<00:04:18.909> in<00:04:19.030> mind<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.479> is

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
cool but just keep in mind that this is

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.210 
cool but just keep in mind that this is
not<00:04:19.780> pay-to-win<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.530> just<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.829> different

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
not pay-to-win this is just a different

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.550 
not pay-to-win this is just a different
configuration<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:22.180> for<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.080> most<00:04:23.199> part<00:04:23.320> it

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
configuration and for the most part it

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.180 
configuration and for the most part it
is<00:04:23.680> more<00:04:24.070> aesthetical<00:04:24.849> choice<00:04:25.419> than<00:04:25.720> anything

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
is more aesthetical choice than anything

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.649 
is more aesthetical choice than anything
so<00:04:27.190> that's<00:04:27.639> kind<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:27.969> how<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.150> works<00:04:28.389> i<00:04:28.510> hope

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
so that's kind of how it works i hope

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.290 
so that's kind of how it works i hope
you<00:04:28.780> guys<00:04:28.930> get<00:04:29.409> a<00:04:29.469> pretty<00:04:29.650> good<00:04:29.740> idea<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.300> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
you guys get a pretty good idea that the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.200 
you guys get a pretty good idea that the
premium<00:04:31.659> ships<00:04:31.870> are<00:04:32.050> you

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
premium ships are you

hoping for you know the movie ships I

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.330 
hoping for you know the movie ships I
think<00:04:51.199> this<00:04:51.289> would<00:04:51.470> be<00:04:51.500> really<00:04:51.710> cool<00:04:51.949> but<00:04:52.190> I

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
think this would be really cool but I

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.920 
think this would be really cool but I
doubt<00:04:52.430> we're<00:04:52.789> going<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.000> get<00:04:53.090> them<00:04:53.300> maybe

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
doubt we're going to get them maybe

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.800 
doubt we're going to get them maybe
we'll<00:04:54.020> get<00:04:54.169> something<00:04:54.349> close<00:04:54.940> this<00:04:55.940> is<00:04:56.240> you

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.110 
I think I'll buy a couple I definitely
will<00:05:00.620> especially<00:05:01.250> if<00:05:01.370> they<00:05:01.520> have<00:05:01.550> some<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:01.970> the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
will especially if they have some of the

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.790 
will especially if they have some of the
ships<00:05:02.660> I'm<00:05:02.810> hoping<00:05:03.050> for<00:05:03.229> that<00:05:03.259> are<00:05:03.530> currently

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
ships I'm hoping for that are currently

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.029 
ships I'm hoping for that are currently
in<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:04.039> game<00:05:04.220> but<00:05:05.180> on<00:05:05.509> that<00:05:05.930> note<00:05:06.169> we<00:05:06.560> shall
