00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.490
 we're back live with teledata 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.580
 for the whole region it's seven minutes 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.250
 for noon and look at just people 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.400
 management of the airport. 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.369
 araçatuba is concerned about the risk of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.230
 accidents caused by model aircraft 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.090
 at night makes it easier 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.949
 to identify they are flying over 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 some spots in the city with lights is not 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.730
 those that can cause these 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.820
 problems at the airport in the city 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.100
 many practitioners are piloting these 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.940
 equipment in the vicinity of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.649
 airport 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 at the beginning of the year an interference 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.760
 during the landing of a plane scared the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.760
 pilot and crew 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.090
 they are turning fever in the sky of 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 araçatuba and attracting supporters through 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.350
 four corners of the city 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.660
 It's a lot of emotion either during the day or 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.120
 during the night and ciça were models 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.760
 also called electric 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.500
 fight for traffickers is a show of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.119
 high acrobatics 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.580
 the equipment can achieve a 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.860
 speed up to 300 kilometers from 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.990
 victory and reach more than two thousand 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.479
 meters in height is no more than that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.670
 styrofoam and is reinforced with fiberglass 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.470
 it is integrated that this tape to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.340
 this colored ribbon for the finish 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.040
 in him 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.080
 There the engine has a battery but those 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.150
 electrical equipment is 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.610
 become a problem when the practice of 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.400
 piloting them in the vicinity of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.409
 airport araçatuba interference 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.780
 of one of these model aircraft during landing 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.299
 of an airplane placed the administration of the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.939
 airport and the airline that operates 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.189
 on the spot in a state of alert to the risk of 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.680
 fall on a person fall into a hammock 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.259
 electrical or even a person is 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.299
 doing tata seeing someone to land a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.130
 landing plane is going from 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.810
 meeting the plane is at risk 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.240
 pick up on an aircraft in a gang 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.829
 landing procedure it is already in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.649
 of a configuration and has the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.790
 speed for landing he has the problem 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.420
 at that time the program of 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.740
 temperature to have a problem of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.619
 speed what happens suddenly 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.090
 an object of this appears in front 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.780
 It really does bring a lot today. 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.760
 great patrick 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.400
 in action daesp air department 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.890
 of são paulo has already been notified 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.410
 by blue company airlines over the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.390
 a preventive report should 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.610
 be forwarded within the next few 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.160
 cenipa research center and 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.680
 prevention of aircraft accidents and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.850
 also the national agency of 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.610
 civil Aviation 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.069
 the purpose of the document is to alert 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.590
 the bodies responsible for the risks 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.540
 electric model can bring 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.330
 during landings and 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.989
 take-offs that we would like here all 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.370
 person who has this equipment that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.910
 let it go in another area that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.590
 really leave the area free area 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.600
 free the airport traffic so that 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.010
 an accident will not occur because 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.739
 we have at this moment 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.269
 in this case an imminent danger 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.010
 This is not a joke because it is 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.769
 serious thing to us because the agency 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.890
 national civil aviation 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.200
 the operation of model airplanes in the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.190
 area of approach and take-off of 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.440
 airports 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.019
 still according to anac the proposal of 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.540
 regulations for these wing models 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.140
 and is in the process of development in 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.510
 parents 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.269
 the agency also reported that it is 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.700
 the specific scenario of Araçatuba and 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.790
 is gathering information so that 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.620
 or there is no irregularity and 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.040
 so those responsible are 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.530
 identified and assessed who uses 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.959
 aircraft in the airport region may be 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.320
 have penalties provided for in the code 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.989
 aeronautics industry and can be 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.010
 subject to civil liability and 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.010
 also criminal
