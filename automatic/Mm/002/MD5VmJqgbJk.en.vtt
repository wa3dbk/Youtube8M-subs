shotguns<00:02:42.019> in<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.230> game<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.530> can't<00:02:42.769> really

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
shotguns in this game you can't really

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.380 
shotguns in this game you can't really
do<00:02:43.129> too<00:02:43.160> well<00:02:43.610> with<00:02:43.640> them<00:02:43.819> because<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.239> all

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
do too well with them because of all

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.000 
do too well with them because of all
because<00:02:44.989> of<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.140> power<00:02:45.319> of<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.560> submachine

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
because of the power of the submachine

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.470 
because of the power of the submachine
guns<00:02:46.220> which<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.489> white<00:02:46.670> damage<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.180> such<00:02:47.450> a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
guns which is white damage is such a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.150 
guns which is white damage is such a
necessity<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:48.140> know<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.650> shouldn't<00:02:48.920> you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
necessity you know you shouldn't you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.289 
necessity you know you shouldn't you
don't<00:02:49.340> really<00:02:49.459> need<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.670> sight<00:02:49.880> on<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> shotgun

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
don't really need a sight on a shotgun

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.729 
don't really need a sight on a shotgun
because<00:02:50.720> there's<00:02:50.900> nine<00:02:51.319> out<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.500> ten<00:02:51.709> times

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
because there's nine out of ten times

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.440 
because there's nine out of ten times
there's<00:02:52.190> no<00:02:52.310> time<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.730> look<00:02:52.849> down<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.329> your

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
there's no time to look down on your

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.509 
there's no time to look down on your
sight<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.260> definitely<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.010> don't<00:02:55.160> need<00:02:55.340> any

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519

silencer<00:02:57.620> definitely<00:02:58.400> never<00:02:58.579> ever<00:02:58.849> use<00:02:59.090> a

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120

silencer<00:02:59.360> guys<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.930> silencer<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.620> by<00:03:00.769> far<00:03:01.099> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
silencer guys a silencer is by far the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.069 
silencer guys a silencer is by far the
worst<00:03:01.640> attachment<00:03:02.299> you<00:03:02.360> ever<00:03:02.599> have<00:03:02.870> on<00:03:03.049> a

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
worst attachment you ever have on a

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.630 
worst attachment you ever have on a
shotgun<00:03:03.379> because<00:03:03.650> all<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.099> sounds<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.430> does

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
shotgun because all the sounds that does

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.800 
shotgun because all the sounds that does
is<00:03:04.819> keep<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.090> off<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.209> video<00:03:05.450> when<00:03:05.780> you're

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
is keep you off the video when you're

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.390 
is keep you off the video when you're
shooting<00:03:06.140> but<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.890> only<00:03:07.010> time<00:03:07.160> you're<00:03:07.310> gonna

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
shooting but the only time you're gonna

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.470 
shooting but the only time you're gonna
be<00:03:07.579> shooting<00:03:07.849> is<00:03:07.910> when<00:03:08.060> you're<00:03:08.180> really<00:03:08.360> really

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
be shooting is when you're really really

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.970 
be shooting is when you're really really
close<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.930> an<00:03:09.019> enemy<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> chances<00:03:09.799> are

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
close to an enemy so the chances are

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.680 
close to an enemy so the chances are
where<00:03:10.579> there's<00:03:10.730> one<00:03:10.940> enemy<00:03:11.090> there's<00:03:11.420> gonna<00:03:11.510> be

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
where there's one enemy there's gonna be

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.970 
where there's one enemy there's gonna be
another<00:03:11.959> enemy<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.620> just<00:03:12.739> gonna<00:03:12.799> have<00:03:12.950> to

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
another enemy so you just gonna have to

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.710 
another enemy so you just gonna have to
turn<00:03:13.160> around<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.400> kill<00:03:13.549> them<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.480> amount

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
turn around to kill them and the amount

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.390 
turn around to kill them and the amount
of<00:03:14.780> damage<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.440> sounds<00:03:15.769> that<00:03:15.890> takes<00:03:16.069> off<00:03:16.250> is

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
of damage the sounds that takes off is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.069 
of damage the sounds that takes off is
ridiculous<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.239> can<00:03:17.389> go<00:03:17.510> from<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.780> three<00:03:17.959> shot

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
ridiculous it can go from a three shot

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.599 
ridiculous it can go from a three shot
kill<00:03:18.500> all<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.799> way<00:03:18.859> up<00:03:18.950> there<00:03:19.069> were<00:03:19.130> six<00:03:19.400> shot

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
kill all the way up there were six shot

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.640 
kill all the way up there were six shot
kill<00:03:19.790> guys<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.209> good<00:03:20.480> witness<00:03:21.139> answer<00:03:21.500> is

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
kill guys is good witness answer is

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.289 
kill guys is good witness answer is
probably<00:03:21.920> one<00:03:22.220> of<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.340> worst<00:03:22.519> guns<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.090> game

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
probably one of the worst guns in a game

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.720 
probably one of the worst guns in a game
so<00:03:23.630> definitely<00:03:24.410> definitely<00:03:24.590> stay<00:03:25.400> away<00:03:25.430> from

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
so definitely definitely stay away from

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.160 
so definitely definitely stay away from
the<00:03:25.790> sound<00:03:25.940> size<00:03:26.239> not<00:03:26.450> only<00:03:26.630> with<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> sparse

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
the sound size not only with the sparse

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.080 
the sound size not only with the sparse
but<00:03:27.350> with<00:03:27.440> all<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.799> other<00:03:27.980> shotguns<00:03:28.670> guys

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
but with all the other shotguns guys

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.479 
but with all the other shotguns guys
so<00:03:29.420> remember<00:03:29.810> damage<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.739> extended<00:03:31.220> marks

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
so remember damage and extended marks

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.129 
so remember damage and extended marks
are<00:03:31.609> the<00:03:31.849> way<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.120> go<00:03:32.420> guys<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:32.870> been<00:03:33.019> well

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
are the way to go guys it's been well

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.509 
are the way to go guys it's been well
proven<00:03:33.410> or<00:03:33.650> everyone<00:03:34.040> who<00:03:34.069> gets<00:03:34.280> involved

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
proven or everyone who gets involved

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.670 
proven or everyone who gets involved
with<00:03:34.639> this<00:03:34.849> is<00:03:35.090> tends<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.750> have<00:03:35.900> damage<00:03:36.290> on<00:03:36.470> and

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
with this is tends to have damage on and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.229 
with this is tends to have damage on and
extended<00:03:37.130> marks<00:03:37.340> extended<00:03:37.730> marks<00:03:37.940> just<00:03:38.120> for

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
extended marks extended marks just for

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.729 
extended marks extended marks just for
convenience<00:03:38.420> sakes<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:39.319> probably<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
convenience sakes and it's probably the

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.589 
convenience sakes and it's probably the
best<00:03:39.920> attachment<00:03:40.400> anyway<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.420> slow

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
best attachment anyway and the slow

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.300 
best attachment anyway and the slow
reloads<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.290> helps<00:03:42.500> alleviate<00:03:42.680> last<00:03:43.099> and

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
reloads and it helps alleviate last and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.819 
reloads and it helps alleviate last and
how<00:03:43.849> much<00:03:44.000> because<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.480> makes<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.840> gun<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.230> kind

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
how much because it makes the gun a kind

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.470 
how much because it makes the gun a kind
of<00:03:45.950> usable<00:03:46.400> because<00:03:46.549> without<00:03:46.880> damage<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.389> is

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
of usable because without damage it is

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.509 
of usable because without damage it is
in<00:03:47.690> nightmare<00:03:48.109> which<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.290> why<00:03:48.530> your<00:03:49.099> priority

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
in nightmare which is why your priority

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.490 
in nightmare which is why your priority
should<00:03:49.730> pay<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:49.970> get<00:03:50.329> damage<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.200> one<00:03:51.349> thing

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
should pay to get damage but one thing

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.539 
should pay to get damage but one thing
that<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:51.739> will<00:03:51.859> have<00:03:51.919> noticed<00:03:52.310> all<00:03:52.430> these

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
that you will have noticed all these

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.069 
that you will have noticed all these
clips<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.510> I've<00:03:53.630> been<00:03:53.750> using<00:03:53.930> the

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
clips is that I've been using the

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.659 
clips is that I've been using the
tactical<00:03:54.500> insurgent<00:03:55.130> as<00:03:55.250> well<00:03:55.459> now<00:03:55.609> the

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
tactical insurgent as well now the

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.370 
tactical insurgent as well now the
tactical<00:03:56.150> insertion<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.690> fantastic<00:03:57.290> because

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
tactical insertion is fantastic because

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.720 
tactical insertion is fantastic because

really helps you to get more kills

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.750

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
and the thing with the spa's is that it

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.449 
and the thing with the spa's is that it
really<00:04:03.349> ruins<00:04:03.739> your<00:04:03.859> k/d

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
because even when you've got damage it's

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.930 
because even when you've got damage it's
still<00:04:06.799> really<00:04:06.980> bad<00:04:07.099> but<00:04:07.459> the<00:04:07.579> journey<00:04:07.790> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
still really bad but the journey the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.909 
still really bad but the journey the
getting<00:04:08.269> damage<00:04:08.599> is<00:04:08.780> super<00:04:09.410> hard<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.769> takes

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
getting damage is super hard it takes

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.830 
getting damage is super hard it takes
for<00:04:10.160> absolutely<00:04:10.579> ever<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.510> best<00:04:11.540> way<00:04:11.810> to

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
for absolutely ever and the best way to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.210 
for absolutely ever and the best way to
do<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.049> is<00:04:12.139> by<00:04:12.260> playing<00:04:12.500> drop<00:04:12.769> zone<00:04:12.980> because

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
super fast with them and it's a pretty

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.930 
super fast with them and it's a pretty
it's<00:05:36.800> a<00:05:36.889> pretty<00:05:36.919> bad<00:05:37.219> gun<00:05:37.490> outside<00:05:37.639> of<00:05:37.849> its

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
it's a pretty bad gun outside of its

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.100 
it's a pretty bad gun outside of its
range<00:05:38.120> as<00:05:38.270> I<00:05:38.360> mentioned<00:05:38.659> earlier<00:05:38.930> so<00:05:39.080> you

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
range as I mentioned earlier so you

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.629 
range as I mentioned earlier so you
definitely<00:05:39.650> definitely<00:05:39.770> definitely<00:05:40.280> need

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
definitely definitely definitely need

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.310 
definitely definitely definitely need
extreme<00:05:41.330> conditioning<00:05:41.750> on<00:05:41.900> in<00:05:41.990> fact<00:05:42.139> that's

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
extreme conditioning on in fact that's

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.560 
extreme conditioning on in fact that's
the<00:05:42.590> most<00:05:42.740> important<00:05:43.219> perk<00:05:43.430> so<00:05:44.060> yeah<00:05:44.419> guys

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
the most important perk so yeah guys

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
the most important perk so yeah guys
what<00:05:44.780> do<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:44.960> think<00:05:44.990> of<00:05:45.229> the<00:05:45.349> overall

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
what do I think of the overall

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.800 
what do I think of the overall
effectiveness<00:05:46.070> of<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.370> spars<00:05:46.729> I'd<00:05:47.180> say<00:05:47.570> it's

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
effectiveness of the spars I'd say it's

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.779 
effectiveness of the spars I'd say it's
definitely<00:05:47.900> a<00:05:48.409> gun<00:05:49.099> to<00:05:49.219> put<00:05:49.370> on<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.550> shelf

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
definitely a gun to put on the shelf

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:50.950 
definitely a gun to put on the shelf
