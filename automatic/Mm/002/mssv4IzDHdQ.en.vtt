I<00:00:31.870> realize<00:00:32.320> that<00:00:32.349> it<00:00:32.559> wouldn't<00:00:32.829> be<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:33.040> same

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
I realize that it wouldn't be the same

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.740 
I realize that it wouldn't be the same
if<00:00:33.280> I<00:00:33.550> showed<00:00:33.760> you<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.059> techniques<00:00:34.420> with<00:00:34.570> one

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
if I showed you the techniques with one

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.090 
if I showed you the techniques with one
of<00:00:34.870> my<00:00:34.960> professionally<00:00:35.589> trained<00:00:35.859> dogs

of my professionally trained dogs

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.040 
of my professionally trained dogs
because<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.030> moves<00:00:37.239> are<00:00:37.390> second<00:00:37.750> nature<00:00:37.780> to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
because the moves are second nature to

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.319 
because the moves are second nature to
them<00:00:38.199> so<00:00:38.649> instead<00:00:39.070> I<00:00:39.429> gave<00:00:39.789> my<00:00:39.940> friend<00:00:40.149> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.970 
people come over our house she tends to
jump<00:01:42.790> up<00:01:42.940> on<00:01:43.120> them<00:01:43.300> which<00:01:43.830> really<00:01:44.830> annoys

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
jump up on them which really annoys

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.760 
jump up on them which really annoys
people<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.910> she<00:01:46.720> doesn't<00:01:46.990> know<00:01:47.080> any<00:01:47.230> commands

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
people and she doesn't know any commands

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.150 
people and she doesn't know any commands
whatsoever<00:01:49.230> fortunately<00:01:50.230> for<00:01:50.410> us<00:01:50.440> she<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:51.040> a

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
whatsoever fortunately for us she is a

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.970 
whatsoever fortunately for us she is a
smaller<00:01:51.580> breed<00:01:51.970> so<00:01:52.900> we<00:01:53.020> don't<00:01:53.170> have<00:01:53.440> huge

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
smaller breed so we don't have huge

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.070 
smaller breed so we don't have huge
problems<00:01:54.220> but<00:01:54.820> if<00:01:54.910> your<00:01:55.060> dog<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.480> bigger<00:01:55.750> dog

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
problems but if your dog is a bigger dog

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.500 
problems but if your dog is a bigger dog
it's<00:01:56.350> especially<00:01:57.340> important<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.300> get<00:01:58.480> a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
it's especially important you get a

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.440 
it's especially important you get a
train<00:01:58.870> because<00:01:59.340> that<00:02:00.340> dog<00:02:00.610> could<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.240> some

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
train because that dog could do some

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.560 
train because that dog could do some
serious<00:02:01.690> damage<00:02:02.610> potentially<00:02:03.610> attacking

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
serious damage potentially attacking

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.540 
serious damage potentially attacking
someone<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.140> seriously<00:02:05.830> injuring<00:02:06.280> them

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
someone and seriously injuring them

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.270 
someone and seriously injuring them
that's<00:02:07.420> why<00:02:07.660> dog<00:02:07.930> training<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:08.950> so

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
that's why dog training is so so

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.670 
that's why dog training is so so
important<00:02:09.819> now<00:02:10.689> there's<00:02:10.869> other<00:02:11.019> dog<00:02:11.290> training

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
important now there's other dog training

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.180 
important now there's other dog training

they're<00:02:15.180> run<00:02:15.420> by<00:02:15.450> dog<00:02:16.440> trainers<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
they're run by dog trainers and the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.460 
they're run by dog trainers and the
techniques<00:02:18.150> are<00:02:18.300> demonstrated<00:02:18.990> on<00:02:19.170> there

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
techniques are demonstrated on there

professionally<00:02:20.460> trained<00:02:20.790> dogs<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:22.560> problem

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
professionally trained dogs the problem

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.100 
professionally trained dogs the problem
with<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.420> when<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.450> trainer<00:02:24.780> says

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
with that is when the trainer says

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.260 
with that is when the trainer says
something<00:02:25.530> because<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> dog<00:02:26.250> has<00:02:26.820> done<00:02:27.090> these

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
something because the dog has done these

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.170 
something because the dog has done these
things<00:02:27.300> over<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.290> over<00:02:28.410> again<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.970> dog

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
things over and over again the dog

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.480 
things over and over again the dog
automatically<00:02:30.960> listens<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:32.070> don't<00:02:32.250> get<00:02:32.370> to

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
automatically listens you don't get to

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.310 
automatically listens you don't get to
see<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.790> speed<00:02:33.090> bumps<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.720> problems

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
see the speed bumps and the problems

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.130 
see the speed bumps and the problems
that<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.640> trainer<00:02:35.940> had<00:02:36.270> when<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> trainer

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
that the trainer had when the trainer

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.670 
that the trainer had when the trainer
first<00:02:37.740> tried<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.610> those<00:02:38.820> techniques<00:02:39.270> and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
first tried out those techniques and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.050 
first tried out those techniques and
because<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.190> go<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.460> try<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.820> at<00:02:42.030> home

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
because of that you go to try it at home

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.600 
because of that you go to try it at home
the<00:02:43.050> same<00:02:43.320> things<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.770> he<00:02:43.980> shared<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:44.340> you

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the same things that he shared with you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.300 
the same things that he shared with you
and<00:02:44.820> when<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.960> do<00:02:46.200> run<00:02:46.470> into<00:02:46.500> problems<00:02:46.860> and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and when you do run into problems and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.430 
and when you do run into problems and
when<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.520> dog<00:02:47.700> doesn't<00:02:48.090> listen<00:02:48.480> even<00:02:49.320> though

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
when your dog doesn't listen even though

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.400 
when your dog doesn't listen even though
you<00:02:49.500> did<00:02:49.740> what<00:02:49.920> he<00:02:50.010> said<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:52.140> don't<00:02:52.320> know

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
you did what he said you don't know

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.470 
you did what he said you don't know
where<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.680> turn<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.730> don't<00:02:53.910> know<00:02:54.000> what<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.300> do

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
where to turn you don't know what to do

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.230 
where to turn you don't know what to do
that's<00:02:55.470> what<00:02:55.650> we're<00:02:55.800> trying<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.190> avoid<00:02:56.370> with

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
that's what we're trying to avoid with

very<00:03:03.900> little<00:03:04.020> about<00:03:04.320> dog<00:03:04.710> training<00:03:05.120> with<00:03:06.120> Lily

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
very little about dog training with Lily

very little about dog training with Lily
a<00:03:06.750> dog<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.650> does<00:03:07.860> have<00:03:08.100> problems<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:09.330> like

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
a dog that does have problems just like

a dog that does have problems just like
your<00:03:09.780> dog<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:11.040> way<00:03:11.280> when<00:03:11.520> we're<00:03:11.670> trying<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
your dog this way when we're trying the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.850 
your dog this way when we're trying the
techniques<00:03:12.570> for<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> first<00:03:13.110> time<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.440> Lily

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
techniques for the first time on Lily

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.680 
techniques for the first time on Lily
you'll<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.580> able<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.850> see<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.120> problems<00:03:15.570> we

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
you'll be able to see the problems we

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.750 
you'll be able to see the problems we
run<00:03:15.900> into<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.470> we'll<00:03:16.920> be<00:03:17.040> able<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.280> fix<00:03:17.550> those

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
run into and we'll be able to fix those

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.729 
run into and we'll be able to fix those
problems<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.540> spot<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.350> you<00:03:19.500> two

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
problems on the spot so that you two

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.830 
problems on the spot so that you two
when<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.100> have<00:03:20.310> them<00:03:20.690> understand<00:03:21.690> exactly

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
when you have them understand exactly

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.580 
when you have them understand exactly
what<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.500> do<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.360> purpose<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.959> this

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
what to do that is the purpose of this

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.290 
what to do that is the purpose of this
video<00:03:25.830> series<00:03:26.250> because<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.820> bottom<00:03:26.970> line<00:03:27.120> is

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
video series because the bottom line is

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.699 
video series because the bottom line is
if<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:27.930> do<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.550> well

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
if I can do it you can do it as well

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.199 
if I can do it you can do it as well
we're<00:03:31.709> going<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.950> put<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.280> easy<00:03:32.459> dog<00:03:32.760> training

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
we're going to put the easy dog training

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.870 
we're going to put the easy dog training
system<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.780> test<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.410> see<00:03:34.560> how<00:03:34.709> easy<00:03:35.040> these

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
system to the test to see how easy these

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.030 
system to the test to see how easy these
techniques<00:03:36.360> really<00:03:36.780> are<00:03:36.959> now<00:03:37.560> before<00:03:37.950> we

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
techniques really are now before we

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.220 
techniques really are now before we
start<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.400> training<00:03:38.700> there's<00:03:39.690> one<00:03:39.930> thing<00:03:40.080> you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
have this is the most important point we

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.930 
have this is the most important point we
can<00:04:37.080> make<00:04:37.290> before<00:04:37.620> we<00:04:37.979> even<00:04:38.100> start<00:04:38.490> training

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940
