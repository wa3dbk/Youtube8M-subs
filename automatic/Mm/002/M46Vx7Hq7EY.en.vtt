00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.950
 just before the video is here yet 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.379
 I wanted to inform you shortly 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.480
 that as the first part of this video 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 I got a king up first 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.490
 exactly so my first video buster 5 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.379
 but yes there can still 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.090
 what in between , that's why I know 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.250
 This is the first time here so anyway 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.240
 so hardly worry and stand there 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.160
 we are not so big now 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.199
 problem and then a lot of fun for the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.699
 video and had many 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.039
 I want my pension settings 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:43.170
 or my option the file 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:45.149
 there publish for the first part of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 Would subscribers 1,000 yes I see 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.100
 in the background sony vegas and starts 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.940
 Although I wish that many 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 yes had a third part 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.530
 have announced just do not tell 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.489
 what it is and rich very many 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.370
 I wish my pension 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.579
 or my option the file 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.080
 because publish because you stop many 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.330
 somehow full of my cattle celebrate 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.850
 attitude or else or mining games 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.080
 Yes, I think I do , but I wish 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.299
 you like it and it was good 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 and then hopefully just appeals 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.170
 out when the many have desired 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.970
 and yes, I just wanted to say we 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.750
 directly to me now just take it 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.890
 a stiff her such an intro family 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.590
 just such a very old altogether 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.110
 is old and not anymore on everyone 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.360
 here are my government here 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.380
 customize the template 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:43.259
 that's my attitude here and yes 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.250
 So I have only 1280 x 720 pixels 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.780
 because my screen is not anymore 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.170
 supported as he does not support 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.659
 1080p so I do not take the whole 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.310
 1080p on but sometimes 720 like 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.530
 said my budget does not support 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 or my laptop so yes 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.600
 the pixel in which both amount means 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.540
 I at the operator I have 20 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.219
 million because here you 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.829
 it just so quickly remembers so if 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.989
 you still have to test your customer somewhere 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.190
 whether you have children or something like that can 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.430
 it just faster with me 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.900
 makes video 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.640
 20 minutes I have 30 fps since I 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.189
 Find it is enough 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.840
 the number of terms I have two 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.939
 and I do not really have anything here 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.469
 if you change that, if I'm here 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.480
 interested if yes what else has 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.000
 there would just have to stop the video 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.849
 but from here about here 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.790
 At that time be directed to the description 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.030
 and from here, too , if you are 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.379
 this in some word or something 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.200
 there will be two screenshots and in the 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.459
 be description and is now 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.489
 finished goods always hollywood so so 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.560
 my pc world 8 bit then i have about 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.329
 the cattle trainer quality at full 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 resolution I did well to 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.290
 motion blur type at night out of that 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.719
 it is what many ice motionflow 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.180
 Describe the shabak in motion corridor 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.319
 and I believe such people as 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.389
 facelift the whole youtube the 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.519
 both of which also looks like 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.260
 I think all the cinemas but also 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.510
 that you go for gas or something 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.409
 Other things I should not look like 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.870
 with florena that's just ten years old 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.879
 and yes, here i have the field mission 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.659
 and the season actually again 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.819
 to here 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.280
 here the audio would have as I said 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.780
 stop at the one by the other 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.470
 will be units screenshot below 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.540
 so now we come to the tc the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.680
 many people also wanted to have people 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.079
 want to have people 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:44.739
 soy in shape and function xd well 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.269
 me here so it's just the investors 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.889
 Here are the ingame settings 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.439
 and that's how I like it 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.930
 at minecraft have set whether the 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:56.500
 bottle and fast plan should be out 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.319
 that everything would stop here 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.790
 let me just say it 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.829
 and yes you can down below the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.479
 descriptions now so darlings 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.030

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.409
 already say something about the special 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.989
 easier if you like the nice 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.209
 and yes then just would say 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.069

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.750
