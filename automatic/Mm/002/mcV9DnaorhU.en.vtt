00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.509
 Welcome to this dotcom tub 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.480
 hello everyone in this video we're going 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.700
 to study plat贸n and in this case the 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.850
 art concept is very broad 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.800
 as far as this thinker is concerned we are going 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.769
 to see what happens with art and why 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.820
 is linked to the concept of mimesis 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:26.380
 Mimesis in Greek means copy and how 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.480
 we saw in several videos of ducati na 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.640
 puntocom with respect to the plate well 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.640
 we know that the platter copies do not 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.739
 cease to be a copy of the world of 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.080
 ideas where things are 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.520
 real therefore to be able to understand 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.470
 this video we recommend that you make a 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.110
 brief review about the videos of the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.730
 Platonic theory of knowledge but 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.560
 good if you are already here want to continue 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.350
 learning about art as mimesis 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.540
 in plat贸n we are going to tell you that in 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.390
 his work the republic is going to 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.059
 differentiate three types of arts 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.700
 remember first that for the Greeks 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.129
 ancient art was not simply the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.320
 plastic art as we can consider 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.200
 nowadays but art was understood 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.600
 as a technique also then in his work 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.009
 Republican he will distinguish between 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.450
 arts that use things among the arts 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:26.350
 that produce things and among the arts that 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:29.360
 they imitate things yes of course these are 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.600
 contrary to what he considers plat贸n 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.539
 as the real thing but let's continue even more because 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.300
 he does not stop here he says good I'm going 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.490
 to make a more exhaustive analysis in what 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.590
 escalante respects and it is so in his 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.130
 work the sophist we are going to put here 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.680
 in your dialogue 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.130
 Sophist Plato will distinguish between what 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.630
 which are the aesthetic arts that are 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.630
 who use what they offer 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.240
 nature 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.979
 for example 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.979
 what is the house 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.650
 fishing to say some then we have the 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:19.859
 poetic arts that are the ones that produce 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.859
 what is not found in nature 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.140
 we are going to put like this not natural for example 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.180
 the art making tools by saying 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.440
 something or not 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.480
 the craftsmen who do 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.569
 tools and finally we have the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.220
 imitative arts and we're going to make a 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.530
 arrow and we're going to go directly 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.650
 talk a little about the imitative arts 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.959
 let's stay with this work this 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.459
 famous work of mango xxxii the sunflowers 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.950
 to illustrate a little bit this 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.990
 explanation that I'm going to give you this we 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.150
 gives clear examples of what this 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.670
 kind of imitative art but by the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.140
 concept you can understand art as 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.660
 copy 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.240
 like mimesis 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.170
 the art then 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.300
 as a copy and the degradation that it makes 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.760
 plate of the same say the art a 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:20.210
 work of art as a sculpture as a 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.210
 picture is for plate a copy 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.930
 from another copy 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.280
 if the sensible world things are 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.629
 copies of things from the world of 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.390
 ideas 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.610
 that reproduction of the copies or of 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.459
 the things of the sensible world are copies 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.800
 of another copy that is to say they are triple 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.790
 distance of being 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.400
 triple 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.490
 distance of being is very interesting 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.010
 this concept of art that raises plat贸n 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.870
 then for platon the plastic arts 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.290
 as we understand them today 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.840
 they occupy a very very inferior place they lack 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.730
 of objectivity we invite you to follow 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.490

 aesthetics if you want to learn more not
