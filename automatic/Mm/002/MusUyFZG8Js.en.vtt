00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hi, I decided to make a review about 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:14.910
 yogurt n &amp; n 560 speedlite in option 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.379
 3 wireless that works with 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.860
 any of the professors 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:25.660
 rf 602 and 631 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.470
 this you have to buy by brand 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.029
 and for no brand there are not two 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.309
 panic versions of two versions for 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.400
 canon but the only difference is changing 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.670
 is the type of cable that is included 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.070
 which is used to connect it to the camera and 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.910
 with your second transmitter shoot the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 cameras remotely 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.530
 all and do not think to use 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:56.239
 any conversions 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.719
 for the 613 3 it is assumed that only 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.589
 works with the network 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.150
 5 of Mac Donald 3 with 7 and there are 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.930
 a version according to what should work 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:13.170
 with the rebellious good this is going to be three 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.720
 in a rebellious dose and functional 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.860
 now we are recording with 15 of mar 3 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.460
 because I bought the 3 and it works 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.890
 as for comparison of physically 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 we can enter these flashes without 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.730
 no problem as to be seen in 580 of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.270
 canon 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.189
 they are practically identical 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.149
 It has some main differences 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:43.450
 for example the lack of firmness in a 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.380
 pressure safe mechanism to remove 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.799
 just from bottom up the button 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.729
 this one has but it has the shape of the button 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.729
 but 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.490
 does not have exactly the same entries 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.020
 helium and the 3d version of them never 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.180
 I had sides but I think both 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.240
 ministers buy specific for camera 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.090
 that is, you would have to buy a version 2 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.540
 for me with my version these are not highlighted 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.430
 They are universal for specific brands 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.840
 are the transmitters that does have 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.840
 check what the good ones are 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.570
 do the scientific test 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.430
 of the powers 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.550
 no longer 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.550
 what 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.800
 two 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.030
 channel 1 channel for how I'm going to measure 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:51.520
 the power of light here we have a 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.459
 it was calling 758 a light meter what 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.580
 let's do is shoot this 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.990
 distance 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.160
 at this distance to measure the light I'm going to 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.260
 try that the two are at the same 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.630
 parallel distance potentials then 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:13.560
 with the rebellion between solbes for 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:18.230
 this flash then there is those 100 to 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.230
 200 speed and it's going to give me the opening 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.010
 efe of 40 that means that I in 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.840
 this closed the lens up to 40 for 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.739
 that the exposure is correct to this 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.739
 distance channel 2 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.440
 ready 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.410
 so here if I shot 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.370
 this full power and you will need 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.370
 Flash recycling time 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.970
 my scientific test 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.770
 is that we are all born to the same 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.840
 distance 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:02.540
 let's repeat the experiment 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.540
 also shooting the jong 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.569
 here we press 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.150
 to effect 26 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.720
 the difference 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.720
 / 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:26.140
 36 efe 40 is a third of this 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.200
 would be df 29 32 36 and 40 is to it 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.860
 instance two to one to one the I do not 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:39.689
 it's a little less powerful 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:43.270
 that the canon 580 x for a stop test and 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:47.770
 400 dollars difference or 350 the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.169
 difference is a flash that is worth a lot 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.199
 more pain if you want to start doing what 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.979
 what is this that is to manage 23 classes one 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.979
 of those of 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:04.119
 580 canon has a cost of around 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:07.709
 450 or 500 hours and the games too 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:11.110
 they have little then the difference 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:12.729
 between one and the other by comparative power 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.909
 against the price difference 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.129
 I prefer to have 32 to have one of 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:21.580
 the others 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.240
 it is a great review I recommend it 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.300
 widely 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.419
 take advantage in version 3 honestly 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.599
 having three flashes and not having to 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:38.410
 walk around loading a transmitter for each 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:38.410
 one is our 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:52.449
 so that they use correctly 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.360
 and I hope its context
