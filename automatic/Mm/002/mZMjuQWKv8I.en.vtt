definitely<00:00:45.300> suggest<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> most<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
definitely suggest this one the most it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.720 
definitely suggest this one the most it
takes<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> little<00:00:46.829> getting<00:00:46.920> used<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.309> mostly

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
