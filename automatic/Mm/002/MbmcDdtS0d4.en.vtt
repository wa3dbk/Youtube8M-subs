00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
let's just get this going so the first

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.090 
let's just get this going so the first
one<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:19.020> these<00:00:19.289> two<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.890> is

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
one I have are these two and this is

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.580 
one I have are these two and this is
peppermint<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> quenched<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.539> these<00:00:22.350> two

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
peppermint and quenched and these two

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.830 
peppermint and quenched and these two
are<00:00:22.769> clear<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.580> they're<00:00:24.420> clear

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
are clear so they're clear

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420 
are clear so they're clear
I<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.320> peppermint<00:00:25.680> better<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> like

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
I like peppermint better that I like

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.330 
I like peppermint better that I like
quenched<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.000> think<00:00:27.240> quench<00:00:27.480> has<00:00:27.720> more<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.050> a

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
quenched I think quench has more of a

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.410 
quenched I think quench has more of a
chemically<00:00:29.340> taste<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.000> when<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.179> gets<00:00:30.269> in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
chemically taste to it when it gets in

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
chemically taste to it when it gets in
my<00:00:30.510> mouth<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.869> peppermint<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.710> very<00:00:32.009> um

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it has no taste to it it smells like

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260

peppermint<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.489> very<00:00:35.760> smooth<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.149> it's

peppermint it's very smooth and it's

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.580 
peppermint it's very smooth and it's
really<00:00:36.480> moisturizing<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.230> those<00:00:37.410> are
