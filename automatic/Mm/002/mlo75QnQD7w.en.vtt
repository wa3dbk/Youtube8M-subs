you<00:01:34.520> pull<00:01:34.700> out<00:01:34.789> the<00:01:34.970> sway<00:01:35.209> bar<00:01:35.450> links<00:01:36.440> from

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
you pull out the sway bar links from

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:45.550 
you pull out the sway bar links from
there<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:42.200> then<00:01:42.410> that<00:01:42.590> drops<00:01:42.800> out<00:01:44.470> pull<00:01:45.470> it

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
there and then that drops out pull it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.270 
there and then that drops out pull it
sway<00:01:45.890> bar<00:01:47.259> which<00:01:48.259> we<00:01:48.410> have<00:01:48.500> yet<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:48.679> do<00:01:48.979> and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
sway bar which we have yet to do and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.479 
sway bar which we have yet to do and
then<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.479> take<00:01:51.259> out<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.560> black<00:01:51.770> plastic

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:52.489 
then you take out the black plastic

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:55.449 
then you take out the black plastic
I<00:01:52.640> guess<00:01:53.000> it's<00:01:53.179> metal<00:01:53.860> black<00:01:54.860> metal<00:01:54.920> piece

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
I guess it's metal black metal piece

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:02.999 
I guess it's metal black metal piece
there

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.309 

these<00:02:04.009> bolts<00:02:04.310> there<00:02:04.610> which<00:02:04.849> I<00:02:05.209> never<00:02:06.080> move

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
these bolts there which I never move

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.419 
these bolts there which I never move
because<00:02:06.619> we<00:02:06.649> actually<00:02:06.890> took<00:02:07.160> out<00:02:07.250> the
