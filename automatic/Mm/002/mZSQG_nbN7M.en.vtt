00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.810 
even though he was really struggling by
by<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.630> point<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:16.070> he<00:04:16.130> was<00:04:16.250> determined<00:04:16.520> to

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
by that point but he was determined to

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.810 
by that point but he was determined to
make<00:04:17.270> that<00:04:17.450> walk<00:04:17.600> on<00:04:17.780> his<00:04:17.840> own<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.950> do<00:04:19.460> think<00:04:19.760> it

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
make that walk on his own I do think it

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.490 
make that walk on his own I do think it
was<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.940> very<00:04:20.120> proud<00:04:20.420> man<00:04:20.870> he<00:04:21.109> wouldn't<00:04:21.290> have

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
was a very proud man he wouldn't have

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.720 
was a very proud man he wouldn't have
any<00:04:23.080> any<00:04:24.080> help<00:04:24.440> he<00:04:24.710> wanted<00:04:24.980> to<00:04:25.070> walk<00:04:25.250> unaided

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
any any help he wanted to walk unaided

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.910 
any any help he wanted to walk unaided
it<00:04:26.150> wouldn't<00:04:26.390> have<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.540> stick<00:04:26.900> or<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.260> frame<00:04:27.650> or<00:04:27.860> I

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
it wouldn't have a stick or a frame or I

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.770 
it wouldn't have a stick or a frame or I
think<00:04:27.980> his<00:04:28.730> family<00:04:29.060> bought<00:04:29.330> them<00:04:29.570> but<00:04:29.720> he

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
think his family bought them but he

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.350 
think his family bought them but he
wouldn't<00:04:29.990> use<00:04:30.410> them<00:04:30.820> but<00:04:31.820> he<00:04:31.910> always<00:04:32.030> wanted

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
wouldn't use them but he always wanted

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.230 
wouldn't use them but he always wanted
to<00:04:32.420> get<00:04:32.630> along<00:04:33.010> himself<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.340> had<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.670> real<00:04:34.910> kind

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
to get along himself and had a real kind

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.820 
to get along himself and had a real kind
of<00:04:35.330> fierce<00:04:36.260> sort<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.560> determination<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.310> think

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
of fierce sort of determination I think

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.980 
of fierce sort of determination I think
so<00:04:39.520> yeah<00:04:39.699> he<00:04:39.759> was<00:04:39.879> just<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.120> wonderful<00:04:40.210> man<00:04:40.509> and

relatives

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
relatives

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.719 
relatives
I<00:04:54.639> liked<00:04:55.530> granddad<00:04:56.530> used<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.770> tell<00:04:57.009> me<00:04:57.159> what<00:04:57.699> a

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
I liked granddad used to tell me what a

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.930 
I liked granddad used to tell me what a
talent<00:04:58.569> Bert<00:04:58.780> was<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.289> he<00:04:59.440> he<00:04:59.949> spoke<00:05:00.220> about

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
talent Bert was and he he spoke about

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.050 
talent Bert was and he he spoke about
Burton<00:05:01.539> really<00:05:02.229> revered<00:05:03.039> tones<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.669> said

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
Burton really revered tones and said

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.330 
Burton really revered tones and said
that<00:05:04.240> he<00:05:04.870> just<00:05:05.409> marveled<00:05:05.830> at<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.009> way<00:05:06.129> that

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
that he just marveled at the way that

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.170 
that he just marveled at the way that
Bert<00:05:06.940> could<00:05:07.300> turn<00:05:08.169> turn<00:05:08.979> midair<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.789> make

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
Bert could turn turn midair to make

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.029 
Bert could turn turn midair to make
saves<00:05:10.479> and<00:05:10.750> I<00:05:10.780> think<00:05:10.960> that's<00:05:11.139> what<00:05:11.440> Bert's

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
saves and I think that's what Bert's

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.059 
saves and I think that's what Bert's
agility<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.449> is<00:05:14.409> I<00:05:14.650> think<00:05:14.710> what<00:05:14.919> people

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
agility is the is I think what people

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.430 
agility is the is I think what people
will<00:05:15.430> remember<00:05:15.460> him<00:05:16.030> by<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:16.419> think<00:05:16.630> so

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
will remember him by and I think so

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.710 
will remember him by and I think so
therefore<00:05:17.889> if<00:05:18.099> you<00:05:18.280> you<00:05:18.880> then<00:05:19.060> transmit<00:05:19.539> that

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
therefore if you you then transmit that

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.080 
therefore if you you then transmit that
to<00:05:19.780> today's<00:05:20.380> goalkeepers<00:05:21.130> where<00:05:21.759> you<00:05:22.000> know

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
to today's goalkeepers where you know

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.610 
to today's goalkeepers where you know
they<00:05:22.210> need<00:05:22.360> to<00:05:22.389> be<00:05:22.509> the<00:05:22.810> balls<00:05:22.990> you<00:05:23.409> know<00:05:23.530> it's

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
they need to be the balls you know it's

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.839 
they need to be the balls you know it's
a<00:05:23.680> lot<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:23.830> light<00:05:24.009> of<00:05:24.220> its<00:05:24.340> flying<00:05:24.550> through<00:05:24.759> the

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
a lot of light of its flying through the

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.439 
a lot of light of its flying through the
air<00:05:24.880> on<00:05:25.000> these<00:05:25.270> excellent<00:05:25.830> pitches<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:28.210> and

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
air on these excellent pitches and and

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.939 
air on these excellent pitches and and
goalkeepers<00:05:28.960> have<00:05:29.050> so<00:05:29.199> much<00:05:29.289> more<00:05:29.440> protection

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
goalkeepers have so much more protection

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.270 
goalkeepers have so much more protection
from<00:05:30.099> referees<00:05:30.520> than<00:05:31.120> they<00:05:31.240> did<00:05:31.300> in<00:05:31.419> his<00:05:31.630> day<00:05:31.840> I

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
from referees than they did in his day I

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.140 
from referees than they did in his day I
think<00:05:33.280> he<00:05:33.340> would<00:05:33.490> have<00:05:33.550> been<00:05:33.699> you<00:05:34.000> know<00:05:34.030> just

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
think he would have been you know just

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.980 
think he would have been you know just
as<00:05:34.569> spectacular<00:05:36.060> now<00:05:37.060> as<00:05:37.240> he<00:05:37.330> as<00:05:37.449> he<00:05:37.569> was<00:05:37.750> then

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
as spectacular now as he as he was then

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.080 
as spectacular now as he as he was then
because<00:05:38.620> he'd<00:05:38.830> have<00:05:38.919> had<00:05:39.039> the<00:05:39.159> benefits<00:05:39.879> of

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
because he'd have had the benefits of

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.749 
because he'd have had the benefits of
you<00:05:40.960> know<00:05:41.080> better<00:05:41.319> fitness<00:05:42.099> diet<00:05:42.310> and

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 
you know better fitness diet and

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.089 
you know better fitness diet and
