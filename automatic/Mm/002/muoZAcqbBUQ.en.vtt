gravity drop the cash bail these are
your<00:01:02.879> internal<00:01:03.210> valves<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.189> they're

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
your internal valves here they're

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.800 
your internal valves here they're
operated<00:01:05.670> by<00:01:05.790> air<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.450> there's<00:01:06.630> four

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
operated by air so there's four

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.020

same<00:01:34.020> thing<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.680> know<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.040> case<00:01:35.630> i'm

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
same thing you know in this case i'm

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.100 
same thing you know in this case i'm
blackhearted<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.509> 1203<00:01:39.509> which<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.900> for

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
blackhearted here with 1203 which is for

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.249 
blackhearted here with 1203 which is for
regular<00:01:40.920> gasoline<00:01:41.509> because<00:01:42.509> i<00:01:42.540> had<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.990> whole

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
regular gasoline because i had one whole

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.749 
regular gasoline because i had one whole
one<00:01:43.920> compartment<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:45.200> full<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.259> gasoline<00:01:46.759> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
one compartment here full of gasoline it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.800 
one compartment here full of gasoline it
has<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> higher<00:01:49.820> volatility<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.600> always

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
has a higher volatility so you always

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
has a higher volatility so you always
plac<00:01:52.140> hard<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> product

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
plac hard for the one for the product

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.480 
plac hard for the one for the product
with<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.909> highest<00:01:55.460> volatility<00:01:56.460> or

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
with the highest volatility or

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.910 
with the highest volatility or
flashpoint<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.780> case<00:01:58.049> gasoline<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> lot

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
flashpoint this case gasoline is a lot

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.929 
flashpoint this case gasoline is a lot
higher<00:01:59.159> than<00:01:59.340> diesel<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:02.189> pup<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
higher than diesel so the pup here the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.990 
higher than diesel so the pup here the
back<00:02:03.420> trailer<00:02:03.920> they<00:02:04.920> had<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.280> compartment<00:02:05.670> of
