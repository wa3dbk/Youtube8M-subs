 a super card for red deck for three 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.690
 Mile 2 2 fly parts is definite 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 solid 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 if your man is your cemetery in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.229
 harms your opponent with one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.850
 red spontaneous sex should be theirs again 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.920
 so you can take it easy 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.090
 for the club it will be easier later 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:26.850
 we have and come here relatively seamlessly 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 conscious number two and yes I have 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.189
 I think my card back through 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.590
 let it flash but I do not have it 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.090

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.229

 Spells in this turn play like that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.249
 Of course, what do you always play off and 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.319
 then it's off right when the opponent can 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:03.299
 he kick me off they go from nothing 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.520
 Of course with you the advantage is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.319
 Nice card then come iso concepts

 me always a little person change 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.340
 by Schreiber mostly alone and the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.870
 opponent is someday easy 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.400
 also pissed off of you because of that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.500
 something I recommend actually nevertheless 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.610
 rather reluctantly goes on with my 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.299
 office ambos are approaching us the last 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.849
 map and we have a pyro merz 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.349
 arranged to five men an artifact and 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.880
 hear a red spontaneous spell of the 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.200
 witchcraft you control yourself or 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.140
 a red planpotter the man 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.549

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.440

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.629
 You have to be careful too 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.840
 After all, enjoying it costs five men 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.590

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.410
 bosses blow away death burn 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.180
 if you should have five painters at all 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.530
 my opponents have almost defeated 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.290
 or stop the last damage points 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.319
 with the 5 x press as well as with 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.049
 so be sure to enjoy my watch 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.500

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.530
 advanced players because he is 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.540

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.919
