00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 good with juan carlos now see the figure 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.569
 of the party I think the important thing that 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.120
 they ended up with two less players and 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.410
 also with the base invites you never to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.410
 they had been able to achieve the championship 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.330
 it was to have been that but 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.960
 as a bad Argentine party was 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.789
 higher 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.430
 but we rescued a point but nothing 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:28.480
 agree above all for the performance 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.480
 a match with racing 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.260
 your reading from the arch 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.240
 piculín and ramírez movements 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.550
 which because they left you in counted 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.530
 occasions in some human man 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.990
 they caused our disorganization and 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.600
 us when we mess up 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.690
 we suffer then 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.059
 then with that we could not correct it 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.589
 except until when we are with 9 that 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.659
 there is if we correct it because we put two 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.699
 lines of four and we work it very 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.159
 well almost did not progress them but 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.480
 when we have with 11 we despair 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.059
 by going in search of the ball for 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.110
 reverse the game and it find the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.399
 spaces that came to look for and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.220
 Argentines the team that plays well with 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.960
 the ball and has fast players and 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.110
 disequilibrating and good they asserted 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.440
 that inclusion in your game and the best that 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.970
 we have been consistently in the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.399
 matches of grains many times is not 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.289
 for being the figures Juan Carlos and the 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.819
 question is it is a bit counterproductive 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.039
 also for the team that you are 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.009
 always the figure for how this is coming 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.940
 belgrano in pos say of or rather 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.179
 in the middle of a run 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.179
 collective 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.140
 a lot without doubt that sometimes and 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.090
 circumstances, maybe take two 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.009
 balls was not so much either yes there was 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.719
 maybe bottles with the image of the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.700
 clear domain of Argentine unions of 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.530
 game but they were not as many 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.990
 Goal situations do not interrupt a 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.700
 second attacker a criminal 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.920
 they were 22 and all 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.530
 but still they were superior to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.330
 see but 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.280
 if you do not owe what I told you before and we 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.720
 we mess up we suffer we are a team 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 that is worked to play in the 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.710
 order and not in disorder 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.850
 today we despair when Argentine 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.100
 started to handle the ball 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.259
 we are far from the marks away from the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.730
 ball away from the position we did not 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.170
 a long team and they find the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.390
 when they find spaces they play well and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.200
 they make you suffer caused a wear 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.970
 important us and good played 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.379
 they created situations once the figure 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.379
 of the party thanks to then
