00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.280
 hello dear gardeners us 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.679
 Why not go on our so 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.539
 winner you set your comments 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.110
 questions after seeing our 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:25.130
 videos and here is the last time very 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.289
 many ask why roses are not 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.809
 All branches have buds 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.870
 and some bushes are just like 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:36.160
 frozen do not grow and do not give buds 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.200
 Now we will not show such a rosette 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.320
 explain what to do with it here 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.579
 look here is a small bone young 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.510
 roses and that's just two shoots 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.379
 there are buds here on this and on this one 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.059
 that's basically every escape of a rose 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.129
 should end with either a bud or 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.499
 he continues to grow 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.190
 these are young leaves of red 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.950
 tekke 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.229
 either on some varieties they don't 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.860
 red and vice versa pale green 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.800
 so still and juicy salad color but 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.920
 look how many shoots are here which 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.829
 has no such continuation no bud no 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:28.520
 see here growth of these leaflets here 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:31.280
 here here here here how fluffy 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.890
 escape or should understand what is here with it 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.240
 it happened here 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.659
 be someone his and volume 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.189
 and here you look there is nothing and 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.520
 there are no buds and there are no growth leaves 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.100
 This kidney is as if the fetus has fallen asleep. 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.500
 evolved nothing out of her 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.979
 neither bud will continue 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:01.490
 escapes and look for such escapes 1 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:05.770
 2 3 4 and over there 5 more that is instead of 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.830
 two flowers on this rose would be seven 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.960
 that's what to do with such a rose and why here 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.890
 such things happen at all 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.610
 single opinion 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.980
 why do they fall asleep as these here say 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.890
 shoots shoots are called sleep Do 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.930
 blind shoots then there is this tip and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.740
 I will run off of it as if blinded and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.250
 growing hive blind shoots it is such 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.209
 the term is already entrenched here at gardeners 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.980
 cheers for plants and often grow roses 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.660
 That is why they are such shoots fall asleep 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.880
 incomprehensible this may be due to 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.350
 by some 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.310
 disasters in the weather for example it 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.870
 frost 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.370
 or vice versa is very strong heat or you and 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.180
 sprinkled very some may be themselves 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.519
 strong 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.010
 Are more chemicals something very some 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.580
 stress revealing birth survived 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.560
 Here, for example, this year were enough 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.140
 cold 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.320
 matinee several times, and even that's not 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.450
 in our garden it was quite possible that that's 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.630
 Kert just influenced the fact that here 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.340
 these shoots fell asleep 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.370
 the most interesting thing here is 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.150
 so as to leave nothing to escape this 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.180
 do with him then he will not have any 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.810
 not side shoots not such buds 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.720
 nowhere does he appear he fell asleep to himself and here 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.209
 need this rose somehow 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.709
 wake up and force her again section 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.620
 will help with this 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.980
 pruning only prune need not like this 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.700
 not the edge of the cut do not regret 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.239
 need low we arrange stress this 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:59.459
 I see a plant like this 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.650
 I also cut off this rosette from here 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.590
 sinus leaves 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.650
 will give a new sprout here with her 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.810
 the kidney will swell and from there 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.150
 go side escape and this one already 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.420
 side escape is quite possible that he 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.039
 will give a bud further here it is also victories I 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:25.050
 I cut it like this and it wins me too 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.860
 pruned here before this leaf and this one 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.580
 escape, too, cut off 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:36.280
 the house of that fox. where can be formed 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:40.870
 . here's another escape is we him 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.439
 we cut it like that that is, the rose stings in 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.349
 this case is not necessary if we are first 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:51.219
 here it is only the tip cut off 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:54.219
 before then if we even go and escape 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:57.099
 then he will be weak thin and what 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:59.710
 below we made the pruning the stronger and 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:03.430
 more powerful go these here side shoots 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.430
 and they are quite possibly formed 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.279
 Buds well, so here it will be necessary 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.969
 sleeping beauty so she pleased 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.969
 you flowers
