00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
filter okay much larger much more area I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
filter okay much larger much more area I
much<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.099> power<00:00:26.840> okay<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:29.570> get<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
much more power okay what you do get the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.740 
much more power okay what you do get the
base<00:00:31.790> which<00:00:32.790> comes<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.239> these<00:00:33.329> obviously

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
base which comes with these obviously

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.319 
base which comes with these obviously
get<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> grown<00:00:34.140> top<00:00:34.410> why<00:00:34.860> not

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
get a grown top why not

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.350 
get a grown top why not
okay<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.630> base<00:00:37.460> cut<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.149> used

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
okay get the base cut it out I just used

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.590 
okay get the base cut it out I just used
a<00:00:39.480> pair<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> tin<00:00:39.899> snips<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> file<00:00:41.450> make<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
a pair of tin snips in a file make it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.110 
a pair of tin snips in a file make it
the<00:00:42.690> same<00:00:42.870> size<00:00:44.690> as<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.899> old<00:00:46.050> filter<00:00:46.969> okay<00:00:47.969> as

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the same size as your old filter okay as

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.729 
the same size as your old filter okay as
you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.750> Ridge<00:00:49.050> needs<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you can see that Ridge needs to be the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.260 
you can see that Ridge needs to be the
same<00:00:50.600> now<00:00:51.600> how<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> seal<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> go

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
same now how will it seal here you go

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.799 
same now how will it seal here you go
double-sided<00:00:54.270> rubber<00:00:54.660> stuck<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:57.660> will

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
double-sided rubber stuck on that will

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.760 
double-sided rubber stuck on that will
basically<00:00:57.989> sit<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.559> top<00:00:58.770> III<00:00:59.129> hundred<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.460> mixer

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
basically sit on top III hundred a mixer

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.189 
basically sit on top III hundred a mixer
get<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:01.859> air<00:01:01.949> filter<00:01:02.660> this<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:03.840> fit<00:01:04.019> on

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
get your air filter this will fit on

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.300 
get your air filter this will fit on
here<00:01:04.790> now<00:01:05.850> mmm-hmm

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
here now mmm-hmm

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.980 
here now mmm-hmm
your<00:01:08.310> old<00:01:08.490> top<00:01:08.970> obviously<00:01:09.540> isn't<00:01:09.689> big<00:01:09.900> enough

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
your old top obviously isn't big enough

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.340 
your old top obviously isn't big enough
because<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.490> air<00:01:11.580> filters<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.840> effective

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
because the air filters more effective

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780 
because the air filters more effective
and<00:01:13.590> therefore<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.250> lot<00:01:14.460> bigger

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and therefore a lot bigger

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.539 
and therefore a lot bigger
okay<00:01:16.939> there's<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:18.259> crankcase<00:01:19.259> breather<00:01:19.549> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
okay there's your crankcase breather so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.210 
okay there's your crankcase breather so
what<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> did<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.680> obviously<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
what I did you can obviously do this a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.070

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
allow for this thing sticking down if

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.890 
allow for this thing sticking down if
you've<00:01:38.369> got<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.820> okay<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.540> crankcase

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you've got one okay for you crankcase

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.660 
you've got one okay for you crankcase
breather<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:41.009> basically<00:01:41.400> what<00:01:41.490> we're<00:01:41.610> gonna

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
breather and basically what we're gonna

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.140 
breather and basically what we're gonna
do

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
do

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.590 
do
stick<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.729> okay<00:01:44.729> clamp<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.450> down

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
stick that on there okay clamp that down

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.080 
stick that on there okay clamp that down
and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.439> obviously<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.310> far<00:01:48.210> bigger

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
and then you obviously have a far bigger

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.270 
and then you obviously have a far bigger
much<00:01:51.090> cheaper<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:51.780> well<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.409> buy<00:01:52.560> air<00:01:52.890> filter

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
much cheaper as well to buy air filter

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.469 
much cheaper as well to buy air filter
you<00:01:53.399> don't<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.790> use<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> official<00:01:54.329> imp

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you don't have to use the official imp

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.130 
you don't have to use the official imp
Co<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:55.310> okay<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.520> will<00:01:57.479> show<00:01:57.869> your<00:01:58.020> video

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
Co one okay I will show your video

Co one okay I will show your video
tomorrow<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.130> fitted<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.790> my

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
tomorrow if it actually fitted on my

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.569 
tomorrow if it actually fitted on my
Dodge<00:02:00.210> Ram<00:02:01.579> uses<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.670> model<00:02:04.159> yeah<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.189> think<00:02:05.280> it

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
Dodge Ram uses a model yeah I think it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.430 
Dodge Ram uses a model yeah I think it
is<00:02:06.229> vaporizer<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.270> 300<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.360> mixer<00:02:09.750> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
is vaporizer and the 300 a mixer so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.580 
is vaporizer and the 300 a mixer so
basically<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:10.890> we're<00:02:11.009> gonna<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.310> now

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
basically what we're gonna do now

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.050 
basically what we're gonna do now
stick<00:02:13.590> some<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.980> double-sided<00:02:14.430> rubber<00:02:14.850> on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
stick some of the double-sided rubber on

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.720 
stick some of the double-sided rubber on
there<00:02:15.800> okay<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.010> will<00:02:17.160> then<00:02:17.310> make<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.490> good

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
there okay that will then make a good
