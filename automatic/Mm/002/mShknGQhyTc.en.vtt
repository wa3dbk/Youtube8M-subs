do this sorry I just can't figure this

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.260 
do this sorry I just can't figure this
video<00:01:39.750> thing<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.140> okay<00:01:40.500> um<00:01:41.000> another<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
video thing out okay um another way to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.609 
video thing out okay um another way to
do<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.689> would<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:44.450> take<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> sides

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
do it would be to take one of the sides

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.280 
do it would be to take one of the sides
and<00:01:46.829> wrap<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> around<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.990> same<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and wrap it around the back same as the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.350 
and wrap it around the back same as the
other<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.329> then<00:01:52.399> just<00:01:53.399> tie<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> side

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
other and then just tie it on the side

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.039 
other and then just tie it on the side
so<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:59.210> second<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.329> wear<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so this is a second way to wear it and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.399 
so this is a second way to wear it and
you<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.829> mess<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.369> sleeves

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
you know you can mess with the sleeves

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.169 
you know you can mess with the sleeves

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
leaving it longer and tying it on the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:32.930 
leaving it longer and tying it on the
side<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:28.560> know<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.050> um<00:03:31.700> another<00:03:32.700> way

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
side you know like that um another way

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.530 
side you know like that um another way
would<00:03:33.510> be<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:35.750> actually<00:03:36.750> reverse<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.260> out<00:03:38.540> so

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
would be to actually reverse it out so

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.940 
would be to actually reverse it out so
this<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.380> way<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.740> would<00:03:40.830> normally

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
this is the way that it would normally

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.780 
this is the way that it would normally
go<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.850> see<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.150> tags<00:03:42.390> right<00:03:42.600> here<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:44.459> take

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
go to see the tags right here but take

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.770 
go to see the tags right here but take
it<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.090> put<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.330> on<00:03:45.480> backwards<00:03:49.489> from<00:03:50.489> there

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
it and put it on backwards from there

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.820 
it and put it on backwards from there
you<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:51.930> do<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.080> couple<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.500> different<00:03:52.770> things

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
you can do a couple of different things

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.670 
you can do a couple of different things
you<00:03:53.330> can<00:03:54.330> just<00:03:54.810> simply<00:03:55.620> tie<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.640> back<00:03:57.680> back

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
you can just simply tie the back back

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:09.530 
you can just simply tie the back back
here<00:04:02.480> like<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:06.530> um<00:04:07.670> that's<00:04:08.670> not<00:04:08.850> very<00:04:09.000> cute<00:04:09.300> of

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
here like so um that's not very cute of

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.010 
here like so um that's not very cute of
a<00:04:09.720> bow<00:04:09.900> but<00:04:10.440> you<00:04:10.650> know<00:04:11.390> kanessa<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.540> want<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.900> and

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
a bow but you know kanessa I want it and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.670 
a bow but you know kanessa I want it and
make<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.290> not<00:04:13.650> cuter<00:04:14.630> and<00:04:15.630> then<00:04:16.260> another<00:04:16.410> way

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
make that not cuter and then another way

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.320 
make that not cuter and then another way
would<00:04:16.830> be<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:19.160> wrap<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.400> around<00:04:20.580> like<00:04:22.070> so

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
would be to wrap it around like so

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.110 
would be to wrap it around like so
and<00:04:24.830> then<00:04:25.830> tie<00:04:26.129> it<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.520> side<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:30.090> can

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
and then tie it on the side and you can

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.869 
and then tie it on the side and you can
mess<00:04:30.419> up<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.599> shoulders<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.259> can<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:32.759> know

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
mess up the shoulders you can you know

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.879 
mess up the shoulders you can you know
bring<00:04:33.629> it<00:04:33.780> down<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:33.960> little<00:04:34.169> bit<00:04:34.319> if<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.620> wanted

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
bring it down a little bit if you wanted

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.990 
bring it down a little bit if you wanted
to<00:04:35.069> to<00:04:36.030> make<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.270> look<00:04:36.360> like<00:04:36.509> that<00:04:37.789> and<00:04:38.789> then

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
to to make it look like that and then

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.460 
to to make it look like that and then
last<00:04:39.720> but<00:04:39.900> not<00:04:40.050> least<00:04:40.470> would<00:04:41.280> be<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.900> back<00:04:43.110> the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
last but not least would be so back the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:55.640 
last but not least would be so back the
original<00:04:43.740> way<00:04:53.300> all<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.449> do<00:04:54.569> is<00:04:54.690> take<00:04:54.900> this<00:04:55.110> one
