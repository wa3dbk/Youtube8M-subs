first learned about urban decay I always

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.680 
first learned about urban decay I always
thought<00:03:59.549> that<00:03:59.729> they<00:03:59.970> were<00:04:00.030> all<00:04:00.239> about<00:04:00.449> bright

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
thought that they were all about bright

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.330 
thought that they were all about bright
colors<00:04:01.049> so<00:04:01.229> it's<00:04:01.379> really<00:04:01.650> nice<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:01.919> see<00:04:02.069> them

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
do something to I guess get back to the

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.729
