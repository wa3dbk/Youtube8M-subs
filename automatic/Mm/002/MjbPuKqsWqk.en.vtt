profit will have to walk about two and a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
profit will have to walk about two and a
half<00:00:47.790> miles<00:00:48.360> down<00:00:48.960> along<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> side<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:07.490 
river in order to even be able to crawl
and<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.159> think<00:00:53.900> that's<00:00:54.900> fine

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.250 

water<00:01:08.500> but<00:01:09.130> they<00:01:09.310> actually<00:01:09.670> filmed<00:01:09.940> from<00:01:10.600> down

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
water but they actually filmed from down

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.340 
water but they actually filmed from down
here<00:01:11.620> looking<00:01:11.860> back<00:01:12.340> up<00:01:12.640> at<00:01:12.940> Fontana<00:01:13.900> Dam<00:01:14.110> so

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
here looking back up at Fontana Dam so

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
here looking back up at Fontana Dam so
that's<00:01:14.500> maybe<00:01:14.650> one<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.010> reasons<00:01:15.310> that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
that's maybe one of the reasons that

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.250 
that's maybe one of the reasons that
this<00:01:15.640> dam<00:01:15.940> is<00:01:16.120> more<00:01:16.360> famous<00:01:16.600> than<00:01:16.780> any<00:01:17.050> other
