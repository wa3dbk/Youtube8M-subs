00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.170
 ironically, in recent days a film had turned to trani 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.630
 on the story of a truck driver who goes from Jerusalem to Jerusalem 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.380
 on the contrary, he traces the apostle Paul's path 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.510
 the figure of the saint to save day orta nova track of 32 years but it is 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.260
 scary pole this morning with your 16bis highway truck yourself 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.870
 bari direction to the underlying properties with the tractor is 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.019
 precipitated on the solar slab of a car garage daughter 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.410
 he managed to get out of it with his head wounded in his bloody face while 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.050
 these anger on fire then 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.080
 he hurled himself down to save his broken leg 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.590
 duomo is now hospitalized in the Andria hospital with a long one 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.380

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:51.789
 his truck remained almost all day long on the road 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.419
 elevated and those houses surrounded by space debris especially from those 280 

00:00:57.419 --> 00:01:01.219
 tons of fresh egg pasta that the man was carrying in Lecce 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.970
 and that instead have become involuntary protagonists of the post-accident in the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.680
 In fact, there have been so many passers-by who have been recovery operations 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.009
 stop out of curiosity 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.079
 and not a few who took away packets of pasta 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.740
 many kitty type 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.950
 for the truth, the initial goal is more than acceptable 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.010
 was to turn away the cargo lost to caritas and other communities to which 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.700
 afferent subjects or with advantages and so it was doing in a 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.380
 first moment but with the passing of the minutes the pressure of the people 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.229
 you become unstoppable and the uncontrolled assault has started and there are also those 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.840
 took away merchandise by pretending to be a caritas volunteer you went to 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.259
 board of a blue van then from the caritas it was learned that theirs is from 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.979
 white color and when it was decided that there was no more time and needed 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.200
 start the complicated removal of the vehicle and then take action 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.329
 bulldozer of the newco people expected that this would unload everything in the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.450
 container destined to landfill 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.649
 who raided pasta from there 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.590
 oven assault scenes of crutches despite logistical difficulties 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.420
 egregious summer work of carabinieri traffic police firemen 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.180
 operators of my environmental services as well as rescuers 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.650
 of the 118 and the emergency radio operators the removal of the medium and came in 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.960
 evening and therefore for the whole day discomforts have registered for the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.640
 circulation both along the axis i cb7 and on the underlying superga way for i 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.479
 curious 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.749
 meanwhile, people wonder what would have happened if the accident had happened 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.549
 verified on Tuesday with vehicles and market stalls underneath 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.989
 weekly but foster the answer they would have given to those at the beginning 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.839
 of the 80s were the architects of the urban planning choices that predicted that the 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:49.479
 road passes seeds palaces with a lot of junction under the house to these problems 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.349
 were it should have been thought in time with the appropriate work by 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.349
 prevention by those who are responsible for these things 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.599
 who 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.790
 hahaha
