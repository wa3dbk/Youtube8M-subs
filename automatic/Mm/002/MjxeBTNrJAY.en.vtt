00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
little bit now they've added a Tesla

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.979 
little bit now they've added a Tesla
generator<00:00:57.230> um<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.390> just<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> ray

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
generator um which is just like a ray

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.820 
generator um which is just like a ray
gun<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.590> goes<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:03.080> I<00:01:04.080> haven't

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
can see the price of them the next one

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.030 
can see the price of them the next one
is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.820> prototype<00:01:09.270> PSR<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.590> which<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
is a prototype PSR one which is a

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880 
is a prototype PSR one which is a
railgun<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> damages<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
railgun as you see the damages all the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.160 
railgun as you see the damages all the
way<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.420> one-shot<00:01:15.930> kill

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
way up which is like a one-shot kill

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.570 
way up which is like a one-shot kill
it's<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> sniper<00:01:17.369> rifle<00:01:18.530> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's going to be like a sniper rifle and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.910 
it's going to be like a sniper rifle and
it<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.509> collaterals<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.619> like

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it you can get collaterals with it like

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100 
it you can get collaterals with it like
once<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> hits<00:01:23.700> something<00:01:23.970> or<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> big<00:01:24.930> win

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
once it hits something or it's a big win

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.880 
once it hits something or it's a big win
it<00:01:25.259> once<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> hit<00:01:25.830> somebody<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.520> keeps<00:01:27.000> going

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
it once it hit somebody it keeps going

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.880 
it once it hit somebody it keeps going
so<00:01:28.890> um<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.110> actually<00:01:31.110> play<00:01:31.470> around<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
so um I actually play around with that

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
so um I actually play around with that
maybe<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> montage<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> since<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.720> can

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
maybe do a montage with it since I can

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.270 
maybe do a montage with it since I can
get<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.110> doubles<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.590> triples<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:35.070> one

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
get like doubles and triples with one

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.510 
get like doubles and triples with one
shot<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.200> let's<00:01:37.380> jump<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.220> our

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
shot and then let's jump in to our

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.219 
shot and then let's jump in to our
Premium<00:01:39.320> which<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.650> grenade<00:01:41.130> launcher

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
Premium which is a grenade launcher

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.260 
Premium which is a grenade launcher
those<00:01:43.229> small<00:01:43.619> maps<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
those small maps that we have just got a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
those small maps that we have just got a
little<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.750> hectic<00:01:46.110> Oh<00:01:47.299> a<00:01:48.299> little<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:49.340> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
little more hectic Oh a little more I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
little more hectic Oh a little more I
think<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.149> all<00:01:51.299> yeah<00:01:51.780> bigger<00:01:52.229> nailin

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
think this is all yeah bigger nailin

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
think this is all yeah bigger nailin
grenade<00:01:53.490> launcher<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.850> all<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.360> weapons

so<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.310> Tesla<00:01:57.030> generator<00:01:57.530> thing

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
so you have the Tesla generator thing

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.180 
so you have the Tesla generator thing
which<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> ray<00:01:59.369> gun<00:01:59.399> thing

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
which is like a ray gun thing

which is like a ray gun thing
you<00:02:01.000> have<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.830> prototype<00:02:02.830> PS<00:02:03.340> our<00:02:03.550> railgun

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
you have the prototype PS our railgun

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.720 
you have the prototype PS our railgun
and<00:02:04.900> you<00:02:05.080> have<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.230> grenade<00:02:05.530> launcher<00:02:05.950> they

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
and you have a grenade launcher they
