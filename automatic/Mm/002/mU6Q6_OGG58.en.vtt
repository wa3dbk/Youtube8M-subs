00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
foot around a 90 degree angle and then

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
foot around a 90 degree angle and then
you're<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.340> raise<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.120> opposite<00:00:57.690> leg

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you're going to raise the opposite leg

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.830 
you're going to raise the opposite leg
up<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> air<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.250> now<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> hand<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
up in the air and now with the hand that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
up in the air and now with the hand that
is<00:01:00.899> closest<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.949> foot<00:01:02.309> you're<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.969> just

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
is closest to your foot you're then just

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.060 
is closest to your foot you're then just
going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.629> hold<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> back<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.860> your

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
going to hold on to the back of your

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.450 
going to hold on to the back of your
ankle<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.760> slowly<00:01:06.479> raise<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.530> leg<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:08.100> as

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
ankle and slowly raise your leg up as

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.450 
ankle and slowly raise your leg up as
high<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.680> same<00:01:10.890> time<00:01:11.220> as

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
high as you can go at the same time as

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.190 
high as you can go at the same time as
raising<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.030> leg<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.900> reaching

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
raising your leg you want to be reaching

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
raising your leg you want to be reaching
over<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.950> opposite<00:01:14.549> arm<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> can

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
over the opposite arm so then you can

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
over the opposite arm so then you can
hold<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> leg<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.220> pull<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> other

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
hold on to that leg and pull the other

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.620 
hold on to that leg and pull the other
arm<00:01:18.540> through<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.729> helps<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
arm through and then this just helps to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.200 
arm through and then this just helps to
bring<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.350> leg<00:01:22.619> slightly<00:01:23.189> backwards<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.000> get

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
bring that leg slightly backwards to get

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.140 
bring that leg slightly backwards to get
it<00:01:24.420> perfectly<00:01:25.110> straight<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> step<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it perfectly straight so step one you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.050 
it perfectly straight so step one you
pivot<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> foot<00:01:28.259> step<00:01:28.920> two<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.430> bring<00:01:29.610> your

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
pivot the foot step two you bring your

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.179 
pivot the foot step two you bring your
leg<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.450> whilst<00:01:30.780> holding<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.650> ankle

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
leg up whilst holding on to your ankle

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.640 
leg up whilst holding on to your ankle
you<00:01:32.700> raise<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.240> leg<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> opposite

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you raise the leg up and the opposite

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.370 
you raise the leg up and the opposite
arm<00:01:34.829> holds<00:01:35.369> onto<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.790> leg<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.810> pull<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
arm holds onto that leg and you pull the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.670 
arm holds onto that leg and you pull the
arm<00:01:37.619> through<00:01:38.210> if<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.420> find<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.869> one<00:01:40.110> simple

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
arm through if you find this one simple

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
arm through if you find this one simple
you<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.400> work<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:42.000> swinging<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> leg<00:01:42.840> up

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
you can then work on swinging the leg up

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.920 
you can then work on swinging the leg up
and<00:01:43.439> catching<00:01:44.369> straight<00:01:44.880> into<00:01:45.420> standing
