00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.110 
and within the first one or two seconds
I<00:00:46.870> can<00:00:47.080> see<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.470> free<00:00:47.710> chlorine<00:00:47.980> level<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.610> in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
I can see the free chlorine level and in

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.180 
I can see the free chlorine level and in
this<00:00:49.210> pool<00:00:49.480> is<00:00:49.540> pretty<00:00:49.600> low<00:00:49.990> and<00:00:50.230> as<00:00:50.830> it<00:00:51.010> sits

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
this pool is pretty low and as it sits

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.470 
this pool is pretty low and as it sits
in<00:00:51.340> there<00:00:51.490> for<00:00:51.700> a<00:00:51.730> minute<00:00:51.820> or<00:00:52.060> two<00:00:52.090> it'll<00:00:52.330> give

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
in there for a minute or two it'll give

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.690 
in there for a minute or two it'll give
me<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.780> combined<00:00:53.380> chlorine<00:00:53.770> level<00:00:54.100> free

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
me the combined chlorine level free

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.010 
me the combined chlorine level free
chlorine<00:00:54.970> is<00:00:55.120> important<00:00:55.510> because<00:00:55.630> that's<00:00:55.810> the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
chlorine is important because that's the

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.110 
chlorine is important because that's the
chlorine<00:00:56.380> that's<00:00:56.500> actually<00:00:56.890> used<00:00:57.130> continuous

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
chlorine that's actually used continuous

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.600 
chlorine that's actually used continuous
in<00:00:58.270> your<00:00:58.390> pool<00:00:58.630> to<00:00:58.990> kill<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.260> bacteria<00:00:59.610> and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
in your pool to kill the bacteria and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.010 
in your pool to kill the bacteria and
you<00:01:00.670> can<00:01:00.790> raise<00:01:00.970> that<00:01:01.000> up<00:01:01.300> by<00:01:01.420> shocking<00:01:01.900> the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
you can raise that up by shocking the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.010 
you can raise that up by shocking the
pool<00:01:02.230> do<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.250> s<00:01:03.460> e<00:01:03.790> pH<00:01:04.270> test<00:01:04.630> I'm<00:01:04.750> going<00:01:04.840> to<00:01:04.930> add

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
pool do the s e pH test I'm going to add

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.900 
pool do the s e pH test I'm going to add
one<00:01:05.199> drop<00:01:05.410> of<00:01:05.440> solution<00:01:05.980> for<00:01:06.280> which<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.670> a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
one drop of solution for which is a

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.780 
one drop of solution for which is a
chlorine<00:01:07.420> neutralizer<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:09.040> swirl<00:01:09.580> that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
chlorine neutralizer just swirl that

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.510 
chlorine neutralizer just swirl that
around<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:10.180> little<00:01:10.210> bit<00:01:10.980> and<00:01:11.980> I'm<00:01:12.100> at<00:01:12.250> five

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
around a little bit and I'm at five

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.270 
around a little bit and I'm at five
drops<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:13.000> solution<00:01:13.480> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.460 

I'm<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> swirl<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> around<00:01:18.450> also<00:01:21.470> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I'm going to swirl that around also and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.530 
I'm going to swirl that around also and
it<00:01:22.590> looks<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.980> pH<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.460> about<00:01:23.700> 8.0<00:01:24.300> right

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it looks like that pH is about 8.0 right

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
it looks like that pH is about 8.0 right
now<00:01:24.950> we're<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> use<00:01:26.220> solution<00:01:26.430> three

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
now we're going to use solution three

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.790 
now we're going to use solution three
for<00:01:27.000> acid<00:01:27.330> demand<00:01:27.660> so<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.170> put<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
for acid demand so I'm going to put the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.609 
for acid demand so I'm going to put the
drops<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.220> accounting<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:31.020> two<00:01:31.260> drops<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
drops in accounting it's two drops and

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.920 
drops in accounting it's two drops and
it<00:01:34.619> took<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.890> two<00:01:35.550> drops<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.570> seven

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it took about two drops to get to seven

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
it took about two drops to get to seven
point<00:01:37.170> four<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.160> wanted<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.580> do<00:01:38.790> that's

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
point four what we wanted to do that's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
point four what we wanted to do that's
how<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.080> acid<00:01:40.170> demand<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> put

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
how you get the acid demand you put

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.250 
how you get the acid demand you put
drops<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.580> count<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:42.000> until<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> gets<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
drops in and count them until it gets to

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.310 
drops in and count them until it gets to
the<00:01:43.380> ideal<00:01:43.710> level<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.250> seven<00:01:44.490> point<00:01:44.700> four<00:01:45.320> now

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the ideal level of seven point four now

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.510 
the ideal level of seven point four now
it's<00:01:46.440> important<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.040> size<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
it's important to know the size of the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.660 
it's important to know the size of the
pool<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> video

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
pool that you have so I have a video

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.410 
pool that you have so I have a video
also<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.979> demonstrates<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.360> way<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
also that that demonstrates the way to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.490 
also that that demonstrates the way to
calculate<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> gallons<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> pool<00:01:56.220> volume

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
calculate the gallons or the pool volume

going to add two drops a solution 5
we're<00:02:48.930> going<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.079> swirl<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.350> around<00:02:50.510> we're

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
we're going to swirl it around we're

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.940 
we're going to swirl it around we're
going<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.690> add<00:02:51.780> drops<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.200> solution<00:02:52.650> three<00:02:52.860> and

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
going to add drops a solution three and

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.880 
going to add drops a solution three and
count<00:02:53.190> them<00:02:53.459> as<00:02:54.299> color<00:02:55.230> changes

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
count them as color changes

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:06.380 
count them as color changes
throw<00:02:57.520> it<00:02:57.730> around

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.220 

okay<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.560> took<00:03:07.710> about<00:03:07.830> eight<00:03:08.130> drops<00:03:08.400> of

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
okay so it took about eight drops of

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
okay so it took about eight drops of
solution<00:03:10.230> three<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.680> changes<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
solution three the changes so the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.580 
solution three the changes so the
alkalinity<00:03:11.640> in<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.850> pool<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.210> at<00:03:12.330> eighty<00:03:12.590> and
