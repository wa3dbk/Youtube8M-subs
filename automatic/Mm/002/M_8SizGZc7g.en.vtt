00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.060
 at 6 3 if you 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.129
 the former president is going to do the thing you need them better 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.659
 whatever you want 

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:10.659
 and I am 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.769
 if you know, people request something 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.459
 might make 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.919
 then find it on the stock exchanges 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.589
 the 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.489
 the system 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:22.769
 and then 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.810
 of course I hurt the first impression of all those people 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 hoensbroek greet super music 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.930
 Then wait you may be wondering which people could have made Sunday 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.250
 that is its own audience 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.020
 often traders go 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.020
 because people of the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.370
 focus on production and not just the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.060
 can have 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.060
 to still negotiate his club oil production with 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.840
 who sends his sad because 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.720
 pregnant woman says marc 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.320
 can check 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.680
 the comic strip museum reported that it is worth taking care of it 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.820
 the manufacturer instead 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.760
 anyway i have my client who by own have this result 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.900
 then you can 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.400
 fortunately not traveling 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.780
 so there was nothing next to these madmen 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.050
 he decides one of those papers, but that is very possible 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.050
 and then machines in that say 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.340
 at least not from both of us 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.510
 has a good start with the kite 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.390
 and you have it everywhere 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.860
 TVM announced that 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.070
 that is one thing 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.900
 then if you want to be serious then you have to 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.820
 how do we ensure that again 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.590
 I myself have seen 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.470
 well you know what you are talking about 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.220
 that you see this sticker or 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.620
 can answer arjen robben 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.820
 quality level 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.660
 and if you are that crazy you must be 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.840
 dropped out at that time 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.910
 you should not go further 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.910
 because otherwise you just have to leave it 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.929
 of course you must fall 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.139
 if you think it's good then we'll look further 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.859
 and 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.859
 according to the most important to me it is not but the most important 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.389
 of course from 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.529
 cows the demonstrators 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.669
 they started off 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.239
 min that has to do with van gogh 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.909
 important just as a customer but if you could with the verdict news 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.519
 now we are a horse dealer with a peak as long as you are 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.409
 maybe touch 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.010
 you can call them a five star hotel 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.599
 the figures are pure art 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.319
 pay if he is in the documentary environment 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.689
 yes so the people and they are everywhere 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.519
 say but hurt that his team 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.519
 the so again such ed in the eyes of the om 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.489
 will not be in his name by the state 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.379
 we have to until then 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.539
 that has us observe 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.259
 He deposited what they are now doing 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.539
 that manufacturers can sort out 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.409
 sometimes cia agent on sometimes directly 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.819
 and then if you feel you can she still lived 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.429
 and if it's one 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.439
 You can make it based on life 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.409
 9 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.799
 cash and tops press release 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.799
 it is stressful for the checking 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.799
 Strasbourg as a club there can be all kinds of pkio 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:23.809
 to do 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.699
 you can also say the after competition deeper into the slop 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.749
 tell the counter I have the transfer 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.589
 the trouble after a tooth 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.189
 he speaks sixty days after receipt of goods 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.039
 but the 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.189
 there are just any of all the things that I have all it depends a bit 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.100
 from the van 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.329
 what type 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.309
 the customer you are 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.359
 Deventer us very important that you have a point 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.889
 the final round 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.609
 Manchester tactics place very important relationships very important 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.449
 that ten men 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.699
 the cabinet is also happy for your flowers 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:55.480
 get there 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.099
 that's actually them 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.199
 and that is also the basis of hall van 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.179
 seriously affected 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.669
 that says she should be happy with each other 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.289
 to be honest there were sounds that might also have hesitations again 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:11.439
 pick up 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.940
 then I see it wrong 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.630
 but she is it is not strange for yourself ai weiwei has true of the 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.799
 cases a bit sat that is different in china ornate 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.689
 best people want to use samsung 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:28.099
 I have very few in the best-selling works 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.620
 min 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.590
 yes back then when the tournament was about the structure of the 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.689
 textile industry in the children's clothing fair 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.300
 they expect 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.270
 rojas twenty years ago there were still many factories in europe in england 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.659
 italy has 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.029
 both matters 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:45.939
 and that was actually europe 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.919
 those were give people with an expensive 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.919
 that will soon be a lot of confusion 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.300
 where I 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.420
 also on the price could find yes we grow 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.080
 it became 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.039
 and 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.199
 that was a robbery because agents fell 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.219
 That means we aren't an intermediary anyway 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:09.360
 dranouter bath and companions on iceland 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.370
 based on a certain percentage 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.930
 working on a number of things for you 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.870
 k and that is that the number thing is the first 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.419
 the wheel of his customers 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.199
 yes that is one 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.490
 so that is precisely for you the power of grain separation agreed with 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.779
 of those people now newspaper 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.779
 a witness also belonged to the entire hearing 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.460
 the brusselaar not that crazy much much difference with with europe anp 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.509
 although started in all situations 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.379
 beijing china is anyway 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:42.159
 otherwise maybe hard but good too 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.159
 branded clothing should be rarely water based 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.180
 everyone is waiting for you 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.740
 everyone has 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.740
 honesty honesty 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.960
 in a few players in the factory in tiel 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.960
 hopefully 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.270
 you also have low light shine 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.180
 if you then 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.599
 they are generally public 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.550
 also higher demands 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.550
 if the cheaper price need to leave country 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.660
 ma weeding to 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.259
 manufacturers that I say 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:22.379
 with a bearing 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:23.720
 then lower costs 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.349
 also ask people who are still interested 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.509
 or who have not yet experiences 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.509
 and then the problem is we can stand a man 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.110
 in the form that they can dispose 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.110
 also hardly mentioned 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.529
 that was the prize winners chosen so too often you also need more comfort 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:45.529
 m we go if it often goes wrong 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.490
 because the wishes are of the consumer but simply do not gain the experience 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.979
 and then 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:55.219
 there will be problems because then I am going to talk about it but I don't want to have it right 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:57.860
 completely fit and ready but yes but I do not want to have anyway 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.099
 for this the procedure is in advance for 52,000 euros 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:03.279
 the good news 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.309
 yes but I agree that it is not good yes, but it's the turn 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:09.619
 accept with a discount and deliver us the amounts arrived early 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:13.889
 Discounts to that have real hits and occasionally well it's like me at one 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.020
 club asking situation 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.319
 and then that adam 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.360
 the newspaper is about it anyway 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.199
 of the other mmo's players a course or a lot of money is going that still has one 

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:28.990
 a noise issue is for a break 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.550
 on its competitors 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.230
 a so that's actually the difference ok
