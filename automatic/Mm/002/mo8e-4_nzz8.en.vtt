hello<00:00:04.290> everybody<00:00:04.620> so<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.460> was<00:00:05.790> getting<00:00:06.029> pretty

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
hello everybody so I was getting pretty

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.120 
hello everybody so I was getting pretty
tired<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.810> using<00:00:06.960> these<00:00:07.230> five<00:00:07.500> objects<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
tired of using these five objects to

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.370 
tired of using these five objects to
light<00:00:08.280> at<00:00:08.400> my<00:00:08.490> base<00:00:08.700> so<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.480> came<00:00:09.630> up<00:00:09.990> with<00:00:10.019> what

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
light at my base so I came up with what

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.280 
light at my base so I came up with what
I'm<00:00:10.530> calling<00:00:10.860> lava<00:00:11.280> blade<00:00:11.610> lighting<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.290> here

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
I'm calling lava blade lighting and here

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.110 
I'm calling lava blade lighting and here
it<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.769> kind<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.250> crazy<00:00:14.490> idea<00:00:14.730> but<00:00:14.940> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
it is it's kind of a crazy idea but I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
it is it's kind of a crazy idea but I
think<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.480> looks<00:00:15.630> really<00:00:15.719> cool<00:00:16.160> these<00:00:17.160> are<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
think it looks really cool these are a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.980 
think it looks really cool these are a
bunch<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.640> machines<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.270> put<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> sky

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
bunch of machines that I put in the sky

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.779 
bunch of machines that I put in the sky
that<00:00:19.320> constantly<00:00:19.859> generate<00:00:20.310> these<00:00:20.460> lava

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
that constantly generate these lava

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.970 
that constantly generate these lava
blades<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.330> slowly<00:00:21.660> fall<00:00:21.990> down<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
blades that slowly fall down so it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.500 
blades that slowly fall down so it
creates<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> pretty<00:00:23.550> cool<00:00:23.730> effect<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.359> can

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
creates a pretty cool effect and you can

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810 
creates a pretty cool effect and you can
actually<00:00:24.660> use<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.529> light<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.160> base<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
actually use this to light up a base and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700 
actually use this to light up a base and
the<00:00:27.630> coolest<00:00:27.869> part<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.470> hit<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the coolest part is when they hit the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.019 
the coolest part is when they hit the
ground<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.099> don't<00:00:29.250> spread<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:29.939> do

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
ground they don't spread out or do

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
ground they don't spread out or do
anything<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.720> land<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.320> they

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
anything like just land and they

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280 
anything like just land and they
disappear<00:00:32.120> so<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> machines<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:34.079> here

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
disappear so here the machines up here

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.709 
disappear so here the machines up here
they're<00:00:34.530> pretty<00:00:34.770> easy<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
they're pretty easy to make it's just a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
they're pretty easy to make it's just a
bunch<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> repeaters<00:00:37.460> some<00:00:38.460> redstone<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
bunch of repeaters some redstone a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
bunch of repeaters some redstone a
piston<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> lava<00:00:40.170> source<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.070> be

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
piston and a lava source and they can be

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.950 
piston and a lava source and they can be
turned<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.700> off<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.690> turn<00:00:42.840> this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
turned on and off so you can turn this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.990 
turned on and off so you can turn this
one<00:00:43.079> off<00:00:43.140> like<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.879> easy

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
one off like this and it's really easy

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.970 
one off like this and it's really easy
so<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.719> set<00:00:45.989> them<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.680> they<00:00:46.800> only

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
so you can set them up so that they only

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.799 
so you can set them up so that they only
turn<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.399> at<00:00:47.670> night<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.570> hook<00:00:48.660> this

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
turn on at night so you just hook this

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.260 
turn on at night so you just hook this
up<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.200> daylight<00:00:49.680> sensor<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.190> there's<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
up to a daylight sensor and there's a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
up to a daylight sensor and there's a
lot<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.770> said

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
lot you can do with this so like I said

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.069 
lot you can do with this so like I said
they're<00:00:53.280> pretty<00:00:53.640> easy<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:54.059> make<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.899> don't

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
they're pretty easy to make they don't

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.619 
they're pretty easy to make they don't
really<00:00:55.289> take<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.649> lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.949> resources<00:00:56.420> over<00:00:57.420> here

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
really take a lot of resources over here

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
really take a lot of resources over here
I've<00:00:57.840> laid<00:00:58.020> out<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.590> resources<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.160> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I've laid out all the resources that you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
I've laid out all the resources that you
will<00:00:59.520> need<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.390> some<00:01:00.570> feedback<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.140> it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
will need I got some feedback that it's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.110 
will need I got some feedback that it's
hard<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> follow<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.980> tutorials<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> just

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
hard to follow the tutorials when I just

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.390 
hard to follow the tutorials when I just
name<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> items<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.379> decided<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.949> name<00:01:05.129> them

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
name the items so I decided to name them

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.980 
name the items so I decided to name them
and<00:01:05.580> put<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> amount<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.390> items<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.780> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and put the amount of items that you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.830 
and put the amount of items that you
need<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.979> need<00:01:08.130> solid<00:01:08.549> blocks<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.390> piston

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
need so you need solid blocks one piston

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.740 
need so you need solid blocks one piston
one<00:01:10.439> lever<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:11.310> lava<00:01:11.549> source<00:01:11.880> 2<00:01:12.540> redstone

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
one lever one lava source 2 redstone

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.620 
one lever one lava source 2 redstone
dust<00:01:13.140> 7<00:01:14.040> redstone<00:01:14.400> repeaters<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.270> stone

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
dust 7 redstone repeaters and one stone

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.899 
dust 7 redstone repeaters and one stone
button<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.130> those<00:01:17.250> items<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
button so get all of those items and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
button so get all of those items and
first<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.330> need<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> make<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.930> holding<00:01:19.409> cell

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
first you need to make a holding cell

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.429 
first you need to make a holding cell
for<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> lava<00:01:20.340> source<00:01:20.689> so<00:01:21.689> place<00:01:21.900> blocks<00:01:22.170> like

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
for the lava source so place blocks like

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.020 
for the lava source so place blocks like
this<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.070> break<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.460> block<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.939> place

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
this you can break this block and place

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.240 
this you can break this block and place
a<00:01:24.210> piston<00:01:24.600> right<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:24.990> place<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.740> block<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.040> top

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a piston right here place a block on top

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
a piston right here place a block on top
and<00:01:26.670> place<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.939> lover<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.630> turn<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and place a lover here and turn on the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
and place a lover here and turn on the
piston<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.740> now<00:01:28.829> place<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.150> lava

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
piston for now place down your lava

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.819 
piston for now place down your lava
source<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.110> need<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.439> set<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
source and now you need to set up the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.550 
source and now you need to set up the
clock<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.790> dig<00:01:33.000> down<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> out<00:01:34.229> like

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
here and here make them all four tix of

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.639 
here and here make them all four tix of
delay<00:01:47.600> then<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.689> need<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.899> place<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.290> block

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
delay then you need to place a block

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.910 
delay then you need to place a block
here<00:01:50.119> place<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.360> block<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.290> blocks<00:01:52.649> here

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
here place a block here and blocks here

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
here place a block here and blocks here
and<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.149> need<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> place<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> redstone

and here so you need to place a redstone

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.380 
and here so you need to place a redstone
dust<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.590> three<00:01:56.490> repeaters<00:01:56.939> set<00:01:57.240> these

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
dust here and three repeaters set these

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.950 
dust here and three repeaters set these
all<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.719> four<00:01:57.899> tix<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.290> delay<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.689> place<00:02:00.689> down

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
all the four tix of delay and place down

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
all the four tix of delay and place down
your<00:02:01.259> button<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.070> has<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.369> be

stone and this is the right amount of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.800 
stone and this is the right amount of
delay<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.770> make<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> lava<00:02:05.250> blades<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.820> you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
delay to make the lava blades and you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.150 
delay to make the lava blades and you
can<00:02:06.990> break<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> button<00:02:07.649> when<00:02:07.829> you're<00:02:07.979> done

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
setting up the clock and to turn it on

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.100 
setting up the clock and to turn it on
just<00:02:10.440> flick<00:02:10.920> off<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.250> lever<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.989> this<00:02:12.989> will

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
just flick off this lever and this will

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.850 
just flick off this lever and this will
start<00:02:13.319> generating

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
start generating

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620 
start generating
lava<00:02:14.070> blades<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.820> it's<00:02:15.090> kind<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
lava blades you see it's kind of a

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.440 
lava blades you see it's kind of a
pattern<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.190> will<00:02:17.460> knock<00:02:17.790> off<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.270> lava

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
pattern so it will knock off the lava

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.150 
pattern so it will knock off the lava
right<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.050> certain<00:02:19.410> amount<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.680> times<00:02:19.890> and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
right here a certain amount of times and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.190 
right here a certain amount of times and
then<00:02:20.340> it'll<00:02:20.460> create<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:21.060> lava<00:02:21.330> blade<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:22.020> this

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
then it'll create a lava blade so this

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.860 
then it'll create a lava blade so this
will<00:02:22.350> fall<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> certain<00:02:23.100> amount<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.870> another

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
will fall a certain amount and another

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.860 
will fall a certain amount and another
lawful<00:02:25.200> blade<00:02:25.380> will<00:02:25.530> form<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.540> think<00:02:27.630> it's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
lawful blade will form so I think it's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.990 
lawful blade will form so I think it's
