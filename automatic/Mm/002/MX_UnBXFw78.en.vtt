00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.250
 Uzee Enoi 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.250
 Hmm 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:16.049
 Yes Hello, my name is Anthony 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.810
 We prepared secret weapon last time and straight and said good thing though 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.000
 Well this 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.119
 You can see if you look at the type I bought a fine equalizer amplifier 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.119
 hey 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.680
 Of course I said that it was a secret weapon just as I bought a fine equalizer there 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.390
 No I'm even though 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.390
 This time I got it 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:44.930
 This fist Fuk 03 + 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:50.329
 I think the maker of adventure is rude, but it is not known much 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:55.680
 Since it is a so-called garage maker, it is a history of purchasing this and why 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:01:00.960
 I would like to talk about it, but before that, with this equalizer amplifier in the first place 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:07.920
 I would like to talk that Ya Nanzo cartridge is the information from the record board 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:12.350
 At the time of reading, the signal is very weak and the period is weak. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.159
 When this is referred to in the United States over the Recording Industry Association of English 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.659
 Recording industry association america 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:26.630
 It is said that it is a rule established by a group called ria game for short 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:30.830
 It looks like this when I make a graph I think it is a bit confusing, so grab an image 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.340
 I would like to express in the apple riser of itunes for Well only 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.979
 When the image of the in fine 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:44.579
 Please forgive this This is the state that Tomitch has taken information and taken from this 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.869
 I don't feel that it sounds so straight, so lift the tight schedule there 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.330
 further 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:55.780
 It is not to amplify a weak signal This is the function of this equalizer amplifier 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:02.170
 Well, to put it in a nutshell, it's easy to arrange and amplify the sound 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:07.900
 Well , I think that it is better if you understand that much 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:12.190
 The amplifier function of this era when record players were in circulation normally The equalizer function of this child 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.350
 Was built in that case on the back of the amplifier 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.870
 Four 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:21.440
 There was an input terminal called a thing , so this phono input is on the back of your amplifier 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.040
 If there is a terminal like this 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:30.530
 You don't have to buy an equalizer 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.569
 However, in recent amps this fine equalizer function has been omitted. 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.519
 There are very many cases 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.770
 It can not be helped that the record player itself is very rare recently 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.270
 think 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:47.170
 My up is also the same, there is no input monitoring of this child 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.230
 So I had to buy a bed with this equalizer amp 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.260
 But I would like to either introduce to Chinami 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:58.760
 Ayu also built in equalizer function 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:03.769
 There are also record players, especially for cheap record players for beginners 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.670
 However, in the case of such type of record player, there is no such terminal on the amplifier side. 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.200
 Is also ok 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:12.620
 In summary, this equalizer is built-in to the amplifier 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:17.100
 The then those of Finance to record player 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.540
 And there is something to be prepared separately 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.110
 a 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:28.450
 The other 's something record player character 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:34.599
 Still or something stomach eh little but rather that not a 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:36.190
 I even before free by saying yes will be cheerful and good if a Lee's by examining 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:42.670
 Has become long 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:45.240
 Next time, I selected this equalizer and bought a solid gk 03 a plus 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.750
 I would like to talk about history 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.750
 Well then
