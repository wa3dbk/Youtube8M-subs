half of 2013 it'll be apparently be
available<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.160> two<00:00:23.430> different<00:00:23.460> variants<00:00:24.260> one

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
available in two different variants one

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.359 
available in two different variants one
called<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> SMN<00:00:26.960> 900<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.140> another<00:00:29.130> one

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
called the SMN 900 and another one

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.030 
called the SMN 900 and another one
called<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.970> SMN<00:00:30.890> well<00:00:31.890> SM<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.899> 905<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.079> 9005

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
called the SMN well SM and 905 or 9005

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
called the SMN well SM and 905 or 9005
both<00:00:35.640> models<00:00:35.850> are<00:00:36.149> apparently<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.870> very

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
both models are apparently very very

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.130 
both models are apparently very very
similar<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:38.520> are<00:00:39.239> probably<00:00:39.540> headed<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
similar but they are probably headed to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.479 
similar but they are probably headed to
different<00:00:40.440> markets<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:41.010> tell<00:00:41.219> him<00:00:41.340> because

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
different markets just tell him because

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.810 
different markets just tell him because
one<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.450> LT<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> another<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:44.040> doesn't<00:00:44.430> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
one has LT and another one doesn't so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.819 
one has LT and another one doesn't so
it's<00:00:44.969> probably<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.320> heading<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's probably that one is heading to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.590 
it's probably that one is heading to
European<00:00:47.309> market<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.789> another<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.360> for

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
European market and another one is for

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.860 
European market and another one is for
the<00:00:49.230> north<00:00:49.710> american<00:00:50.219> market<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.809> course

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the north american market and of course

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.479 
the north american market and of course
the<00:00:52.199> european<00:00:52.620> one<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> other<00:00:53.219> markets

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the european one for the other markets

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.130 
the european one for the other markets
as<00:00:53.789> well<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.510> i'm<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> go

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
as well so i'm actually going to go

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
as well so i'm actually going to go
quickly<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.890> run<00:00:56.250> through<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> leak<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
quickly go run through the leak and it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910 
quickly go run through the leak and it
was<00:00:57.239> leaked<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.750> by<00:00:57.930> sammobile<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.739> all

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
was leaked out by sammobile so all

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.740 
was leaked out by sammobile so all
credit<00:00:59.129> goes<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.489> them<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.570> was

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
credit goes to them and this was

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.290 
credit goes to them and this was
apparently<00:01:01.289> from<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> trusted<00:01:02.280> insider<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
apparently from a trusted insider that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.870 
apparently from a trusted insider that
they<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.379> let's<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.860> over<00:01:04.890> both<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
they have so let's go over both the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
they have so let's go over both the
smartphone's<00:01:06.479> specs<00:01:07.320> specification<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
smartphone's specs specification so the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.070 
smartphone's specs specification so the
