I<00:03:24.630> am<00:03:24.750> jazzed<00:03:25.170> at<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> idea<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.400> game

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
I am jazzed at the idea that this game

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.449 
I am jazzed at the idea that this game
would<00:03:26.880> would<00:03:27.209> exist<00:03:27.720> with<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.140> premise

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
would would exist with this premise

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.190 
would would exist with this premise
normally<00:03:29.459> it'd<00:03:29.580> be<00:03:29.760> really<00:03:30.060> hard<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.360> produce

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
normally it'd be really hard to produce

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.650 
normally it'd be really hard to produce

one<00:03:43.200> creature<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.860> dude<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:45.360> sings<00:03:46.020> it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
one creature and dude I just it sings it

one creature and dude I just it sings it
sings<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.950> world's<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.580> me<00:03:47.730> because<00:03:48.000> it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
sings the world's to me because it

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.090 
sings the world's to me because it
sounds<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:48.630> good<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.290> only<00:03:49.530> hope<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:49.950> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
sounds so good and I only hope that a

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.280 
sounds so good and I only hope that a
game<00:03:50.459> made<00:03:50.730> with<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.030> premise<00:03:51.330> but<00:03:52.140> my

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
game made with this premise but my

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.810 
game made with this premise but my
biggest<00:03:52.560> doubt<00:03:52.950> right<00:03:53.160> now<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:53.640> it's

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
biggest doubt right now is that it's

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.270 
biggest doubt right now is that it's
made<00:03:54.060> by<00:03:54.270> a<00:03:54.300> bunch<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.840> dudes<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.290> make<00:03:55.530> RTS

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
made by a bunch of dudes that make RTS

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.880 
made by a bunch of dudes that make RTS
style<00:03:56.670> games<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.450> who<00:03:57.750> knows<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.350> might<00:03:58.830> be

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
style games so who knows it might be

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.260 
style games so who knows it might be
their<00:03:59.190> first<00:03:59.340> trying<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.880> different<00:04:00.240> genre

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270
