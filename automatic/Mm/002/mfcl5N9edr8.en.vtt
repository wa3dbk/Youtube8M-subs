00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
actually got some very flowing curve a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
actually got some very flowing curve a
lot<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.940> hints<00:01:51.150> in<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.080> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
lot of hints in here what I think the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.330 
lot of hints in here what I think the
Knicks<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.530> rates<00:01:52.830> going<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> start<00:01:53.310> looking

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
Knicks are rates going to start looking

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.740 
Knicks are rates going to start looking

like particularly in this sort of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
like particularly in this sort of

and at fast in both conditions so you've

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.600

you've<00:02:19.890> got<00:02:20.010> an<00:02:20.160> active<00:02:20.550> air<00:02:20.730> suspension

you've got an active air suspension
that's<00:02:21.750> actually<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.560> allow<00:02:22.769> you<00:02:22.800> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that's actually going to allow you to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.949 
that's actually going to allow you to
raise<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.400> lower<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.640> vehicle<00:02:23.910> by<00:02:24.540> about<00:02:24.780> an

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
raise and lower the vehicle by about an

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.449 
raise and lower the vehicle by about an
inch<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.290> half<00:02:25.320> from<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.950> static<00:02:26.280> ride

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
GPS system so if you're on the highway

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.090 
GPS system so if you're on the highway
it'll<00:02:30.390> sit<00:02:30.600> lower<00:02:30.840> but<00:02:31.350> if<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.530> turn<00:02:31.680> off<00:02:31.920> onto

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
it'll sit lower but if you turn off onto

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.949 
it'll sit lower but if you turn off onto
a<00:02:32.250> gravel<00:02:32.730> road<00:02:32.760> it'll<00:02:33.360> raise<00:02:33.630> itself

a gravel road it'll raise itself
automatically<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.739> don't<00:02:34.769> have<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> do

more<00:02:47.459> crazy<00:02:47.790> you've<00:02:48.030> got<00:02:48.239> things<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
more crazy you've got things like the
