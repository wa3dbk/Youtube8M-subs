them<00:00:58.869> now<00:00:59.019> normally<00:00:59.619> I<00:00:59.799> advocate<00:01:00.729> against<00:01:01.420> the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
them now normally I advocate against the

them now normally I advocate against the
use<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.930> synthetic<00:01:02.110> benchmarks<00:01:02.949> but<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.519> this

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
use of synthetic benchmarks but in this

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.130 
use of synthetic benchmarks but in this
case<00:01:03.909> I<00:01:04.119> was<00:01:04.239> talking<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.659> wheels<00:01:04.869> who

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
case I was talking to wheels who

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.469 
case I was talking to wheels who
actually<00:01:05.320> ran<00:01:05.740> all<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.010> numbers<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:07.180> was

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
actually ran all the numbers and I was

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.630 
actually ran all the numbers and I was
like<00:01:07.659> well<00:01:07.869> they're<00:01:08.140> all<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.590> same

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
like well they're all the same

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.980 
like well they're all the same
architecture<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:10.150> using<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.600> synthetic

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
architecture so using a synthetic

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.830 
architecture so using a synthetic
actually<00:01:11.860> does<00:01:12.159> give<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.880> comparative

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
actually does give you comparative

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.140 
actually does give you comparative
numbers<00:01:14.229> between<00:01:14.470> these<00:01:14.920> because<00:01:15.610> there's<00:01:16.000> no

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
numbers between these because there's no

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.969 
numbers between these because there's no
architectural<00:01:16.750> optimizations<00:01:17.590> going<00:01:17.859> on

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
architectural optimizations going on

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.399 
architectural optimizations going on
it's<00:01:18.130> just<00:01:18.189> which<00:01:18.579> one<00:01:18.909> is<00:01:19.149> actually<00:01:20.020> able<00:01:20.170> to

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
it's just which one is actually able to

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.069 
it's just which one is actually able to
maintain<00:01:20.619> boost<00:01:21.219> clocks<00:01:21.579> better<00:01:22.270> than<00:01:22.840> the

maintain boost clocks better than the

guys<00:01:25.450> because<00:01:25.990> with<00:01:26.740> GPU<00:01:27.549> boost<00:01:27.729> 2.0

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.499 
guys because with GPU boost 2.0
temperatures<00:01:29.740> make<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> big<00:01:30.729> difference<00:01:30.969> to

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
temperatures make a big difference to

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.440

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
how fast the card will run even if you

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.300 
how fast the card will run even if you

don't touch any overclocking settings
the<00:01:36.759> card<00:01:37.030> will<00:01:37.179> run<00:01:37.359> better<00:01:37.659> if<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.320> can

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
the card will run better if it can

the card will run better if it can

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
maintain better temperatures now what

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.959 
maintain better temperatures now what
you<00:01:40.869> might<00:01:41.079> notice<00:01:41.289> is<00:01:41.590> these<00:01:41.829> cards<00:01:42.369> all<00:01:42.549> look

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
further ado let's go through what makes

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.550 
further ado let's go through what makes
each<00:02:06.789> of<00:02:06.850> these<00:02:07.090> special<00:02:07.539> this<00:02:07.899> is<00:02:07.960> EVGA

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
each of these special this is EVGA

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.469 
each of these special this is EVGA
standard<00:02:09.190> reference<00:02:09.640> card<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.149> that<00:02:10.209> means

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
standard reference card and that means

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.780 
standard reference card and that means
it<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> reference<00:02:11.290> Nvidia<00:02:11.980> card<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.730> you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
it is a reference Nvidia card so you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.150 
it is a reference Nvidia card so you
have<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.180> polycarbonate<00:02:14.110> window<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.709> the
