to the reason why they broke they broke
because<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:29.260> cable<00:04:30.260> connecting<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:33.100> the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
because the cable connecting the the

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.960 
because the cable connecting the the
actual<00:04:37.180> headphone<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.840> connected<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.590> this

actual headphone is connected to this
which<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.120> only<00:04:41.240> connected<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.750> one<00:04:41.900> headphone

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
which is only connected to one headphone

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.210 
which is only connected to one headphone
not<00:04:42.800> both<00:04:43.150> for<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.240> be<00:04:44.330> connected<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:44.750> both

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
not both for to be connected to both

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.500 
not both for to be connected to both
then<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.520> want<00:04:46.789> to<00:04:46.850> be<00:04:46.910> having<00:04:47.180> this<00:04:47.270> problem

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.440 

because<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:51.110> would<00:04:51.350> because<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.830> UM

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
because it would because the UM

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.080 
because it would because the UM
headphone<00:04:53.450> were<00:04:53.660> not<00:04:53.840> shaped<00:04:54.229> to<00:04:54.380> my<00:04:54.530> head

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
headphone were not shaped to my head

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.250 
headphone were not shaped to my head
apparently<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:56.690> then<00:04:56.870> they<00:04:57.020> would<00:04:57.110> always

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
apparently so then they would always

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.190 
apparently so then they would always
bend<00:04:57.680> outward<00:04:58.430> kind<00:04:59.389> of

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
bend outward kind of

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.550 
bend outward kind of
you<00:05:00.950> have<00:05:01.070> bent<00:05:01.280> outward<00:05:01.550> like<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.830> so<00:05:03.830> then

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
you have bent outward like that so then

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.870 
you have bent outward like that so then
this<00:05:06.560> pretty<00:05:07.040> much<00:05:07.220> i'm<00:05:07.430> guessing<00:05:07.910> got<00:05:09.880> overly
