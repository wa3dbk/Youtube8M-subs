00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
unfortunately no most wargame maps don't

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.860 
unfortunately no most wargame maps don't
do<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.860> it's<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> opposite<00:02:26.580> way<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.720> is

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
do it it's the opposite way but this is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.180 
do it it's the opposite way but this is
actually<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.290> correct<00:02:28.470> art<00:02:28.769> way<00:02:31.069> anyway<00:02:32.069> it's

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
actually the correct art way anyway it's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.550 
actually the correct art way anyway it's
