other way the other strings are tuned so

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.480 
other way the other strings are tuned so
we<00:01:45.110> have<00:01:45.230> 6<00:01:46.130> 8<00:01:46.310> 6<00:01:46.670> 8<00:01:46.880> 10<00:01:47.300> 8<00:01:48.160> 10<00:01:49.160> 8<00:01:49.790> 10<00:01:50.230> 12<00:01:51.340> but<00:01:52.340> then

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
we have 6 8 6 8 10 8 10 8 10 12 but then

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.260 
right back down into the home row again
but<00:02:30.830> sometimes<00:02:31.340> if<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.850> know<00:02:31.970> you're<00:02:32.150> gonna

or you know just instinctually you're
gonna<00:02:34.640> go<00:02:34.940> up<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.209> here<00:02:35.570> sometimes<00:02:36.500> I'll<00:02:36.590> use

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
gonna go up to here sometimes I'll use

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.229 
gonna go up to here sometimes I'll use
my<00:02:36.860> index<00:02:37.250> finger<00:02:37.520> there<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.090> usually

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
my index finger there and I usually

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.520 
my index finger there and I usually
teach<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.750> with<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> index<00:02:39.170> finger<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:39.470> you

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
teach it with the index finger so you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.760 
teach it with the index finger so you
can<00:02:39.650> go<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:44.360> connects<00:02:45.200> all<00:02:45.320> your<00:02:45.500> fingers

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
can go it connects all your fingers

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.470 
can go it connects all your fingers
together<00:02:45.920> but<00:02:46.190> if<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.340> know<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:47.150> I'm<00:02:47.270> not

11 on the beat with my middle finger so

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.320 
11 on the beat with my middle finger so
we<00:02:57.950> got

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.990 

[Music]

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240

that's just a cool lick right right in
its<00:03:08.430> own<00:03:08.610> right<00:03:14.540> but<00:03:15.540> what<00:03:15.660> we're<00:03:15.780> gonna<00:03:15.870> do<00:03:16.080> is

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200

we're<00:03:16.320> gonna<00:03:16.380> have<00:03:16.740> our<00:03:16.890> ring<00:03:17.070> finger<00:03:17.100> back<00:03:17.490> on

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
we're gonna have our ring finger back on

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.950 
we're gonna have our ring finger back on
the<00:03:17.730> 12<00:03:18.030> we're<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.300> pick<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.750> slide

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
the 12 we're going to pick it and slide

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.640 
the 12 we're going to pick it and slide
it<00:03:18.990> back<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.530> got<00:03:19.740> slide<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:21.320> 11<00:03:22.320> on<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> B

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
it back so we got slide up 11 on the B

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.750 
it back so we got slide up 11 on the B
and<00:03:23.240> then<00:03:24.240> bring<00:03:24.990> back<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.770> G<00:03:26.160> slide<00:03:26.520> down

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
and then bring back on the G slide down

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:39.740 
and then bring back on the G slide down
so<00:03:27.720> we<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:37.400> index<00:03:38.400> finger<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.510> 8th<00:03:39.720> fret

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
so we have index finger on the 8th fret

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:48.410 
so we have index finger on the 8th fret
of<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.050> G<00:03:40.280> so<00:03:44.870> then<00:03:45.870> we<00:03:45.930> go<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.260> D<00:03:46.440> string

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
of the G so then we go to the D string

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.970 
of the G so then we go to the D string
and<00:03:48.720> we<00:03:49.050> can<00:03:49.200> go<00:03:49.460> ten<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.970> eight<00:03:54.890> and<00:03:55.890> I'm

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
and we can go ten to eight and I'm

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.280 
and we can go ten to eight and I'm
pulling<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:57.060> ten<00:03:57.300> off<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.810> eight<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.170> you

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
pulling the ten off to the eight but you

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:11.120 
pulling the ten off to the eight but you
know<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.440> could<00:03:58.590> pick<00:03:58.709> each<00:03:58.830> note<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:10.410> all<00:04:11.070> I

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
know you could pick each note and all I

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.100 
know you could pick each note and all I
did<00:04:11.400> was<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.790> exact<00:04:12.120> same<00:04:12.330> looking<00:04:12.660> an<00:04:12.720> octave

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
did was the exact same looking an octave

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.470 
did was the exact same looking an octave
lower<00:04:13.430> but<00:04:14.430> because<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.880> B<00:04:15.030> string<00:04:15.300> being

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
lower but because of that B string being

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.630 
lower but because of that B string being
tuned<00:04:15.690> differently<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.650> fingering<00:04:17.070> gets<00:04:17.519> a

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
tuned differently the fingering gets a

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.580 
tuned differently the fingering gets a
little<00:04:17.850> different<00:04:18.390> it's<00:04:18.600> actually<00:04:18.840> easier

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.330 

and<00:04:22.590> what<00:04:22.680> we're<00:04:22.800> going<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:22.950> do<00:04:23.040> is<00:04:23.100> get<00:04:23.250> our

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
and what we're going to do is get our

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.440 
and what we're going to do is get our
ring<00:04:23.550> finger<00:04:23.930> it's<00:04:24.930> kind<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.200> setup<00:04:26.360> it's<00:04:27.360> a

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450
