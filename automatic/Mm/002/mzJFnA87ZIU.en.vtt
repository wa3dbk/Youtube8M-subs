00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.861
if you don't love your nose try this contouring
technique before you make a appointment at

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:12.620
your plastic surgeons office grab your cream
bronzer this is sonya casics cream bronzer

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.720
and its just awesome ill using a flat synthetic
brush and im starting at the inside end of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.099
my eyebrow.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.769
You're going to start to go down the slope
of the bridge of your nose.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.789
And as you can see, I have a bump on this
side of my nose, so I'm kind of working around

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.789
it.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.850
You have to ignore that it's there and just
be as straight as you can, following the natural

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.510
curvature of your nose.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.120
You're going to bring these shadow lines in
a lot further than where your natural shadow

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.120
lie.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:55.379
I am building and not trying to do this in
one swoop.

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.390
Once you get to the end of your nose you're
going to take your lines underneath the edge

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.019
of your nose and kind of connect them in a
diamond shape.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.120
If you feel like your nose is too long you
can actually add.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.860
Some more shadow on the very bottom part to
make this area seem visually shorter.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.890
Now we're ready to blend out the lines we've
laid down.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.190
So I'm using a synthetic eye shadow brush.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.560
This is from Real Techniques.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.800
And this is going to just soften our lines,
make them not so obvious.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:35.880
And that's going to give this the most natural
appearance.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
Now that we've contoured, or laid down the
shadow areas, we are ready to highlight.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.180
I'm using a concealer that's lighter than
my skin tone.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.540
This is by Nars, and I'm drawing a little
fan shape between my eyebrows, taking it very

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.780
thinly down the bridge of.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.480
My nose, and then doing a little pop on the
end.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.670
This is going to give your nose a little bit
more of a cute, upturned appearance.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.670
You also wanna highlight right under the eyes
in a fan shape, placing a highlight on either

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.280
side of your shadow you've created is going
to make that appear even more.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.650
three dimensional, and of course you want
to blend everything out seamlessly so we don't

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.000
see where one color ends and the next one
begins.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.250
For a little extra highlight.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.250
Lighting.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.920
I like to take a liquid luminisor this is
Stila's kitten and place it over those highlight

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:45.160
areas just to catch the light even more.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.280
Hopefully my nose is looking a little thinner.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.530
A little straighter.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.130
Just a little more three dimensional in general.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.550
And I didn't even have to visit a doctor's
office.
