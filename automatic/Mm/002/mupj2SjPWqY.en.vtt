want<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.490> two<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.759> these<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.060> hand

want to have two of these in your hand
one<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.930> my<00:01:52.140> last<00:01:52.470> match<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.189> drew<00:01:53.369> two<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
one of my last match was I drew two of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.499 
one of my last match was I drew two of
these<00:01:54.000> two<00:01:54.990> maxi<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.710> chug<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.820> write<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> Jinzo

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
these two maxi a chug do write a Jinzo

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.020 
these two maxi a chug do write a Jinzo
and<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:57.960> arises<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.710> obviously<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.880> just

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and then arises so obviously you just

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.639 
and then arises so obviously you just
have<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.270> play<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.509> well<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.960> confident<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
have to play it well be confident and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.859 
have to play it well be confident and
then<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:01.950> eventually<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.759> maxi<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.570> why<00:02:03.840> I

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
then like eventually the maxi is why I

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660 
then like eventually the maxi is why I
mean<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.680> helps<00:02:05.009> me<00:02:05.070> out<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.369> those<00:02:05.490> bad

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
mean it it helps me out of those bad

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.119 
mean it it helps me out of those bad
hands<00:02:05.909> faster<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:07.020> drew<00:02:07.229> into<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> battle

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
hands faster and I drew into the battle

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.859 
hands faster and I drew into the battle
fader<00:02:08.280> immediately<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> was<00:02:09.750> able<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
fader immediately so I was able to

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.690 
fader immediately so I was able to
well<00:02:11.110> in<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.409> match<00:02:11.620> actually<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.190> won<00:02:12.519> that

fourth up nice nice 3d rises recently
this<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.549> important<00:02:43.060> because<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.510> want<00:02:43.540> wants

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
this is important because you want wants

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.690 
this is important because you want wants
to<00:02:44.170> hate<00:02:44.319> models<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:44.980> understand<00:02:45.519> it's

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
to hate models and I understand it's

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.180 
to hate models and I understand it's
redundant<00:02:46.000> four<00:02:46.359> decks<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.720> go<00:02:46.870> fast<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:48.010> a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
redundant four decks that go fast it's a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.699 
redundant four decks that go fast it's a
big<00:02:48.400> problem<00:02:48.700> for<00:02:49.060> example<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.959> summon<00:02:50.530> and

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
big problem for example I I summon and

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.050 
big problem for example I I summon and
all<00:02:50.950> they<00:02:51.069> have<00:02:51.099> is<00:02:51.340> Miguel<00:02:51.640> oh<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.970> I'm

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
all they have is Miguel oh and I'm

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.150 
all they have is Miguel oh and I'm
pretty<00:02:52.329> sure<00:02:52.450> that's<00:02:52.720> fear<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.530> don't<00:02:53.859> it

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
pretty sure that's fear you don't it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.819 
pretty sure that's fear you don't it
sucks<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.209> top<00:02:55.390> deck<00:02:55.599> it<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.349> get<00:02:56.590> at

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
sucks the top deck it but you can get at

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.970 
sucks the top deck it but you can get at
least<00:02:57.959> well<00:02:58.959> if<00:02:59.049> they<00:02:59.170> all<00:02:59.319> have<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.739> hand

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
least well if they all have the hand

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.440 
least well if they all have the hand
then<00:03:00.159> it's<00:03:00.310> definitely<00:03:00.730> good<00:03:00.970> but<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.239> still

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
then it's definitely good but you still

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.500 
then it's definitely good but you still
can<00:03:01.599> hit<00:03:01.780> 424<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:03.190> really<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:03.790> for<00:03:04.329> like

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
can hit 424 but really it's for like

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.420 
can hit 424 but really it's for like
synchro<00:03:04.989> succeeds<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.799> if<00:03:05.980> they<00:03:06.099> set<00:03:06.400> a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
synchro succeeds and if they set a

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.399 
synchro succeeds and if they set a
monster<00:03:06.670> if<00:03:06.909> they<00:03:07.000> start<00:03:07.299> slow<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:08.200> will

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
monster if they start slow this will

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.680 
monster if they start slow this will
really<00:03:08.650> hurt<00:03:08.920> them<00:03:09.159> yeah<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:09.940> tempo<00:03:10.329> changes

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
really hurt them yeah so tempo changes

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.869 
really hurt them yeah so tempo changes
it's<00:03:10.959> definitely<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.530> template<00:03:11.859> Weiner<00:03:12.040> now<00:03:12.849> I

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
it's definitely a template Weiner now I

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.229 
it's definitely a template Weiner now I
think<00:03:13.540> dark<00:03:13.989> duster<00:03:14.409> is<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:15.430> necessary<00:03:15.700> I

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
think dark duster is just necessary I

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.589 
think dark duster is just necessary I
think<00:03:16.599> only<00:03:16.810> one<00:03:17.200> yeah<00:03:17.650> against<00:03:18.579> mer<00:03:19.060> males<00:03:19.299> I

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
think only one yeah against mer males I

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.420 
think only one yeah against mer males I
just<00:03:19.900> kept<00:03:20.109> I<00:03:20.260> had<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.590> faders<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.099> hand<00:03:21.310> and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
just kept I had to faders in hand and

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.490 
just kept I had to faders in hand and
