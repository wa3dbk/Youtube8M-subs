next<00:00:20.460> gen<00:00:20.640> consoles<00:00:21.090> came<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.630> since

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
next gen consoles came out and since

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.720 
next gen consoles came out and since
I've<00:00:22.260> had<00:00:22.410> both<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.800> them<00:00:22.890> since<00:00:23.130> launch<00:00:23.430> I've

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
I've had both of them since launch I've

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.550 
I've had both of them since launch I've
had<00:00:24.180> some<00:00:24.510> time<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.779> experience<00:00:25.260> playing

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
had some time to experience playing

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.200 
had some time to experience playing
games<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.980> both<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.160> them<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.880> thought<00:00:27.060> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
games on both of them and I thought I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.519 
games on both of them and I thought I
would<00:00:27.300> make<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.689> video<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> let<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.320> guys

would make this video to let you guys

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.560 
would make this video to let you guys
know<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.460> impressions<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.060> each<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.420> them

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
know what my impressions of each of them

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.990 
know what my impressions of each of them
are<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.960> far<00:00:31.279> I'm<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> tell<00:00:32.969> you

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
are so far I'm not going to tell you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.280 
are so far I'm not going to tell you
which<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.660> better<00:00:33.870> because

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
which one I think is better because

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.690 
which one I think is better because
honestly<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.890> think<00:00:35.040> they're<00:00:35.340> both<00:00:35.489> great

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
honestly I think they're both great

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
honestly I think they're both great
consoles<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.540> he<00:00:36.660> couldn't<00:00:36.930> go<00:00:37.050> wrong<00:00:37.079> with

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
consoles and he couldn't go wrong with

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.040 
consoles and he couldn't go wrong with
picking<00:00:37.620> either<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.219> them<00:00:38.660> instead<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:39.870> going

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
picking either of them instead I'm going

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.660 
picking either of them instead I'm going
to<00:00:40.170> tell<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> what<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:40.739> each<00:00:41.070> console

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to tell you what I think each console

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
to tell you what I think each console
does<00:00:41.910> better<00:00:42.180> than<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.510> other<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.079> least

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
does better than the other one at least

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
does better than the other one at least
so<00:00:43.710> far<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.610> say<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:44.850> far<00:00:45.210> because

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so far and I say so far because

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
so far and I say so far because
obviously<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> very<00:00:46.980> early

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
obviously we are in the very early

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
obviously we are in the very early
stages<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.149> consoles<00:00:48.539> lives<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.020> both

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
stages of these consoles lives and both

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.810 
stages of these consoles lives and both
of<00:00:49.500> them<00:00:49.710> are<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.250> even<00:00:50.399> better<00:00:50.610> as

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
of them are going to get even better as

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.330 
of them are going to get even better as
the<00:00:50.940> months<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.329> years<00:00:51.390> go<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.129> there's<00:00:53.129> going

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the months and years go on there's going

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.040 
the months and years go on there's going
to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> ton<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.879> new<00:00:54.090> features<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.539> clouds

that<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> PSN<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:22.259> evolve<00:01:22.439> much<00:01:22.890> more

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that the PSN can evolve much more

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
ps3 so let's get into talking about my

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.929 
ps3 so let's get into talking about my
impressions<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> start<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
impressions I'm going to start with the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.450 
impressions I'm going to start with the
ps4<00:01:30.240> first<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:31.530> does<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.979> better<00:01:32.250> than

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
ps4 first what does it do better than

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.520 
ps4 first what does it do better than
the<00:01:32.579> xbox<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.329> might<00:01:33.450> ask<00:01:33.630> me<00:01:33.900> well<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the xbox one you might ask me well the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.700 
the xbox one you might ask me well the
answer<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.860> hardware<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:36.720> ps4<00:01:37.079> console

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
answer is hardware the ps4 console

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.469 
answer is hardware the ps4 console
itself<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.430> powerful<00:01:38.610> than<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.090> xbox

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
itself is more powerful than the xbox

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.510 
itself is more powerful than the xbox
one<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> huge<00:01:40.799> massive<00:01:41.369> difference

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
one it's not a huge massive difference

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
one it's not a huge massive difference
but<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.180> ps4<00:01:42.509> definitely<00:01:43.110> does<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.500> better

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
but the ps4 definitely does have better

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.160 
but the ps4 definitely does have better
rim<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.820> far<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.390> difference<00:01:45.750> has<00:01:45.930> shown

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
rim and so far the difference has shown

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
rim and so far the difference has shown
in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> resolution<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> some<00:01:47.250> games<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
in the resolution of some games on the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.719 
in the resolution of some games on the
ps4<00:01:48.470> many<00:01:49.470> games<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.979> Call<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> Duty<00:01:50.490> ghosts

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
ps4 many games like Call of Duty ghosts

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.730 
ps4 many games like Call of Duty ghosts
and<00:01:50.880> assassins<00:01:51.479> creed<00:01:51.630> 4<00:01:51.689> run<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.500> higher

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and assassins creed 4 run at higher

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
and assassins creed 4 run at higher
native<00:01:53.340> resolutions<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> ps4<00:01:54.390> than<00:01:54.750> they

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
native resolutions on the ps4 than they

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.050 
native resolutions on the ps4 than they
do<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.200> Xbox<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.799> both<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.729> these<00:01:56.820> games

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
do on the Xbox one both of these games

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.230 
do on the Xbox one both of these games
run<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.570> 1080p<00:01:58.079> natively<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> ps4<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.850> at

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
run at 1080p natively on the ps4 and at

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.260 
run at 1080p natively on the ps4 and at
720p<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.200> 900p<00:02:01.979> respectively<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> Xbox

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
720p and 900p respectively on the Xbox

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.749 
720p and 900p respectively on the Xbox
one<00:02:03.649> what<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.799> means<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.549> need<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
one what that means is that they need to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.089 
one what that means is that they need to
be<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.090> converted<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> 1080p<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.320> xbox<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
be up converted to 1080p on xbox and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.740 
be up converted to 1080p on xbox and
this<00:02:08.580> makes<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> these<00:02:09.300> games<00:02:09.539> look

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
this makes it so that these games look

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.530 
this makes it so that these games look
more<00:02:09.989> crisp<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> ps4<00:02:11.390> imagine<00:02:12.390> you're

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
more crisp on the ps4 imagine you're

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730 
more crisp on the ps4 imagine you're
editing<00:02:12.900> two<00:02:13.170> different<00:02:13.500> pic

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
editing two different pic

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.260 
editing two different pic
once<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.160> larger<00:02:14.550> picture<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.030> one's<00:02:15.180> a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
once a larger picture and one's a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.480 
once a larger picture and one's a
smaller<00:02:15.540> picture<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.170> then<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:17.100> stretch<00:02:17.370> out

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
smaller picture and then you stretch out

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.220 
smaller picture and then you stretch out
the<00:02:17.640> smaller<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.300> be<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> same<00:02:18.750> size<00:02:18.990> as

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
the smaller one to be the same size as

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.750 
the smaller one to be the same size as
the<00:02:19.350> large<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:19.830> leave<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> larger<00:02:20.640> one

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the large one and leave the larger one

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.790 
the large one and leave the larger one
alone<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.660> course<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.110> smaller<00:02:22.350> one<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.650> going

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
alone of course the smaller one is going

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.290 
alone of course the smaller one is going
to<00:02:22.890> look<00:02:23.100> less<00:02:23.310> clear<00:02:23.580> than<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.880> large<00:02:24.060> one

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
to look less clear than the large one

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.540 
to look less clear than the large one
and<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.110> case<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.560> ps4<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> larger

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and in this case the ps4 is the larger

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.370 
and in this case the ps4 is the larger
image<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.300> Xbox<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.080> smaller

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
image and the Xbox one is the smaller

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.140 
image and the Xbox one is the smaller
this<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.190> not<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.460> say<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.640> these<00:02:29.910> games

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
this is not to say that these games

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.270 
this is not to say that these games
don't<00:02:30.420> look<00:02:30.600> good<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> Xbox<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.650> fact

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
don't look good on the Xbox one in fact

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.620 
don't look good on the Xbox one in fact
they<00:02:32.430> still<00:02:32.670> look<00:02:32.790> great<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.150> you'd<00:02:33.480> still

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
they still look great and you'd still

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.480 
they still look great and you'd still
have<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.870> great<00:02:34.020> time<00:02:34.260> playing<00:02:34.470> them<00:02:34.770> there<00:02:34.950> but

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
have a great time playing them there but

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.550 
have a great time playing them there but
if<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.850> do<00:02:36.000> compare<00:02:36.390> them<00:02:36.540> side<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.810> side<00:02:37.110> with

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
if you do compare them side to side with

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.350 
if you do compare them side to side with
the<00:02:37.680> ps4<00:02:37.950> versions<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.790> will<00:02:38.940> see<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.240> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the ps4 versions you will see that the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.410 
the ps4 versions you will see that the
ps4<00:02:39.540> ones<00:02:39.990> do<00:02:40.230> look<00:02:40.440> slightly<00:02:40.710> better<00:02:41.420> another

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
ps4 ones do look slightly better another

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.090 
ps4 ones do look slightly better another
part<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.870> hardware<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.440> ps4<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:44.070> I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
part of the hardware of the ps4 that I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800 
part of the hardware of the ps4 that I
like<00:02:44.280> better<00:02:44.460> than<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> xbox<00:02:45.150> one<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
like better than the xbox one is the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.110 
like better than the xbox one is the
controller<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.530> love<00:02:47.130> how<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> ps4<00:02:47.640> controller

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
controller I love how the ps4 controller

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.700 
controller I love how the ps4 controller
has<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.450> grip<00:02:48.720> surface<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.380> back<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
has the grip surface on the back of the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.350 
has the grip surface on the back of the
controller<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.610> all<00:02:50.850> four<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
controller and on all four of the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.500 
controller and on all four of the
triggers<00:02:51.720> r1<00:02:52.200> r2<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.950> l1<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.400> l2<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.910> just

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
triggers r1 r2 and l1 and l2 it just

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.540 
triggers r1 r2 and l1 and l2 it just
feels<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.900> comfortable<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.590> use<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:55.800> even

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
feels so comfortable to use and even

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.980 
feels so comfortable to use and even
though<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.910> trackpad<00:02:57.300> hasn't<00:02:57.690> been<00:02:57.780> used

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
though the trackpad hasn't been used

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.860 
though the trackpad hasn't been used
that<00:02:58.140> much<00:02:58.170> yet<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.800> feels<00:02:58.860> very<00:02:59.280> nice<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.870> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
that much yet it feels very nice to the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.810 
that much yet it feels very nice to the
one<00:03:01.080> part<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> xbox<00:03:01.920> one<00:03:02.250> controller<00:03:02.610> that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
one part of the xbox one controller that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.640 
one part of the xbox one controller that
I<00:03:02.910> do<00:03:02.970> like<00:03:03.270> better<00:03:03.510> than<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.780> ps4<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
I do like better than the ps4 is the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.620 
I do like better than the ps4 is the
thumb<00:03:04.860> sticks<00:03:05.190> around<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.060> edges<00:03:06.210> of<00:03:06.450> them

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
thumb sticks around the edges of them

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.450 
thumb sticks around the edges of them
there's<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.990> grip<00:03:07.260> material<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.220> makes<00:03:08.370> it

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
there's a grip material and it makes it

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.190 
there's a grip material and it makes it
so<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.670> your<00:03:08.940> thumb<00:03:09.210> stays<00:03:09.450> directly<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
so that your thumb stays directly in the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.840 
so that your thumb stays directly in the
middle<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> stick<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.460> think<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.760> gives

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
middle of the stick and I think it gives

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.130 
middle of the stick and I think it gives
you<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> little<00:03:12.390> bit<00:03:12.570> better<00:03:12.660> control<00:03:13.110> over

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
you a little bit better control over

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.130 
you a little bit better control over
your<00:03:13.410> character<00:03:13.830> in<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.070> camera<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:15.750> with

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
your character in the camera so with

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.990 
your character in the camera so with
that<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:17.010> good<00:03:17.130> transition<00:03:17.550> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that I think it's a good transition to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.090 
that I think it's a good transition to
what<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.150> think<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.510> xbox<00:03:19.020> one<00:03:19.260> does<00:03:19.800> better

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
what I think the xbox one does better

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.340 
what I think the xbox one does better
than<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.400> ps4<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.510> answer<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.960> that<00:03:21.990> is

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
than the ps4 and the answer to that is

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.190 
than the ps4 and the answer to that is
software<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:23.480> think<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:24.750> should<00:03:25.020> come

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
software I think that this should come

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.080 
software I think that this should come
at<00:03:25.290> no<00:03:25.440> surprise<00:03:25.800> since<00:03:26.190> Microsoft<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.940> of

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
at no surprise since Microsoft is of

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.330 
at no surprise since Microsoft is of
course<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.420> software<00:03:27.810> company<00:03:27.960> but<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:29.160> user

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
course a software company but the user

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.460 
course a software company but the user
interface<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.030> xbox<00:03:30.300> one<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.780> superior<00:03:31.320> to

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
interface of the xbox one is superior to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.310 
interface of the xbox one is superior to
that<00:03:31.710> of<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.040> ps4<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.550> my<00:03:32.670> opinion<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.960> feels<00:03:34.260> a

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
that of the ps4 in my opinion it feels a

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.110 
that of the ps4 in my opinion it feels a
lot<00:03:34.440> faster<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.890> more<00:03:35.130> responsive<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.850> I

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
lot faster and more responsive and I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.280 
lot faster and more responsive and I
didn't<00:03:36.390> think<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.630> would<00:03:36.690> really<00:03:36.900> care<00:03:37.140> about

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
didn't think I would really care about

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.080 
didn't think I would really care about
or<00:03:37.620> use<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.920> Kinect<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.310> much<00:03:38.580> but<00:03:38.970> it

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
or use the Kinect that much but it

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.460 
or use the Kinect that much but it
actually<00:03:39.240> is<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.600> very<00:03:39.870> useful<00:03:40.050> tool<00:03:40.440> for

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
actually is a very useful tool for

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.300 
actually is a very useful tool for
multitasking<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.850> Xbox<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:43.530> far<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.950> lot<00:03:44.010> of

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
multitasking on the Xbox so far a lot of

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.160 
multitasking on the Xbox so far a lot of
the<00:03:44.400> time<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.820> think<00:03:45.210> that<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.420> ps4<00:03:45.570> UI<00:03:46.020> is

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
the time I think that the ps4 UI is

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.260 
the time I think that the ps4 UI is
actually<00:03:46.620> pretty<00:03:46.770> slow<00:03:47.070> sometimes<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:48.150> takes

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
actually pretty slow sometimes it takes

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.000 
actually pretty slow sometimes it takes
a<00:03:48.420> couple<00:03:48.570> seconds<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.170> loads<00:03:49.350> my<00:03:49.500> friend<00:03:49.770> to

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
a couple seconds to loads my friend to

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.710 
a couple seconds to loads my friend to
load<00:03:50.190> my<00:03:50.370> friends<00:03:50.670> list<00:03:50.880> or<00:03:51.120> messages<00:03:51.540> and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
load my friends list or messages and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.660 
load my friends list or messages and
then<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.410> send<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.710> message<00:03:52.830> accept<00:03:53.460> a<00:03:53.550> friend

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
then to send a message accept a friend

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.670 
then to send a message accept a friend
request<00:03:53.790> or<00:03:54.180> join<00:03:54.360> someones<00:03:54.600> game<00:03:55.020> takes<00:03:55.560> a

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
request or join someones game takes a

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.640 
request or join someones game takes a
few<00:03:55.890> seconds<00:03:56.220> as<00:03:56.370> well<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:57.510> works<00:03:57.780> faster<00:03:58.350> when

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
few seconds as well it works faster when

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.050 
few seconds as well it works faster when
you're<00:03:58.770> not<00:03:58.890> playing<00:03:59.070> a<00:03:59.280> game<00:03:59.310> but<00:03:59.910> when

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
you're not playing a game but when

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.980 
you're not playing a game but when
you're<00:04:00.210> in<00:04:00.240> game<00:04:00.570> it's<00:04:00.780> definitely

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
you're in game it's definitely

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.350 
you're in game it's definitely
noticeably<00:04:01.650> slower<00:04:01.860> like<00:04:02.580> for<00:04:02.730> example<00:04:02.820> when

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
noticeably slower like for example when

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.120 
noticeably slower like for example when
I'm<00:04:03.450> playing<00:04:03.570> call<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.870> duty<00:04:03.960> ghosts<00:04:04.500> i<00:04:04.650> click

freezes<00:04:08.640> for<00:04:08.820> like<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.000> couple<00:04:09.270> seconds

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
