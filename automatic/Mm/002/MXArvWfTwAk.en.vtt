00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
throughout this game some things I liked

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.350 
throughout this game some things I liked
about<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.100> game<00:01:58.310> was<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.820> music<00:01:59.270> was

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
about this game was that the music was

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.719 
about this game was that the music was
really<00:01:59.659> good<00:01:59.869> if<00:02:00.470> you're<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.159> fan<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.460> Lord<00:02:01.610> of

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
really good if you're a fan of Lord of

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:02.710 
really good if you're a fan of Lord of
the<00:02:01.790> Rings<00:02:01.970> you'll<00:02:02.180> definitely<00:02:02.479> like<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
the Rings you'll definitely like the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.710 
the Rings you'll definitely like the
music<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:04.549> be<00:02:04.670> honest<00:02:04.939> I<00:02:05.060> didn't<00:02:05.390> hate<00:02:05.510> this

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
music to be honest I didn't hate this

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.960 
music to be honest I didn't hate this
game<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.439> think<00:02:06.799> that<00:02:07.159> if<00:02:07.369> you're<00:02:07.490> fans<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.880> the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
game I think that if you're fans of the

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.609 
game I think that if you're fans of the
Lord

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
Lord

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.770 
Lord

even<00:02:11.590> though<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.860> does<00:02:12.069> like<00:02:12.310> difficulty<00:02:13.000> it's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
even though it does like difficulty it's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.470 
even though it does like difficulty it's
rather<00:02:14.019> easy<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.220> rather<00:02:15.370> short<00:02:15.700> it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
rather easy and is rather short it's

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.990 
rather easy and is rather short it's
still<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> fun<00:02:17.049> playthrough<00:02:17.739> in<00:02:17.980> my<00:02:18.489> opinion

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
still a fun playthrough in my opinion

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.390 
still a fun playthrough in my opinion
especially<00:02:19.540> from<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.230> price<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.769> now<00:02:21.099> I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
especially from the price it is now I

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.030 
especially from the price it is now I
think<00:02:21.670> pre-owned<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.330> like<00:02:22.540> 10<00:02:22.930> bucks<00:02:23.170> that's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
think pre-owned is like 10 bucks that's

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.619 
think pre-owned is like 10 bucks that's
