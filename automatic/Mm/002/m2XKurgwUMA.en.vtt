so first you chicas I think being

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.649 
so first you chicas I think being
unsatisfied<00:00:02.639> with<00:00:02.669> modern<00:00:03.149> medicine<00:00:03.419> are

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
unsatisfied with modern medicine are

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.539 
unsatisfied with modern medicine are
unsatisfied<00:00:04.350> with<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.650> options<00:00:05.009> we<00:00:05.130> have<00:00:05.339> are

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
unsatisfied with the options we have are

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.059 
unsatisfied with the options we have are
unsatisfied<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:07.529> can't<00:00:07.770> answer<00:00:07.950> that

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
unsatisfied that you can't answer that

better<00:00:10.590> as<00:00:11.370> part<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:11.759> keeps<00:00:11.910> me<00:00:12.150> going<00:00:12.179> I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
better as part of what keeps me going I

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.970 
better as part of what keeps me going I
do<00:00:12.750> think<00:00:13.019> that's<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.259> piece<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.440> our<00:00:13.650> culture

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
do think that's a piece of our culture

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.250 
do think that's a piece of our culture
it's<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> feeling<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.839> should<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.080> able<00:00:16.139> to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
it's a feeling that we should be able to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.970 
it's a feeling that we should be able to
do<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.470> better<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:22.199> mindset<00:00:22.800> with

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
do this better the mindset with

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.089 
do this better the mindset with
antibodies<00:00:23.699> nearly<00:00:24.090> 1990s<00:00:24.869> was<00:00:25.199> been<00:00:25.859> there

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
antibodies nearly 1990s was been there

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
antibodies nearly 1990s was been there
done<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.369> didn't<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> field

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
done that didn't work you know the field

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.120 
done that didn't work you know the field
was<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.070> new<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.449> lot<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.929> people<00:00:31.529> had

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
was so so new that a lot of people had

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.280 
was so so new that a lot of people had
given<00:00:32.340> up<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.969> antibodies<00:00:33.600> has<00:00:33.780> ever<00:00:34.020> been

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
given up on antibodies has ever been

there<00:00:36.329> was<00:00:36.480> no<00:00:36.630> playbook<00:00:37.370> there<00:00:38.370> was

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
there was no playbook there was

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.990 
there was no playbook there was
basically<00:00:39.680> folks<00:00:40.680> had<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.040> figure<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.610> how<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
basically folks had to figure out how to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.220 
basically folks had to figure out how to
do<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.079> first<00:00:43.440> time<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.550> right

our bodies that recognize foreign
invaders<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.030> generate<00:00:54.329> any<00:00:54.510> antibody<00:00:54.840> in

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
invaders we can generate any antibody in

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.560 
invaders we can generate any antibody in
the<00:00:55.110> lab<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:56.010> recognizes<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.969> particular

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the lab that recognizes that particular

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
the lab that recognizes that particular
protein<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.320> want<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.829> less<00:00:59.100> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
protein that we want to have less of

around<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.760> cancer<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> analogy<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.010> like

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
around in cancer the analogy that I like

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.709 
around in cancer the analogy that I like
to<00:01:02.399> use<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.879> when<00:01:03.059> you're<00:01:03.180> flying<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> plane

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
to use is when you're flying on a plane

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.560 
to use is when you're flying on a plane
there<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.470> map<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.369> airlines<00:01:06.030> routes

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
there is a map of the airlines routes

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.170 
there is a map of the airlines routes
that<00:01:07.110> map<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.860> always<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.520> complicated

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that map is always really complicated

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.410 
that map is always really complicated
and<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.740> try<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.580> biological

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and what we try to do in biological

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.679 
and what we try to do in biological
systems<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.580> to<00:01:14.580> map<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.270> Network

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
systems is also to map out that Network

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.260 
systems is also to map out that Network
and<00:01:16.009> for<00:01:17.009> us<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.430> figure<00:01:17.729> out<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:17.970> are

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and for us to then figure out what are

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.510 
and for us to then figure out what are
the<00:01:18.390> most<00:01:18.540> important<00:01:19.110> notes<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.280> if

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the most important notes just like if

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.039 
the most important notes just like if
you<00:01:20.640> wanted<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> shut<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.420> particular

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
you wanted to shut down a particular

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.710 
you wanted to shut down a particular
airline<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.369> certain<00:01:23.700> hubs<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.659> are

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
airline there are certain hubs that are

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.899 
airline there are certain hubs that are
you<00:01:24.930> shut<00:01:25.259> down<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.280> shut<00:01:26.460> down<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you shut down you would shut down that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.179 
you shut down you would shut down that
Network<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:28.290> trying<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> same

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
Network and we're trying to do the same

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.249 
Network and we're trying to do the same
thing<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> cancer<00:01:30.060> biology<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.869> figure<00:01:31.229> out

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
thing in cancer biology is figure out

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
thing in cancer biology is figure out
what<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> most<00:01:32.009> important<00:01:32.520> nodes<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
what are the most important nodes to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.450 
what are the most important nodes to
antagonize<00:01:33.750> them<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.100> whether<00:01:35.310> or

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
antagonize them and then see whether or

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.830 
antagonize them and then see whether or
not<00:01:35.549> there's<00:01:35.759> any<00:01:35.939> benefit

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
not there's any benefit

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.200 
not there's any benefit
you<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.740> genetics<00:01:38.280> been<00:01:38.460> successful<00:01:39.150> in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you know genetics been successful in

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.359 
you know genetics been successful in
antibodies<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.829> number<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
antibodies for you know a number of

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
antibodies for you know a number of
reasons<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:42.000> being<00:01:42.420> willing<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> take

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
reasons I think being willing to take

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.030 
reasons I think being willing to take
risks<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.579> explore<00:01:45.090> new<00:01:45.570> areas<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.649> overall

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
risks to explore new areas the overall

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.280 
risks to explore new areas the overall
quality<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> rigor<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.600> science<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
quality and the rigor of the science I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.520 
quality and the rigor of the science I
think<00:01:50.100> having<00:01:50.369> expertise<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.570> many<00:01:52.229> different

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
think having expertise in many different

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
think having expertise in many different
areas<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.670> biology<00:01:54.590> technology<00:01:55.700> clinical<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
areas of biology technology clinical it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.719 
areas of biology technology clinical it
really<00:01:57.299> does<00:01:57.509> take<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> village<00:01:58.399> there<00:01:59.399> will

really does take a village there will

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.810 
really does take a village there will
probably<00:02:00.060> come<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> time<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.200> next<00:02:01.680> five<00:02:02.430> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
probably come a time in the next five to

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.170 
probably come a time in the next five to
ten<00:02:03.030> years<00:02:03.479> where<00:02:04.439> cancer<00:02:05.399> patients<00:02:06.000> have

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
ten years where cancer patients have

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.830 
ten years where cancer patients have
their<00:02:06.450> entire<00:02:06.810> tumor<00:02:07.560> sequence<00:02:08.720> there<00:02:09.720> are

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
their entire tumor sequence there are

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.619 
their entire tumor sequence there are
kind<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.050> normal<00:02:10.470> cells<00:02:10.879> sequenced<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
kind of normal cells sequenced and

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.869 
kind of normal cells sequenced and
they'll<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.379> thumb<00:02:14.160> drive<00:02:14.190> and

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
they'll have it on a thumb drive and

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.360 
they'll have it on a thumb drive and
they'll<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.239> their<00:02:15.540> doctor<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.290> say<00:02:16.530> you

they'll go to their doctor and say you

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.880 
they'll go to their doctor and say you
know<00:02:17.489> here's<00:02:17.730> my<00:02:17.910> information<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.870> idea<00:02:19.410> is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
know here's my information this idea is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.990 
know here's my information this idea is
a<00:02:20.540> particular<00:02:21.540> concept<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:23.310> we've<00:02:23.580> embraced

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
a particular concept that we've embraced

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.540 
a particular concept that we've embraced
this<00:02:24.720> whole<00:02:25.080> personalized<00:02:25.860> health<00:02:26.250> care

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
this whole personalized health care

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.350 
this whole personalized health care
concept<00:02:27.230> we<00:02:28.230> identify<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.980> alterations<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:30.209> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
concept we identify the alterations of a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.970 
concept we identify the alterations of a
particular<00:02:31.050> patient<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:32.090> then<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.680> look<00:02:34.680> for

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
particular patient and then we look for

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.410 
particular patient and then we look for
drugs<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.610> treat<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:36.209> patient<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:38.420> we're

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
drugs to treat that patient and we're

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.260 
drugs to treat that patient and we're
going<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.660> continue<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:40.349> more<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.590> that

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
going to continue to do more of that

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.759 
going to continue to do more of that
