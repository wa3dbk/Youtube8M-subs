00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.450
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
 video as you see I am in gta 5 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.280
 in history I'm using the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
 franklin character and as you see 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.699
 wear the secret mask I have 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.289
 shown in the last video for whom 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.470
 I had not seen put link here 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.939
 on the screen then click on it 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.560
 this mask here after I did 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.510
 that video where I explained how 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.689
 take it some of you sent me 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.649
 of messages telling me using 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.420
 the motorcycle the character puts on a helmet 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.940
 removing the helmet the mask changes 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.940
 completely transforms it comes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.920
 another secret therefore I am now 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 here with you to do it live 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.660
 first of all before doing everything there 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.410
 I meant that this mask is not 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.750
 anti gas 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.180
 I also tried to throw bombs 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.579
 those of the gas in practice the character 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.219
 calmly dies so let's go and try 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.129
 right away if this thing is true or not 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.840
 I don't remember if I removed the radio 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.689
 here it is, let's remove it immediately 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.250
 as you can see the character puts on 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.580
 helmet 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.100
 we see and can already be seen in the distance that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.860
 in something then we leave the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.869
 motorcycle should now be removed 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.009
 let's wait a while for a helmet 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.930
 seconds 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.020
 here it is guys look at the mask 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.259
 it's completely changed it's a mask 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.939
 as a sub this is no longer like that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.520
 before it was just a typical mask 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.079
 doc is this here has become a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.619
 diving mask let's see if I can 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.610
 zoom well look here always black and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.920
 green is always inside green 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.710
 look at that stuff is one thing 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.450
 really I can't explain to you guys 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.630
 let's try it out right away 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.670
 here it works maybe if it keeps us back 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 the breath more in the water even if it does 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.990
 I doubt why we don't have the tanks of 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.990
 oxygen however we try and see 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.250
 yes no the air here continues to fall 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.780
 so absolutely not needed 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.550
 until we have the tanks of 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.960
 oxygen this mask is useless 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.240
 then 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.840
 really strange things are 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.860
 happening to the character of franklin 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.740
 look a little I don't know at all 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.640
 why the rock star put these 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.950
 things in here 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.800
 if it's a bug if something I don't know 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.380
 absolutely why these happen 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.720
 things here anyway guys I thank 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.360
