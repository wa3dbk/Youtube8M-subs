00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.870
 to know the widgets that I consider 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.609
 which are more prominent or those that are more 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.160
 functional so if you want to know

 of widget a pretty application 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.410
 classic that takes a long time in google 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.510
 play currently version 4.1 requires 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.520
 android 4.0 and the payment but it is 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.200
 pretty good to download it if the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.520

 mexico now let's select 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.989
 any of these widgets so that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.910
 let's see how the application works like this 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.170
 who selected this and placed it in 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.150
 any place or on any screen 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.040
 of my phone simply loose and 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.170
 let's start to configure this we see 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.640
 here we can change the color by 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.740
 example that I want the watch to be of 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.630
 a color more or less like that blue or not 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.700
 let's put the red ones so they do not 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.259
 lose with the background color now 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.000
 simply here we can change the 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.940
 background as much as we can select a 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.800
 blue background or red white background 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.750
 etcetera has many options for 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.649
 customization here we can change the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.200
 watch type 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.090
 for example to place this we see that and 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.830
 changed the type and good has many 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.450
 options for us to give you a 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.770
 quite attractive touch to our 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.820
 phone we simply press here 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.560
 above 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.090
 it is already configured so it is a 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.530
 Pretty recommended widget that you 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.229
 I recommend that you download it and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.120
 enjoy on your phone now if you have 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.830
 android 2.3 I recommend downloading this 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.500
 application that is called minimalist text 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.390
 it's a pretty smart widget that has 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.060
 different sizes and as they say in 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.320
 Spain is the support in onion we are going to 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.970
 see that here we have different sizes 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.650
 to personalize our screen 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.630
 phone if I select for example 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.160
 this he pressed it I put it in any 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.200
 instead of the screen I release it now 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.060
 then we are going to design it to our 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.830
 style more than different styles by 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.619
 example the time for example here to the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 time and time the battery for example 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.709
 the climate in degrees celsio nin fahrenheit 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.480
 so he selected for example from 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.430
 battery and then we see that what 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.900
 we can design as we want 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.090
 adjust the background as we want and 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.730
 pressed here we see that we can remove the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.230
 background or put a different color here 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.880
 below we are going to see a preview of 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.110
 all the adjustments that we are making if 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.970
 we go to the next tab then 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.700
 we can go to the orientation in the other 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.500
 because the design here we can see the style 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.850
 of the text we can change to the text and 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.989
 everything if we wish it and good is 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.519
 quite complete up to the language 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.810
 we can change already when you set 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.060
 all you press here 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.310
 and we see how it is deposited in our 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.780
 android so pretty recommended 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.130
 this widget so you can see him for 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.550
 use it and customize the screen 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.260
 of your android download it that is free 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.940
 good and we continue with super widget a 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.099
 application or a group of applications 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.239
 pretty useful for us to be able 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.010
 customize the screen to our 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.989
 phone then is that different styles 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.910
 so he selected for example this from 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.860
 here below you just have to 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.420
 press it to place it on the screen and 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.730
 we see that after sizing what 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.370
 we press here and ready and we press 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.209
 again to go to the configurations 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.450
 here the configurations we can 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.590
 find variety of watches or widgets 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.480
 that we can place in our phone 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.459
 so that you look at the most 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.690
 appropriate that we want to see 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.150
 that there are different styles so it's going to 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.680
 select for example this marked it to 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.299
 next I go to the design we see that 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.640
 we can change the layout the color 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.739
 we can even that when we 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.819
 let's mark with the finger on the widget it 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.500
 run an application so 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.299
 simply in this case it's going to change you 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.910
 color to place a red color 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.349
 press capresi 1 on this option and 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.400
 we see that the appearance has already changed 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.159
 now yes I go back 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.500
 is already stored or placed in the 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.700
 screen of our mobile phone we see 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.379
 that as they say in Colombia our 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.150
 phone is a chambita with this 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.920
 widget so it's a widget that requires 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.420
 android 3.0 so it can work and 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.739
 it's free there's a paid version 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.439
 It is also quite complete so 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.689
 download it on your good phone and 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.670
 We continue with one uader a widget that 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.170
 it's good so let's see the 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.959
 different options by emplo selected 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.609
 this one here dragged him to the screen what 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.930
 loose and then if you press it 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.670
 with the configurations we will see that 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.190
 we have many options for 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.599
 configure it for example here we can 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.419
 place our location here we add 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.310
 then the town and so on then here 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.109
 we can change the background this background 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.639
 that it brings by default depending on the 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.199
 weather if it's raining or if it's 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.760
 night if this day I'm changing 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.350
 automatically reflecting then the 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.460
 weather but you can 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.990
 change here where it says funds 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.349
 pressing for example if you want a 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.120
 dark if you want another with more light or 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.470
 just if you want a transparent one 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.669
 you press it here and ready 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.650
 here you can change the color and so on 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.479
 then he customizes expressions here 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.039
 above and we see that it is already deposited 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.230
 in your walk we will see how elegant 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.540
 it looks and we see that you can also add 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.670
 other alternative windows pressing 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.050
 here we go again here to drawer 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.420
 widgets and we can select 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.010
 For example, we put this wheel here 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.870
 we see that we already have a new style 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.190
 just here to customize him 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.410
 we change the color for example we place 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.760
 the orange of mole to accept and we go 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.470
 as it remains in this way we can 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.240
 add many widgets with this 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.640
 application so download it in your 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.320
 Android is free good we continue with 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.390
 another classic of the widgets that is called 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.190
 elixer here we have it here we are seeing 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.770
 different shapes selected by 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.700
 example is 3 x 1 we place here 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.010
 on the screen 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.630
 then the editor is executed and 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.070
 Here we can do the following for 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.780
 example if we press on every X of 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.310
 they can add such as a 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.320
 application that when I select or 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.970
 press the button to execute in 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.100
 any system application too 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.140
 we can add some functions like 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.220
 for example the state of the battery here 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.190
 let's place for example another application 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.280
 we are going to launch an application that is 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.800
 for example a game is here and here 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.960
 let's select 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.389
 another two other two options as per 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.280
 example the use of the cpu and finally 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.409
 let's select any random 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.180
 for example the wifi we place the traffic 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.949
 we put it better here we see that 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.319
 we already have our design here in those 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.699
 options we can change the package of 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.069
 icons to make it look much nicer 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.060
 we can change the color and so on now 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.500
 when we have our style 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.810
 We press on creating and we see how 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.250
 is on the phone so with this 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.199
 widget can perform different 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.580
 functions and I press any button 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.990
 of these of the game for example we see that 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.460
 press here and my game runs like this 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.409
 which is a recommended application for 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.300
 what do you say on your good phone and 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.159
 we finish with dash clot widget one of 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.599
 the best widget for android requires 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.610
 Android four points so you can 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.409
 work and let's see its functions what 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.690
 pressed it placed it on any screen 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.800
 of the phone with what is cool here 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.020
 then let's start 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.310
 configure this application requires
