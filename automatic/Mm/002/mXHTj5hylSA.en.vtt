what I mean by that
it<00:03:56.190> just<00:03:56.400> won't<00:03:56.520> form<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.000> proper<00:03:57.210> sinker<00:03:57.660> until

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it just won't form a proper sinker until

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.040 
it just won't form a proper sinker until
the<00:03:58.590> moulds<00:03:58.950> at<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.130> right<00:03:59.280> temperature<00:03:59.820> so<00:04:00.050> I

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
the moulds at the right temperature so I

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.050 
the moulds at the right temperature so I
preheated<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.770> mold<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.220> let's<00:04:02.640> see<00:04:02.820> how<00:04:03.000> we

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
preheated the mold so let's see how we

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.470 
preheated the mold so let's see how we
go<00:04:03.300> I've<00:04:03.660> got<00:04:04.350> my<00:04:04.500> lead<00:04:04.710> nice<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.160> hot<00:04:05.480> and
