looking<00:01:58.700> down<00:01:58.909> at<00:01:59.180> my<00:01:59.299> feet<00:01:59.539> and<00:01:59.600> they'd<00:02:00.140> be

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
looking down at my feet and they'd be

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.770 
looking down at my feet and they'd be
back<00:02:00.590> underneath<00:02:01.399> me<00:02:01.670> almost<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.720> I'm

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
back underneath me almost and I'm

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.800

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
thinking maybe that's the natural

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.199
