going to be back there's only about 40

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.340 
going to be back there's only about 40
to<00:00:19.140> go<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.440> you're<00:00:19.530> behind<00:00:19.740> your<00:00:19.920> feet<00:00:20.010> away

now<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.860> to<00:00:22.950> point<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.250> I'm<00:00:23.730> not<00:00:23.940> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
now I just like to point out I'm not a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750 
now I just like to point out I'm not a
sniper<00:00:24.270> I'm<00:00:24.870> a<00:00:24.930> scout<00:00:25.320> my<00:00:25.890> snipers<00:00:26.280> not<00:00:26.460> here

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
sniper I'm a scout my snipers not here

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.750 
sniper I'm a scout my snipers not here
right<00:00:26.880> now<00:00:26.940> so<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.990> how<00:00:28.770> well<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.610> that

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
right now so the how well you see that

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.610 
right now so the how well you see that
this<00:00:29.910> totally<00:00:30.450> depends<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:31.020> own<00:00:31.170> skill

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:31.620 
this totally depends on your own skill

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.560 
this totally depends on your own skill
also<00:00:32.309> where<00:00:32.730> we're<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.360> now<00:00:33.390> we

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
also where we're out here right now we

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.190 
also where we're out here right now we
live<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.140> very<00:00:34.440> windy<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.070> cold<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
live it's very windy very cold so the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.919 
live it's very windy very cold so the
wind<00:00:37.410> will<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> factor<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.640> test<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:39.929 
wind will be a factor in this test and

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.819 
wind will be a factor in this test and
also<00:00:40.969> I'm<00:00:41.969> using<00:00:42.059> 0.25<00:00:42.480> grand<00:00:43.289> BB<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.769> I'm

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
also I'm using 0.25 grand BB so I'm

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.959 
also I'm using 0.25 grand BB so I'm
going<00:00:43.949> to<00:00:44.010> try<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.249> negate<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> wind<00:00:44.820> effect

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
going to try and negate the wind effect

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.899 
going to try and negate the wind effect
placing<00:00:45.690> them<00:00:45.870> got<00:00:46.769> four<00:00:47.010> thirty<00:00:47.219> four<00:00:47.519> forty

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
placing them got four thirty four forty

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.060 
placing them got four thirty four forty
with<00:00:48.059> 0.25<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.589> to<00:00:49.620> start<00:00:49.859> right

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
with 0.25 and I'm going to start right

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:29.700 
with 0.25 and I'm going to start right

proud you can probably tell that from

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.999 
proud you can probably tell that from
the<00:01:44.719> way<00:01:44.869> my<00:01:45.170> voice<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.590> getting<00:01:45.829> a<00:01:45.890> little

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
the way my voice is getting a little

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.760 
the way my voice is getting a little
chopped<00:01:46.399> up<00:01:47.560> anyway

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
chopped up anyway

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.919

let's<00:01:49.340> look<00:01:49.579> at<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.759> target<00:01:52.599> now<00:01:53.599> we<00:01:53.689> fired

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
let's look at the target now we fired

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.830 
let's look at the target now we fired
four<00:01:54.409> shots<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.950> missed<00:01:55.490> one<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.729> them<00:01:55.969> fell

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
four shots I missed one of them fell

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.410 
four shots I missed one of them fell
over<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.170> others<00:01:57.439> I<00:01:57.879> managed<00:01:58.879> to<00:01:58.909> get<00:01:59.060> one<00:01:59.270> on

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
over the others I managed to get one on

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.169 
over the others I managed to get one on
the<00:01:59.509> outside<00:01:59.869> of<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.110> target<00:02:00.549> one<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:01.819> little

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
the outside of the target one a little

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.050 
the outside of the target one a little
closer<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.869> inside<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.489> one<00:02:04.489> even<00:02:04.789> closer

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
closer to the inside and one even closer

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.270 
closer to the inside and one even closer
to<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.420> bullseye<00:02:05.709> so<00:02:06.709> for<00:02:06.890> someone<00:02:07.069> who

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
to the bullseye so for someone who

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.940 
to the bullseye so for someone who
really<00:02:07.520> isn't<00:02:07.939> a<00:02:08.239> good<00:02:08.509> sniper<00:02:08.810> like<00:02:09.259> me<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.709> was

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
really isn't a good sniper like me I was

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.259 
really isn't a good sniper like me I was
able<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.160> hit<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> target<00:02:10.670> at<00:02:10.759> three<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.090> four

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
able to hit the target at three to four

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.360 
able to hit the target at three to four
times<00:02:11.450> barely<00:02:12.170> towards<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> middle

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
times barely towards the middle

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.270 
times barely towards the middle
so<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.329> MBO<00:02:14.629> six<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.200> very<00:02:15.769> very<00:02:16.040> accurate

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
so the MBO six is very very accurate

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.610 
so the MBO six is very very accurate
it's<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.700> very<00:02:17.000> high-quality<00:02:17.329> sniper<00:02:18.140> rifle

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it's a very high-quality sniper rifle

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.650 
it's a very high-quality sniper rifle
and<00:02:18.799> I<00:02:19.250> recommend<00:02:19.579> it<00:02:19.790> for<00:02:19.819> any<00:02:20.120> airsoft

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660
