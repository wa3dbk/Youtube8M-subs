heard of it it's more of a remake of the

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.779 
heard of it it's more of a remake of the
ak-74<00:00:47.660> except<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:48.289> has<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.410> 556<00:00:48.949> round<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:49.640> it

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
ak-74 except it has a 556 round so it

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:50.950 
ak-74 except it has a 556 round so it
looks<00:00:50.000> like<00:00:50.059> it's<00:00:50.300> going<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.449> be<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.629> little<00:00:50.839> bit

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
looks like it's going to be a little bit

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.500 
looks like it's going to be a little bit
more<00:00:51.079> accurate<00:00:51.589> we've<00:00:52.309> got<00:00:52.489> 800<00:00:53.239> meters

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510

more accurate we've got 800 meters
effective<00:00:53.989> range<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.920> comes<00:00:55.160> with<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:55.309> 60

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
if they actually cut it down to 30 it

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.350 
if they actually cut it down to 30 it
shoots<00:01:03.890> 600<00:01:04.460> rounds<00:01:04.550> per<00:01:04.730> minute<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.180> it's<00:01:05.300> a

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
shoots 600 rounds per minute so it's a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
556 round it's a it's a weapon a

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.180 
556 round it's a it's a weapon a
combination<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.640> mp7<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.990> ar-15<00:01:57.740> now

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
combination of the mp7 in the ar-15 now

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.460 
combination of the mp7 in the ar-15 now
of<00:01:58.340> course<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.730> ar-15<00:01:59.390> is<00:01:59.420> very<00:02:00.020> similar<00:02:00.350> to

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
of course the ar-15 is very similar to

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.030 
of course the ar-15 is very similar to
the<00:02:00.650> m4<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.540> mp7<00:02:03.110> is<00:02:03.470> very<00:02:03.650> similar<00:02:03.920> to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
the m4 and the mp7 is very similar to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.340 
the m4 and the mp7 is very similar to
the<00:02:04.190> mp5<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:05.270> it's<00:02:05.450> pretty<00:02:05.570> much<00:02:05.720> taken<00:02:06.110> for

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
the mp5 so it's pretty much taken for

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.529 
the mp5 so it's pretty much taken for
weapons<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:06.860> putting<00:02:07.280> them<00:02:07.340> into<00:02:07.490> one<00:02:07.730> making

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
weapons and putting them into one making

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.410 
weapons and putting them into one making
a<00:02:08.690> pretty<00:02:09.319> high<00:02:09.470> powered<00:02:09.860> sub<00:02:10.459> machine<00:02:10.759> gun<00:02:10.970> if

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
a pretty high powered sub machine gun if

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.670 
a pretty high powered sub machine gun if
I<00:02:11.629> was<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.930> guess<00:02:12.080> that's<00:02:12.260> going<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.470> probably

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
I was the guess that's going to probably

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.890 
I was the guess that's going to probably
be<00:02:12.860> like<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.280> Peacekeeper<00:02:13.879> but<00:02:14.360> it's<00:02:14.599> it's

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
be like the Peacekeeper but it's it's

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.960 
be like the Peacekeeper but it's it's
