00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.060
 well today we will see how 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.940
 prepare a sudan catfish 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.470
 and we're going to describe step by step we're going to 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.350
 see in the first instance that you are 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.080
 doing the respective washing of the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.850
 pieces of fish is made with the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 knife to clean impurities and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.770
 clean some of the dirt that it has and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.390
 then we have it washed 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.390
 let's proceed to the next step 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.730
 good after having washed the pieces 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.620
 of fish let's proceed to apply 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.570
 salt so that it impregnates a little more 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.570
 the taste of fish 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.790
 and we're going to let it rest around 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.160
 about 15 to 20 minutes for the salt 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.190
 impregnate 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.270
 and so we're going to do it with all the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.270
 fish parts 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.880
 good after having left the fish 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.270
 with salt during a time of around 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.469
 20 to 25 minutes we have the following 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.360
 ingredients to make the respective 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.070
 stew 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.260
 then in the first instance we have 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.530
 chopped onion and may even be onion 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.150
 long 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.150
 and we are going to add it 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.730
 our container was turned on 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.730
 with a touch of onion 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.490
 let's now add crushed cilantro 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.490
 Y 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.920
 then this to increase our 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.920
 taste in our magnitude 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.689
 and the other ingredient that we have here is 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.069
 the tomato in our case what we do 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.810
 is to do it in other occasions there is 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.239
 people who do not just bite it 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.730
 well that already depends on the tastes in 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.260
 this case we have the grated tomato 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.260
 that we are also going to add 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.870
 and we're going to let our 20 suffer 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.870
 twenty 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.480
 good additional to this we're going to 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.699
 add color 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.699
 [Music] 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.819
 an amount outside 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.180
 we are not going to add because the fish 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.010
 already supposed to be 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.010
 a bird train quite a salt true 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.090
 at 20 minutes and about 20 minutes 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.110
 our floor will cook we are going to proceed 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.110
 to apply the fish 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.200
 ace 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200
 ah 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.250
 to 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.870
 well then we're going to put it on fire 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.970
 slow in principle 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.970
 to add water yes 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.879
 Of something 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.760
 good as we told you before, 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:09.519
 we will add around and fish 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.519
 we already give you the process of salt 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.660
 good for now let's give so that 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.550
 cook not such a high game and already 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.320
 we will see how they are 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.120
 ah 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.190
 good after having let him cook 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.100
 around 40 minutes we have this 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.210
 beauty as we see already 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.210
 I cooked 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.300
 and it can be everything that sometimes adds 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.040
 a little bit of salt because it's short 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.370
 it depends on the tastes of each 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.370
 who 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.919
 good and finally in our fish what 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.200
 we can accompany with some drop tails 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.770
 rice and yucca 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.830
