00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.340
 so friends hello this is a video 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.090
 impromptu I did not prepare it at all 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.369
 write down but I promised that as soon as 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.970
 headphones will fall on the state I 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.800
 opportunities will write down this short review and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:28.670
 so came the original sony headphones 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 so they came here in this box 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:41.489
 here is the box itself the box is very massive 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.920
 very high build quality itself 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.160
 the box 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:53.950
 very high plastic durable 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.290
 drawing all letters 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.390
 instructions and things like that are all very 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:05.550
 very high quality and clear 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:09.660
 made interesting what is copy and original 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:13.240
 gather in china too in thailand but 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:19.780
 the original, unlike the copy, has to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:24.910
 will be seen 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.030
 goes copyright comes first sign 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.790
 Copyright then comes the year and sony 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.890
 corporation 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.770
 This is in the original in the copy is sony 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.610
 corporation or some other 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:44.140
 giving the inscription further goes little letters 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:51.700
 copyright and there is already a test for the code and 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:54.430
 Well, the difference in packaging is of course 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.399
 copy rendering everything goes very 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.670
 poorly I'm all very, very 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:04.390
 great done on packaging this of course 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.140
 ok but we are more interested of course 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.479
 same headphones 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.050
 here they are the original sony very 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.980
 awesome headphones I just did not expect 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:23.680
 that they will sound so mean 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:26.430
 sony mdr xp 700 is original 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.530
 headphones have very soft pads 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.500
 eat i'm sitting don't take off until five to seven until 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:40.920
 eight hours in them and the ears do not get tired 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.780
 completely different, of course, from 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.090
 original copy yes if you will take 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.599
 so be sure to check the original 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.640
 here this part goes 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.920
 necessarily ribbed here this part goes 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.980
 from the quality of such quality 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.049
 quality rubber pads themselves i 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.879
 I write here these they come from very 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.920
 quality skin is very soft and so and 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.250
 she wants to touch and touch 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.920
 she is very soft 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.040
 here is this darling she goes and here from the skin 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.670
 from very soft and inside from skin too 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.939
 inside is very soft skin here I don't know 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.780
 will see here still here here 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.970
 There are screws that attach naturally 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.250
 here it is this whole structure here they are 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.959
 here are the screws in the copy 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.310
 no screws there goes some such 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.340
 molded plastic glued without such 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.480
 collapsible that's of course included very 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.959
 great so gave a gift such 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.659
 money of course here is such a chekhov 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.959
 also from such a pleasant 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.939
 the material inside it is very much 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.099
 fleecy myagenko very large 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.650
 Of course , the headphones themselves are a big case 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.750
 very big here something like this 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.400
 it will look in a carrying case and i 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.599
 I havenâ€™t used headphones yet 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.049
 for home use only 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:12.780
 what else that's still here that part of the original 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.940
 This is the part of aluminum from such 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:22.660
 nice aluminum here and 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:25.940
 copies she is plastic well, the inscription sony 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:30.320
 of course everything is very clearly done without 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:34.520
 all smudges are very very all great 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.530
 you can see that the quality you can see that this 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.460
 is japanese quality made in 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.910
 China ki headphones very dora sound 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.950
 I really like it now I don't even know 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.670
 how will i listen to other headphones 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.650
 most likely nothing and just gonna 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.100
 pull out of ears because after 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.830
 this listen to something cheap something 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.960
 lower quality is impossible and so 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.100
 they cost me will not beat him 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.850
 how much if you want these headphones 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.590
 sure you take care you will not regret 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:16.120
 awesome sound awesome 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.460
 awesome design I really like how 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.009
 they sit on her head she of course 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.240
 It does not look as aesthetically pleasing as the droplets 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.159
 which are inserted into the ears but the sound 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:34.539
 inexpressible bass very very clear 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:35.800
 very smooth sure to warm them i 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.599
 I do not remember the name 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.289
 In general, there are special wheels that 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.150
 I prolong the headphones after warming up 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.800
 such a light 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.169
 felt a very very good rise 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.440
 the top in the middle and the bottoms are all very 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:56.590
 so life to sounded in general take 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:06:00.360
 sony mdr xb 700 this is the quality this 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.069
 everything is great hope you have been helpful 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.930
 short video review impromptu general 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:09.190
 wasn't going to do it because a lot 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:13.469
