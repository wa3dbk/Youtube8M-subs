00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.530

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.149
 I have so many 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.829
 oh yes sorry I am enchanted and in fact 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.990
 I go to Paris from 19 to 26 August that is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:13.409
 from Monday to Monday, however, August and I will do it 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:18.479
 But many video blogs are not that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.909
 so many video blogs together because in a 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 just video that is why I don't know 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:29.820
 cut video do ie I have to understand a 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.090
 bit because I do not know how you cut 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.020
 videos how to make a girl up 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.299
 instagram recommended a program for me 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:48.689
 but I did not feel well and therefore 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.360
 yes and I have to understand a little how to do it 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.549
 I don't think I don't know if you can give mobile 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.170
 though because I have heard from the director 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.890
 mobile phone 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 and I don't know if it can be cut 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.520
 so yes I wanted to show that I have 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:12.680
 got a parity guide but you'll see 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:17.989

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:23.269
 you had all the places the story of 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:27.440

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.110
 he says of disneyland but I wo n't go there 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.610
 because I go to Paris to visit no 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:39.230
 I think it is also for fun but not 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.630
 I go to the amusement park even if I do 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:47.120

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:53.150
