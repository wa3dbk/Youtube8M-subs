00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
back all on the bike which is what we're

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.309 
back all on the bike which is what we're
gonna<00:02:02.200> do<00:02:02.409> anyways<00:02:02.829> and<00:02:03.959> with<00:02:04.959> this<00:02:05.110> all

gonna do anyways and with this all
together<00:02:05.470> we're<00:02:05.770> gonna<00:02:05.860> torque<00:02:06.579> this<00:02:06.789> down

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
together we're gonna torque this down

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
the bike in gear you could torque this

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.110 
the bike in gear you could torque this
down<00:02:11.819> hopefully<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:13.000> little<00:02:13.209> better<00:02:14.040> what

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
down hopefully a little better what

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.789 
down hopefully a little better what
we're<00:02:16.120> gonna<00:02:16.209> see<00:02:16.959> how<00:02:17.049> good<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.290> impact<00:02:17.620> us

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
we're gonna see how good to impact us

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.030 
we're gonna see how good to impact us
anyways<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:19.030> small<00:02:19.269> little<00:02:19.599> tiny

anyways it's just this small little tiny
piece<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.400> pretty<00:02:21.760> much<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.660> way<00:02:22.870> too

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
piece of pretty much it's way too

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.440 
piece of pretty much it's way too
small<00:02:23.319> for<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:24.849> got<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.060> get<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.239> bigger

sockets here right there take this out
under<00:02:54.370> here<00:02:54.519> somewhere

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
under here somewhere

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:08.220 
under here somewhere
we're<00:02:56.800> looking<00:02:57.099> for<00:02:57.340> our<00:02:58.650> 3/8<00:03:07.140> there's<00:03:08.140> a

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
we're looking for our 3/8 there's a

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:17.640 
we're looking for our 3/8 there's a
socket<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.890> I'm<00:03:09.099> sure<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.670> think<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:16.470> know<00:03:17.470> no

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
socket on I'm sure I think I know no

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:32.180 
socket on I'm sure I think I know no
there's<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.599> socket<00:03:19.599> on<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.170> when<00:03:20.560> I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.540 

does<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.280> put<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.520> back<00:03:37.560> well<00:03:38.560> well<00:03:39.340> yeah<00:03:39.460> you

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
does that put it back well well yeah you

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.340 
does that put it back well well yeah you
guys<00:03:39.760> get<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> idea<00:03:40.390> I'm<00:03:40.630> just<00:03:40.780> gonna<00:03:40.870> tort<00:03:41.230> it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
guys get the idea I'm just gonna tort it

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.150 
guys get the idea I'm just gonna tort it
down<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:43.290> factory<00:03:44.290> torque<00:03:44.800> spec<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:47.160> probably

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
down and factory torque spec is probably

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.280 
down and factory torque spec is probably
right<00:03:48.340> around<00:03:48.660> 18<00:03:49.660> or<00:03:49.960> so<00:03:51.510> but<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:53.050> doesn't

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
right around 18 or so but this doesn't

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.750 
right around 18 or so but this doesn't
do<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.530> very<00:03:53.740> good<00:03:53.830> job<00:03:55.260> anyways<00:03:56.580> we're<00:03:57.580> gonna

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
do a very good job anyways we're gonna

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:09.360 
do a very good job anyways we're gonna
try<00:03:58.330> it<00:03:58.390> oh<00:03:58.680> oh<00:04:03.450> we<00:04:04.450> get<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.630> right<00:04:08.190> this<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.310> a

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
try it oh oh we get it right this is a

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.450 
try it oh oh we get it right this is a
28<00:04:09.700> millimeter<00:04:09.940> by<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.630> way<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:12.010> what<00:04:12.100> fits<00:04:12.310> on

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
28 millimeter by the way so what fits on

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.110 
28 millimeter by the way so what fits on
here<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:18.310> know<00:04:18.370> that's<00:04:18.730> gonna<00:04:18.790> get<00:04:19.000> it

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
here and you know that's gonna get it

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.160 
here and you know that's gonna get it
tight<00:04:19.299> enough<00:04:19.330> but<00:04:19.750> we're<00:04:19.840> gonna<00:04:19.930> do<00:04:20.080> this

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
tight enough but we're gonna do this

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.720 
tight enough but we're gonna do this
again<00:04:20.290> well<00:04:20.560> it's<00:04:20.650> on<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.799> bike<00:04:21.010> just<00:04:21.580> tight

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
again well it's on the bike just tight

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.490 
again well it's on the bike just tight
enough<00:04:21.760> for<00:04:22.120> assembly<00:04:22.480> did<00:04:22.750> he<00:04:22.810> say<00:04:22.960> it<00:04:23.470> like

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
enough for assembly did he say it like

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.400 
enough for assembly did he say it like
this<00:04:23.620> -<00:04:23.980> yeah<00:04:24.880> but<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.390> wrench<00:04:25.990> doesn't<00:04:26.320> have

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
this - yeah but that wrench doesn't have

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.610 
this - yeah but that wrench doesn't have
enough<00:04:26.620> torque<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.920> get<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.280> down<00:04:28.500> then<00:04:29.500> F

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
enough torque to get that down then F

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.430 
enough torque to get that down then F
you're<00:04:29.770> done<00:04:29.950> with<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:31.390> can<00:04:31.480> take<00:04:31.720> your

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
you're done with that you can take your

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.110 
you're done with that you can take your
cover<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.310> put<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.430> new<00:04:33.610> gasket<00:04:33.850> on

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
cover on and put the new gasket on

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.930 
cover on and put the new gasket on
everything<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:35.160> we'll<00:04:36.160> do<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.580> second

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
everything and we'll do that in a second

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.670 
everything and we'll do that in a second
part<00:04:37.150> video<00:04:37.390> cuz<00:04:37.660> we<00:04:37.960> got<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.169> get<00:04:38.260> some<00:04:38.410> parts

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
part video cuz we got to get some parts

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.300 
part video cuz we got to get some parts
in<00:04:38.770> order<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.190> yeah<00:04:39.610> that'll<00:04:39.970> be<00:04:40.000> next
