this<00:00:43.950> configuration<00:00:44.360> when<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> loosen<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
this configuration when you loosen this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.740 
this configuration when you loosen this
it<00:00:46.829> goes<00:00:47.100> back<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.579> forth<00:00:47.670> which<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:48.510> what

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it goes back and forth which is not what

miss<00:00:49.020> Mona<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.440> after<00:00:49.800> she<00:00:50.010> wanted<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> know

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
miss Mona was after she wanted to know

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
miss Mona was after she wanted to know
how<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.690> say<00:00:52.110> goes<00:00:52.350> forward<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
how I can do it say goes forward and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.069 
how I can do it say goes forward and
backwards<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.180> solution<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
backwards and the solution to that is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.350 
backwards and the solution to that is
very<00:00:55.170> easy<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.949> when<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.030> carve

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
very easy and when it's going to carve

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.260 
very easy and when it's going to carve
is<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.140> almighty<00:00:58.590> allen<00:00:59.219> wrench<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.730> if<00:01:00.120> I

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
is the almighty allen wrench and if I

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.270 
is the almighty allen wrench and if I
may<00:01:00.449> let<00:01:00.750> me<00:01:00.780> show<00:01:00.960> how<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.440> essentially

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
may let me show how it so essentially

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.759 
may let me show how it so essentially
you<00:01:02.460> take<00:01:02.489> them<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.539> take<00:01:03.719> your<00:01:03.960> hammer<00:01:04.439> off

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
hit the allen wrench there's a screw in

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.000 
hit the allen wrench there's a screw in
the<00:01:09.780> center<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.439> bad<00:01:10.680> boy

the center of this bad boy

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.789 
the center of this bad boy
you<00:01:11.670> unscrew<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.960> will<00:01:13.200> take<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.590> no
