00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
making this video is this these have the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520 
making this video is this these have the
correct<00:02:08.520> size<00:02:08.670> hub<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.300> 12<00:02:09.509> millimeter<00:02:09.720> hub

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
correct size hub the 12 millimeter hub

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.920 
correct size hub the 12 millimeter hub
however<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.370> hole<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.480> center<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
however this hole in the center of the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.720 
however this hole in the center of the
hub<00:02:13.080> for<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> end<00:02:13.710> of<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.890> stub<00:02:14.190> axle<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
hub for the end of the stub axle the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.480 
hub for the end of the stub axle the
pass-through<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.540> not<00:02:16.050> large<00:02:16.350> enough<00:02:16.410> if<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
pass-through is not large enough if you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.940 
pass-through is not large enough if you
look<00:02:17.670> at<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> stock<00:02:18.210> tire<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:19.500> actually

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
look at the stock tire it's actually

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.059 
look at the stock tire it's actually
considerably<00:02:20.580> larger<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.590> real<00:02:22.800> easy

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
considerably larger so the real easy

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.350 
considerably larger so the real easy
solution<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.200> take<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:26.210> 9/32<00:02:27.210> inch

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
solution for this is to take a 9/32 inch

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.320 
solution for this is to take a 9/32 inch
drill<00:02:27.630> bit<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.200> I'm<00:02:28.980> going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> use<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:30.120> hole

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
drill bit and I'm going to use the hole

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.940 
drill bit and I'm going to use the hole
that's<00:02:30.630> already<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:31.050> there<00:02:31.200> from<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> factory

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
that's already in there from the factory

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.410 
that's already in there from the factory
drill<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.940> out<00:02:33.240> real<00:02:33.540> quick<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:35.239> we'll<00:02:36.239> make

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
drill this out real quick and we'll make

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.289 
drill this out real quick and we'll make
it<00:02:36.599> fit<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.230> other<00:02:37.409> thing<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.709> you'll<00:02:38.010> need

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
it fit the other thing that you'll need

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.319 
it fit the other thing that you'll need
if<00:02:39.989> you're<00:02:40.260> going<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.500> need<00:02:40.970> some<00:02:41.970> number

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
if you're going to need some number

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.350 
if you're going to need some number
eight<00:02:42.599> plant<00:02:43.590> washers<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.610> actually<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> think

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
eight plant washers and actually I think

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.170

then I put the wheel nut right here I'm

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.230 
then I put the wheel nut right here I'm
gonna<00:04:34.650> put<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:34.980> inside<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.490> my<00:04:35.639> nut<00:04:35.880> driver
