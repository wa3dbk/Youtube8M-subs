00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello I'm rudy the box office we 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.460
 let's see how today 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.080
 preserve his hand by giving a shot of 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.820
 boxing fist whatever 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 the orientation of the hand the blow we 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.639
 only chooses whether it's live a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.350
 hook hits me 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.330
 it will always be imperative to type 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.470
 with the top of the point 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.119
 and especially with the heads 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.890
 metacarp the parts protected by 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 languages ​​as it is a fight 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.039
 it will always remain well 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 focused on the orientation of his hand 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.609
 relative to the area we want to touch 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 so being a confrontation to 2 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.130
 in a ring 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.690
 we will put the whites and you 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.280
 show the main pitfalls to avoid 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.780
 obviously before putting on the gloves 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.309
 do not forget that my hand is preserved 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.660
 with boxing bandages fractures 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.430
 the most frequent metacarpals are 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.170
 those of the thumb first is from 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.850
 the index the second or the 5th that of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.680
 the pinkie with christ we go 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.640
 see how to fix it 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.110
 always stay focused on 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 the orientation of the hand in relation to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 opponent's movements 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.770
 if I give direct arm before my 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.120
 opponent who skis to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.739
 inside it's my thumb to standards 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 and my index that will come crashing into his 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.730
 skull if he looks outward it's 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.260
 my little finger the little finger that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.640
 could hit caused his skull 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.080
 injuries to the hand of the same 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360
 way you have to control your emotions 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.760
 for example on a rotary stop where 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.990
 the opponent dodge and release the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.700
 arm pressure so that the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.020
 thumb does not tap the back of his skull 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.340
 which already is not allowed but which 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 in addition to risk of creating a fracture in 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.909
 inch so there are areas we just 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.200
 see me as the skull that are very 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.939
 dangerous for the hand we invite 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.460
 really kicking the skull very 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.119
 important as well as the elbows and the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.619
 iliac crest 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.600
 it will be necessary to manage to control 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.979
 emotions released a little bit of 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.409
 speed and power at the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.509
 arm not to break your hand there 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.100
 on the sewing we easily break the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.130
 hand it will rather try to near 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 misalign it to go get behind 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.860
 on the elbow itself on the front 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.930
 arm in itself rather than the tip of the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.670
 shot in the same way on the ridge 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.250
 iliac he forbids under the belt 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.960
 obviously but it can happen in 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.860
 fight one types a little disturbing that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.360
 come affected 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 lalanne may be imminent who is there 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.420
 at the hip the device the 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.490
 hand risks letting go of all these areas 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.440
 there are really to proscribe on the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.790
 directions of the hand we come 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.010
 to see with what part of the hand he 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.410
 had to touch but metacarp and what 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.840
 part of the opponent it was necessary to avoid 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.620
 the skull to proscribe the tip of the elbow 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.180
 and the iliac crest 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.890
 do not forget that despite everything 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.660
 concentration reactivity are 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.700
 things that are imperative in our 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.500
 sport one must adapt to the adversary 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.850
 do not forget that in the long term 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.710
 fractures of the map cause 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.060
 inconvenience or pathology 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.890
 that osteoporosis osteoporosis 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.690
 so you have to be very careful about 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.070
 hands it was redis for box office 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.070
 thank you see you soon
