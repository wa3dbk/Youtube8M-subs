00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.059
 with the a 500 hp its speaker 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.220
 argument about a nfc capable good 40 

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:09.440
 speaker extended as a material 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.510
 came here stable plastic and 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.519
 to carry 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.340
 on the front is a 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.949
 status led area blue lights up and on 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.380
 loading red is located on the top 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.529
 In addition, the nfc connection and on 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.089
 the underside should stand feet and the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.089
 technical data of the device 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.090
 Switching on the device acknowledges it 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.090
 Switch off again with just one tone 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.350
 right next to a switch 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.420
 the micro usb socket with which 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.500
 the 900 billion hours battery 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.000
 directly in stock 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.680
 by the way, this should last for ten hours 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.970
 hold on next to it there is one 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.370
 audio input for the enclosed three 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.860
 Jack to test the cord 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.839
 I have here once the zoom h1 which 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.540
 right here into the team takes on full 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.960
 volume and of course that are 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.630
 speakers also a signal and me 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.630
 start recording now 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.659
 the distortion could be heard came through 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.610
 the microphones recording does not stop 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.100
 down and she was live 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 do not listen when the volume is on 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.270
 device reaches its maximum there is 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.200
 By the way, a signal 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.240
 summarized I can say the rub 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.800
 500 offers a good price 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.640
 performance ratio and is good 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.649
 processed 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.240
 It is plastic but it is 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.640
 stable plastic no cheap 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.830
 plastic 2 x 3 watts are the speakers 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.620
 and the only thing really much 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.350
 is here at delivery 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.890
 plastic cover the indiscriminate but that 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.600
 is everything 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.130
 The battery should last for about ten hours 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.840
 but I have that now, of course 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.239
 not tested in detail I can only 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.880
 say the first charge gives me one 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.590
 done by where I always tag each 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.580
 only a few hours the speaker 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.140
 used 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.019
 the voice quality of the internal 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.610
 Microphones for phone calls up as at 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.920
 many of these speakers are less good 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.440
 it sometimes sounds scratchy and dull 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.390
 or becomes very reverberant 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.680
 if you go away from the microphone 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.170
 You will find an example on the website 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.180
 something annoying is that the blue led 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.930
 flashing down if the whole thing by cable 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.209
 connected 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.489
 something bothers me because it stops the whole 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.410
 time is flashing and I find something annoying 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.450
 also prefer the sound something 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.620
 the indirect so scattered may like that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.180
 By the way, the speaker is simple 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.870
 Press on and then write 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.870
 above 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.500
 is striking compared to the 30 60 that 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.799
 this model, though good heights and middle 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.920
 but has unfortunately that is so dear 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.620
 bass-heavy music likes the 30 60th 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.650
 a little better served but who clear 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.170
 heights and in the middle like that becomes the a500 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.819
 The handy thing is that on 3.5 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.690
 Millimeter also input other devices 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.790
 can connect 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.830
 and so for example the radio from 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.940
 smartphones can use 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.550
 less nice but normal with this 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.900
 Real stereo provide this 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.849
 device-not because simply times the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.590
 Speakers too close to each other are the 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.330
 would have to go on quite a bit 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.800
 be apart from each other for good 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.810
 you have to go stereo exactly like that 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.459
 be far away from the speakers like 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.970
 the speakers of each other so left 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.680
 to the right should be the rub ua 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.630
 500 is now available in stores 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.650
 however, they still exist today 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.170
 not at amazon 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.940
 as soon as it is available i will do that im 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.220
 with sick note 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.140
 definitely smaller 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.570
 bluetooth speaker we to 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.340
 example of what music in the shower and 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.410
 where in the leisure or in the car for the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.060
 You can use navigation under the shower 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.980
 Of course not, he is not 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.330
 water resistant 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.980
 I hope that you liked it 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.110
 if yes then subscribe to the channel 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.170
 only share it and if you ask 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.150
 just post to the product 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.500
 to the next video I wish you still 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.500
 Merry Christmas
