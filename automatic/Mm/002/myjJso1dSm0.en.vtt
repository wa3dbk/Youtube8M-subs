00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Waking up -

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
warming up -

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Waking up -

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
ready.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The robot works,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.100
the machine produces.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It's mechanic, totally different -

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.200
the soul of a machine.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Without our permission -

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
it shall set us free.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.200
Solo: It paints,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It can sing,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
we made it for us

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.100
to replace us.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It replaces us,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
without our permission,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
it shall set us free.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Choir: Cools down, stops.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Solo: Man should not -

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Choir: Cools down, stops.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
- sing like a machine.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The robot works,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the machine produces,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
relentless,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The robot works, relentless,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
it never stops.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Works, produces,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.000
relentless, it continues, it sings.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The robot works, the machine produces,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.200
relentless, it always continues,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.000
the machine sings.
