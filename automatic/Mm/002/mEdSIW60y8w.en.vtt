00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.290
 dismantling brush 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:48.270
 Good, I always left a mouse. 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:51.540

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.470
 not very thick and also the features 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.470

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:29.480
 will ask who to pull up to the end 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:58.470

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:02.430
 beautiful gives a shine more do not stay so 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:07.380
 not funny, only judge 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:11.780
 I used those mounds I always use 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.780
 it leads them to go in most 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.139
 paintings on lines to do 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.139

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:48.860
 It's good, girls. I already have the paint. 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.620
 dried and I gave a demand this enamel 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:56.460
 gives sparkle and practicing it there because it is 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.979
 water-based and if you do not pass this 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.180
 and shifted in another in another. 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.080
 thing the ink comes out spoils 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.940
 the nail 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.940
 So it has to go through and it stays that way.
