00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
toothpaste that's designed for kitty

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.080 
toothpaste that's designed for kitty
cats<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> taste<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> my

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
cats so they like the taste of it and my

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.760 
cats so they like the taste of it and my
feeling<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.199> take<00:01:01.379> your<00:01:01.559> cat

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
feeling is that if you take your cat

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.500 
feeling is that if you take your cat
when<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.070> young<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.270> start

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
when it's young like this and you start

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
when it's young like this and you start
teaching<00:01:03.809> your<00:01:04.140> cat<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> enjoy<00:01:05.580> having

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
teaching your cat how to enjoy having

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.969 
teaching your cat how to enjoy having
the<00:01:06.150> teeth<00:01:06.330> brushed<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.650> very

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the teeth brushed then it's not very

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.580 
the teeth brushed then it's not very
much<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.430> problem<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> done

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
much of a problem for you to get it done

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.609 
much of a problem for you to get it done
and<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> idea<00:01:11.970> again<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.630> training<00:01:12.990> process

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and the idea again is a training process

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.050 
and the idea again is a training process
that<00:01:13.830> might<00:01:13.979> even<00:01:14.130> take<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> whole<00:01:14.729> month

that might even take you a whole month

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
that might even take you a whole month
to<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> try<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.650> make<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> fun<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
