00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:02.480
 Hi I am here 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.490
 Price are on site 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.840
 the game is Lennart 16 but still very good 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.020
 that is 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.210
 here you want to introduce 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.539
 not even ahead 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.029
 you can play the game 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.160
 out 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.460
 4 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.579
 So let's start from the top 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.679
 or if the external view 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.070
 So six years ago, taxes did not come 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.350
 Dauernheim has heroes 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.230
 her husband 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
 Exten can use 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.380
 search 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.480
 I do not care in which team I play games 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.610
 Just spit it to see it go the fastest 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.270
 is played only with the mouse 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.299
 the critics used 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.299
 there are also missions 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 free to play 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.280
 Now he plays a lot 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.620
 what happened 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.909
 Like China, they are all equally good 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.909
 not with the psychologist post 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.229
 we do yes 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.229
 any kind of resources 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.110
 allows me with one 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.110
 one but that a prey animal judge 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.090
 It can not be every corner 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.090
 you draw heroes 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.060
 Through this Olympus also sends wears on the shoe can spend 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.749
 Schubert see megaphone and Senate 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.749
 I can also carry anything exploring 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:33.519
 this usually needs similarities that you have enough collected 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.339
 through any kind of 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:40.599
 battle 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.599
 winning 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.909
 I'll just go now 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.449
 to do some drugs 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.079
 there act and send us just times 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.589
 Given hundreds and thousands of names 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:04.379
 roughly estimated 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.809
 200 pieces 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.209
 with whom I am now I'm going to make campaign 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.039
 Now you are right 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.509
 more 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.509
 some show 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:28.569
 here we are directly 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.659
 the solved dies 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.299
 highest level 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.569
 Chips allowed men weight is everything to build in one fell swoop 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.809
 This is 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:41.800
 rarely 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.249
 Pak procures 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.649
 web 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.649
 Lohner can find investors 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.089
 new optics must go because I can control my hero on the 6th view 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.309
 the tricky pose 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.519
 try the group a lot 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.829
 you can see that 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.769
 who right below 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.999
 bottom left you can see the map datt Columbus is completely covered 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.669
 the officials advise we have the sword 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.669
 for the normal punches it would be nicer 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.959
 in Copenhagen 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.150
 the bow more 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.800
 he conveys complaints 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.219
 Karsai does not consume the least energy 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:32.930
 What is left above, according to Zeil and 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.930
 about the red it lives 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.279
 it is uncertain if the FDP for consequences 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.279
 the rectum represented symbol 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.819
 Shenzhen China first 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.749
 Points 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:53.710
 so that goes 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.710
 after having more time 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.719
 on zoom 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.870
 to build several buildings 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.870
 even my hero of course loses life again and again 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.379
 LaBeouf less 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.379
 Noront experience 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:16.589
 and loses energy 

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.270
 will be decided and Lotus 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.270
 I am using it once in it 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.949
 one used 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.020
 the keycard in the year 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.020
 Undetached, my still give up until they rediscovered 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.129
 you can already see that 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.629
 the opponents have as always 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.110
 up there 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.460
 he wanted 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.460
 Trott calculates is always on 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.059
 I grab 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:47.059
 see the enemy's progress 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:02.659
 This game is wonderful for thinking you just got bored 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.659
 next to a bit rum to Metzel or known times 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.960
 Feel like you have more sen and this game sometimes 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.789
 play nice 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.949
 although you have time forever 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.949
 You can always play this game 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.439
 just fun 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.439
 Roma newspaper 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:30.229
 Just take a look 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.710
 Does not cost too much 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.159
 10 Euro 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.159
 this game a pretty 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.789
 because this game does a lot 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:47.619
 it has fewer expectations 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.900
 Servos around processors 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.409
 graphics Cards 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:56.330
 and all such things 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.150
 It's not all at once 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.150
 computer 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:03.210
 was in the application 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.210
 or so 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.779
 all right 

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:12.509
 bought in May bought 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.509
 are all the stuff you need 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.689
 buy it and just try it big 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.719
 the kids wanted was defeated 

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.050
 and then four open liability 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.050
 won by course 

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.979
 do not give it 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:42.439
 to leave 

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:44.330
 and the summary 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.179
 to see the statisticians 

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:47.630
 the Greens announced themselves 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.630
 playing one pushes cynical high would get 

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.629
 the best 

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:58.629
 I am the blue line 

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:01.089
 relative 

00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:04.089
 after a relatively short time 

00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:06.960
 good with it 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.039
 Sylvia Mende 

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:12.389
 what does it taste and good luck
