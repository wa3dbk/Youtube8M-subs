00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
arms warm and we just haven't gotten

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.830 
arms warm and we just haven't gotten
around<00:05:31.250> to<00:05:31.430> hooking<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.850> up<00:05:31.940> on<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:32.570> the

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
around to hooking it up on this and the

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.360 
around to hooking it up on this and the
grips<00:05:33.110> are<00:05:33.290> just<00:05:33.500> keeping<00:05:34.070> us<00:05:34.190> going

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
grips are just keeping us going

comfortably

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.610 
comfortably
so<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.550> is

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
so it is

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.800 
so it is
actually<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.430> trade<00:05:39.699> off<00:05:39.850> with<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.180> grips<00:05:40.419> you

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
actually to trade off with the grips you

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.550 
actually to trade off with the grips you
don't<00:05:41.050> need

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
don't need

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.950 
don't need
extra<00:05:42.250> warmth<00:05:42.580> nearly<00:05:43.090> as<00:05:43.270> soon<00:05:43.510> as<00:05:43.630> you<00:05:43.780> do

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
extra warmth nearly as soon as you do

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.150 
extra warmth nearly as soon as you do
without<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.530> group's<00:05:46.740> now<00:05:47.740> I'm<00:05:47.860> wearing

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
to you

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.280 
to you
approximate<00:05:58.370> temperatures<00:05:58.960> that's<00:05:59.960> them

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
approximate temperatures that's them

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.860 
approximate temperatures that's them
making<00:06:00.650> snow<00:06:00.980> over<00:06:01.220> there

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
making snow over there

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.350 
making snow over there
and<00:06:03.260> right<00:06:03.440> now<00:06:03.560> my<00:06:03.590> hands<00:06:04.040> are<00:06:04.130> burning<00:06:04.340> up<00:06:04.580> no
