00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.480 
you to say it's hard for you to choose I
don't<00:01:36.869> think<00:01:37.259> that's<00:01:37.500> true<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:37.979> you're

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
don't think that's true I think you're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.380 
don't think that's true I think you're
just<00:01:38.840> trying<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.259> both<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.400> play<00:01:42.150> both

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
just trying to have both and play both

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
just trying to have both and play both
instead<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.500> making<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.829> decision<00:01:43.950> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
instead of just making a decision in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.179 
instead of just making a decision in
choosing<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.479> would<00:01:46.350> say<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.799> sit

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
choosing one so I would say just sit

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
choosing one so I would say just sit
down<00:01:47.270> have<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> look<00:01:48.479> over<00:01:48.750> them

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
down have a look over them

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.840 
down have a look over them
really<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:49.979> about<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.340> you're<00:01:50.490> looking

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
really think about what you're looking

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.330 
really think about what you're looking
for<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.869> make<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.140> decision<00:01:52.200> based<00:01:53.130> on

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
for and then make your decision based on

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
for and then make your decision based on
what<00:01:53.579> you're<00:01:53.759> interested<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.720> will

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
what you're interested in and what will

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.299 
what you're interested in and what will
last<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:55.829> what<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.759> last<00:01:56.909> today
