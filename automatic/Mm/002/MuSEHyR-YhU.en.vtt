 camera focused and I realize that to me 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.270
 the camera somehow is behaving here 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.970
 It stinks a bit but it works 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.250

 what they are good and I could my 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.350
 runs because my mobile phone has 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.950
 but I sent something else 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:35.630
 that somehow understand what with 150 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:39.680
 units dearest are quite complicated 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.910

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.170

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.330
 let it down that it is not 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.959
 broke the deputy Horst 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.730

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.510

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.180
 we're going somewhere now 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.180
 no idea 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.819
 do not record that 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:33.580
 okay we are on the way again 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:38.070
 because I have as a lena has my camera 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.070
 do you have the same simply trying to 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.090
 the mind is still not 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.280
 eat 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.780
 I still bitch on an iron 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.780
 lena proved to be correct 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:12.310
 yes I have no idea I have in any case 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.530
 and we will probably equal time 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.479
 to find the iceman or as a woman or 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:22.780
 ice-dare not with you if something 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.430
 have found where my friends are 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.849
 right now, says lena 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.990
 we can probably because then 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.020
 it is dead 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.810
 So I think it's way too warm and yes 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:42.940
 my camera is focused was here 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.470
 That's the way it is now 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.560
 look at lenas hessian shadow 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:52.070
 look long before 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.700
 we have to do faster 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:06:00.230
 hunger hunger hunger have in mind 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.720
 thirst for their home so thirsty people 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.510
 We found ourselves in ice cream cart after 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.610
 10,000 have walked around like that 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.289
 Finally we have the last idiot 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.689
 ice car discovered 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:15.629

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:18.539
 now get the nice ice cream cart 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:22.680
 here and now we will somehow 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:26.610
 somehow try to come back 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.159
 yes that was my video and I hope you 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.050
 liked the video because it was 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:34.110
 something different than the others 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.999

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.080
