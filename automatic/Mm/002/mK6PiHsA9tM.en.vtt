between the motor and the housing on

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
between the motor and the housing on
these<00:00:25.769> units<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.580> motor<00:00:26.849> has<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.269> enclosed

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
these units this motor has an enclosed

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.419 
these units this motor has an enclosed
housing<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.320> bearing<00:00:28.619> system<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.250> and

housing and bearing system on it and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.189 
housing and bearing system on it and
what<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.970> does<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> keeps<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> dust<00:00:30.990> out

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
what that does is it keeps the dust out

what that does is it keeps the dust out
and<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> dust<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.219> causes<00:00:32.460> motors<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
and the dust is what causes motors to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
and the dust is what causes motors to
fail<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.989> make<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.320> louder<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.920> other<00:00:35.070> type

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
fail and make them louder the other type

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
fail and make them louder the other type
of<00:00:35.399> motor<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.690> called<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> C

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
of motor you can get is called the C

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
transformer exposed and the bearing

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.119 
transformer exposed and the bearing
exposed<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.079> desk<00:00:43.440> taun<00:00:43.680> them<00:00:43.860> so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340 
exposed they get more desk taun them so
they<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.399> noisier<00:00:44.940> faster<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:45.989> fail

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
they get noisier faster and they fail

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.160 
they get noisier faster and they fail
faster<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.789> enclosed<00:00:48.300> housing<00:00:48.960> you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
faster with this enclosed housing you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
faster with this enclosed housing you
should<00:00:49.379> only<00:00:49.620> hear<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.039> sound<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> air<00:00:50.670> when

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
should only hear the sound of air when

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
should only hear the sound of air when
it<00:00:50.969> runs<00:00:51.149> when<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.629> replace<00:00:51.989> motors<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.620> pello

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
it runs when I replace motors and pello
