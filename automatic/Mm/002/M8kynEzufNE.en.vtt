00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
you really don't get an accurate toss

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
you really don't get an accurate toss
and<00:00:35.010> remember<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.880> surface<00:00:36.210> motion<00:00:36.630> what

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and remember on the surface motion what

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
and remember on the surface motion what
we're<00:00:36.960> looking<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> couple<00:00:37.800> things<00:00:38.129> number

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
we're looking for a couple things number

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970 
we're looking for a couple things number
one<00:00:38.700> obviously<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.870> looking<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.350> accuracy

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
one obviously we're looking for accuracy

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
one obviously we're looking for accuracy
and<00:00:41.250> consistency<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:43.050> your

and consistency with with your with your

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.619 
and consistency with with your with your
toss<00:00:43.379> placement<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.030> importantly

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
toss placement but just as importantly

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.180

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
what we're trying to get to is that

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
what we're trying to get to is that
you're<00:00:47.340> tossing<00:00:47.640> motion<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.840> really

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you're tossing motion you know really

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
you're tossing motion you know really
set<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> proper<00:00:50.789> hitting

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
of really getting up into a good firm

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.429 
of really getting up into a good firm
strong<00:01:02.250> hitting<00:01:02.789> position<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> want

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
strong hitting position so what I want

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
strong hitting position so what I want
you<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:04.769> about<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.820> Tom<00:01:06.210> Stowe

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
you to think about is this and Tom Stowe

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
you to think about is this and Tom Stowe
taught<00:01:06.810> me<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.409> terms<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> how<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> hold

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
taught me this in terms of how to hold

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
taught me this in terms of how to hold
the<00:01:08.700> tennis<00:01:09.000> ball<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:10.020> he<00:01:10.229> wanted<00:01:10.590> me<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.770> do

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the tennis ball what he wanted me to do

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
the tennis ball what he wanted me to do
is<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.250> hold<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.299> position<00:01:12.869> right

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
is to hold it in this position right

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
is to hold it in this position right
here<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:13.530> I've<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> between<00:01:14.220> my<00:01:14.490> thumb

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
here where I've got it between my thumb

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
here where I've got it between my thumb
and<00:01:14.880> my<00:01:15.630> index<00:01:15.659> finger<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.250> third<00:01:17.460> finger

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and my index finger and the third finger

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820 
and my index finger and the third finger
is<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:19.020> kind<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.320> letting<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> ball

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
is really just kind of letting the ball

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.490 
is really just kind of letting the ball
lay<00:01:20.070> lay<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.729> top<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.990> reason<00:01:22.170> he

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
lay lay on top of it and the reason he

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.109 
lay lay on top of it and the reason he
had<00:01:22.830> me<00:01:23.040> hold<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.610> way<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> reason

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
had me hold it this way and the reason

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.780 
had me hold it this way and the reason
he<00:01:24.540> taught<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.049> way<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.470> opposed<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> like

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
he taught it this way as opposed to like

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.469 
he taught it this way as opposed to like
this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.650> only<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.520> risk

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this is because not only do you risk

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.240 
this is because not only do you risk
sort<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> risk<00:01:31.229> getting<00:01:31.590> involved<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
sort of the risk getting involved the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.789 
sort of the risk getting involved the
elbow<00:01:32.670> getting<00:01:33.060> involved<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.439> if

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
elbow getting involved and you know if

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.280 
elbow getting involved and you know if
you<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.340> even<00:01:35.579> even<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.420> toss<00:01:36.630> perfectly

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you can even even if you toss perfectly

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
you can even even if you toss perfectly
with<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> wrist<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> elbow<00:01:38.430> breaking

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
with the wrist and the elbow breaking

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
with the wrist and the elbow breaking
this<00:01:39.270> way<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.990> never<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.799> get<00:01:41.009> into<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this way you never really get into a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.819 
this way you never really get into a
good<00:01:41.610> hitting<00:01:41.909> position<00:01:42.180> number<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.990> but

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
good hitting position number one but

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.200

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
set up like this and I was always a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.320 
set up like this and I was always a
little<00:02:16.170> bit<00:02:16.709> too<00:02:17.010> open<00:02:17.459> too<00:02:17.610> early<00:02:18.030> with<00:02:18.180> my

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
the feeling of coming up this way

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.890 
the feeling of coming up this way
meaning<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:24.000> know<00:02:24.090> your<00:02:24.269> hand<00:02:24.569> when<00:02:24.780> you

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
aren't like this they are simply like

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.369 
aren't like this they are simply like
this<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.450> more<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.810> natural<00:02:31.049> position

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
this this is more of a natural position

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.399 
this this is more of a natural position
and<00:02:31.860> when<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.610> toss<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.360> more<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.110> natural

and when you toss in more of a natural

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.039 
and when you toss in more of a natural
position<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.519> helps<00:02:36.000> keep<00:02:36.269> your<00:02:36.540> shoulders

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049
