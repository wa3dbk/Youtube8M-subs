through three simple digital

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.049 
through three simple digital
enhancements<00:00:12.710> you<00:00:12.800> can<00:00:12.950> make<00:00:13.160> to<00:00:13.880> make<00:00:14.030> a

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
enhancements you can make to make a

enhancements you can make to make a
photograph<00:00:14.599> look<00:00:14.809> great<00:00:15.139> now<00:00:16.099> I'm<00:00:16.219> using

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
photograph look great now I'm using

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.150 
photograph look great now I'm using
Lightroom<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:17.210> as<00:00:17.450> a<00:00:17.480> demonstration<00:00:17.960> tool<00:00:18.560> but

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
Lightroom to as a demonstration tool but

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.429 
Lightroom to as a demonstration tool but
all<00:00:19.369> these<00:00:19.550> concepts<00:00:20.180> are<00:00:20.390> applicable<00:00:20.810> to

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
all these concepts are applicable to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.320 
all these concepts are applicable to
many<00:00:21.650> different<00:00:22.160> advanced<00:00:23.090> photography

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
many different advanced photography

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.970 
many different advanced photography
software<00:00:25.689> so<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.170> first<00:00:27.380> thing<00:00:27.529> we'll<00:00:27.769> do<00:00:27.949> is

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
software so the first thing we'll do is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.890 
software so the first thing we'll do is
take<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.310> look<00:00:28.550> at<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.699> histogram<00:00:29.029> up<00:00:29.420> here<00:00:29.779> on

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
take a look at the histogram up here on

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.320 
take a look at the histogram up here on
the<00:00:29.990> top<00:00:30.019> right<00:00:30.470> now<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:31.490> want<00:00:31.789> your<00:00:32.000> dark

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
the top right now you want your dark

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.049 
the top right now you want your dark
areas<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.160> which<00:00:34.160> is<00:00:34.309> on<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.550> left<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:34.970> the

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
areas and which is on the left of the

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.450 
areas and which is on the left of the
graph<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:36.199> light<00:00:36.379> area<00:00:36.710> is<00:00:36.799> to<00:00:36.979> be<00:00:37.070> really

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
graph and the light area is to be really

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.270 
graph and the light area is to be really
spread<00:00:37.970> out<00:00:38.000> across<00:00:38.330> the<00:00:38.570> graph<00:00:38.949> to<00:00:39.949> do<00:00:40.100> this

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
spread out across the graph to do this

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.759 
spread out across the graph to do this
we'll<00:00:41.030> use<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.239> black<00:00:41.690> slightly<00:00:42.409> were<00:00:42.559> down

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
we'll use the black slightly were down

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.610 
we'll use the black slightly were down
here<00:00:42.799> to<00:00:43.790> move<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.150> graph<00:00:44.360> to<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.690> left<00:00:44.780> just

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
here to move the graph to the left just

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.640 
here to move the graph to the left just
a<00:00:45.739> bit<00:00:45.949> so<00:00:46.760> if<00:00:47.150> I<00:00:47.239> just<00:00:47.269> slide<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:47.900> across<00:00:48.049> you

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
a bit so if I just slide it across you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.560 
a bit so if I just slide it across you
can<00:00:48.799> see<00:00:48.979> i<00:00:49.010> push<00:00:49.369> the<00:00:49.549> histogram<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.330> left

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
can see i push the histogram to the left

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.869 
can see i push the histogram to the left
getting<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.470> dark<00:00:51.739> area<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.280> spread<00:00:52.640> about

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
getting the dark area to spread about

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.189 
getting the dark area to spread about
even<00:00:53.510> more<00:00:53.890> across<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.100> histogram<00:00:56.019> then<00:00:57.019> to

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
even more across the histogram then to

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.680 
even more across the histogram then to
balance<00:00:57.589> it<00:00:57.739> i'll<00:00:57.949> use<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.400> exposure<00:00:58.879> slide<00:00:59.269> 2

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
balance it i'll use the exposure slide 2

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.960 
balance it i'll use the exposure slide 2
now<00:00:59.720> push<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.440> right<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.640> get<00:01:01.820> my

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
now push it to the right and get my

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.450 
now push it to the right and get my
lights<00:01:02.299> to<00:01:02.809> spread<00:01:03.110> out<00:01:03.260> across<00:01:03.439> a<00:01:03.860> bit<00:01:04.280> more

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
lights to spread out across a bit more

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.760 
lights to spread out across a bit more
evenly<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.420> histogram<00:01:05.689> as<00:01:06.020> well<00:01:08.770> next

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
evenly in the histogram as well next

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.770 
evenly in the histogram as well next
I'll<00:01:09.950> move<00:01:10.160> down<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.490> tone<00:01:10.790> curve<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.630> give

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
I'll move down to the tone curve to give

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.260 
I'll move down to the tone curve to give
our<00:01:11.900> photograph<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.470> lot<00:01:12.770> more<00:01:12.980> pop<00:01:13.250> I'll<00:01:13.970> pull

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
our photograph a lot more pop I'll pull

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.840 
our photograph a lot more pop I'll pull
up<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.480> lights<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.930> make<00:01:15.050> them<00:01:15.230> lighter<00:01:15.470> and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
up the lights to make them lighter and

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.570 
up the lights to make them lighter and
pull<00:01:16.850> down<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.180> darks<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.720> make<00:01:17.870> them<00:01:18.050> darker

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
pull down the darks to make them darker

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.610 
pull down the darks to make them darker
now<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.640> resulting<00:01:20.240> s<00:01:20.420> curve<00:01:20.690> is<00:01:20.840> very<00:01:21.230> useful

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
now the resulting s curve is very useful

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.160 
now the resulting s curve is very useful
in<00:01:21.680> photography<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.490> can<00:01:23.390> really<00:01:23.750> give<00:01:23.930> any

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
in photography and can really give any

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.330 
in photography and can really give any
photograph<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.860> lot<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.220> pop<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.830> tone<00:01:28.070> curve

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
photograph a lot of pop the tone curve

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.980 
photograph a lot of pop the tone curve
also<00:01:28.520> gives<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.060> lot<00:01:29.240> more<00:01:29.300> control<00:01:29.840> over

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
also gives you a lot more control over

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.580 
also gives you a lot more control over
contrast<00:01:30.770> then<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.490> slightest<00:01:31.970> do

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.520 

so<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.789> see<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.240> sky<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.719> a<00:01:36.899> bit<00:01:37.229> too

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
so now you can see my sky is a bit too

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.709 
so now you can see my sky is a bit too
bright<00:01:38.119> especially<00:01:39.119> compared<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> my

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
bright especially compared to my

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.169 
bright especially compared to my
foreground<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:41.369> resolve<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.850> by<00:01:42.030> using

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
foreground I can resolve this by using

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.039 
foreground I can resolve this by using
the<00:01:42.420> graded<00:01:43.039> filter<00:01:44.039> tool<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.609> just<00:01:45.569> click<00:01:45.840> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the graded filter tool I just click that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.520 
the graded filter tool I just click that
and<00:01:46.409> pull<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.859> down<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.990> filter<00:01:49.380> now

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and pull it down and the filter now

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.160 
and pull it down and the filter now
covers<00:01:49.950> half<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.610> photograph<00:01:51.149> right<00:01:51.899> at<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
covers half my photograph right at the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.370 
covers half my photograph right at the
horizon<00:01:52.319> level<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:54.509> filter<00:01:54.750> will<00:01:54.990> allow<00:01:55.200> me

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
horizon level the filter will allow me

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.999 
horizon level the filter will allow me
to<00:01:55.590> selectively<00:01:56.310> choose<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.420> sky<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.049> darken

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
to selectively choose the sky and darken

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.319 
to selectively choose the sky and darken
the<00:01:59.100> sky<00:01:59.369> leaving<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.119> foreground<00:02:00.569> untouched

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
the sky leaving the foreground untouched

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.330 
the sky leaving the foreground untouched
so<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.840> make<00:02:04.049> sure<00:02:04.079> i<00:02:04.259> click<00:02:04.679> on<00:02:04.709> exposure

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
so just make sure i click on exposure

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.020 
so just make sure i click on exposure
and<00:02:05.989> if<00:02:06.989> i<00:02:07.079> move<00:02:07.229> my<00:02:07.289> slide<00:02:07.799> now<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.459> left<00:02:08.700> i

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and if i move my slide now to the left i

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.809 
and if i move my slide now to the left i
will<00:02:09.209> darken<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.989> sky<00:02:10.430> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.579> see<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
will darken the sky you can see the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.170 
will darken the sky you can see the
foreground<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:12.480> pretty<00:02:12.840> much<00:02:12.959> unaffected

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
foreground is pretty much unaffected

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.300 
foreground is pretty much unaffected
that's<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.360> power<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.870> graded<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
that's the power of the graded to the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.170 
that's the power of the graded to the
graded<00:02:17.640> filter<00:02:18.030> tool<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.940> about

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
graded filter tool and that's just about

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.040 
graded filter tool and that's just about
right<00:02:21.239> for<00:02:21.480> me

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.500 

and<00:02:24.140> since<00:02:25.070> every<00:02:25.520> feature<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:26.240> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
and since every feature of the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.440 
and since every feature of the
photograph<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.230> connected<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.040> each<00:02:28.160> other

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
photograph is connected to each other

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.090 
photograph is connected to each other
changing<00:02:29.450> one<00:02:29.630> aspect<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.260> photo<00:02:30.620> will

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
changing one aspect of a photo will

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.820 
changing one aspect of a photo will
affect<00:02:31.430> another<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.810> I'm<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:33.440> going<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.650> play

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
affect another so I'm just going to play

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.650 
affect another so I'm just going to play
with<00:02:33.950> my<00:02:34.100> curves<00:02:34.460> a<00:02:34.640> bit<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:34.970> brighten<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
with my curves a bit to brighten the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.530 
with my curves a bit to brighten the
full<00:02:35.870> overall<00:02:36.380> photograph<00:02:36.970> since<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.150> filter

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
full overall photograph since the filter

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.540 
full overall photograph since the filter
darken<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.140> sky<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.830> also<00:02:40.010> dark<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.490> the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
darken the sky it also dark in the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.450 
darken the sky it also dark in the
picture<00:02:40.910> just<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.390> little<00:02:41.660> bit<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:43.340> I've<00:02:43.430> just

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
picture just a little bit so I've just

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.510 
picture just a little bit so I've just
added<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:44.150> bit<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.300> fill<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.010> boosted<00:02:46.010> my<00:02:46.190> curve

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
added a bit of fill and boosted my curve

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.870 
added a bit of fill and boosted my curve
so<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:47.360> it's<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.780> bit<00:02:47.960> brighter<00:02:48.340> overall

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.900 

finally<00:02:52.880> when<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.300> add<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.510> bit<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.720> fig<00:02:54.290> nut<00:02:54.910> to

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
finally when I add a bit of fig nut to

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.300 
finally when I add a bit of fig nut to
the<00:02:55.940> edges<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.630> give<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.990> bit<00:02:57.260> more<00:02:57.290> drama<00:02:57.860> so

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
the edges to give it a bit more drama so

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.390 
the edges to give it a bit more drama so
those<00:02:58.490> ominous<00:02:58.970> clouds<00:02:59.330> are<00:02:59.660> really<00:03:00.400> really

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
those ominous clouds are really really

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.160 
those ominous clouds are really really
adds<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.000> bit<00:03:02.150> more<00:03:02.180> drama<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.900> overall

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
adds a bit more drama to the overall

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.410 
adds a bit more drama to the overall
photograph<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:06.470> finally<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:08.180> going<00:03:08.330> to

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
photograph and finally just going to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.230 
photograph and finally just going to
straighten<00:03:09.200> out<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.470> picture<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> bit<00:03:10.240> the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
horizon is all level and that looks

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.360 
horizon is all level and that looks
great<00:03:15.290> right<00:03:15.590> now<00:03:16.960> so<00:03:17.960> there<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.170> go<00:03:18.370> let's

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
great right now so there you go let's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
great right now so there you go let's
compare<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.770> our<00:03:21.770> original<00:03:22.430> photo<00:03:23.060> and

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
compare that to our original photo and

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.840 
compare that to our original photo and
see<00:03:23.570> how<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.810> compares<00:03:24.340> yeah<00:03:25.340> there<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.730> can

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
see how it compares yeah there you can

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.270 
see how it compares yeah there you can
see<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.210> is<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.450> lot<00:03:26.870> more<00:03:26.900> contrast<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.830> lot<00:03:28.070> more

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
see it is a lot more contrast a lot more

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.479 
see it is a lot more contrast a lot more
pop<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.880> lot<00:03:29.630> more<00:03:29.810> drama<00:03:30.080> in<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.650> new<00:03:30.890> enhanced

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
pop a lot more drama in the new enhanced

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.220 
pop a lot more drama in the new enhanced
photograph

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.440 

so<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.290> summarize<00:03:36.849> use<00:03:37.849> your<00:03:37.999> exposure

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
so to summarize use your exposure

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.110 
so to summarize use your exposure
controls<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.560> evenly<00:03:40.310> spread<00:03:40.790> out<00:03:40.909> that

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
controls to evenly spread out that

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.789 
controls to evenly spread out that
histogram<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.689> get<00:03:42.109> it<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.319> touch<00:03:42.530> those

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
histogram and get it to touch those

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.649 
histogram and get it to touch those
edges<00:03:43.249> and<00:03:44.109> then<00:03:45.109> try<00:03:45.980> using<00:03:46.219> an<00:03:46.430> s-curve<00:03:46.969> to

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
edges and then try using an s-curve to

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.869 
edges and then try using an s-curve to
really<00:03:47.959> make<00:03:48.319> that<00:03:48.499> photograph<00:03:48.980> pop<00:03:49.340> making

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
really make that photograph pop making

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.410 
really make that photograph pop making
those<00:03:49.969> lights<00:03:50.329> lighter<00:03:50.749> and<00:03:51.019> darks<00:03:51.530> darker

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
those lights lighter and darks darker

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.000 
those lights lighter and darks darker
always<00:03:53.420> evaluate<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.049> overall<00:03:54.439> photograph

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
always evaluate the overall photograph

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.689 
always evaluate the overall photograph
after<00:03:55.609> each<00:03:55.849> change<00:03:56.299> you<00:03:56.480> make
