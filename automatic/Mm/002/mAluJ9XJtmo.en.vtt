I thought it kind of like you just do

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.129 
I thought it kind of like you just do
done<00:04:20.739> lots<00:04:20.950> of<00:04:21.010> aerobatic<00:04:21.430> 50<00:04:21.669> bubbles<00:04:22.020> get<00:04:23.020> on

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
done lots of aerobatic 50 bubbles get on

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.529 
done lots of aerobatic 50 bubbles get on
verted<00:04:23.470> wings<00:04:23.680> are<00:04:23.860> level<00:04:24.160> yeah<00:04:24.550> so<00:04:25.000> power<00:04:25.330> off

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
verted wings are level yeah so power off

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.450 
verted wings are level yeah so power off
just<00:04:25.750> as<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:25.930> get<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.289> top<00:04:26.500> yeah<00:04:26.889> just<00:04:27.310> let

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
just as I get to the top yeah just let

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.370 
just as I get to the top yeah just let
it<00:04:27.610> drop<00:04:27.789> down<00:04:27.849> naturally<00:04:28.510> I'm<00:04:28.810> upside<00:04:29.349> down

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
it drop down naturally I'm upside down

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.680 
it drop down naturally I'm upside down
on<00:04:29.650> all<00:04:29.860> well<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.430> wasn't<00:04:30.610> vetted<00:04:30.880> yeah<00:04:31.389> you're

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
on all well it wasn't vetted yeah you're

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.450 
on all well it wasn't vetted yeah you're
coming<00:04:31.840> down<00:04:32.169> yeah<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.800> then<00:04:33.039> I<00:04:33.070> normally

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
coming down yeah and then I normally

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.770 
coming down yeah and then I normally
just<00:04:33.610> give<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.270> little<00:04:34.510> bit<00:04:34.660> of

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
just give it just a little bit of

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.899 
just give it just a little bit of
elevator<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.979> response<00:04:36.430> that<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.700> can

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
elevator just the response that I can

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.930 
elevator just the response that I can
basically<00:04:37.919> guesstimate<00:04:38.919> what<00:04:39.099> size<00:04:39.340> loop<00:04:39.820> I

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
basically guesstimate what size loop I

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.640 
basically guesstimate what size loop I
want<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.210> today<00:04:40.360> I<00:04:40.659> don't<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.229> doing<00:04:41.349> small

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
want it today I don't like doing small

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.120 
want it today I don't like doing small
loops

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
loops

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.310 
loops
and<00:04:42.820> just<00:04:43.000> did<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.180> bit<00:04:43.390> and<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.930> just<00:04:44.080> didn't

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
and just did a bit and it just didn't

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.690 
and just did a bit and it just didn't
send<00:04:44.470> it's<00:04:44.590> not<00:04:45.310> know<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.490> vertical

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
send it's not know that vertical

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.180 
send it's not know that vertical
attitude<00:04:46.600> gave<00:04:47.320> it<00:04:47.500> a<00:04:47.530> bit<00:04:47.680> more<00:04:47.800> just<00:04:48.010> didn't

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
attitude gave it a bit more just didn't

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.620 
attitude gave it a bit more just didn't
want<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.370> pull<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.850> I<00:04:49.120> just<00:04:49.270> keep<00:04:49.360> giving

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
want to pull it and I just keep giving

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.410 
want to pull it and I just keep giving
it<00:04:49.690> more<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:49.930> more<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.760> at<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.600> spawn<00:04:52.870> I

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
it more and more and it at the spawn I

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.670 
it more and more and it at the spawn I
was<00:04:55.420> probably<00:04:55.600> about<00:04:55.750> three<00:04:56.080> four<00:04:56.320> meters<00:04:56.590> off

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
was probably about three four meters off

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.200 
was probably about three four meters off
the<00:04:56.710> ground<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.100> was<00:04:57.250> hard<00:04:57.460> bet<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.060> hope

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
the ground that was hard bet and I hope

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.560 
the ground that was hard bet and I hope
I<00:04:58.390> can't<00:04:58.600> do<00:04:58.690> anything

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
I can't do anything

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.480 
I can't do anything
yes<00:05:01.570> babe<00:05:01.840> airspeed<00:05:02.470> is<00:05:02.590> way<00:05:02.830> above<00:05:02.980> thought

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
yes babe airspeed is way above thought

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.200 
yes babe airspeed is way above thought
that<00:05:03.730> one<00:05:03.850> is<00:05:04.060> stalled<00:05:04.450> situation<00:05:05.970> so<00:05:06.970> this<00:05:07.030> is

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
that one is stalled situation so this is

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.880 
that one is stalled situation so this is
the<00:05:07.330> Smith<00:05:07.600> now<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:07.810> normally<00:05:08.440> it<00:05:08.560> would<00:05:08.710> just

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
the Smith now so normally it would just

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.740 
the Smith now so normally it would just
probably<00:05:09.130> pull<00:05:09.520> out<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:09.970> mr.wai<00:05:10.860> blue<00:05:11.860> gun

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
probably pull out that mr.wai blue gun

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.920 
probably pull out that mr.wai blue gun
