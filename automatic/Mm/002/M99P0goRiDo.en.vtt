keep the solvent on there and chemical

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.050 
keep the solvent on there and chemical
solve<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.710> go<00:03:21.710> slowly<00:03:22.010> come<00:03:22.250> off<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.730> don't

know<00:03:23.240> with<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.570> spoon<00:03:23.870> or<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.110> solvent<00:03:24.410> but

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
know with the spoon or the solvent but

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.030 
know with the spoon or the solvent but
it<00:03:25.460> seems<00:03:25.730> like<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.910> little<00:03:26.090> bit<00:03:26.240> of<00:03:26.360> both<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:27.290> a

it seems like a little bit of both and a
paint<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.460> still<00:03:28.640> protected<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:31.130> worked

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
paint is still protected so it worked

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.650
