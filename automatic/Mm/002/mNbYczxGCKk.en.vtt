00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
bought it about a year ago and said the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.620 
bought it about a year ago and said the
first<00:00:31.529> 50<00:00:32.009> pages<00:00:32.219> were<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> best<00:00:32.969> first<00:00:33.300> 50

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
first 50 pages were the best first 50

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869

not<00:02:00.869> supernatural<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:02.100> kind<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
not supernatural it's kind of like the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.459 
not supernatural it's kind of like the
Gallagher<00:02:03.090> girls<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.570> slightly<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:04.140> mature

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
Gallagher girls but slightly more mature

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.649 
Gallagher girls but slightly more mature
I<00:02:04.799> loved<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.219> mixture<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.729> femininity<00:02:06.149> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
I loved the mixture of femininity and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.270 
I loved the mixture of femininity and
then<00:02:06.810> being<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.170> warrior<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.039> thought<00:02:08.129> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
then being a warrior I just thought it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.249 
then being a warrior I just thought it
was<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.550> cool<00:02:08.789> I'm<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.360> excited<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:10.020> this

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
was so cool I'm really excited for this

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
was so cool I'm really excited for this
because<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.709> think<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> first<00:02:11.220> book<00:02:11.520> kind<00:02:12.030> of

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
because I think the first book kind of

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.100 
because I think the first book kind of
just<00:02:12.420> set<00:02:12.629> up<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
just set up the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.650 
just set up the
supernatural<00:02:13.740> element<00:02:14.250> next<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.970> an<00:02:15.150> ember<00:02:15.480> in

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
supernatural element next is an ember in

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.650 
supernatural element next is an ember in

the ashes by Sebata here so excited to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.910 
the ashes by Sebata here so excited to
read<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:18.900> because<00:02:19.260> again<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.800> another

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
read this because again it's another

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.100 
read this because again it's another
fantasy<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.060> although<00:02:21.300> some<00:02:21.600> are<00:02:21.630> supposed

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
fantasy and although some are supposed

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.630 
fantasy and although some are supposed
to<00:02:22.230> be<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> time<00:02:22.710> when<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.040> want<00:02:23.190> light<00:02:23.430> and

that<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.320> be<00:02:28.410> something<00:02:28.680> like

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
that it's going to be something like

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.860 
that it's going to be something like
Daughter<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.370> Smoke<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.910> bone<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> shadow
