00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.460 
are and personally I don't believe this
at<00:02:13.340> all<00:02:13.720> how<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.750> open<00:02:15.260> these<00:02:15.410> things

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
at all how you open these things

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.520 
at all how you open these things
is<00:02:16.790> because<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.120> got<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> very<00:02:18.390> thin<00:02:18.870> skin<00:02:19.140> and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
is because it's got a very thin skin and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.260 
is because it's got a very thin skin and
you<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.710> kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.070> has<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> poke<00:02:20.490> at<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.940> until

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
you just kind of has a poke at it until

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.080 
you just kind of has a poke at it until
it<00:02:21.600> comes<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.910> see

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it comes out like that and you see

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.420 
it comes out like that and you see
there's<00:02:24.270> some<00:02:24.450> green<00:02:24.750> seeds<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.440> there<00:02:25.620> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
there's some green seeds in there you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.150 
there's some green seeds in there you
grab<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.970> thing<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.660> basically<00:02:27.870> just

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
grab this thing and you basically just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:41.160 
grab this thing and you basically just
suck<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.340> fruit<00:02:29.580> out

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.230 

there's<00:02:41.860> pretty<00:02:42.790> big<00:02:44.760> green<00:02:45.760> seeds<00:02:46.240> in<00:02:46.480> there

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
there's pretty big green seeds in there

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.050 
there's pretty big green seeds in there
as<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.300> can<00:02:49.450> see<00:02:49.570> there<00:02:50.050> they<00:02:50.980> they<00:02:51.640> take<00:02:51.820> up<00:02:51.970> a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
as you can see there they they take up a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.460 
as you can see there they they take up a
lot<00:02:52.210> of<00:02:52.240> room<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.780> when<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:52.990> eat<00:02:53.230> these<00:02:53.410> things

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
lot of room so when you eat these things

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.990 
lot of room so when you eat these things
there<00:02:53.830> isn't<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> whole<00:02:54.340> lot<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.550> fruit

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
there isn't a whole lot of fruit

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.960 
there isn't a whole lot of fruit
involved<00:02:55.860> because<00:02:56.860> once<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.280> peel<00:02:57.490> off<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
involved because once you peel off the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.270 
involved because once you peel off the
skin<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:59.110> take<00:02:59.350> out<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.680> seeds<00:02:59.950> there's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280
