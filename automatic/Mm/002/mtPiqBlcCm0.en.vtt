begin<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.280> again<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
begin to see you know again you see you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.320 
begin to see you know again you see you
can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.800> want<00:01:17.040> physical<00:01:17.700> reality<00:01:18.150> but

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
can see if you want physical reality but

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.290 
can see if you want physical reality but
you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.600> also<00:01:18.830> go<00:01:19.830> deeper<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.490> experience

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
you can also go deeper and experience

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.020 
you can also go deeper and experience
energy<00:01:21.810> fields<00:01:22.230> and<00:01:22.950> ultimately<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.760> say

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
energy fields and ultimately I would say

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.780 
energy fields and ultimately I would say
qualia<00:01:24.480> fields<00:01:24.980> that's<00:01:25.980> all<00:01:26.250> there<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
qualia fields that's all there is and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.380 
qualia fields that's all there is and
even<00:01:27.240> beyond<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> qualia<00:01:28.500> fields<00:01:28.890> there's

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
even beyond the qualia fields there's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.630 
even beyond the qualia fields there's
basically<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.600> yourself<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.640> that's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
basically just yourself and that's

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.850 
basically just yourself and that's
called<00:01:33.030> Brahman<00:01:33.450> consciousness<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
called Brahman consciousness and that is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.430 
called Brahman consciousness and that is
reality<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.820> everything<00:01:36.210> else<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
reality the everything else is a

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.430 
reality the everything else is a
projection<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.320> have

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
projection you know it's like if I have

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.460 
projection you know it's like if I have
light<00:01:40.740> coming<00:01:41.190> through<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.490> film<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.470> it's

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
light coming through a film and it's

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.700 
light coming through a film and it's
projecting<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> screen<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:46.260> it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
projecting on the screen I know it's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.210 
projecting on the screen I know it's
light<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> projecting<00:01:48.510> on<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> screen

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
light that is projecting on the screen

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.890 
light that is projecting on the screen
but<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.580> like<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.030> arrange<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> fight

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
but I don't like the arrange so I fight

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.010 
but I don't like the arrange so I fight
to<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.200> cinema<00:01:52.620> screen<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.479> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to the cinema screen but you know it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.800 
to the cinema screen but you know it's
just<00:01:55.440> so<00:01:55.680> light<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:56.490> furthermore<00:01:57.180> light<00:01:57.570> is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
just so light and furthermore light is

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
just so light and furthermore light is
not<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.409> we<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.799> light<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.940> know<00:02:00.060> we

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
not what we think light is you know we

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.289 
not what we think light is you know we
say<00:02:00.390> light<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.869> bright<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.820> photons<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
say light is bright and photons and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.840 
say light is bright and photons and
color<00:02:03.860> but<00:02:04.860> light<00:02:05.100> has<00:02:05.340> none<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.700> those

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
color but light has none of those

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.259 
color but light has none of those
attributes<00:02:06.830> okay<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:08.519> only<00:02:08.639> light<00:02:09.029> that

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
attributes okay the only light that

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.140 
attributes okay the only light that
exists<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> light<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.379> awareness<00:02:11.150> because

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
exists is the light of awareness because

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.740 
exists is the light of awareness because
without<00:02:12.329> the<00:02:12.629> light<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.959> awareness

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
without the light of awareness

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.870 
without the light of awareness
even<00:02:15.750> what<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.380> call<00:02:16.410> fundamental<00:02:17.310> particles

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
even what we call fundamental particles

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.930 
even what we call fundamental particles
you<00:02:18.810> know<00:02:18.930> science<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.890> bamboozled<00:02:20.670> by<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
you know science is so bamboozled by the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.540 
you know science is so bamboozled by the
superstition<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.840> materialism<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.400> the

artificial nature is one the universe is
one<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.209> its<00:02:36.420> activity<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:38.070> first<00:02:38.400> there's<00:02:38.910> a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
split which is not real you're not the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.090 
split which is not real you're not the
observer<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.380> universe<00:02:43.770> you're<00:02:43.980> an

the<00:02:47.190> activity<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> universe<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.750> this

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
the activity of the universe in this

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.540 
the activity of the universe in this
case<00:02:49.709> has<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> subjective<00:02:51.330> feeling<00:02:51.870> called<00:02:52.170> I

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
case has a subjective feeling called I

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.080 
case has a subjective feeling called I
okay<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:54.080> there<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.230> no<00:02:55.730> observers<00:02:56.730> that's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
okay but there is no observers that's

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.680 
okay but there is no observers that's
why<00:02:57.269> it<00:02:57.360> can't<00:02:57.630> be<00:02:57.780> found<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.980> know<00:02:59.570> when<00:03:00.570> you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
why it can't be found you know when you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.360 
why it can't be found you know when you
can't<00:03:00.989> find<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.410> observer<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.130> only

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
can't find the observer then the only

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.520 
can't find the observer then the only
two<00:03:02.550> choices<00:03:02.989> either<00:03:03.989> it's<00:03:04.320> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
two choices either it's the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.620 
two choices either it's the
hallucination<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:09.500> biological<00:03:10.500> robot

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
hallucination of a of a biological robot

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.040 
hallucination of a of a biological robot
Daniel<00:03:12.630> Dennett<00:03:12.989> etc<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.650> doesn't<00:03:13.980> exist

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
Daniel Dennett etc it doesn't exist

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.080 
Daniel Dennett etc it doesn't exist
well<00:03:16.050> that's<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.860> position<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.610> take<00:03:17.820> that

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
well that's a position you can take that

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.500 
well that's a position you can take that
the<00:03:18.209> observing<00:03:18.690> self<00:03:18.959> is<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:20.510> hallucination

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the observing self is is hallucination

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.020 
the observing self is is hallucination
which<00:03:22.320> actually<00:03:22.799> then<00:03:23.010> reinforces<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.000> idea

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
which actually then reinforces the idea

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.600 
which actually then reinforces the idea
so<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.780> world<00:03:24.989> if<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.980> observer<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
so is the world if the observer is the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.210 
so is the world if the observer is the
loose<00:03:27.150> at<00:03:27.510> Rick<00:03:27.780> produced<00:03:28.230> by<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.440> brain<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.160> as

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
loose at Rick produced by a brain so as

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.060 
loose at Rick produced by a brain so as
the<00:03:29.400> world<00:03:29.579> why<00:03:30.450> do<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.900> be<00:03:31.140> partial<00:03:31.620> only<00:03:31.920> to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
the world why do I be partial only to

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.210 
the world why do I be partial only to
the<00:03:32.190> observer<00:03:32.579> or<00:03:33.510> since<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.500> can't<00:03:34.769> find<00:03:35.010> it

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
the observer or since you can't find it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.080 
the observer or since you can't find it
it<00:03:35.910> doesn't<00:03:36.209> exist<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.900> space-time<00:03:37.850> okay<00:03:38.850> it's

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
it doesn't exist in space-time okay it's

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.710 
it doesn't exist in space-time okay it's
non-local<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.430> that's<00:03:41.430> where<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.970> Eastern

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
non-local and that's where the Eastern

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.449 
non-local and that's where the Eastern
traditions<00:03:43.260> come<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.709> they<00:03:43.890> say<00:03:44.130> if<00:03:44.250> you

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
traditions come in they say if you

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.539 
traditions come in they say if you
forget<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.570> observation<00:03:46.260> be<00:03:47.190> if<00:03:47.370> you

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
forget this observation be if you

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.280 
forget this observation be if you
practice<00:03:48.650> self-awareness<00:03:50.000> transcendence

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
practice self-awareness transcendence

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.430 
practice self-awareness transcendence
you<00:03:53.000> question<00:03:54.000> your<00:03:54.209> perceptual<00:03:54.780> reality

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
you question your perceptual reality

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.750 
you question your perceptual reality
make<00:03:56.430> conscious<00:03:56.910> choices<00:03:58.670> you<00:03:59.670> will<00:04:00.260> see<00:04:01.260> that

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
make conscious choices you will see that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.280 
make conscious choices you will see that
there's<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.820> quality<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.420> awareness<00:04:03.870> called

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
there's a quality of awareness called

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.190 
there's a quality of awareness called
second<00:04:04.739> attention<00:04:05.340> first<00:04:06.209> attention<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.019> to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
be bamboozled by the images and then

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.390 
be bamboozled by the images and then
