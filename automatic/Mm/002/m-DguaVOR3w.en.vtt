years<00:00:53.449> especially<00:00:54.449> since<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.199> experience<00:00:55.829> in

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.770 
Kundalini awakening after that in it and
it<00:00:59.520> got<00:00:59.640> more<00:00:59.789> pronounced<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.449> remember

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
it got more pronounced but I remember

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.470 
it got more pronounced but I remember
even<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> kid<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.120> issue<00:01:03.239> with

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
even as a kid then I have an issue with

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.950 
even as a kid then I have an issue with
it<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.840> would<00:01:04.409> stay<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:05.630> all<00:01:06.630> night<00:01:06.659> reading

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it I would stay up all night reading

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.450 
it I would stay up all night reading
books<00:01:07.260> because<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> wasn't<00:01:08.040> able<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> sleep

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
books because I wasn't able to sleep

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.240 
books because I wasn't able to sleep
while<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.820> brother<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.420> snoring<00:01:09.689> away

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.789 

so<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.580> guess<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.570> genetic<00:01:16.170> genetic

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
so I guess it's just a genetic genetic

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.710 
so I guess it's just a genetic genetic
thing<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.250> whatever<00:01:17.490> whatever<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> problem

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
thing or whatever whatever the problem

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.950 
thing or whatever whatever the problem
is<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.049> wish<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> hell<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.890> could

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
is I wish the hell that I could

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
is I wish the hell that I could
straighten<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:23.180> literally

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
straighten it out because I literally

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.380 
straighten it out because I literally
never<00:01:24.509> wake<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.460> rested

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
never wake up rested

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.480 
never wake up rested

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.770 

tapping<00:03:16.780> into<00:03:17.909> sources<00:03:18.909> of<00:03:19.180> energy<00:03:19.420> within

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
tapping into sources of energy within

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.920 
tapping into sources of energy within
them<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.049> are<00:03:20.290> seeking<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.650> integrate<00:03:21.160> and

them that are seeking to integrate and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.740 
them that are seeking to integrate and
trying<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.019> balance<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.560> with<00:03:24.629> you<00:03:25.629> know

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750
