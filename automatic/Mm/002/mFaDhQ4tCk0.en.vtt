this<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.549> better<00:03:24.060> than<00:03:24.889> trying<00:03:25.889> to<00:03:26.220> wiggle<00:03:26.459> it

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
this is better than trying to wiggle it

we<00:03:39.500> will<00:03:39.769> begin<00:03:39.980> our<00:03:40.340> stitching<00:03:40.909> by<00:03:41.090> passing

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
we will begin our stitching by passing

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.280 
we will begin our stitching by passing
our<00:03:41.870> needle<00:03:42.260> through<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.890> hole<00:03:43.790> as<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:45.019> can

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
our needle through the hole as you can

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.390 
our needle through the hole as you can
see<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.890> then<00:03:46.730> we<00:03:46.939> will<00:03:47.180> pull<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.930> up<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.370> that

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
see and then we will pull it up so that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.649 
see and then we will pull it up so that
we<00:03:49.730> have<00:03:49.879> an<00:03:50.060> even<00:03:50.599> amount<00:03:50.719> of<00:03:51.170> thread<00:03:51.620> on<00:03:52.659> each

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
we have an even amount of thread on each

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.869 
we have an even amount of thread on each
end<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:55.090> then<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:56.359> will<00:03:57.250> push<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.489> next

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
end and then we will push the next

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.860 
end and then we will push the next
needle<00:03:59.150> or<00:03:59.659> push<00:04:00.049> it<00:04:00.230> down<00:04:00.439> one<00:04:03.609> stitch<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:05.000> we

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
needle or push it down one stitch and we

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.050 
needle or push it down one stitch and we
will<00:04:06.079> come<00:04:06.319> back<00:04:06.500> through<00:04:06.799> that<00:04:06.950> same<00:04:07.280> hole<00:04:07.340> in

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
will come back through that same hole in

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.500 
will come back through that same hole in
the<00:04:09.049> other<00:04:09.200> direction<00:04:11.260> then<00:04:12.260> we<00:04:12.590> will<00:04:13.299> pull<00:04:14.299> it

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
the other direction then we will pull it

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:26.320 
the other direction then we will pull it
up<00:04:14.689> tight<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.680> we<00:04:19.400> will<00:04:19.609> continue<00:04:19.880> this<00:04:25.330> all

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
up tight and we will continue this all

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:41.360 
up tight and we will continue this all
the<00:04:26.389> way<00:04:26.750> around<00:04:27.229> our<00:04:27.560> project

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.260 

to<00:04:42.370> make<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.639> splice<00:04:43.740> we<00:04:44.740> cut<00:04:45.010> off<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.580> threads

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
to make a splice we cut off the threads

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:53.360 
to make a splice we cut off the threads
to<00:04:46.600> about<00:04:46.870> an<00:04:47.050> inch<00:04:47.199> and<00:04:47.500> a<00:04:47.530> half<00:04:49.229> then<00:04:50.229> we'll

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.330 

tie<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.400> little<00:04:54.699> overhand<00:04:55.600> knot<00:04:55.979> may<00:04:56.979> need<00:04:57.190> to

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
tie a little overhand knot may need to

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.640 
tie a little overhand knot may need to
get<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.729> threads<00:04:58.090> out<00:04:58.419> of<00:04:58.960> our<00:04:59.139> way

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
get the threads out of our way

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.170 
get the threads out of our way
I<00:05:01.320> have<00:05:02.320> prepared<00:05:02.949> another<00:05:03.340> thread<00:05:03.790> and<00:05:04.030> then

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
I have prepared another thread and then

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.280 
I have prepared another thread and then
I<00:05:04.210> will<00:05:04.600> go<00:05:04.780> back<00:05:04.810> one<00:05:05.440> two<00:05:05.860> stitches<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:07.290> I

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
I will go back one two stitches and I

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:16.830 
I will go back one two stitches and I
will<00:05:09.540> begin<00:05:10.540> stitching<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:15.540> we'll<00:05:16.540> do<00:05:16.720> it

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
will begin stitching and we'll do it

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.870 
will begin stitching and we'll do it
just<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.260> way<00:05:17.410> we<00:05:17.620> did<00:05:17.860> when<00:05:18.070> we<00:05:18.100> started<00:05:18.280> with

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
just the way we did when we started with

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.879 
just the way we did when we started with
even<00:05:19.360> up<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.750> two<00:05:20.430> two<00:05:21.430> ends<00:05:22.380> we'll<00:05:23.380> go<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.650> the

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
even up the two two ends we'll go to the

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.790 
even up the two two ends we'll go to the
next<00:05:24.450> hole<00:05:25.450> now<00:05:25.900> it'll<00:05:26.169> be<00:05:26.200> a<00:05:26.350> little<00:05:26.530> more

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
next hole now it'll be a little more

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.000 
next hole now it'll be a little more
difficult<00:05:27.490> because<00:05:28.229> there's<00:05:29.229> more<00:05:29.620> threads

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
difficult because there's more threads

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:45.249 
difficult because there's more threads
going<00:05:30.400> through<00:05:30.669> the<00:05:30.820> same<00:05:31.090> holes

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.930 

we'll<00:05:46.259> go<00:05:46.470> through<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.889> next<00:05:47.100> hole<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.639> same

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
we'll go through the next hole the same

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.390 
we'll go through the next hole the same
way<00:05:48.740> we'll<00:05:49.740> come<00:05:49.949> back<00:05:50.190> through<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.880> then<00:05:52.400> we

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
way we'll come back through and then we

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:05.800 
way we'll come back through and then we
will<00:05:53.610> continue<00:05:53.880> stitching<00:06:00.979> and<00:06:02.210> after<00:06:03.210> we<00:06:03.360> get

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:14.689 

several<00:06:06.810> stitches<00:06:07.110> past

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:20.340 

then<00:06:15.699> we<00:06:15.970> can<00:06:17.880> undo<00:06:18.880> our<00:06:18.910> overhand<00:06:19.690> knot<00:06:19.960> right

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
then we can undo our overhand knot right

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:32.460 
then we can undo our overhand knot right
here<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:28.590> with<00:06:29.590> a<00:06:29.620> sharp<00:06:30.070> knife<00:06:30.490> or<00:06:31.470> our

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
here and with a sharp knife or our

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.710 
here and with a sharp knife or our
shears<00:06:33.750> we'll<00:06:34.750> cut<00:06:34.990> off<00:06:35.169> these<00:06:36.360> ends<00:06:37.360> real

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
shears we'll cut off these ends real

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:59.269 
shears we'll cut off these ends real
close<00:06:39.449> and<00:06:41.280> now<00:06:42.280> we<00:06:42.340> can<00:06:42.759> continue<00:06:43.240> stitching

00:06:59.269 --> 00:06:59.279 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:03.499 

when<00:06:59.849> we<00:07:00.059> get<00:07:00.269> back<00:07:00.329> to<00:07:00.629> where<00:07:01.109> we<00:07:01.319> started<00:07:02.509> we

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
when we get back to where we started we

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:10.099 
when we get back to where we started we
just<00:07:03.839> continue<00:07:04.559> stitching<00:07:07.399> past<00:07:09.109> several

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:10.109 
just continue stitching past several

00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:16.839 
just continue stitching past several
holes<00:07:11.209> how'd<00:07:12.209> you<00:07:12.749> see<00:07:13.019> me<00:07:13.199> doing<00:07:13.439> here<00:07:15.799> and

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:16.849 
holes how'd you see me doing here and

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:28.390 
holes how'd you see me doing here and
then

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.550 

we<00:07:28.970> take<00:07:29.270> a<00:07:30.460> sharp<00:07:31.460> knife<00:07:32.889> or<00:07:34.720> as<00:07:35.720> yours<00:07:36.139> if<00:07:36.380> you

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 
we take a sharp knife or as yours if you

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.610 
we take a sharp knife or as yours if you
want<00:07:36.800> and<00:07:41.440> cut<00:07:42.440> the<00:07:42.620> ends<00:07:42.949> off<00:07:43.070> real<00:07:43.580> short<00:07:44.000> and

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.620 
want and cut the ends off real short and

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.500 
want and cut the ends off real short and
that's<00:07:45.620> all<00:07:45.919> there<00:07:46.100> is<00:07:46.250> to<00:07:46.490> some<00:07:46.729> really<00:07:47.270> good

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:47.510 
that's all there is to some really good

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.710 
that's all there is to some really good
quality<00:07:47.870> stitching
