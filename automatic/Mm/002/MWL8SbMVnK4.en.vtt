proposes<00:02:22.389> responding<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.019> yeah<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.769> would

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
proposes responding it yeah that would

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.309 
proposes responding it yeah that would
be<00:02:23.920> pretty<00:02:24.159> badass<00:02:24.549> I<00:02:24.999> think<00:02:25.569> we<00:02:25.930> might<00:02:26.079> look

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
be pretty badass I think we might look

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.009 
be pretty badass I think we might look
into<00:02:26.560> things<00:02:26.920> like<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.760> count<00:02:28.269> promise<00:02:28.719> but

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
into things like that count promise but

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.589 
into things like that count promise but
I've<00:02:29.170> certainly<00:02:29.439> would<00:02:29.829> love<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.159> have<00:02:30.370> one

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
I've certainly would love to have one

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.750 
I've certainly would love to have one
now<00:02:31.599> I<00:02:31.629> believe<00:02:31.870> ear<00:02:32.230> sold<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:34.379> hundred<00:02:35.379> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
now I believe ear sold a hundred and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.640 
now I believe ear sold a hundred and

not gone into that but something that

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.520 
not gone into that but something that
really<00:03:38.500> interests<00:03:38.829> me<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:40.019> co-op<00:03:41.019> mode<00:03:41.259> an

really interests me a co-op mode an
online<00:03:42.250> co-op<00:03:42.970> mode<00:03:43.439> so<00:03:44.439> we<00:03:45.189> don't<00:03:45.310> know<00:03:45.459> how

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
online co-op mode so we don't know how

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.640 
online co-op mode so we don't know how
many<00:03:45.759> people<00:03:45.909> would<00:03:46.449> actually<00:03:46.629> do<00:03:47.229> the<00:03:47.379> co-op

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
many people would actually do the co-op

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.249 
many people would actually do the co-op
mode<00:03:47.829> unless<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.430> have<00:03:48.609> two<00:03:48.849> people<00:03:49.109> doing<00:03:50.109> it

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:50.259 
mode unless you have two people doing it

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.469 
mode unless you have two people doing it
or<00:03:50.470> four<00:03:50.769> people<00:03:50.979> doing<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.519> so<00:03:51.939> I<00:03:52.000> like<00:03:52.209> left

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
or four people doing it so I like left

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:59.030 
or four people doing it so I like left
for<00:03:52.599> dead<00:03:53.579> what<00:03:54.579> mold<00:03:54.790> sounds<00:03:55.180> good<00:03:55.359> to<00:03:55.509> me

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.429 

anything<00:04:00.040> what<00:04:00.280> else<00:04:00.430> well<00:04:01.389> not<00:04:01.629> as<00:04:01.810> about<00:04:02.049> it

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
anything what else well not as about it

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.179 
anything what else well not as about it
so<00:04:02.859> far<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:04.349> I've<00:04:05.349> actually<00:04:05.560> been<00:04:05.769> looking

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
so far and I've actually been looking

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:12.929 
so far and I've actually been looking
into<00:04:07.469> making<00:04:08.469> a<00:04:09.629> dead<00:04:10.629> space<00:04:10.930> helmet<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.939> I'm

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
into making a dead space helmet and I'm

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.640 
into making a dead space helmet and I'm
no<00:04:13.209> interested<00:04:13.719> in<00:04:13.780> making<00:04:14.049> a<00:04:14.109> plasma<00:04:14.469> cutter

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
no interested in making a plasma cutter

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.170 
no interested in making a plasma cutter

since there is no replicas out the I

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.469 
since there is no replicas out the I

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
expensive at the moment so then asked to

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.629 
expensive at the moment so then asked to
have<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.220> plasma<00:04:55.699> cutter<00:04:55.820> from<00:04:56.210> dead<00:04:56.630> space<00:04:56.900> and

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
have a plasma cutter from dead space and

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.430 
have a plasma cutter from dead space and
we<00:04:58.639> actually<00:04:59.330> do<00:04:59.449> many<00:04:59.630> movies<00:05:00.020> so<00:05:00.169> we<00:05:00.289> could

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
we actually do many movies so we could

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.830 
we actually do many movies so we could
probably<00:05:00.590> do<00:05:00.919> a<00:05:01.160> mini<00:05:01.729> dead<00:05:02.210> space<00:05:02.449> movie

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
probably do a mini dead space movie

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.290 
probably do a mini dead space movie
