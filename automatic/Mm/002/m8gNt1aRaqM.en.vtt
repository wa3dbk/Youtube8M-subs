00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
weeks that you do it should probably

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.610 
weeks that you do it should probably
work<00:06:03.160> on<00:06:03.370> -<00:06:03.610> it's<00:06:03.760> slow<00:06:04.000> let<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.110> go<00:06:05.230> from<00:06:05.440> there

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
work on - it's slow let it go from there

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.210

and<00:06:05.920> then<00:06:06.400> after<00:06:06.670> that<00:06:07.140> really<00:06:08.140> jump<00:06:08.470> high<00:06:08.680> get

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
and then after that really jump high get

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.740 
and then after that really jump high get
a<00:06:09.250> little<00:06:09.460> bit<00:06:09.550> more<00:06:09.670> min<00:06:09.910> of<00:06:10.060> momentum<00:06:10.720> a

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
a little bit more min of momentum a

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.750 
a little bit more min of momentum a
little<00:06:10.870> bit<00:06:11.050> more<00:06:11.230> explosion<00:06:11.740> throw<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.550> crap
