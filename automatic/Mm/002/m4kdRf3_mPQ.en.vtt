00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
SF and if we all remember the SF from

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.359 
SF and if we all remember the SF from
Dainese<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.440> used<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> lot<00:01:08.340> of

Dainese it used to have a lot of

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
Dainese it used to have a lot of
reflectivity<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.840> slightly

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
reflectivity to it in a slightly

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
reflectivity to it in a slightly
different<00:01:10.380> line<00:01:10.890> sometimes<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> SF

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
different line sometimes I think the SF

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.789 
different line sometimes I think the SF
wasn't<00:01:12.750> sure<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> wanted<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
wasn't sure what it wanted to be when it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.500 
wasn't sure what it wanted to be when it
crewed<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.549> grew<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
crewed up because it grew up because it

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.480 
crewed up because it grew up because it
had<00:01:15.660> certain<00:01:16.110> race<00:01:16.290> elements<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.280> rays
