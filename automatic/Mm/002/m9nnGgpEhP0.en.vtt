00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.200
 Now a ninja 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.200
 I agree 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.769
 s go 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.769
 Because we purchased 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.090
 Non 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.090
 Let's go 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.470
 Because it will change 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.460
 Ginkgo Test Video 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.789
 I think it's good 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.089
 I will take 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.089
 You 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.920
 It is quite a voice 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.500
 Icha N 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.100
 Between you 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.730
 When standing 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.730
 Video 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.450
 Sometimes say 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.450
 peach 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.590
 Voice is 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.590
 Because the sound quality was bad 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.220
 amazon 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.020
 It is me 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.880
 Nakabayashi with iphone 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.159
 Fifth 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.920
 Electret condenser microphone 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:16.159
 say to get mc 01 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.159
 I bought a tiny small microphone 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.229
 I need a video 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.229
 Though I thought that I wanted to take a little bit and put it on, I bought it 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.070
 Follow 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.570
 You can use even draw 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.290
 I bought a soup but 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.730
 without corresponding to the xperia 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 is not it 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.360
 Month 2 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.500
 I kept it 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.330
 Finally I bought it 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.330
 I think the time has come to use 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.020
 I can say that even a low voice can be taken properly 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.020
 What 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.530
 I can also be a pin microphone 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.900
 Away from mobile 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.900
 It means that you are speaking with a small voice 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.090
 What is being recorded 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.090
 I have not tried it yet 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.050
 It's a bit occasional 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.650
 I 'm in front of a moving cat 's store right now 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.810
 Better 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.370
 on youtube 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.299
 I'm up to review videos 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.299
 amazon but 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.740
 The plate was expensive, and it has a reputation 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.360
 I can not expect transparency 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.900
 Clearly 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.900
 Travel properly 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:16.490
 Is it a short video because it is a test video 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.170
 Over Te around here 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.170
 I want to end 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.690
 this 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.590
 It is to see after both are 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.370
 To hear 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.370
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.060
 You are lucky 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.980
 Chew at the end 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.980
 Thank you for watching the school
