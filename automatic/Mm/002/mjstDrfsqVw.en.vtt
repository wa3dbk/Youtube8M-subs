00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 and hello to all and their journey we get 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.610
 found today for the 2nd tutorial 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.380
 of the tutorial chain goes wall or 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.349
 in everyday language how to climb 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.519
 a wall and so we do not wait for a more 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.519
 one finds oneself right away 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.470
 so first of all you have to know that this 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.560
 movement can be divided into two 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 big steps so the whole party you 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.110
 go grab the wall with the race 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.960
 momentum etc and second step it's all 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.239
 the part of the attraction and the climb 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.149
 of the wall obviously it will start 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.879
 with walls to his little ones ie 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.940
 that you can catch without using 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.280
 but as you go 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 progress will have to increase the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.850
 difficulty is therefore the size of the wall 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.840
 because otherwise it will be way too much 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.370
 easy and so you will progress more 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.649
 your run run must be enough 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.290
 fast one so obviously no 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.580
 market and you have to try the least 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.080
 possible to slow down close to the wall 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.740
 so keep in mind that really the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.030
 run of momentum it's really fundamental 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.450
 if you try to do without you go 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.939
 to see is to see it no height at 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.210
 about one meter from the wall it will be necessary to launch 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.270
 your leg up to the hip so 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.159
 on the wall and if your foot is too low 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.049
 you'll see you go slipped 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.679
 and if it is too much you will surely 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.140
 be pushed back and therefore performed in 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.909
 somehow another figure on 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.759
 call the tick but it's because 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.390
 we want if you can not really 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.209
 not to ride your foot as high as 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.990
 the height of the hip then it will take 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:56.049
 trained the muscle located here so we 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.469
 call it a right behind with some 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.049
 exercises so like for example 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.599
 group seals and once your foot on 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.599
 the wall will have to try the most 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:10.509
 possible to give your impetus towards 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:13.540
 the top and that's not always easy 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.230
 because often we tend to 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.000
 push back slightly and that 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.970
 can sometimes stop you from 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.370
 so grab more this ambition is going 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.530
 to be very important especially if you do not 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.069
 put 15 rain because it's she 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.480
 who will give you the necessary height 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.329
 so it will have to be really 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.250
 the most explosive possible and also binds 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.540
 more exercises to train you 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.310
 the chair is a very good chair 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.570
 way 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.480
 sorry I know it's so boring 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.820
 but you really have to go for 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.120
 you build your legs are also the 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.250
 flexions extensions the squats on 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.130
 find the exercises that will improve 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.870
 your relaxation 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.480
 so for the obstacles really too much 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.490
 you can place a second support 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.080
 so I warn you right away 1 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.450
 at first he will give you no more 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.750
 height maybe even that will bother you 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.470
 finally short but once mastered we 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.380
 can reach heights really 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.870
 it's so good me it's not yet 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.270
 very impressive but look am 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.270
 I think it 's okay 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.010
 at 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.569
 so the first thing to do is 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.790
 to grab the wall and that's already going 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.340
 may be a problem in any case 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.120
 has been for me so naturally when 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.849
 of the climb 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.790
 you will put one on the wall for 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.099
 you balance and suddenly when you 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.230
 launch your free arm over 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.539
 your head you will have only one 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.780
 only hand to hang you from 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.220
 from there there can be two scenarios 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.889
 so either you naturally have to 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.560
 this force in the hands to hold and 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.660
 so it's good for you or 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.330
 you can not do it or really 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.360
 little time and then there will have to be 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.350
 muscler so I have not really 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.780
 example 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.810
 but in fact all the exercises for 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.160
 you're muscling your hands are good a 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.530
 once you're going to be hooked on 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.750
 main is done but it will still need 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.110
 you hoist then I tell you all of 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.110
 after 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.800
 use your legs because as soon as we 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.620
 see that we have the impression of hoisting 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.410
 huge dead point so you push on 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.820
 your feet up and you pull on 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.610
 your arms to pull 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.820
 classic so for the sequel there are three 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.490
 difficulty levels the first one the most 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.750
 easy but also the slowest where you 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.470
 go put a bend 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.250
 one after the other 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.480
 the second you go directly ask 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.160
 your hand flat but one sheet at a time 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.950
 and the third fastest the most 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.380
 stylish both arms at the same time but 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.140
 it's also the most difficult so it's 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.390
 for that I will explain to you more 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.030
 in detail so once you are 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.420
 hagrid and you'll have to go back 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.220
 your legs to reach this position 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.520
 with arms outstretched is not glued to 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.830
 Wall 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.030
 and then as quickly as possible 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.310
 because you do not stay 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.010
 eternally in this position you 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.150
 go at the same time pushed with your 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.650
 legs and make an explosive pull 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.350
 do not try to get into the wall 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:02.250
 because it's going to take some effort 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:04.590
 more important and longer but I you 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.710
 rather advise to climb parallel 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.030
 and to advance your bust after and 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.690
 then you will have more to do 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.230
 a dip 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:16.050
 finally last thing sorry I know that 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.460
 it's a lot of info at once but 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.730
 good it's still a shame to finish 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.580
 your movement like that while you 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.770
 can easily ride your legs with 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.770
 more class we will say 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.220
 and here is this tutorial coming to an end 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.650
 I would have a hard time getting him out 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.419
 excuse me if it was a bit long 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.330
 I hope at least that they have the most 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.490
 complete possible do not hesitate to 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.400
 leave your impressions or your 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.930
 difficulties in the comments and by 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.080
 the same opportunity to subscribe to 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.150
 and share this video I 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.490
 count on you and I tell you to very 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.490
 soon for a third cottage to the story
