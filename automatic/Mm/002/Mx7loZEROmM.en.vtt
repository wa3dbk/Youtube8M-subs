so that takes care of that and you also

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.719 
so that takes care of that and you also
get<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> copy<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.900> summing<00:01:16.590> giant<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
get a copy of your of summing giant the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.249 
get a copy of your of summing giant the
problem<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.600> only<00:01:18.630> play<00:01:18.840> creatures

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
problem is you can only play creatures

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
problem is you can only play creatures
here<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.439> your<00:01:19.590> main<00:01:19.710> phase<00:01:19.890> right<00:01:20.689> well

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
here in your main phase right well

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.340 
here in your main phase right well
normally<00:01:22.020> yes<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.330> activated<00:01:24.330> abilities<00:01:24.450> can

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350

be<00:01:25.409> played<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.920> any<00:01:26.070> time<00:01:26.340> they<00:01:26.580> are<00:01:26.759> instant

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
be played at any time they are instant

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.910 
be played at any time they are instant
speed<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:28.619> over<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:30.920> at

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
speed so if we look over here at

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.850 
speed so if we look over here at
quiksilver<00:01:32.610> amulet<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.479> pay<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:33.720> tap<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
quiksilver amulet we can pay for tap and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830 
quiksilver amulet we can pay for tap and
I<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> creature<00:01:35.759> from<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> hand<00:01:36.570> onto

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
I can put a creature from the hand onto

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.780 
I can put a creature from the hand onto
the<00:01:37.020> battlefield<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.369> resolve

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the battlefield and that will resolve

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.350 
the battlefield and that will resolve
before<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.900> end<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.200> his<00:01:40.320> turn<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.150> means

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
before the end of his turn so that means

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.910 
before the end of his turn so that means
that<00:01:42.540> i<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.810> exile<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> creature<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that i can exile the creature at the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.020 
that i can exile the creature at the
beginning<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.369> Keith<00:01:44.579> there's<00:01:44.790> no

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
beginning of my out Keith there's no

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130 
beginning of my out Keith there's no
enchantments<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.100> ahead<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.390

turn<00:02:56.769> so<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:58.340> easiest<00:02:58.570> thing<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.810> I've<00:02:59.930> seen

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
turn so the easiest thing that I've seen

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.310 
turn so the easiest thing that I've seen
is<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.980> use<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:05.269> play<00:03:05.900> /

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
is you have to use this and play /

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.970 
is you have to use this and play /
cursor<00:03:06.709> golem<00:03:07.040> if<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.150> read<00:03:08.360> precursor<00:03:08.840> golem

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
cursor golem if you read precursor golem

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.190 
cursor golem if you read precursor golem
it<00:03:09.980> creates<00:03:10.430> two<00:03:11.090> three<00:03:11.540> three<00:03:11.660> colors<00:03:11.959> film

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
it creates two three three colors film

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.840 
it creates two three three colors film
artifacts<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.920> most<00:03:13.070> important<00:03:13.790> thing

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
artifacts but the most important thing

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.420 
artifacts but the most important thing
is<00:03:14.299> if<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.320> target<00:03:15.560> one<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:15.890> those<00:03:16.040> golems

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
is if you target one of those golems

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.580 
is if you target one of those golems
that<00:03:16.730> spell<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.390> replicated<00:03:17.959> for<00:03:18.110> all<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.470> them

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that spell is replicated for all of them

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.759 
that spell is replicated for all of them
so<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.430> can<00:03:19.880> copy<00:03:20.269> your<00:03:20.930> opponents<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.470> copy<00:03:21.680> a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
sort of buff or something that makes you

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.350 
sort of buff or something that makes you
draw<00:03:25.790> as<00:03:26.090> you'll<00:03:26.239> see<00:03:26.390> here<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.570> minute<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.239> we
