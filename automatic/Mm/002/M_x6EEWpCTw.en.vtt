um shower it's gonna do the same thing
as<00:02:15.950> baking<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:18.230> was<00:02:18.560> pretty<00:02:18.709> much<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.890> I

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
as baking and that was pretty much it I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.570 
as baking and that was pretty much it I
think<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.490> was<00:02:19.640> um<00:02:20.470> now<00:02:21.470> going<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.220> how<00:02:22.520> to

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
think it was um now going on to how to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.970 
think it was um now going on to how to
keep<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:24.340> broken<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.459> keep<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.060> broken<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.980> it's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
keep it broken it keep it broken in it's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.540 
keep it broken it keep it broken in it's
just<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.520> same<00:02:28.730> way<00:02:28.880> as<00:02:28.910> breaking<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:30.550> this

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
just the same way as breaking it in this

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.000 
just the same way as breaking it in this
is<00:02:31.700> rad<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.120> right<00:02:32.450> when<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:32.660> get<00:02:32.780> off<00:02:33.020> from<00:02:33.290> the
