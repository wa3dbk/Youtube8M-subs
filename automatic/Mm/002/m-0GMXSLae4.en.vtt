00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.090
 Hello welcome to this videoblog 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.860
 primeriti in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.620
 show you step by step how this is done 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.170
 combed a braided crown but good 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.730
 an easier version for those who 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.620
 Do not be too crafty when it comes to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.600
 braid to make very elaborate hairstyles 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.520
 let's use the false technique 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 Root braid with that French braid 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.930
 that you already see me use in the collected 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 what we did for valentine and good and 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.620
 you will see that it is very easy I explain 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.210
 step by step how it is done 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 The first thing we do is divide the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.670
 hair with a central stripe we collect this 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.789
 half with a clamp so that we do not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.109
 clog while doing the other 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:56.469
 and we catch you very well so you're 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:57.879
 well untangled let's start 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.890
 doing the area of ​​the bangs a 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.239
 false French braid like those that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.509
 explain in the previous video I remember 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.509
 how is it ok let's catch a lot 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.729
 another just below 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.729
 and we will cross it over 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.710
 Now we are going to add hair to 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:29.590
 chin that stays under crossing it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:32.790
 above we add starch from below and 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.790
 we cross it over 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:53.940
 we add and cross when we get to 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.369
 the area of ​​the ear we give a 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.360
 little more 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.360
 we fix it with a fork 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:34.240
 and now we collect all the hair 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:37.800
 in a little ball and we're going to do 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.800
 exactly the same with the other side 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.260
 once we have braided the part 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.580
 of bangs now what we're going to do 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.580
 is also to braid the pigtails 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.780
 Needless we press too much 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.129
 We are going to leave it loose 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.400
 to then do it a bit with the 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.400
 fingers 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.560
 when we get to the end we will fix 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.569
 secure it with a rubber band and fix 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.569
 what I'm going to do, let's leave 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.540
 a little look made with the end of 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.540
 the braid 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:27.080
 something like that we undo it a little bit to 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:29.000
 It seems thicker do not be afraid 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.010
 that they leave strands because good 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.639
 the idea of this hairstyle is that it is very 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.639
 carefree 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:05:02.379
 the operation with the tail once 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.479
 we already have braided the two pigtails 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.879
 let's go through the top of 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.639
 the head to make the crown that is what 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.990
 what are we going to do, let's use the 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.300
 arito of this look we made with the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.520
 end to go through there a fork 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.599
 and fix it to the opposite extreme good 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.750
 first I will fix it in the part 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.750
 higher 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.910
 now if we set the end 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.310
 and we add more hairpins until with 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.310
 breed that we notice that it is safe 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.340
 Now let's do the same with the other 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.470
 30 but let's pass it over the 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:06:02.830
 end to cover the part of the gummie 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:04.750
 and we are going to fix it and now the 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:19.139
 end we will hide under the 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:21.300
 another one and we add more hairpins and that's it 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.180
 good and this you see here is the 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.370
 result as you have already seen is a 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.539
 very very easy way to make a crown 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.249
 we do not need to be in 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.050
 overly skilled or that 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.419
 let's have a lot of skill at the time of 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.279
 braid and it becomes very very fast so 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.259
 which is a good option both to go to 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:38.370
 work as for a dinner a little bit 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.710
 in which we want to wear a hairstyle 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.740
 little more elaborated because as you see no 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.599
 we have time left five minutes ago 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.190
 this has been all for today I hope that 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.690
