00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.270
 family touring was we again 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.600
 with a short video to do the 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.840
 presentation and installation of a model 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.810
 wanted a 100% steel clutch warning 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.780
 very robust and functional stainless 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:20.180
 a new option an improvement that 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:24.290
 we did where we have the possibility d 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.900
 and they lengthened and shortened the distance of 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.630
 the platinas to improve a bit the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.250
 softness in the case that our the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.010
 space in our times we had no 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.810
 let us understand that the 16 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.860
 valve has a little more space than 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.879
 those of valve 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.879
 the procedure is very simple 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.960
 and we make a comparison simple 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.760
 we see that the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.760
 Latinas are a little longer 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.040
 a little more more stylized but still 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.030
 being very strong in stainless steel 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.030
 by laser 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 like 12 big here very tough 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.479
 everything is in stainless steel for what 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.290
 they did not have the opportunity to see the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.290
 previous video 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.580
 we picked up again a pingo 16 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.090
 valves that differentiates it from the others 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.040
 in the in the beginning of the installation 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.410
 is to remove this box at a filter level 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.810
 of air let's do the procedure 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.780
 from the beginning reflecting a bit the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.290
 clamp is that cow of the making of 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.150
 air in body acceleration we remove the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.270
 hose that come from the gas e place 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.250
 be the crankcase 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.530
 this hose that comes from the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.240
 ventilation of the box the vent of 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.280
 this way comes from the quarry to the engine 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.590
 that takes the tank vapors the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.700
 gasoline to the engine 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.439
 the air intake 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.439
 we retired a little 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.750
 we fill the hundred 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.750
 retired 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.220
 the procedure is the same as the model 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.120
 previous we easily removed the water and 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.120
 of the fork 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.130
 to the base 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.230
 the rubber we passed the head of the water already 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.230
 through the hole 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.650
 The first thing that we are going to install in 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.590
 our plate on the right side we give 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.050
 the nut and we throw the two washers 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.020
 powerful 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.870
 a recommendation the position of this 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.310
 softened by here some small 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.980
 asymmetries of this space space 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.140
 shorter up that's why with me 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.200
 thus 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.459
 we put the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.910
 the platen we put the washer 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:03.640
 we screwed the plate 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.640
 we look for the nut the washer 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.730
 slightly loose additional attention 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.410
 in this case it is that it has the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.440
 particularity of doing this can be 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.560
 to enlarge 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.690
 lengthen and shorten the point where the water 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.360
 the fork is already there and the more 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.510
 long stay 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.020
 improves the lever and there is a little more 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.020
 smoothness 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.590
 the next process is the stage that 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.900
 goes in the fork in the previous model 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.700
 of the tournament and is fixed by one 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.730
 distance was much more practical just 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.360
 we put the nut here is the screw 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.210
 on the mobile and it moves on 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.320
 a sarria screw g 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.700
 we have to be very careful here of 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.700
 soon we put 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.110
 we apply here 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.230
 we keep a little bit pressed 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.120
 in this case the stainless washer the 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.830
 we stick with a little bit of glue 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.550
 instantaneous so that we can not be 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.290
 fall into the procedure 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.620
 let's push the rubber a little bit towards 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.620
 down 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.840
 and we know the twingo to you are a little 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.840
 uncomfortable just with a little patience 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.760
 for we are not going to notice the here in this 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.670
 process by 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.350
 but it is very simple there is one peace 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.570
 installed unlike the d 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.920
 of the 16-barrel trees has a 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.400
 little more room here then it is 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.330
 the function would be loosening a bit until 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.460
 to let us lengthen and cut 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.410
 lengthen and shorten 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.169
 the measure of those leads would be 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.550
 stop down and the 16 valves has 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.270
 about 5 millimeters 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.040
 forward and that increases us the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.500
 lever the tool that we're going to 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.920
 use the 14 mm 9 16 also 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.920
 apply 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.470
 and we started 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.470
 point 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.160
 We already said a bit of discomfort 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.290
 We will try to extend the most 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.290
 possible without us 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.700
 roll us down the platen to 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.700
 make the most of the long 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.280
 we are screwed the rubber a little 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.280
 uncomfortable 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.260
 because we are firm 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.020
 while you get a little annoyed if I go 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.020
 to remove the key 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.410
 here we are granting signatures 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.940
 here we have the long one when you're 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.040
 doing the installation personally 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.310
 can lengthen to 5 millimeters 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.070
 here do not stick the fan in this 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.250
 platinum we will work on the long 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.250
 maximum or a little less to take advantage 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.270
 that lever here would be the minimum lever 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.270
 the most 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.570
 why 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.230
 let's be firm 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.370
 we have installed the two bananas in 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:18.920
 stainless steel 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.460
 100% very resistant did not bend and did not 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.919
 part 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.550
 for the benefit to our foot 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:27.800
 left our knee 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.970
 and benefits of the clutch system not 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.970
 has no side effects 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.730
 we installed the guaya as we had already 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.680
 named in a previous video can 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.860
 remove either the rubber this from 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:47.860
 plastic this and apply thin oil or 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.860
 lubricant to improve softness 

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.840
 we place here 

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.630
 we installed the guaya 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.190
 through the new hole 

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.510
 we reached the top of the channel 

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.840
 we talked a little 

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.550
 there we have the water already installed
