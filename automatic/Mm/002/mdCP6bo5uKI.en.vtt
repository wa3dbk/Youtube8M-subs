solidly<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.620> he<00:03:09.370> was<00:03:09.579> just<00:03:09.609> like<00:03:10.139> foreign

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
solidly and he was just like foreign

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.629 
solidly and he was just like foreign
trances<00:03:12.120> away<00:03:13.120> really<00:03:13.359> he<00:03:14.109> did<00:03:14.410> quite<00:03:14.680> quite<00:03:15.609> a

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
trances away really he did quite quite a

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.420

around<00:03:18.489> my<00:03:18.880> defense<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.480> think<00:03:19.959> we<00:03:20.049> were

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
around my defense I think we were

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.990 
around my defense I think we were
playing<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.500> same<00:03:20.829> formation<00:03:21.280> I'm<00:03:21.790> not<00:03:21.940> sure

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
playing the same formation I'm not sure

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.900 
playing the same formation I'm not sure
if<00:03:22.209> he<00:03:22.269> was<00:03:22.359> playing<00:03:22.540> 5221<00:03:23.230> anyway<00:03:24.130> did<00:03:24.670> manage

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
if he was playing 5221 anyway did manage

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.910 
if he was playing 5221 anyway did manage
to<00:03:25.329> squeeze<00:03:25.660> in<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.019> head<00:03:26.200> up<00:03:26.319> with<00:03:26.410> any<00:03:26.620> load

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
to squeeze in the head up with any load

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.949 
to squeeze in the head up with any load
es<00:03:27.190> again<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.880> can't<00:03:28.359> even<00:03:28.450> remember<00:03:28.630> who<00:03:28.840> he

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
es again I can't even remember who he

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.569 
es again I can't even remember who he
outjumped<00:03:29.139> but<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.680> thought<00:03:29.919> it<00:03:30.010> was<00:03:30.069> just<00:03:30.280> fake

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
outjumped but I thought it was just fake

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.940 
outjumped but I thought it was just fake
and<00:03:31.000> I<00:03:31.090> was<00:03:31.239> absolutely<00:03:31.500> raging<00:03:32.500> at<00:03:32.859> this

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
and I was absolutely raging at this

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.400 
and I was absolutely raging at this
moment<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.340> time<00:03:33.389> anyway<00:03:34.389> going<00:03:34.690> up<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.230> other

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
moment in time anyway going up the other

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.370 
moment in time anyway going up the other
end<00:03:35.680> in<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.819> think<00:03:37.150> it's<00:03:37.329> in<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.599> second<00:03:38.230> half

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
end in I think it's in the second half

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.180 
end in I think it's in the second half
we<00:03:39.130> managed<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.760> get<00:03:40.510> another<00:03:41.319> goal<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.859> this

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
we managed to get another goal and this

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.490 
we managed to get another goal and this
goal<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.579> pretty<00:03:42.910> sick<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.480> be<00:03:43.599> honest<00:03:43.840> nice

dominated the game but yeah um he did
the<00:04:05.500> phone<00:04:05.680> pretty<00:04:05.859> well<00:04:06.190> and<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.880> was<00:04:07.060> just<00:04:07.239> a

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
the phone pretty well and it was just a

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.030 
the phone pretty well and it was just a
tough<00:04:07.569> game<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.989> fought<00:04:08.200> literally<00:04:08.590> every<00:04:08.829> time

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
tough game I fought literally every time

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.600 
tough game I fought literally every time
I<00:04:09.069> thought<00:04:09.310> he<00:04:09.459> was<00:04:09.549> going<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.760> score

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
I thought he was going to score

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.479 
I thought he was going to score
because<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.910> think<00:04:12.180> our<00:04:12.510> style<00:04:12.990> of<00:04:13.110> players

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
because I think our style of players

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.819 
because I think our style of players
somewhat<00:04:14.489> different<00:04:15.109> but<00:04:16.109> similar<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
somewhat different but similar in the

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.400 
somewhat different but similar in the
same<00:04:17.070> way<00:04:17.329> Bateson<00:04:18.329> did<00:04:18.570> defend<00:04:18.989> pretty<00:04:19.200> well

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
same way Bateson did defend pretty well

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.440 
same way Bateson did defend pretty well
I<00:04:19.590> was<00:04:19.709> rowing<00:04:19.919> also<00:04:20.430> sorts<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.030> things<00:04:21.209> and

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
I was rowing also sorts of things and

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.030 
I was rowing also sorts of things and
his<00:04:21.660> goalkeeper<00:04:22.109> was<00:04:22.290> being<00:04:22.470> pretty<00:04:22.650> fakes

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
his goalkeeper was being pretty fakes

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.670 
his goalkeeper was being pretty fakes
well<00:04:23.310> then<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.550> knew<00:04:23.820> he<00:04:23.970> hadn't<00:04:24.270> go<00:04:24.500> but<00:04:25.500> yeah

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
well then I knew he hadn't go but yeah

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.520 
well then I knew he hadn't go but yeah
by<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.550> way<00:04:26.669> this<00:04:27.600> out<00:04:27.870> time<00:04:28.110> cuz<00:04:28.290> I<00:04:28.350> didn't
