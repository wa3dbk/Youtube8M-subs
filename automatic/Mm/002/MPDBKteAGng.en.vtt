00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
not the greatest definitely but you'll

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.300 
not the greatest definitely but you'll
see<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> examine<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.380> gun<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.130> to

level up or one of the nodes and then

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.850 
level up or one of the nodes and then
you<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.240> embalming<00:01:24.750> orb<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> get

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860

you use the embalming orb that you get
from<00:01:26.520> Eris<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.240> you're<00:01:27.360> ranked<00:01:27.630> 3<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.350> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
takes forever to level her up so that's

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.960 
takes forever to level her up so that's
not<00:01:30.930> gonna<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> most<00:01:31.619> fun<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.790> gun
