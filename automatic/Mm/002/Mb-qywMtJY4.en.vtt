00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
remember it but four weeks ago when I

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.269 
remember it but four weeks ago when I
introduced<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.810> opening<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.410> mentioned<00:00:29.189> that

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
introduced this opening I mentioned that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.220 
introduced this opening I mentioned that
there<00:00:29.460> were<00:00:29.580> some<00:00:29.609> relations<00:00:30.420> after<00:00:30.630> blacks

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
there were some relations after blacks

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.160 
there were some relations after blacks
personal<00:00:31.800> c6<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.180> make<00:00:33.329> life<00:00:33.360> sober<00:00:33.870> for

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
personal c6 that can make life sober for

personal c6 that can make life sober for
white<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.940> variation<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:36.930> had<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.320> mind

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
white the variation I then had in mind

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.920 
white the variation I then had in mind
is<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.219> following<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.059> his<00:00:39.390> name<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.780> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
is the following one and his name is so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.860 
is the following one and his name is so
that<00:00:40.140> after<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.739> move<00:00:41.040> from<00:00:41.670> black<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.570> means

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that after this move from black it means

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.220 
that after this move from black it means
that<00:00:43.110> he<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.410> altered<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> b-pawn<00:00:44.789> and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
that he is altered to in the b-pawn and

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.510 
that he is altered to in the b-pawn and
actually<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.440> quite<00:00:46.620> hard<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.070> protect<00:00:47.340> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
actually it's quite hard to protect it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.299 
actually it's quite hard to protect it
as<00:00:47.640> white<00:00:47.969> white<00:00:48.960> second<00:00:49.500> move<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
as white white second move is the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.060 
as white white second move is the
obvious<00:00:50.820> Bishop<00:00:51.210> e2<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.840> thus<00:00:52.469> now<00:00:52.739> black

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
obvious Bishop e2 and thus now black

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.209 
obvious Bishop e2 and thus now black
places<00:00:53.610> special<00:00:54.090> move<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.980> black

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
places special move it's so that black

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.939 
places special move it's so that black
here<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.760> two<00:00:57.090> moves<00:00:57.390> choose<00:00:57.780> from<00:00:58.050> Queen<00:00:58.739> b6

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
here have two moves choose from Queen b6

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.930 
here have two moves choose from Queen b6
and<00:00:59.460> a5<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.020> Queen<00:01:01.350> b6<00:01:01.559> variation<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and a5 the Queen b6 variation was the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.479 
and a5 the Queen b6 variation was the
one<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.329> analyzed<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> first<00:01:04.350> episode<00:01:04.890> but

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
one we analyzed in the first episode but

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.550 
one we analyzed in the first episode but
if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.820> can't<00:01:06.060> remember<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.600> we'll<00:01:07.140> look<00:01:07.380> at

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
if you can't remember it we'll look at

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.160 
if you can't remember it we'll look at
it<00:01:07.680> again<00:01:07.850> its<00:01:08.850> name<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.450> white<00:01:09.810> guards

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
it again its name so that white guards

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.320 
it again its name so that white guards
is<00:01:10.320> pawn<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> most<00:01:11.250> interesting<00:01:11.970> manner

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
is pawn in the most interesting manner

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
is pawn in the most interesting manner
it<00:01:12.510> begins<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.409> playing<00:01:13.710> eight<00:01:13.920> three<00:01:14.220> black

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it begins with playing eight three black

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.240 
it begins with playing eight three black
is<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> fact<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> B<00:01:16.710> pawn<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
is here is the fact that the B pawn is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.490 
is here is the fact that the B pawn is
pinned<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.880> increases<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> pressure<00:01:19.140> by

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
pinned and increases the pressure by

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.190 
pinned and increases the pressure by
playing<00:01:19.770> a5<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.600> white<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
playing a5 but here white have a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.710 
playing a5 but here white have a
variation<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.580> save<00:01:23.850> him<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.570> loss

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
variation that can save him from a loss

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
variation that can save him from a loss
of<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> b-pawn<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.520> white<00:01:26.700> can

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
of the b-pawn because here white can

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.289 
of the b-pawn because here white can
play

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
play

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.080 
play
c4<00:01:27.829> one<00:01:28.829> might<00:01:29.070> think<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
c4 one might think that this is a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480 
c4 one might think that this is a
mistake<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> take<00:01:30.930> him<00:01:31.110> v4<00:01:31.590> since<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.280> looked

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
mistake to take him v4 since it's looked

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999 
mistake to take him v4 since it's looked
like<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> trap<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.390> kind<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.380> black

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
like a trap and it kind of is if black

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.249 
like a trap and it kind of is if black
takes<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> c5<00:01:35.970> after<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.810> white<00:01:36.990> play<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
takes and c5 after that white play this

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.160 
takes and c5 after that white play this
is<00:01:37.560> pawn<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:38.299> because<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.720> happens

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
is pawn there because if that happens

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.319 
is pawn there because if that happens
there<00:01:40.500> will<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.619> yet<00:01:41.009> another<00:01:41.130> capture<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.970> b4

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
there will be yet another capture and b4

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.810 
there will be yet another capture and b4
and<00:01:42.600> now<00:01:42.990> both<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> rook<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.770> a8<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
rook change on a1 the interesting

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.340 
rook change on a1 the interesting
continuation<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.630> after<00:02:07.140> black
