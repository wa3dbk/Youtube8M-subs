00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.940
 well and in addition to some affordable prices you heard division very much but if 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.070
 fears about the traditional only trail 90 ruffle in the first part of the 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.059
 program that good 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.400
 There is a new trend weapon currently with the issue of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.129
 but as we know 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.070
 and it is little because, concretely, it is always the pink and white that are the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.060
 pioneers let's say 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.970
 and the third which then began to cultivate the sale by 4% 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.189
 josé ramón why I say this plant is necessary queen 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.309
 I will need a lot of water or otherwise I do not need it sometimes 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.870
 I really like the strike but 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.490
 today in plant clashes at the time of abuse a lot of 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.060
 percent in aunts continued with a large substrate begin to catch disease 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.730
 so what we call a sect was fine if in a moment 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.050
 determined level of the week - avoid one of the risks worth 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.440
 so that's another thing I know it's true that the plant will start a little bit 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.880
 languished in the cinema is excited with the sheet a little less urgent than 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.600
 normal 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.230
 and in that moment it is when he received from hands of gold we will renew vale 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.680
 This means that if you abuse too much of the irrigation water 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.910
 the normal thing is that they take fonade 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.890
 e cristóbal while porongo at the root level 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.310
 this will rot and end in the death of the plant 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.580
 the plant itself they ask for it which needs to be irrigated if it received the hand 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.330
 he spent another twenty many times 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.320
 I do not fear that they suffer too much, we do not know that way 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.080
 and it's true that we can 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.670
 but it was a flower but it is a guarantee of 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.050
 durability over time therefore 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.320
 let's let's emphasize in that practice if we're going to take it a bit 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.900
 dry in a way that lasts long enough and does not affect a lot of diseases 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.910
 as fusarium 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.270
 whole families are expected to attack then it's a great level 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.260
 of your deal will be high 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260
 with the fertilization of sixth plant state 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.250
 bianco like 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.880
 or maybe we have commented did not hesitate in another program all the flowering plants 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.299
 We have been talking about his prostration for a month 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.320
 he needs to announce a fertilization will pass through this 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.420
 it means no 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.840
 we do not have nitrogen and phosphorus from the main elements 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.950
 you have to contribute all three but that percentage a little bit higher than 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.169
 occupation what does 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:16.609
 that the plant will bloom spectacularly then from here what 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.799
 we recommend the complex fertilizers typhoon infoca reads that contribute the 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.730
 main elements that already provides a micronutrient trace element and this 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.459
 will replenish the plant by a very long phrase from the moment of 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.560
 last international week acceptance that now in spring and summer the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.409
 substratum 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.479
 as it should be 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:40.179
 in the plant it adapts to a fringe dph curiously medium high that can be 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:44.349
 perfectly assemble php only up to eight units that means 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.029
 that the original calcareous terrain of that shape comes in handy for that one 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.009
 of the reasons why it was downloaded to our organization 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.379
 but good as the whole ornamental plant age him his strategy 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.659
 frank legal to say that it takes a bit of all sand and sausage 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.340
 i none let us play a little more component of seats a substrate 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.889
 frank sandy the one that has or can wealth organic matter model of league 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.629
 therefore I enjoy a lot 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.109
 It would be his current strategy, that is, at the level of 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.479
 from soil not to a plantation being demanding 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.479
 that's why he was forced 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.799
 I mentioned to facer a josé manuel bridge some illness or not 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.129
 as a cost close to diane kruger will have to be done more intensely on 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.899
 yes hamas 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:35.459
 and diseases that can be read in the extensive establishment according to a plant that 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.129
 that may be more interest on the same day of death the substrate 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.569
 g in this way will occur in leaf spots even some 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.859
 rot of the people can not stand said 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.970
 then the way to characterize is 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.370
 a maintenance mix when we've already talked about cultivation 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.150
 let's see his photos in the second the plant and has done together to treatments 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.009
 fungal preventives at the moment we see what 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.009
 there is a lot of activity to keep in mind that for the world the debt 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.539
 achieved four climatic and yale so that this can be 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.220
 blur quickly 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.439
 they are juliana relative high i united 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.900
 the high temperature therefore we are talking about 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.780
 when the sales to companies in full swing and we will have no choice but to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.379
 use fungicides 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.749
 was and finally explained frames is to say 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.829
 preventive full cover a little the range of possibilities of getting sick that 

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:29.460
 have 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.710
 in this case the vinca that is high if the conditions killed him 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:34.990
 this way you have 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.280
 in some questions about the type of fungicide used presented to 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.919
 prevent this list shifts disease after percent in the 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.750
 nursery you can explain verdasco perfectly involve everything about 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.090
 every plant that will take a thousand any doubt will be resolved of course only 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.220
 They know that our line of work and well we try to keep up on 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.569
 new civil matters 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.949
 war reports you have to tell people that they are changing 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.440
 definitely 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.930
 because samoa samoa european legislations 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.530
 and then they have written off a lot of material if they are not registering 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.069
 another new then very changing world and that also does not forget 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.999
 of 40 can be used and which can not 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.030
 We have learned a lot because I will not accept this plant 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.660
 Inca and we return next week talking about less to more flowering plants 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.660
 of art artists for the state thank you so much for joining us 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.669
 Tuesday more 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.110
 we 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.620
 in practical terms the point and end to this section flowers and raised
