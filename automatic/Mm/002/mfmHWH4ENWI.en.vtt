dad<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.780> was<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:57.990> own<00:01:58.110> person<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.890> there's<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
dad I was your own person but there's a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.350 
dad I was your own person but there's a
difference<00:01:59.430> between<00:01:59.670> doing<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.329> just

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
difference between doing that and just

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.969 
difference between doing that and just
doing<00:02:00.689> sums<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.110> attention<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.950> think

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
doing sums for attention and I think

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.889 
doing sums for attention and I think
what<00:02:02.399> she<00:02:02.430> did<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.939> stage<00:02:03.240> was<00:02:03.630> just

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
what she did on the stage was just

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.179 
what she did on the stage was just
basically<00:02:04.200> because<00:02:04.530> she<00:02:04.680> knew<00:02:04.829> people<00:02:04.860> would

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
basically because she knew people would

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.560 
basically because she knew people would
talk<00:02:05.369> about<00:02:05.430> her<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> think

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
talk about her I just kind of think

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.970 
talk about her I just kind of think
the<00:02:06.659> limit<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> think

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
the limit of what you can do and I think

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.410 
the limit of what you can do and I think
she<00:02:08.130> crossed<00:02:08.399> over<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.910> kind<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.119> like

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
she crossed over there kind of like

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.940 
she crossed over there kind of like
being<00:02:09.720> yourself<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.320> just<00:02:10.410> being<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.740> bit
