 Let's talk about hunger, a lot of people. 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.299
 asked about hunger 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.180
 As I said in the previous video you can 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.820
 eat a danone that I also mentioned 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.939
 you can eat gelatin I also 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.200
 I said okay to chew or betrays dem 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.000
 this is basically the same thing both 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.119
 The phases that I'm doing are the same. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 Let's go there first phase and go back to 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.229
 speak 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.270
 The attack phase you can not handle. 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.240
 no species whatsoever 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.850
 eat rice beans breads fruits vegetables and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.119
 vegetables and no soda that does not 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.930
 zero is not the light on 1 0 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.860
 It 's a coca has sprite It has several 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 options on the market is second phase 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.320
 cruise the only difference from one to the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.490
 another is that you can eat vegetables and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.640
 vegetables 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.600
 but there are some exceptions like the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.420
 cassava casserole potato 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.680
 the sweet potato is sound of these vegetables 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.039
 and others 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.370
 It is okay and asked me about the 12 kilograms 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.540
 I lost people 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.330
 from one body to the other is very 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.690
 different in several videos on the internet 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.659
 that people lost 14 and 15 in the month 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.099
 if you lost 5 such great people are not 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.049
 because I've lost 12 that you're going to have to 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.720
 lose 12 you 'll get mad because 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.730
 You did not lose 12 just like me, you? 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.620
 have to remember that the metabolism of a 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.640
 body different from the other 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.099
 It 's my facebook, like I already told you 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.610

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.940

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.190
 People are playing some little cards, are you? 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.450
 It's my email to anyone who has any 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.709
 doubt our cam skin 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.530
 but then we can change some 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.069

 're physical activity in the first phase is 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.319

 fourth for the rest of your life 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.430
 in the first phase are 20 minutes daily 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.049
 and on the second is 30 minutes elton 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.519
 second stage so I have to walk 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.900
 30 minutes 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.849
 're always 30 minutes or more never - okay 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.879
 in the first phase always 20 minutes or 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.769
 but never - there's no gym in the 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.090
 building goes on the street strolls in 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:43.519
 block and from there will do well to

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.669

 tÃ¡ water water is essential to take two 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.530
 liters of water per day 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.370
 do not forget the water because the water 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.310
 So it's important for you to help in the 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.099
 Your weight loss rate goes a lot more in 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.359
 bathroom and will do you good for you 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.099
 this diet is okay headache me 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.620
 ask about headache 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.070
 I had a lot of headaches in the five 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.419
 first days is in the first second 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.389
 or third party was much stronger 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.030
 migraine of those bravas of mourning 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.540
 but then it passed my is that so the 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.420
 body is adapting to its new 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.950
 food education then he is 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.410
 suffering a little because what you 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.770
 You ate, you 're not eating anymore. 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.970
 understood is you can eat or even an ox 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.440
 right meat fish and chicken 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.620
 the problem is the following you will feel 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.590
 lack of bread is from the pizza you buy 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.660
 At the pizzeria, you 'll finally miss it. 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.550
 those things that you always do and 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.470
 always did and I in my case I feel 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.330
 lacking in so much feijoada that I 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.490
 I love pizza, it's our coxinha with a 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.900
 I miss so many places that I wanted 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.630
 and I will not go any more 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.660
 so it's hard, but it's not 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.720
 impossible people are not impossible 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.980
 the nervous system 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.510
 the nervous system and anxiety system 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.700
 nervous for me so I 'm already a 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.460
 nervous person until a treatment is 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.980
 for that 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.050
 however, it increased greatly in the 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.470
 eleventh stage in the first week 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.730
 in the attack phase our same blow slap 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.670
 but it turned out so I ended up 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.210
 controlling is talking to a 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.820
 psychologist 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.270
 so improving I did not improve 100% 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.750
 of course, but so did the 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.420
 self esteem i 'm like this 10 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.760
 It should not even be because we 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.120
 personal problems such as 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:01.570
 Everyone is great, but I'm like this 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:04.700
 As my back told me, it suppresses anxiety. 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.310
 Only anxiety I am also very anxious 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.190
 I climb on the scales type 3 4 a 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.200
 day at the beginning to know our but had 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.210
 thin but now I have this weight 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.050
 but I had lost 100 grams 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.670
 increased 200 mec that is happening 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.370
 so stay in that neurosis that I did 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.390
 I weighed myself every morning in the 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.510
 first phase 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.420
 then in the second stage you lose weight 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.300
 kilo per week to what is not for 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.950
 week and I was watching like this was 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.390
 Wow, but never losing weight the same as 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.810
 this in the first phase and gives a 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.230
 discouraged but then you start to see the 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.290
 other 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.710
 things the pants falling without your pants 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.390
 all baggy shorts all lips and 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:51.320
 You start talking like this, it's working. 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:53.480
 Let's continue and so for me 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.670
 field recipe was great 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.730
 In the meantime, understand me then. 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.880
 my self esteem a lot and feel super 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.640
 happy right very happy weakness and dizziness 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.750
 ask me I did not have weakness 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.730
 I was dizzy 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:14.660
 goin to giving Pinel sum I did this 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:17.690
 reduction of the stomach eight years ago 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.390
 As I already told you here, it's e 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.860
 I had a lot of damping and I 'm going to tell you 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.980
 the truth since I started dieting 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.360
 I did not have any dumping I do not even know 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.510
 But what is this 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.570

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.680
 bad breath you too will have cinema 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:41.000
 mainly in the second phase 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:44.750
 Yeah, but just like the tooth we 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.040
