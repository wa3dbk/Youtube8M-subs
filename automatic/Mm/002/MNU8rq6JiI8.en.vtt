the bratwurst itself isn't that bad I
mean<00:00:55.690> it's<00:00:55.840> about<00:00:56.079> what<00:00:56.590> I<00:00:56.620> would<00:00:56.860> expect<00:00:57.340> for

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
mean it's about what I would expect for

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.440 
mean it's about what I would expect for
a<00:00:57.730> theme-park<00:00:58.500> bratwurst<00:00:59.500> I<00:01:00.310> would<00:01:00.970> never<00:01:01.180> go

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
a theme-park bratwurst I would never go

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.420 
a theme-park bratwurst I would never go
out<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.810> my<00:01:01.960> way<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.200> get<00:01:02.500> this<00:01:02.680> but<00:01:03.040> if<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.310> was

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
out of my way to get this but if I was

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.740 
out of my way to get this but if I was
gonna<00:01:03.550> jam<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.180> like<00:01:04.299> every<00:01:04.629> other

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
gonna jam and like every other

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.050 
gonna jam and like every other
restaurant<00:01:04.960> in<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.409> park<00:01:05.619> was<00:01:05.799> too<00:01:06.070> busy<00:01:06.250> then

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
restaurant in the park was too busy then

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.730 
restaurant in the park was too busy then
I<00:01:07.119> would<00:01:07.329> probably<00:01:07.509> go<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.930> jeweler<00:01:08.409> and

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
I would probably go to a jeweler and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.570 
I would probably go to a jeweler and
grab<00:01:09.130> me

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
grab me

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.610

in there I'm not a fan of sauerkraut at
all<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.470> tried<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.250> I<00:01:27.610> hated<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.090> this

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
all so I tried it and I hated it this

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.149 
all so I tried it and I hated it this
was<00:01:28.479> basically<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.960> little<00:01:29.320> cup<00:01:29.470> of<00:01:29.500> poison<00:01:30.010> to

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
was basically a little cup of poison to

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.430 
was basically a little cup of poison to
me<00:01:30.280> but<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.330> know<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.659> might<00:01:32.140> have<00:01:32.170> different

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
me but you know you might have different

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.770 
me but you know you might have different
results<00:01:32.979> now<00:01:33.909> originally<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.390> was<00:01:34.510> just<00:01:34.720> gonna

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
results now originally I was just gonna

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.420 
results now originally I was just gonna
try<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.140> bratwurst<00:01:35.590> but<00:01:35.890> since<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:36.190> was<00:01:36.310> there

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
try the bratwurst but since I was there

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.130 
try the bratwurst but since I was there
I<00:01:36.460> figured<00:01:36.729> I'd<00:01:36.970> try<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.270> other<00:01:37.510> two<00:01:37.930> things

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
I figured I'd try the other two things

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.870 
I figured I'd try the other two things
on<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.380> menu<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:39.010> these<00:01:39.130> are<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.369> pretzel

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
on the menu so these are the pretzel

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.219 
on the menu so these are the pretzel
bites<00:01:40.030> they<00:01:40.330> include<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.659> little<00:01:40.869> cup<00:01:41.110> of

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
bites they include a little cup of

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.570 
bites they include a little cup of
cheese<00:01:41.530> these<00:01:42.460> are<00:01:43.229> $4.99<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.500> bit<00:01:44.740> expensive

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
cheese these are $4.99 a bit expensive

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.430 
cheese these are $4.99 a bit expensive
I<00:01:45.630> enjoyed<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.720> pretzel<00:01:47.020> bites<00:01:47.140> they<00:01:47.350> were

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
I enjoyed the pretzel bites they were

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.800 
I enjoyed the pretzel bites they were
good<00:01:47.619> they<00:01:47.890> pretty<00:01:48.490> much<00:01:48.640> taste<00:01:49.299> exactly<00:01:49.510> like

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
good they pretty much taste exactly like

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.450 
good they pretty much taste exactly like
any<00:01:50.110> other<00:01:50.320> soft<00:01:50.799> pretzel<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.220> would<00:01:51.369> ever

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
any other soft pretzel you would ever

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.030 
any other soft pretzel you would ever
have<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.689> alternative<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.530> these<00:01:53.650> would

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
have so the alternative to these would

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.399 
have so the alternative to these would
be<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.490> regular<00:01:55.060> Mickey<00:01:55.479> pretzels<00:01:55.990> that<00:01:56.200> you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
be the regular Mickey pretzels that you

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.380
