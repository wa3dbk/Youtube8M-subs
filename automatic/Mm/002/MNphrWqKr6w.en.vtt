00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
gonna turn it on to the 1x scale which

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.120 
gonna turn it on to the 1x scale which
is<00:02:18.360> reading<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> 20<00:02:19.200> foot<00:02:19.380> scale<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:20.069> your

reading about 30 feet
these<00:02:43.170> fish<00:02:43.380> are<00:02:43.440> feeding<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.950> these<00:02:44.130> little

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
these fish are feeding on these little

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.370 
these fish are feeding on these little
truck<00:02:44.520> perch<00:02:44.760> down<00:02:45.030> there<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:45.720> we're<00:02:45.870> teaming

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
truck perch down there so we're teaming

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.530 
truck perch down there so we're teaming
up<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.650> minnow<00:02:47.030> we're<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.240> simply

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
up with a minnow we're just simply

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.330 
up with a minnow we're just simply
cooking<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.990> on<00:02:49.140> through<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.890> back<00:02:50.099> I'm

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
cooking it on through the back I'm

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.070 
cooking it on through the back I'm
letting<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> minnow<00:02:50.849> do<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> action<00:02:51.599> these

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
letting the minnow do the action these

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.690 
letting the minnow do the action these
fish<00:02:52.290> are<00:02:52.410> belching<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.040> minnow<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.550> that's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
fish are belching up minnow so that's

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.030 
fish are belching up minnow so that's
why<00:02:53.819> we're<00:02:53.940> efficient<00:02:54.180> with<00:02:54.270> minerals<00:02:54.630> today

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
why we're efficient with minerals today

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.440 
why we're efficient with minerals today
so<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.190> very<00:02:56.310> easy<00:02:56.459> that's<00:02:56.849> all<00:02:57.060> we're<00:02:57.209> doing

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
so it's very easy that's all we're doing

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.580 
so it's very easy that's all we're doing
is<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.540> hooking<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.319> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
is just hooking it on there like that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.220 
is just hooking it on there like that
and<00:02:58.770> dropping<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.190> down<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.670> then<00:03:00.390> big<00:03:00.990> perch

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
and dropping it down and then big perch

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.980 
and dropping it down and then big perch
are<00:03:01.440> coming<00:03:01.709> up<00:03:01.800> there<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.099> just<00:03:02.250> whack<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.610> it

sometimes they want a lot more action in

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.200 
sometimes they want a lot more action in
others<00:04:52.010> but<00:04:53.010> since<00:04:53.250> we're<00:04:53.400> using<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:54.000> whole

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
others but since we're using that whole

others but since we're using that whole
mineral<00:04:54.570> day<00:04:54.720> we're<00:04:55.260> kind<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.590> letting<00:04:55.830> them

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
mineral day we're kind of letting them

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.700 
mineral day we're kind of letting them
in<00:04:56.039> with<00:04:56.220> some<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.760> action<00:04:57.710> there's

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
in with some of the action there's

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:09.280 
in with some of the action there's
another<00:04:59.099> one

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.640 

you<00:05:10.290> know<00:05:10.350> much<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.860> much<00:05:11.250> nicer<00:05:11.460> perch<00:05:12.650> you

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
you know much a much nicer perch you

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.250 
you know much a much nicer perch you
know<00:05:13.770> probably<00:05:14.130> a<00:05:14.280> nine<00:05:14.490> inch<00:05:14.730> or<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.200> now<00:05:16.200> you

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
know probably a nine inch or so now you

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.110 
know probably a nine inch or so now you
see<00:05:16.470> we<00:05:16.590> have<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.830> gain<00:05:17.040> set<00:05:17.370> at<00:05:17.490> about<00:05:17.730> three

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
see we have the gain set at about three

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.810 
see we have the gain set at about three
seems<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.990> be<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.230> gain<00:05:19.470> we're<00:05:19.710> we're<00:05:20.430> using

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
seems to be the gain we're we're using

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.150 
seems to be the gain we're we're using
today<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:21.510> you'll<00:05:22.260> see<00:05:22.380> there<00:05:22.560> goes<00:05:22.710> my<00:05:22.920> hook

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
today and you'll see there goes my hook

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.210 
today and you'll see there goes my hook
down<00:05:23.340> towards<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.850> bottom<00:05:24.830> you<00:05:25.830> want<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.070> run

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
down towards the bottom you want to run

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.030 
down towards the bottom you want to run
the<00:05:26.370> dial<00:05:26.640> there<00:05:27.290> get<00:05:28.290> it<00:05:28.380> down<00:05:28.530> close<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:28.860> the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
the dial there get it down close to the

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.060 
the dial there get it down close to the
bottom<00:05:29.390> stop<00:05:30.390> it<00:05:30.540> up<00:05:30.600> above<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.990> bottom<00:05:31.380> but<00:05:32.040> a

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
bottom stop it up above the bottom but a

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.890 
bottom stop it up above the bottom but a
lot<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.400> times<00:05:32.610> for<00:05:32.760> fishing<00:05:33.030> these<00:05:33.150> perch<00:05:33.480> we

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
lot of times for fishing these perch we

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.720 
lot of times for fishing these perch we
need<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.230> fish<00:05:34.410> really<00:05:34.860> close<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.310> bottom

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
need to fish really close to the bottom

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.300 
need to fish really close to the bottom
so<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.330> lower<00:05:36.570> line<00:05:36.930> down<00:05:37.260> right<00:05:37.830> next<00:05:38.010> to<00:05:38.190> the

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
so the lower line down right next to the

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.130 
so the lower line down right next to the
bottom<00:05:38.700> and<00:05:39.420> you'll<00:05:39.600> see<00:05:39.780> that<00:05:39.900> it<00:05:39.990> gets

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
bottom and you'll see that it gets

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.190 
bottom and you'll see that it gets
rather<00:05:40.620> confusing<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.430> hard<00:05:41.640> to<00:05:41.820> see<00:05:42.200> exactly

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
rather confusing and hard to see exactly

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.300 
rather confusing and hard to see exactly
where<00:05:43.500> your<00:05:43.530> jig<00:05:44.370> is<00:05:44.580> that's<00:05:45.270> why<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:45.480> f18<00:05:46.380> was

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
where your jig is that's why the f18 was

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.340 
where your jig is that's why the f18 was
built<00:05:47.610> Vexilar<00:05:48.390> built<00:05:48.660> it<00:05:48.780> so<00:05:49.080> we<00:05:49.170> could<00:05:49.320> zoom

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
built Vexilar built it so we could zoom

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.310 
built Vexilar built it so we could zoom
in<00:05:49.830> on<00:05:49.980> the<00:05:50.100> bottom<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:51.000> AZ<00:05:51.180> mode<00:05:51.750> is<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.170> auto

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320
