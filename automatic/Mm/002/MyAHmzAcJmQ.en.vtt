00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and I think our intelligence community

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600 
and I think our intelligence community
especially<00:01:58.049> here<00:01:58.530> has<00:01:58.890> done<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> pretty<00:01:59.340> damn

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
especially here has done a pretty damn

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.459 
especially here has done a pretty damn
good<00:01:59.670> job<00:01:59.909> defending<00:02:00.540> us<00:02:00.750> against<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> bad

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
good job defending us against the bad

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.920 
good job defending us against the bad
guys<00:02:01.740> especially<00:02:02.280> since<00:02:02.790> 911<00:02:03.360> yes<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.869> do

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
guys especially since 911 yes and I do

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.179 
guys especially since 911 yes and I do
think<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.290> that's<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.740> comes<00:02:04.860> down<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
think that that's what it comes down to

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.709 
think that that's what it comes down to
but<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.090> careful<00:02:06.299> not

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
but I think you have to be careful not

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
but I think you have to be careful not
to<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.439> group<00:02:07.649> everybody<00:02:07.920> together<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.459> say
