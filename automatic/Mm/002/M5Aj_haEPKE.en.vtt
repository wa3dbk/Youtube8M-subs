 the box we are all classic with 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.200
 up to a small indication up to 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.960
 right particular the effect that messi offers 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.120
 the x game pict caster so for six 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.260

 stream and online games here 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.470
 so now what I propose to you 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.860
 on a past directly to the opening 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.860
 of the box 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.739
 so here's after the dams whose 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:59.310
 box provided with so a hollow 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.090
 opening we're going to have the loader so 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.090
 classic connectors 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:11.490
 the second part here the taking 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:17.690
 Then we will have the notebook of guys 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:25.070
 whole but if the user kit 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:27.119
 but if the cd so to all drivers 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.300
 to start the machine 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:36.350
 correctly but then 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.900
 a little of the clothiers who are you 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.040
 to show you how 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.980
 plug in how to get it started 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.570
 it's dawn after that I'm you 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.960
 proposes is to spend two years 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.360
 now at the machine for the yard 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.450
 back we will find the logo msi 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.890
 so right here we'll see just 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.490
 right here 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:06.680
 a hatch at the level of motivation 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.810
 to air the product right here again 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.710
 traps that will allow stopping 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.170
 maximum laherrère the products here so 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.840
 seen the foot so if you get up you go 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.860
 to be able to appear on vices 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.090
 power -delit is so the master 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.070
 bézard hanging on the wall 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.070
 so that's going to be 100 standard by 100 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.820
 then what I propose is that we are going 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 switch to connectivity so concerning 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.950
 connectivity we will have a 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.650
 obviously a take vga the socket for 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.920
 me at the food or the voice hd 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:48.010
 mini hdmi to 8 3 usb ports 3 the port 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.080
 ethernet so quillan that will allow 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.830
 to prioritize the flow according to 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.710
 use 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.780
 and then the headphone jack and the jack 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.680
 micro as you could see it 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.450
 you have two hdmi + 1 vga who will you 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.820
 allow to use an exciting match to 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.850
 know using three screens two 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.530
 screens priest screen jo limon here we are 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.300
 let's go to the slices now 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.860
 ie the sides of the wick 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.880
 concerning side connectors 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.680
 so have the ignition button the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.630
 source button so to change the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.130
 video modes the menu button the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.490
 volume buttons 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:32.320

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.090
 2 usb card reader 2 with 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.060
 especially this one that will serve also 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.150
 to super load here we are going to spend 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.650
 on the other side we proceeded so 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.650
 at the ignition of the machine 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.680
 so a little reminder so brief of 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.590
 characteristics and spectators of the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.130
 machine of which we know 21 inches 5 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.370
 so full hd math in touch or not 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:22.270
 touch according to the versions 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.640
 we will have a core i5 4200 h 8 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.840
 gigas of ram a hard disk 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.720
 a gtx 860 and will be able to represent with 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.610
 or no bone so now what you 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.100
 propose if you show a feature my 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.130
 particular of the machine to know the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.620
 matri display so we connected two 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.340
 screens on this screen show you a little 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.260
 little the possibilities of the rhythm so 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.620
 here is an example of using the matrix 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.720
 display you can of course I have 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.660
