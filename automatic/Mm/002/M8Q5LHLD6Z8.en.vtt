let's look at a tip for editing

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.260 
let's look at a tip for editing
components<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.330> groups<00:00:19.369> these<00:00:20.369> beams<00:00:20.789> are

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
components and groups these beams are

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.320 
components and groups these beams are
all<00:00:21.539> components<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.699> they're<00:00:23.699> embedded

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
all components and they're embedded

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.480 
all components and they're embedded
within<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.230> building<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.220> I'm<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.460> to
