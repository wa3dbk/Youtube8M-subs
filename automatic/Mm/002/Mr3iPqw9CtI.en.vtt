00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
it's dead here I don't know if the hair

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.660 
it's dead here I don't know if the hair
is<00:03:31.170> old<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.130> don't<00:03:32.280> know<00:03:32.340> what<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.550> is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
is old and I just don't know what it is

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.400 
is old and I just don't know what it is
but<00:03:32.820> I've<00:03:33.300> been<00:03:33.450> losing<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.780> lot<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.019> here<00:03:34.140> every

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
but I've been losing a lot of here every

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.740 
but I've been losing a lot of here every
week<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.489> much<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.330> like<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.570> said

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
week about this much and like I said

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.030 
week about this much and like I said
it's<00:03:36.930> dense<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:39.350> yeah<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.620> that's<00:03:40.739> how<00:03:40.920> much

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
it's dense and yeah so that's how much

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.650 
it's dense and yeah so that's how much
I've<00:03:41.160> been<00:03:41.310> losing<00:03:41.640> as<00:03:42.120> far<00:03:42.330> as<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> actual

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
I've been losing as far as the actual

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.870 
I've been losing as far as the actual
look<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.260> my<00:03:43.500> hair<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:44.010> do<00:03:44.100> see<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.670> it's

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
look of my hair I do see that it's

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.180 
look of my hair I do see that it's
growing<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.780> said<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.230> concern<00:03:46.620> is

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
growing but like I said the concern is

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.120 
growing but like I said the concern is
that<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.549> hair<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.790> thinner<00:03:48.209> but<00:03:48.920> I'll<00:03:49.920> only

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
that the hair is thinner but I'll only

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.009 
that the hair is thinner but I'll only
see<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.700> once<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.090> hair<00:03:51.299> straightened<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
see that once the hair straightened and

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.570 
see that once the hair straightened and
I'm<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.470> straightening<00:03:52.739> for<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.100> few<00:03:53.370> more

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
I'm not straightening for a few more

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.140 
I'm not straightening for a few more
months<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.080> still<00:03:55.670> what's<00:03:56.670> going<00:03:57.000> on

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
months so this is still what's going on

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.289 
months so this is still what's going on
I<00:03:57.390> feel<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.660> it's<00:03:57.989> thick<00:03:58.320> still<00:03:58.970> not<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.150> much

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
I feel like it's thick still not so much

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.610 
I feel like it's thick still not so much
to<00:04:00.480> work<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.750> end<00:04:00.930> but<00:04:01.080> it's<00:04:01.200> still<00:04:01.320> pretty

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
to work the end but it's still pretty

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.350 
to work the end but it's still pretty
thick<00:04:01.920> and

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.550 

this<00:04:07.170> is<00:04:07.380> pretty<00:04:07.710> much<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:10.410> only

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
this is pretty much it and the only

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.560 
this is pretty much it and the only
thing<00:04:10.800> I<00:04:10.890> did<00:04:11.100> different<00:04:11.520> was<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.790> put<00:04:12.060> in<00:04:12.300> a

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
thing I did different was I put in a

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.600 
thing I did different was I put in a
treatment<00:04:13.200> that's<00:04:13.950> one<00:04:14.130> thing<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.400> did

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
treatment that's one thing I did

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.350 
treatment that's one thing I did
differently

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
differently

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.900 
differently
the<00:04:15.780> treatment<00:04:16.260> was<00:04:16.470> from<00:04:16.859> cream<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.519> nature

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
the treatment was from cream of nature

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.259 
the treatment was from cream of nature
and<00:04:18.829> I<00:04:19.829> put<00:04:20.070> two<00:04:20.250> packets<00:04:20.640> of<00:04:20.790> that<00:04:20.970> treatment

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
and I put two packets of that treatment

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.470 
and I put two packets of that treatment
in<00:04:21.540> my<00:04:21.720> hair<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.170> think<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:23.130> liked<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.790> mean<00:04:24.120> I

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
in my hair I think I liked it I mean I

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.240 
in my hair I think I liked it I mean I
wouldn't<00:04:24.930> buy<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.140> again<00:04:25.380> when<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.920> because<00:04:26.160> I

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
wouldn't buy it again when you because I

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.610 
wouldn't buy it again when you because I
didn't<00:04:26.460> notice<00:04:26.700> anything<00:04:26.970> too<00:04:27.300> drastic<00:04:27.540> but<00:04:28.440> I

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
didn't notice anything too drastic but I

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.380 
didn't notice anything too drastic but I
think<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.100> I<00:04:29.190> noticed<00:04:29.580> something<00:04:29.760> different

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
think that I noticed something different

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.760 
think that I noticed something different
like<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.630> think<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:31.020> my<00:04:31.140> hair<00:04:31.350> was<00:04:31.470> quite

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
like I think that my hair was quite

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.160 
like I think that my hair was quite
manageable<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.360> know<00:04:33.450> maybe<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.930> would

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
manageable so you know maybe it would

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.590 
manageable so you know maybe it would
buy<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.410> again<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.890> can't<00:04:35.190> say<00:04:35.370> for<00:04:35.520> sure<00:04:35.580> but<00:04:36.060> it

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
buy it again I can't say for sure but it

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.690 
buy it again I can't say for sure but it
was<00:04:36.720> about<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:36.990> dollar<00:04:37.260> 89<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.860> packs<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.400> I

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
was about a dollar 89 in packs so I

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.070 
was about a dollar 89 in packs so I
spent<00:04:39.210> about<00:04:39.300> 4<00:04:39.660> bucks

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
spent about 4 bucks

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.550 
spent about 4 bucks
for<00:04:40.710> treatment<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:41.910> I<00:04:42.720> have<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.080> package<00:04:43.260> I'm

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
can see the jump I saw that you guys

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.900 
can see the jump I saw that you guys
could<00:05:23.680> see<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:23.950> end<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.460> hair<00:05:24.670> I<00:05:24.700> don't

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
for sure I'm still gonna wait on that as

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.720 
for sure I'm still gonna wait on that as
far<00:05:45.870> as<00:05:45.960> stretching<00:05:46.290> it<00:05:46.560> out<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:46.980> pulling<00:05:47.520> it

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
far as stretching it out and pulling it

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.930

a<00:05:47.850> little<00:05:48.090> bit<00:05:48.210> longer<00:05:52.100> this<00:05:53.100> is<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.670> length

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
a little bit longer this is the length
