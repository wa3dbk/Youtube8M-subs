believe is an industry leader we've got
the<00:00:45.350> progressive<00:00:46.350> suspension<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the progressive suspension so that the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.799 
the progressive suspension so that the

with a standard glovebox now in the back

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.730 
with a standard glovebox now in the back
we've<00:01:25.500> got<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.810> 900<00:01:27.810> our<00:01:28.080> engine<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.530> engine

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
we've got the 900 our engine this engine

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.170 
we've got the 900 our engine this engine
on<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.130> particular<00:01:29.400> machine<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:29.820> been

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
on this particular machine has been

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.359 
on this particular machine has been
moved<00:01:30.479> back<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:31.170> from<00:01:31.530> under<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> seats<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
moved back out from under the seats and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520 
moved back out from under the seats and
that<00:01:32.759> reduces<00:01:33.299> any<00:01:33.479> type<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.960> heat<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.320> noise

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that reduces any type of heat and noise

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.130 
that reduces any type of heat and noise
inside<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.340> cab<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.299> if<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> cab

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
inside the cab so if you do do a cab

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
inside the cab so if you do do a cab
system<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.890> some<00:01:38.100> accessory<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.670> machine

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
system or do some accessory this machine

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.330 
system or do some accessory this machine
with<00:01:39.329> front<00:01:39.600> rear<00:01:39.750> windows<00:01:40.049> tops<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.890> keeps<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
with front rear windows tops it keeps it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
with front rear windows tops it keeps it
quiet<00:01:41.549> inside<00:01:42.090> also<00:01:42.689> keeps<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.140> heat<00:01:43.350> out

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
quiet inside also keeps the heat out

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
quiet inside also keeps the heat out
plus<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.149> great<00:01:45.450> extremes<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.140> build

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
plus is going to great extremes to build

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
plus is going to great extremes to build
