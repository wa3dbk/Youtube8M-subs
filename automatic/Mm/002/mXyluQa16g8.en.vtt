00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.209
 The pruning is one of the big ones 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.410
 Work tips in viticulture beside the folder 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:18.810
 in summer and vintage in autumn 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.510
 within the three months everyone has to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.210
 Vine cut dug and bent 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.789
 before the new gears start 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.470
 to grow 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.690
 with the pruning is from the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.940
 hibernation the rain started from circa 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.760
 middle of november when the first frost is here 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.800
 was with the conventional pruning 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.579
 will be available one or two companies 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 calmly 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.199
 which will later be weighed out 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 grow this so-called castle vine 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.370
 then new shoots in the spring with the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.579
 later grapes per running meter 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.129
 You can leave about ten to twelve 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.239
 eyes stand out of those later the shoots 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 to grow with the grapes 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.090
 so i have the guarantee for a good one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.649
 print quality with this electric scissors 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.579
 Nowadays, most wines become wine 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.689
 cut both 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.789
 if you think about it in the medium safe 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.280
 5000 pieces per hectare stand are yes 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.859
 already some cuts needed and around the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.950
 to relieve the hand is one big 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:24.950
 Help 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.570
 This hand scissors were formerly the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.030
 cut vineyards 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.439
 Today they are still used around the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.439
 to cut out cut wood 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.969
 the working process of the rating in the 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.950
 usually the first two will be split 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.679
 vines cut and then 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.499
 Dug on the ground where they are 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:54.869
 then be changed if you do not 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:57.179
 the stock would cut 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.939
 grow uncontrollably that means mine 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.340
 stock construction was lost and I would have 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.429
 a large amount of grapes with inferior 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.429
 quality 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.470
 when we have finished in rhede cut 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.760
 the next work is on the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.560
 bend and tie the talk with the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.450
 we try to grow the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.450
 to lead vines in a regulated pathways 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:35.340
 the vines become flat or over one 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:37.319
 half arch attached to wire earlier 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.629
 These wires were used for bending 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.040
 today take these semi-automatic ways 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:53.610
 pliers which work considerably 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:55.530
 simplifies the pruning and that 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.360
 bend prepare the rebstock on the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.360
 imminent vegetation period 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.219
 we get an optimal stock 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.900
 Construction of the yield can already be early 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.969
 growth stage 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.680
 I do all this with the goal in the 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.680
 autumn good quality grapes to harvest
