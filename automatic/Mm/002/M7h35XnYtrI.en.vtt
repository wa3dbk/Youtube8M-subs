got a couple digestive enzymes to help

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.310 
got a couple digestive enzymes to help
you<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.270> break<00:01:42.479> everything<00:01:42.750> down<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you know break everything down so you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.730 
you know break everything down so you
can<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.799> your<00:01:43.890> muscles<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:48.740> that's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
can get to your muscles and that's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.030 
can get to your muscles and that's
pretty<00:01:49.950> much<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:51.259> serving<00:01:52.259> size<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.710> scoop

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
pretty much it serving size one scoop

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
pretty much it serving size one scoop
there's<00:01:53.640> fifty<00:01:54.180> four<00:01:54.390> scoops<00:01:54.659> per<00:01:54.960> container

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
there's fifty four scoops per container

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.700 
there's fifty four scoops per container
it's<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> four<00:01:55.860> pound<00:01:56.100> tub<00:01:57.049> or<00:01:58.049> four<00:01:58.320> point

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
it's a four pound tub or four point

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.219 
it's a four pound tub or four point
something<00:01:59.840> four<00:02:00.840> pounds<00:02:02.360> 120<00:02:03.360> calories<00:02:03.750> per

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
something four pounds 120 calories per

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.240 
something four pounds 120 calories per
scoop<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:05.969> right<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.240> par<00:02:06.600> with

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
scoop that's you know right on par with

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.999 
scoop that's you know right on par with
most<00:02:08.250> other<00:02:08.489> proteins<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.300> pretty<00:02:09.569> low

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
most other proteins that's pretty low

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.990 
most other proteins that's pretty low
two<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> half<00:02:11.280> grams<00:02:11.520> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
two and a half grams of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.070 
two and a half grams of
and<00:02:12.720> 24<00:02:13.350> grams<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.740> protein<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.100> that's<00:02:14.460> good

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
and 24 grams of protein so that's good

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.960 
and 24 grams of protein so that's good
sometimes<00:02:16.080> proteins<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.280> just<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.580> 20

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
sometimes proteins that just have 20

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.640 
sometimes proteins that just have 20
grams<00:02:18.240> per<00:02:18.540> serving<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.470> 24<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.370> pretty<00:02:20.610> solid

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
grams per serving but 24 is pretty solid

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.280 
grams per serving but 24 is pretty solid
so<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.270> get<00:02:24.980> four<00:02:25.980> pound<00:02:26.190> tub<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.550> this

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
so you can get four pound tub like this

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.620 
so you can get four pound tub like this
roughly<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:28.350> average<00:02:28.920> price<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.430> about<00:02:29.630> $39.99

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
roughly do average price is about $39.99

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.180 
roughly do average price is about $39.99
40<00:02:31.080> bucks<00:02:31.290> which<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.400> pretty<00:02:32.610> decent<00:02:34.070> might<00:02:35.070> be

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
40 bucks which is pretty decent might be

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.060 
40 bucks which is pretty decent might be
a<00:02:35.220> little<00:02:35.430> bit<00:02:35.700> higher<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:37.290> I'm<00:02:37.920> also

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
a little bit higher but I'm also

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.180
