00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 hello welcome to disabled 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.820
 barrier-free what you get on the rehacare 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.920
 2014 finally exhausted here 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.019
 proactively times just to look over first 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.690
 times good morning good morning mountain 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.520
 it was the hell going on the last days 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.109
 that must say the saturday morning the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.150
 gates open we have to enter here 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 Gave a little gas recently 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.760
 reported about the trial of view and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 Now I have a huge rush 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 traveler full imagine now before 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.660
 we have the best 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.329
 Frame geometry from the woman julie now 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.360
 taken to the simplified line 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.140
 this means simple for the customers 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.879
 Customize shortened delivery times easily 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.680
 well we presented quite new 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.460
 get in on more tables already 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.489
 on road 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 he is available now so that is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.789
 of course, what are important to us 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.160
 since this part he sees now 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.469
 visually a bit similar will be on 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.340
 for you but you have to explain us because 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.410
 There are really a few here 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.799
 highlights must necessarily show subject 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.950
 we have completely new this carbon 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.150
 Side panel in the eu line is full 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.799
 Carbon very stable and above all things 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.290
 profession great in winter good 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.750
 heat insulation simply recommended 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.479
 So it's not just about lightweight construction 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 but it also has these factors like 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.140
 totally fun more equipment when we were at 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.990
 side part when it is always cold and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.150
 and and ok estimated an optical 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.880
 change but looks very chic but 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.200
 you did even more when new 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.540
 apron built on it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.740
 we also have a few technical ones 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.640
 change details 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.140
 I would like to show that carriage 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.899
 once you see the details as always 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.700
 in the hidden 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.220
 we have the recording from here 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.590
 side part completely revised and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.079
 can now now the side part 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 adjust if it is easy to solve 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.140
 or whether it should be bombproof easy 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.000
 change with a few hand movements and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 set to the desired size 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.810
 and now on the frame that's one 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.439
 important thing on the frame 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.340
 changed 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.400
 in the v li na 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.890
 we have the proven v form the the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.870
 shown here or just when the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.599
 frame tubes just go down 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.190
 as g shape with the proven knee angle 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.530
 from 105 degrees 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.049
 that is essentially the the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.900
 frame parameters now also in the evo 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.120
 line available brand new at proactive 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.920
 yes and then I counted the tip 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.650
 point imagination there you have too 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.470
 what changed yes we can now 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.510
 completely without completely new things 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.390
 order adjust the tilt 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.720
 we see the proven traveler here 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.880
 folding mechanism now also in the eu line 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.519
 with the new pages 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.430
 that is when I adjust the tilt 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.200
 I wander around with the rat plate 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.870
 driving behavior of the wheelchair too 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.180
 can influence and then just here for 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.280
 the case mechanism simply the pipe 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.340
 then introduce with few 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.849
 Hand-made that is brand new that 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.209
 adjustable middle part now also in 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.549
 the traveler evo line so birk first time 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.560
 great information great changes 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.079
 I've done it proactively 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.440
 you really have to say so come 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.579
 over at pro actively informs you 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.200
 Of course you can also buy sanitary houses 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.530
 help the school on the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.530
 market to malta and willi and berg
