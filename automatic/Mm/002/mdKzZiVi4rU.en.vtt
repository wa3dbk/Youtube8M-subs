we<00:00:33.020> all<00:00:33.050> know<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.440> earth<00:00:33.559> is<00:00:33.710> hollow<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.420> down

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
we all know the earth is hollow and down

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.630 
we all know the earth is hollow and down
there<00:00:35.600> Dewey's<00:00:35.930> enormous<00:00:36.320> caves<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.920> in

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
there Dewey's enormous caves and in

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.950 
there Dewey's enormous caves and in
these<00:00:37.760> caves<00:00:37.970> it's<00:00:38.120> not<00:00:38.270> dark<00:00:38.540> actually

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
these caves it's not dark actually

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.240 
these caves it's not dark actually
because<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:39.320> crust<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.739> earth<00:00:39.829> kind<00:00:40.130> of

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
because the crust of the earth kind of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.010 
because the crust of the earth kind of
pushes<00:00:40.640> down<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.239> pressure<00:00:41.570> makes<00:00:41.870> the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
pushes down and the pressure makes the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.230 
pushes down and the pressure makes the
air<00:00:42.170> fluoresce<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:42.830> by<00:00:43.460> that<00:00:43.640> fluorescent<00:00:44.150> a

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
air fluoresce and by that fluorescent a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.210 
air fluoresce and by that fluorescent a
you<00:00:44.300> can<00:00:44.570> see<00:00:44.690> these<00:00:44.810> enormous<00:00:45.230> oceans<00:00:45.650> and<00:00:46.100> as

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
you can see these enormous oceans and as

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.410 
you can see these enormous oceans and as
all<00:00:46.340> of<00:00:46.430> these<00:00:46.520> oceans<00:00:46.790> these<00:00:46.940> mushrooms

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
all of these oceans these mushrooms

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.870 
all of these oceans these mushrooms
which<00:00:47.540> are<00:00:47.690> 50<00:00:47.960> or<00:00:48.020> 60<00:00:48.350> feet<00:00:48.500> tall<00:00:48.880> that's

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
which are 50 or 60 feet tall that's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.010 
which are 50 or 60 feet tall that's
science<00:00:50.210> fiction<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:51.350> there's<00:00:51.590> some<00:00:51.920> factual

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
science fiction but there's some factual

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.970 
science fiction but there's some factual
speculation<00:00:54.020> that<00:00:54.200> there<00:00:54.320> is<00:00:54.500> life<00:00:54.710> down

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
speculation that there is life down

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.470 
speculation that there is life down
there<00:00:55.130> and<00:00:55.280> that's<00:00:55.460> what's<00:00:55.670> generates<00:00:56.090> fossil

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
there and that's what's generates fossil

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.110 
there and that's what's generates fossil
fuels<00:00:56.750> not<00:00:57.620> lossy<00:00:58.340> compressed<00:00:58.700> jungles<00:00:59.060> a

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
fuels not lossy compressed jungles a

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.090 
fuels not lossy compressed jungles a
billion<00:00:59.420> years<00:00:59.510> old<00:00:59.780> at<00:00:59.900> all<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:00.710> kind<00:01:01.010> of

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
billion years old at all so I kind of

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.590 
billion years old at all so I kind of
like<00:01:01.280> science<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:02.000> sounds<00:01:02.270> like<00:01:02.420> science

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
like science that sounds like science

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.719 
like science that sounds like science
fiction<00:01:02.780> another<00:01:03.530> example<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:04.100> at<00:01:04.280> second

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
fiction another example is at second

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.580 
fiction another example is at second
moon<00:01:04.850> with<00:01:05.239> me<00:01:05.420> which<00:01:05.930> doesn't<00:01:06.259> orbit<00:01:06.500> the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
moon with me which doesn't orbit the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.260 
moon with me which doesn't orbit the
Earth<00:01:06.680> orbits<00:01:07.040> are<00:01:07.280> kind<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.549> balance<00:01:07.939> point

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
Earth orbits are kind of a balance point

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.120 
Earth orbits are kind of a balance point
between<00:01:08.329> Europe<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.110> Sun<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:09.920> has<00:01:10.040> an

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
between Europe and the Sun and so has an

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.609 
between Europe and the Sun and so has an
orbit<00:01:10.549> kind<00:01:10.820> of<00:01:10.939> shaped<00:01:11.180> like<00:01:11.329> a<00:01:11.360> kidney<00:01:11.780> which

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
orbit kind of shaped like a kidney which

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.700 
orbit kind of shaped like a kidney which
just<00:01:12.860> nice<00:01:13.040> because<00:01:13.250> it's<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.430> cool<00:01:13.610> shape<00:01:14.710> I'm

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
just nice because it's a cool shape I'm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.350 
just nice because it's a cool shape I'm
also<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.190> fan<00:01:16.400> as<00:01:16.610> well<00:01:16.670> as<00:01:16.970> science<00:01:17.270> that

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
also a fan as well as science that

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.820 
also a fan as well as science that
sounds<00:01:17.540> like<00:01:17.659> science<00:01:17.810> fiction<00:01:17.990> of<00:01:18.440> moving

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
sounds like science fiction of moving

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.370 
sounds like science fiction of moving
cities<00:01:19.159> so<00:01:20.120> I<00:01:20.150> like<00:01:20.390> Kim<00:01:20.570> Stanley<00:01:20.840> Robinson<00:01:20.930> s

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
cities so I like Kim Stanley Robinson s

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.200

on<00:01:23.330> giant<00:01:23.720> train<00:01:23.990> tracks<00:01:24.260> which<00:01:24.979> heat<00:01:25.250> up<00:01:25.430> as

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
on giant train tracks which heat up as

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.969 
on giant train tracks which heat up as
the<00:01:25.700> sun<00:01:25.909> goes<00:01:25.940> around<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:26.450> planet<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.590> as

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
the sun goes around the planet and as

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.620 
the sun goes around the planet and as
they<00:01:28.130> heat<00:01:28.370> they<00:01:28.520> expand<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.120> that<00:01:29.210> pushes

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
they heat they expand and that pushes

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.480 
they heat they expand and that pushes
the<00:01:29.780> city<00:01:29.990> onward<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:30.799> onward<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.370> onward

the city onward and onward and onward

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.240 
the city onward and onward and onward
round<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.210> round<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.479> equator<00:01:33.250> another

round and round the equator another
moving<00:01:34.520> city<00:01:34.909> I<00:01:34.940> like<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:36.110> I've<00:01:36.229> heard<00:01:36.409> about

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
moving city I like that I've heard about

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.310 
moving city I like that I've heard about
is<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:36.860> birdhouse<00:01:37.400> r<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:38.750> birdhouse<00:01:39.020> has

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
is a birdhouse r and this birdhouse has

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.510 
is a birdhouse r and this birdhouse has
actually<00:01:39.560> meant<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.830> walk<00:01:39.979> around<00:01:40.159> because

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
actually meant to walk around because

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.250 
actually meant to walk around because
when<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.820> birds<00:01:41.030> land<00:01:41.330> on<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.510> struts<00:01:41.840> inside

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
when the birds land on the struts inside

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.070 
when the birds land on the struts inside
it<00:01:43.130> mechanically<00:01:43.970> pushes<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.720> building

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
it mechanically pushes the building

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.840 
it mechanically pushes the building
forwards<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.159> roams<00:01:46.460> around<00:01:46.640> the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
forwards so it roams around the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.940 
forwards so it roams around the
landscape<00:01:47.030> like<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.390> giant<00:01:47.690> robot<00:01:48.110> now<00:01:48.799> there's

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
landscape like a giant robot now there's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.950 
landscape like a giant robot now there's
actually<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> viewer<00:01:49.850> at<00:01:50.030> London<00:01:50.390> Zoo<00:01:50.420> which

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
actually a viewer at London Zoo which

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.690 
actually a viewer at London Zoo which
which<00:01:51.409> which<00:01:51.440> is<00:01:51.740> based<00:01:52.100> on<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:52.610> it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
which which is based on this but it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.880 
which which is based on this but it
doesn't<00:01:52.970> walk<00:01:53.150> around<00:01:53.420> I'm<00:01:53.659> afraid<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:54.140> was

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
doesn't walk around I'm afraid I was

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.500 
doesn't walk around I'm afraid I was
talking<00:01:55.159> about<00:01:55.189> mercury<00:01:55.670> just<00:01:55.880> now<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:56.180> mean

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
talking about mercury just now I mean

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.030 
talking about mercury just now I mean
the<00:01:56.600> really<00:01:56.810> neat<00:01:57.020> thing<00:01:57.200> about<00:01:57.290> mercury<00:01:57.830> is

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
the really neat thing about mercury is

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.830 
the really neat thing about mercury is
that<00:01:58.340> its<00:01:58.549> orbit<00:01:58.939> doesn't<00:01:59.240> debate<00:01:59.479> Newton's

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
that its orbit doesn't debate Newton's

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.740 
that its orbit doesn't debate Newton's
laws<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.680> gravitation<00:02:01.119> in<00:02:02.119> fact<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.570> wasn't

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
laws of gravitation in fact it wasn't

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.780 
laws of gravitation in fact it wasn't
until<00:02:03.020> Einstein<00:02:03.619> came<00:02:04.100> along<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:04.460> general

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
until Einstein came along this general

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.060 
until Einstein came along this general
relativity<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:06.380> found<00:02:06.619> out<00:02:06.799> why<00:02:07.009> do

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
relativity that we found out why do

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.859 
relativity that we found out why do
orbit<00:02:07.400> work<00:02:07.549> like<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:07.850> did<00:02:07.939> at<00:02:08.030> all<00:02:08.179> before

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
orbit work like it did at all before

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.359 
orbit work like it did at all before
that<00:02:09.170> people<00:02:09.470> speculated<00:02:09.950> there's<00:02:10.129> another

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
that people speculated there's another

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.160 
that people speculated there's another
planet<00:02:10.729> inside<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.299> orbit<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.569> mercury<00:02:11.720> and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
planet inside the orbit of mercury and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.990 
planet inside the orbit of mercury and
then<00:02:12.950> they<00:02:13.040> may<00:02:13.099> get<00:02:13.310> their<00:02:13.549> planet<00:02:13.819> was

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
then they may get their planet was

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.710 
then they may get their planet was
Vulcan<00:02:14.739> so<00:02:15.739> now<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:15.950> know<00:02:16.720> another

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
Vulcan so now you know another

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.280 
Vulcan so now you know another
speculated<00:02:18.379> planet<00:02:18.709> there<00:02:18.889> is<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:20.290> something

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
speculated planet there is is something

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.780 
speculated planet there is is something
the<00:02:21.379> Greek<00:02:21.620> set<00:02:21.889> which<00:02:22.159> is<00:02:22.310> kind<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.519> Earth's

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the Greek set which is kind of Earth's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.050 
the Greek set which is kind of Earth's
evil<00:02:23.239> twin<00:02:23.540> wherever

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
evil twin wherever

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.309 
evil twin wherever
thing<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.510> like<00:02:24.660> us<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:24.989> really<00:02:25.290> really

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
thing is just like us but really really

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.440 
thing is just like us but really really
bad<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.860> they<00:02:26.340> place<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.760> planet<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
bad and they place this planet in the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.910 
bad and they place this planet in the
exact<00:02:27.720> same<00:02:27.900> orbit<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.470> earth<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.590> on<00:02:28.800> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
exact same orbit as the earth but on the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.070 
exact same orbit as the earth but on the
other<00:02:29.040> side<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.640> Sun<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.060> we<00:02:30.630> couldn't<00:02:30.870> see

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
other side of the Sun so we couldn't see

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.290 
other side of the Sun so we couldn't see
it<00:02:31.170> which<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.340> nice<00:02:32.700> from<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> kind<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.209> a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
it which is really nice from a kind of a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.850 
it which is really nice from a kind of a
symmetry<00:02:33.630> perspective<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.560> turns<00:02:34.770> out

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
symmetry perspective but it turns out

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.729 
symmetry perspective but it turns out
it's<00:02:35.040> actually<00:02:35.130> gravitationally<00:02:35.910> unstable

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
it's actually gravitationally unstable

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.470 
it's actually gravitationally unstable
here's<00:02:37.739> another<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.209> planet

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
here's another one this is the planet

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.640 
here's another one this is the planet
that<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.660> supposed<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> origin<00:02:40.440> at

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that was supposed to be the origin at

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.259 
that was supposed to be the origin at
the<00:02:40.680> asteroid<00:02:41.130> belt<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.640> kind<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.910> blew<00:02:42.090> her

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
the asteroid belt and kind of blew her

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.240 
the asteroid belt and kind of blew her
billion<00:02:42.599> years<00:02:42.750> ago<00:02:42.989> that's<00:02:43.739> wrong<00:02:43.950> big<00:02:44.160> as

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
billion years ago that's wrong big as

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.620 
billion years ago that's wrong big as
the<00:02:44.340> asteroid<00:02:44.640> belt<00:02:44.670> has<00:02:45.030> actually<00:02:45.300> left<00:02:45.450> over

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
the asteroid belt has actually left over

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.570 
the asteroid belt has actually left over
from<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.900> accretion<00:02:46.319> disk<00:02:46.560> which<00:02:47.220> was<00:02:47.400> meant

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
from the accretion disk which was meant

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.059 
from the accretion disk which was meant
to<00:02:47.790> which<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> thing<00:02:48.930> which<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.380> solar

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
to which is the thing which the solar

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.259 
to which is the thing which the solar
system<00:02:50.340> came<00:02:50.550> from<00:02:50.760> all<00:02:50.910> those<00:02:51.000> billions

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
system came from all those billions

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.350 
system came from all those billions
years<00:02:51.480> ago<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.019> another<00:02:53.010> planet<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.640> Herod

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
years ago and another planet is a Herod

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.339 
years ago and another planet is a Herod
I<00:02:54.510> was<00:02:54.720> reading<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:54.989> book<00:02:55.170> by<00:02:55.319> Michael

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
I was reading this book by Michael

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.580 
I was reading this book by Michael
Moorcock<00:02:55.860> where<00:02:56.250> he<00:02:56.310> talks<00:02:56.519> about<00:02:56.610> Venus<00:02:57.150> and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
Moorcock where he talks about Venus and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.050 
Moorcock where he talks about Venus and
Mercury<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.799> then<00:02:58.890> he<00:02:59.010> goes<00:02:59.160> Herod<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.850> I'm

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
Mercury and then he goes Herod and I'm

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.550 
Mercury and then he goes Herod and I'm
like<00:03:00.239> as<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.480> young<00:03:00.750> kid<00:03:00.900> I'm<00:03:01.049> like<00:03:01.170> Herod

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
like as a young kid I'm like Herod

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.440 
like as a young kid I'm like Herod
there's<00:03:02.310> no<00:03:02.430> planet<00:03:02.730> called<00:03:02.850> Herod<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:03.360> are

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
there's no planet called Herod there are

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.699 
there's no planet called Herod there are
nine<00:03:03.630> planets<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.080> can't<00:03:04.260> go<00:03:04.350> around<00:03:04.410> making

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
nine planets you can't go around making

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.410 
nine planets you can't go around making
planets<00:03:05.280> up<00:03:05.430> that's<00:03:05.610> science<00:03:06.060> right<00:03:06.269> it's<00:03:06.360> a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
planets up that's science right it's a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.600 
planets up that's science right it's a
fact<00:03:06.920> except<00:03:07.920> now<00:03:08.010> there<00:03:08.190> are<00:03:08.250> only<00:03:08.280> eight

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
fact except now there are only eight

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.370 
fact except now there are only eight
planets<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.450> turns<00:03:09.660> out<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.840> Pluto<00:03:10.230> is

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
planets and it turns out that Pluto is

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.870 
planets and it turns out that Pluto is
just<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.650> social<00:03:10.980> construction<00:03:11.340> three<00:03:11.640> billion

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
just a social construction three billion

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.699 
just a social construction three billion
miles<00:03:12.180> away<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.630> there's<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.110> tenth<00:03:13.470> planet

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
miles away and there's a tenth planet

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.620 
miles away and there's a tenth planet
which<00:03:14.400> looks<00:03:14.640> like<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.790> character<00:03:15.180> encoding

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
which looks like a character encoding

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.880 
which looks like a character encoding
bug<00:03:16.080> not<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.410> planet<00:03:16.650> at<00:03:16.860> all<00:03:17.989> okay<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.680> we<00:03:19.799> need

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
bug not a planet at all okay so we need

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.640 
bug not a planet at all okay so we need
some<00:03:20.099> real<00:03:20.700> planets<00:03:21.120> now<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.299> think<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.410> first

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
some real planets now I think the first

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.259 
some real planets now I think the first
one<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:22.830> Uranus<00:03:23.280> which<00:03:23.489> doesn't<00:03:23.849> need<00:03:23.970> science

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
one is Uranus which doesn't need science

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
with and these guys they're trying to

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.569 
with and these guys they're trying to
blow<00:04:04.109> up<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.410> solar<00:04:04.650> system<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.190> make<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.430> go

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
blow up the solar system to make it go

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.949 
blow up the solar system to make it go

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
back to the accretion disk which is

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.090 
back to the accretion disk which is
where<00:04:07.170> they<00:04:07.260> really<00:04:07.530> light<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.859> because<00:04:08.010> that

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
where they really light it because that

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.920 
where they really light it because that
was<00:04:08.190> home<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:09.000> they're<00:04:09.120> bad<00:04:09.329> guys<00:04:09.359> but<00:04:09.780> when

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
was home so they're bad guys but when

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.629 
was home so they're bad guys but when
they<00:04:10.049> talk<00:04:10.260> about<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.560> accretion<00:04:10.950> disk<00:04:11.160> they

they're musicians who made harps across

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.599 
they're musicians who made harps across
the<00:04:18.959> solar<00:04:19.139> system<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:20.039> make<00:04:20.160> beautiful<00:04:20.459> music

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
the solar system to make beautiful music

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.760

make a planet-wide telescope just by
looking<00:05:05.680> up<00:05:06.120> but<00:05:07.120> also<00:05:07.210> because<00:05:07.570> Neptune<00:05:08.080> is

into Florida skies which of that blue

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.920 
into Florida skies which of that blue
anyway<00:05:30.700> those<00:05:31.090> are<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.270> books<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.570> mentioned

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
anyway those are the books I mentioned

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.600 
anyway those are the books I mentioned
those<00:05:32.169> are<00:05:32.320> destinations<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.250> think<00:05:33.490> I've

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
those are destinations and I think I've

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.800 
those are destinations and I think I've
got<00:05:33.639> a<00:05:33.760> slots<00:05:34.030> talk<00:05:34.270> more<00:05:34.479> about<00:05:34.539> sci-fi

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
got a slots talk more about sci-fi

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
got a slots talk more about sci-fi
tomorrow<00:05:35.320> yeah<00:05:36.039> tomorrow<00:05:36.280> evening

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830
