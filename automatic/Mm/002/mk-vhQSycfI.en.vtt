00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.840 

the<00:00:23.380> thing<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.860> struck<00:00:24.010> me<00:00:24.070> most<00:00:24.220> about<00:00:24.700> a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
the thing that struck me most about a

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.210 
the thing that struck me most about a
man<00:00:25.150> when<00:00:25.330> I<00:00:25.420> first<00:00:25.450> came<00:00:25.840> here<00:00:26.080> but<00:00:26.800> I<00:00:27.010> can

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
man when I first came here but I can

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.150 
man when I first came here but I can
sense<00:00:27.490> right<00:00:27.790> away<00:00:28.000> that<00:00:28.150> there<00:00:28.300> was<00:00:28.420> no<00:00:28.570> water

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
sense right away that there was no water

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.540 
sense right away that there was no water
so<00:00:30.160> as<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.760> feel<00:00:31.180> its<00:00:31.600> ruggedness<00:00:32.400> you<00:00:33.400> know

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
so as you feel its ruggedness you know

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.930 
so as you feel its ruggedness you know
and<00:00:33.820> it's<00:00:34.770> their<00:00:35.770> kind<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.190> stone<00:00:36.640> like

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
and it's their kind of stone like

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.270 
and it's their kind of stone like
quality<00:00:37.480> of<00:00:37.600> it<00:00:37.810> and<00:00:38.170> that's<00:00:39.040> not<00:00:39.160> necessarily

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
quality of it and that's not necessarily

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.549 
quality of it and that's not necessarily
bad<00:00:39.790> or<00:00:39.820> good<00:00:40.210> or<00:00:40.390> whatever<00:00:40.570> but<00:00:40.809> and<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.290> feel

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
bad or good or whatever but and you feel

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.180 
bad or good or whatever but and you feel
it<00:00:41.739> right<00:00:41.950> away<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.430> are<00:00:43.090> like<00:00:43.330> in<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.720> rock

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it right away you are like in a rock

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.680 
it right away you are like in a rock
nothing<00:00:45.190> is<00:00:45.340> really<00:00:45.580> for<00:00:46.239> me<00:00:46.360> it<00:00:46.450> quite

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
nothing is really for me it quite

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.229 
nothing is really for me it quite
exciting<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.980> know<00:00:48.100> that<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:48.430> actually<00:00:48.760> feel

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
exciting you know that I actually feel

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.420 
exciting you know that I actually feel
it<00:00:49.300> right<00:00:49.540> away<00:00:49.570> that<00:00:49.960> there<00:00:50.680> was<00:00:50.800> no<00:00:51.010> stream

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
it right away that there was no stream

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.299 
it right away that there was no stream
or<00:00:51.700> river<00:00:51.910> or<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.680> know<00:00:53.800> I<00:00:53.980> think<00:00:54.100> that's

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
or river or you know I think that's

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.880 
or river or you know I think that's
quite<00:00:54.580> you<00:00:55.269> know<00:00:55.420> unique<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:56.110> mean<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.710> water

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
quite you know unique I mean the water

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.640 
quite you know unique I mean the water
is<00:00:57.070> not<00:00:57.190> far<00:00:57.400> away<00:00:57.519> but<00:00:57.850> it's<00:00:58.510> not<00:00:58.720> you<00:00:59.559> know

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
is not far away but it's not you know

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.549 
is not far away but it's not you know
you<00:00:59.680> don't<00:00:59.890> have<00:01:00.010> embankment<00:01:00.820> so<00:01:01.089> you<00:01:01.870> know<00:01:01.989> if

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
you don't have embankment so you know if

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.399 
you don't have embankment so you know if
you<00:01:02.800> have<00:01:03.010> valleys<00:01:03.519> and<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.989> know<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:05.170> have

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
you have valleys and you know you have

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.240 
you have valleys and you know you have
hills<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:08.110> I<00:01:08.140> think<00:01:08.350> them<00:01:08.590> rock<00:01:08.950> is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
hills and and so I think them rock is

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.200 
hills and and so I think them rock is
very<00:01:10.440> important<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.620> city<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:15.210> don't

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
very important to the city I don't

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.969 
very important to the city I don't
really<00:01:16.390> believe<00:01:16.690> in<00:01:16.840> relating<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.890> the

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
really believe in relating to the

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.840 
really believe in relating to the
environment<00:01:18.630> per<00:01:19.630> se<00:01:20.010> I<00:01:21.010> don't<00:01:21.640> think<00:01:21.790> you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
environment per se I don't think you

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.820 
environment per se I don't think you
know<00:01:21.970> if<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.150> want<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.540> start<00:01:23.080> afresh<00:01:23.350> with

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
know if you want to start afresh with

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.660 
know if you want to start afresh with
something<00:01:24.280> you<00:01:24.940> feel<00:01:25.390> always<00:01:25.630> constantly

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
something you feel always constantly

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.459 
something you feel always constantly
relating<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.880> context<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.140> think<00:01:29.320> what's

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
relating to context and I think what's

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.530 
relating to context and I think what's
happened<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:29.890> last<00:01:29.920> they<00:01:30.399> say<00:01:30.579> 20<00:01:30.640> 30<00:01:31.149> years

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
happened the last they say 20 30 years

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.020 
happened the last they say 20 30 years
the<00:01:32.409> whole<00:01:32.590> idea<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:32.950> context<00:01:33.399> change<00:01:33.700> a<00:01:33.850> lot

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
the whole idea of context change a lot

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.590 
the whole idea of context change a lot
it's<00:01:34.750> not<00:01:34.869> no<00:01:35.469> longer<00:01:35.979> means<00:01:36.390> context<00:01:37.390> in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
it's not no longer means context in

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.060 
it's not no longer means context in
terms<00:01:37.750> of<00:01:38.140> adjacency<00:01:38.799> and<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:41.070> visual

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
terms of adjacency and and and visual

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.060 
terms of adjacency and and and visual
appearance

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.950 

and<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.730> don't<00:01:45.940> think<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.150> has<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.330> completely

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
and I don't think it has to completely

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.720 
and I don't think it has to completely
relate<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:50.020> sometimes<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.650> can<00:01:50.920> but<00:01:51.400> it's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
relate to it sometimes it can but it's

00:01:51.730 --> 00:02:02.580 
relate to it sometimes it can but it's
