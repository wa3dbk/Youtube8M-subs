of all the reason I'm making this video

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.999 
of all the reason I'm making this video
is<00:00:11.160> because<00:00:11.750> some<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:13.049> are<00:00:13.200> experiencing

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
is because some of you are experiencing

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.380 
is because some of you are experiencing
this<00:00:14.280> whole<00:00:14.580> IP<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.299> problem<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:17.150> all<00:00:18.150> that

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
this whole IP a problem and all that

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.609 
this whole IP a problem and all that
stuff<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.789> first<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.970> all<00:00:21.119> um<00:00:21.619> basically

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
stuff so first of all um basically

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.740 
stuff so first of all um basically
another<00:00:23.609> reason<00:00:24.000> why<00:00:24.119> I'm<00:00:24.210> doing<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.570> is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
another reason why I'm doing it is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.439 
another reason why I'm doing it is
because<00:00:25.289> some<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.220> may<00:00:26.400> actually<00:00:26.580> find<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
because some of you may actually find it

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
because some of you may actually find it
quite<00:00:27.660> hard<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.039> remember<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.730> had

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
quite hard to use and I remember I had

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.359 
quite hard to use and I remember I had
these<00:00:30.150> help<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> first<00:00:31.260> time<00:00:31.439> because

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
these help for the first time because

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700 
these help for the first time because
I'm<00:00:32.610> basically<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.540> happened<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.590> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
I'm basically what happened is it so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.530 
I'm basically what happened is it so
easy<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.219> search<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.820> actual<00:00:36.090> app<00:00:36.180> itself

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
easy to search for the actual app itself

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440 
easy to search for the actual app itself
but<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.469> actually<00:00:37.620> am<00:00:38.040> download<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
but to actually am download it can be a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.959 
but to actually am download it can be a
bit<00:00:39.629> hard<00:00:39.660> sometimes<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.620> things<00:00:41.460> pop<00:00:41.760> up

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
bit hard sometimes because things pop up

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.779 
bit hard sometimes because things pop up
and<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> gets<00:00:42.600> confusing<00:00:43.190> okay<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.250> first<00:00:44.579> of

this<00:04:55.430> IP<00:04:55.699> a<00:04:55.970> problem<00:04:56.479> thing<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.960> did<00:04:57.590> used<00:04:58.009> to

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
this IP a problem thing I did used to

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.540 
this IP a problem thing I did used to
have<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.430> like<00:04:58.550> i<00:04:58.580> said<00:04:58.880> though<00:04:59.090> um<00:04:59.389> a<00:05:00.340> tip<00:05:01.340> is

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
have it like i said though um a tip is

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.439 
have it like i said though um a tip is
so<00:05:02.650> basically<00:05:03.650> i'd<00:05:04.250> recommend<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.210> run

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
so basically i'd recommend that you run

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.270 
so basically i'd recommend that you run
on<00:05:05.599> a<00:05:05.660> 5.1<00:05:06.440> of<00:05:06.680> iOS<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:08.199> don't<00:05:09.199> know<00:05:09.349> it<00:05:09.889> was

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
on a 5.1 of iOS I don't know it was

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.620 
on a 5.1 of iOS I don't know it was
strange<00:05:10.520> actually<00:05:10.820> because<00:05:11.150> I<00:05:11.240> used<00:05:11.419> to<00:05:11.509> have

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
strange actually because I used to have

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.900 
strange actually because I used to have
it<00:05:11.780> but<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.990> just<00:05:12.020> stopped<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.400> don't<00:05:13.759> know

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
it but it just stopped so I don't know

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.210 
it but it just stopped so I don't know
whether<00:05:14.259> installous<00:05:15.259> has<00:05:15.440> done<00:05:15.620> something<00:05:15.919> to

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
whether installous has done something to

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.610 
whether installous has done something to
stop<00:05:16.430> people<00:05:16.940> from<00:05:17.240> experience<00:05:17.900> in<00:05:18.169> that<00:05:18.199> or

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
stop people from experience in that or

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.460 
stop people from experience in that or
whether<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.940> know<00:05:20.060> it's<00:05:20.240> just<00:05:20.389> me<00:05:20.599> but

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
whether you know it's just me but

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.749 
whether you know it's just me but
basically<00:05:22.099> a<00:05:22.900> tip<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:24.139> do<00:05:24.289> it<00:05:24.440> is<00:05:24.620> if<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:25.550> go<00:05:25.669> on

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
basically a tip to do it is if you go on

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:31.810 
basically a tip to do it is if you go on
to<00:05:25.910> cydia<00:05:26.389> and<00:05:28.210> then<00:05:29.210> hold<00:05:29.900> on<00:05:30.110> i'll<00:05:30.500> just<00:05:31.310> wait
