obviously I think you know a library and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.179 
obviously I think you know a library and
his<00:01:39.420> debrief<00:01:39.840> today<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.350> tomorrow<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.040> be

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
why didn't how and where to get that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.539 
why didn't how and where to get that
