00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.020 
the water and this is really important
whatever<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.380> use<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.859> put<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.190> water<00:03:34.430> in<00:03:34.730> the

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
whatever you use to put the water in the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.640 
whatever you use to put the water in the
Ducks<00:03:35.299> need<00:03:35.569> to<00:03:35.630> be<00:03:35.780> able<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.109> put<00:03:36.260> their<00:03:36.440> face

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
Ducks need to be able to put their face

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.099 
Ducks need to be able to put their face
all<00:03:36.919> the<00:03:37.099> way<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.609> water<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.720> they

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
all the way in the water so that they

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.650 
all the way in the water so that they
can<00:03:39.349> clean<00:03:39.680> out<00:03:39.829> their<00:03:40.040> nostrils<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.760> the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
can clean out their nostrils and the

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.229 
can clean out their nostrils and the
water<00:03:41.900> also<00:03:42.230> helps<00:03:42.650> wash<00:03:43.579> their<00:03:43.819> food<00:03:44.030> down

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
water also helps wash their food down

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.670 
water also helps wash their food down
because<00:03:44.540> their<00:03:44.690> food<00:03:44.930> can't<00:03:45.200> go<00:03:45.319> down<00:03:45.470> their

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
because their food can't go down their

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.190 
because their food can't go down their
throat<00:03:45.980> unless<00:03:46.280> they<00:03:46.459> have<00:03:46.639> water<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.810> wash<00:03:47.989> it

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
throat unless they have water to wash it

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.120 
throat unless they have water to wash it
down<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.780> anyway<00:03:50.780> okay<00:03:51.200> so<00:03:51.230> these<00:03:51.650> need<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:51.950> be

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
down so anyway okay so these need to be

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.920 
down so anyway okay so these need to be
in<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.340> house<00:03:52.489> for<00:03:52.819> about<00:03:53.000> six<00:03:53.299> weeks<00:03:53.419> and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
in the house for about six weeks and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.110 
in the house for about six weeks and
when<00:03:54.620> these<00:03:54.739> guys<00:03:55.069> get<00:03:55.340> bigger<00:03:55.609> we'll<00:03:55.910> show

supervise<00:05:05.420> them<00:05:05.810> while<00:05:06.020> they're<00:05:06.230> swimming

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
supervise them while they're swimming

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.050 
supervise them while they're swimming
they<00:05:06.860> can<00:05:07.010> have<00:05:07.160> lots<00:05:07.400> of<00:05:07.640> fun<00:05:09.640> they<00:05:10.640> will<00:05:10.850> get

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
cold after a little bit though so we're

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.050 
cold after a little bit though so we're
going<00:05:12.920> to<00:05:13.010> let<00:05:13.130> them<00:05:13.190> swim<00:05:13.460> for<00:05:13.670> a<00:05:13.700> little<00:05:13.910> bit

going to let them swim for a little bit
and<00:05:14.210> then<00:05:14.300> we'll<00:05:14.420> put<00:05:14.600> them<00:05:14.750> back<00:05:14.990> under<00:05:15.200> their

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
and then we'll put them back under their

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.040 
and then we'll put them back under their
heat<00:05:15.770> lamp<00:05:16.010> I<00:05:16.310> forgot<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.150> mention<00:05:17.300> earlier<00:05:17.690> in

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
heat lamp I forgot to mention earlier in

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.950 
heat lamp I forgot to mention earlier in
the<00:05:18.140> video<00:05:18.470> how<00:05:18.950> you<00:05:19.010> regulate<00:05:19.700> the<00:05:20.060> heat<00:05:20.300> with

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
the video how you regulate the heat with

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.590 
the video how you regulate the heat with
the<00:05:20.990> heat<00:05:21.290> lamp<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.910> way<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:23.090> regulate

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
the heat lamp and the way you regulate

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.990 
the heat lamp and the way you regulate
the<00:05:23.900> heat<00:05:24.050> is<00:05:24.290> just<00:05:24.470> by<00:05:24.620> lowering<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.730> heat

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
the heat is just by lowering the heat

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.840 
the heat is just by lowering the heat
lamp<00:05:26.300> closer<00:05:26.600> to<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.170> container<00:05:27.710> or<00:05:27.950> raising

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
lamp closer to the container or raising

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.670 
lamp closer to the container or raising
it<00:05:28.970> up<00:05:29.090> higher<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.780> have<00:05:29.930> less<00:05:30.230> heat<00:05:30.500> in<00:05:30.620> the

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
it up higher to have less heat in the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.910 
it up higher to have less heat in the
container<00:05:31.160> it's<00:05:31.610> that<00:05:32.120> simple<00:05:32.800> then<00:05:33.800> what

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
container it's that simple then what

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.800 
container it's that simple then what
