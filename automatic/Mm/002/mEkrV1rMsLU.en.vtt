you go a size up and I did that I did go

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.710 
you go a size up and I did that I did go
size<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:23.829> so<00:02:23.980> normally<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.549> America<00:02:25.329> I<00:02:25.480> would

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
size up so normally in America I would

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.390 
size up so normally in America I would
normally<00:02:25.870> go<00:02:26.230> with<00:02:26.260> smalls<00:02:26.769> or<00:02:26.980> mediums

normally go with smalls or mediums

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.300 
normally go with smalls or mediums
depending<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.030> how<00:02:28.180> long<00:02:29.170> they<00:02:29.410> are<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.829> got

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
depending on how long they are I got

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.710 
depending on how long they are I got
everything

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
everything

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720 
everything
as<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.989> large<00:02:32.380> up<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.920> light<00:02:33.100> of<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.280> box<00:02:33.489> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
as a large up of light of the box and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.539 
as a large up of light of the box and
like<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.780> said<00:02:34.840> everything<00:02:35.440> fits<00:02:35.709> well<00:02:36.190> this

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
like I said everything fits well this

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.220 
like I said everything fits well this
way<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:37.030> just<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.299> some<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> items<00:02:37.840> are

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
way it's just that some of the items are

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.590 
way it's just that some of the items are
a<00:02:38.260> little<00:02:39.010> too<00:02:39.220> short<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.700> am<00:02:39.730> 6<00:02:40.090> feet<00:02:40.329> tall

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
a little too short and I am 6 feet tall

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.110 
a little too short and I am 6 feet tall
so<00:02:41.049> put<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.680> into<00:02:41.890> perspective<00:02:42.070> people<00:02:42.880> keep

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
so put that into perspective people keep

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.430 
so put that into perspective people keep
asking<00:02:43.299> me<00:02:43.480> I've<00:02:43.570> never<00:02:43.720> asked<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.079> I'm<00:02:44.230> 6

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
fantastic one of the things that I

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.070 
fantastic one of the things that I
appreciate<00:05:07.790> about<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.240> design<00:05:08.540> is<00:05:08.780> that<00:05:08.960> they

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
appreciate about the design is that they

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.570 
appreciate about the design is that they
started<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.560> from<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.889> front<00:05:10.130> and<00:05:10.310> they

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
started it from the front and they

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.510 
started it from the front and they
carried<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:11.060> on<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.960> back<00:05:12.139> -<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:13.310> tree

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
carried it on to the back - the tree

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.270 
carried it on to the back - the tree
obviously<00:05:14.389> but<00:05:15.050> I<00:05:15.200> think<00:05:15.470> that's<00:05:15.620> just<00:05:15.710> really

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
obviously but I think that's just really

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.400 
obviously but I think that's just really
cool<00:05:16.580> that<00:05:16.790> they<00:05:17.360> didn't<00:05:17.630> just<00:05:17.720> have<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:18.110> design

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
cool that they didn't just have a design

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.780 
cool that they didn't just have a design
on<00:05:18.560> one<00:05:18.710> side<00:05:18.950> and<00:05:19.130> then<00:05:19.220> stop<00:05:19.490> on<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:19.760> other

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
on one side and then stop on the other

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.090 
on one side and then stop on the other
side<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:20.630> this<00:05:20.750> is<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.960> good<00:05:21.230> shirt<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:21.889> fits
