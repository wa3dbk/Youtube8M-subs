so let's set that aside you take a good

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.210 
so let's set that aside you take a good
look<00:02:05.880> at<00:02:06.210> MacBook<00:02:06.930> Pro<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.680> MacBook<00:02:08.009> Pro

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
look at MacBook Pro so the MacBook Pro

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.090 
look at MacBook Pro so the MacBook Pro
of<00:02:08.369> course

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
of course

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.300 
of course
has<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.820> Retina<00:02:10.210> display<00:02:10.710> so<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.860> resolution
