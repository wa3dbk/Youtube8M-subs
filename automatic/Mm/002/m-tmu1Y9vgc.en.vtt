00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
I recently finished my first year of

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.629 
I recently finished my first year of
medical<00:00:12.750> school<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.530> as<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.340> was<00:00:14.460> thinking

medical school and as I was thinking

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.420 
medical school and as I was thinking
about<00:00:14.910> what<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> learned<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.529> any<00:00:16.890> advice<00:00:17.220> I

have to give to the incoming first-year
medical<00:00:19.770> students<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.550> started<00:00:21.480> writing

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
medical students I started writing

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050 
medical students I started writing
things<00:00:21.930> down<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:23.340> came<00:00:23.519> up<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.699> three

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
things down and I came up with three

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.920 
things down and I came up with three
categories<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:25.010> things<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> learned<00:00:26.930> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
categories of things that I learned the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
categories of things that I learned the
first<00:00:28.140> category<00:00:28.439> relates<00:00:29.010> directly<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
first category relates directly to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.030 
first category relates directly to
studies<00:00:30.210> changes<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.080> discoveries<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
studies changes and discoveries that I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.790 
studies changes and discoveries that I
made<00:00:32.399> about<00:00:33.149> how<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> study<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> learned

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
made about how I study and how I learned

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.530 
made about how I study and how I learned
the<00:00:35.610> second<00:00:36.000> category

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the second category

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.970 
the second category
relates<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.850> misconceptions<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.540> what<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> what

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
relates to misconceptions on what I what

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.100 
relates to misconceptions on what I what
I<00:00:41.010> misunderstood<00:00:41.910> before<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.360> started<00:00:42.750> medical

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
I misunderstood before I started medical

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
I misunderstood before I started medical
school<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.980> third<00:00:44.160> category<00:00:45.559> were<00:00:46.610> bits

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
school and the third category were bits

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.470 
school and the third category were bits
of<00:00:47.700> advice<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.300> had<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> offer<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:50.360> to<00:00:51.360> get

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
of advice that I had to offer so to get

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.310 
of advice that I had to offer so to get
started<00:00:52.340> directly<00:00:53.340> related<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> how<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> study

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
started directly related to how I study

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.189 
started directly related to how I study
and<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> study<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.780> came<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:57.930> two

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and what I study I came up with two

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
and what I study I came up with two
things<00:00:58.579> study<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.820> teacher<00:01:00.059> before<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
things study the teacher before you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.470 
things study the teacher before you
study<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> subject<00:01:01.489> every<00:01:02.489> teacher<00:01:02.789> tests

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
study the subject every teacher tests

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
study the subject every teacher tests
differently<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.710> mistake<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.189> made<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
differently one mistake I made was that

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.780 
differently one mistake I made was that
I<00:01:05.850> studied<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.420> every<00:01:06.720> class<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> know

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
I studied for every class you know

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.179 
I studied for every class you know
basically<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> same<00:01:09.689> by<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.830> over<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
basically the same by going over the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.140 
basically the same by going over the
lectures<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.930> same<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> went<00:01:14.490> over<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
lectures the same way as I went over the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
lectures the same way as I went over the
packets<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> powerpoints<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
packets and the powerpoints and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.140 
packets and the powerpoints and
listening<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> lectures<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.119> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
listening to the lectures you know I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
listening to the lectures you know I
kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.479> treated<00:01:18.689> every<00:01:19.080> class<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.890> same<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
kind of treated every class the same and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
kind of treated every class the same and
that<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> huge<00:01:21.360> mistake<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> learned

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that was a huge mistake what I learned

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
that was a huge mistake what I learned
that<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.369> second<00:01:23.850> year<00:01:24.060> students<00:01:24.600> were

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that is that second year students were

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.440 
that is that second year students were
an<00:01:25.229> incredible<00:01:25.799> resource<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.460> tell<00:01:26.640> me<00:01:26.790> what

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
an incredible resource to tell me what

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.910 
an incredible resource to tell me what
to<00:01:27.570> expect<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> tests<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.680> how<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
to expect on the tests and how the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.100 
to expect on the tests and how the
teacher<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:29.970> patterns<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.659> testing

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
teacher you know patterns of testing

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.350 
teacher you know patterns of testing
that<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> teacher<00:01:32.100> used<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> learn

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that that a teacher used you can learn

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.390 
that that a teacher used you can learn
the<00:01:33.540> material<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.380> well<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.280> that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the material really well but that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
the material really well but that
doesn't<00:01:35.729> mean<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> you'll<00:01:36.240> necessarily<00:01:36.420> do

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
doesn't mean that you'll necessarily do

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.090 
doesn't mean that you'll necessarily do
well<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> specific<00:01:38.159> teacher's<00:01:38.759> test<00:01:40.100> so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
well on on a specific teacher's test so

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.340 
well on on a specific teacher's test so
so<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:41.970> first<00:01:42.180> point<00:01:42.479> my<00:01:42.930> second

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
so that was my first point my second

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.120 
so that was my first point my second
point<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:45.570> develop<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.409> study<00:01:46.619> pattern

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
point was is to develop a study pattern

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.399 
point was is to develop a study pattern
learn<00:01:47.700> how<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.000> learn<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> stick<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
learn how you learn and stick with that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.030 
learn how you learn and stick with that
throughout<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.189> year<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.590> very<00:01:52.829> time

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
throughout the year it can be very time

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.770 
throughout the year it can be very time
consuming<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.700> change<00:01:54.030> your<00:01:54.240> study<00:01:54.509> habits

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
consuming to change your study habits

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.380 
consuming to change your study habits
and<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.200> techniques<00:01:55.740> completely<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.579> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and your techniques completely as you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.630 
and your techniques completely as you
know<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.380> bad<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> test<00:01:59.250> or<00:01:59.430> something

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
know you do bad on a test or something

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.639 
know you do bad on a test or something
like<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.869> tried<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.560> couple

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
like that and I tried that a couple

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.550 
like that and I tried that a couple
times<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.640> set<00:02:02.850> me<00:02:02.969> back<00:02:03.530> what<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
times and it really set me back what I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.880 
times and it really set me back what I
found<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:05.310> effective<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.890> you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
found to be more effective was to you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.669

everyone's<00:04:08.519> heard<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.690> what<00:04:09.930> does<00:04:10.079> that

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
everyone's heard that but what does that

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.830 
everyone's heard that but what does that
mean<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:11.099> know<00:04:11.220> was<00:04:11.579> i<00:04:11.700> busy<00:04:11.970> in<00:04:12.269> undergrad

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
mean you know was i busy in undergrad

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.099 
mean you know was i busy in undergrad
because<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.440> i<00:04:13.560> was<00:04:13.799> busy<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.639> undergrad<00:04:15.209> and

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
because if i was busy and undergrad and

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.129 
because if i was busy and undergrad and
then<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.410> thought<00:04:16.799> about<00:04:16.940> my<00:04:17.940> my<00:04:18.660> medical

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
then I thought about my my medical

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.319 
then I thought about my my medical
school<00:04:19.380> career<00:04:19.829> in<00:04:20.070> relation<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:21.239> know

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
school career in relation to you know

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:21.680 
school career in relation to you know
that

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
that

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.890 
that
level<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.110> busyness<00:04:23.240> which<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.390> what<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.570> did<00:04:24.870> I

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
level of busyness which is what I did I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.020 
level of busyness which is what I did I
was<00:04:25.140> way<00:04:25.320> off<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.770> know<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.100> expected<00:04:26.880> myself

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
was way off you know I I expected myself

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.010 
was way off you know I I expected myself
to<00:04:27.560> basically<00:04:28.560> eight<00:04:28.920> hours<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.340> day<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:30.060> school

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
to basically eight hours a day of school

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.170 
to basically eight hours a day of school
and<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.680> would<00:04:31.860> treat<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> full-time

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
and I would treat it like a full-time

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.870 
and I would treat it like a full-time
job<00:04:33.410> well<00:04:34.410> when<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.620> got<00:04:34.860> here<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:35.190> quickly<00:04:35.580> found

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
job well when I got here I quickly found

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.960 
job well when I got here I quickly found
out<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.720> had<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.200> treat<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.970> 7:00

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
out that I had to treat it like a 7:00

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.660 
out that I had to treat it like a 7:00
a.m.<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.690> 10:00<00:04:39.930> p.m.<00:04:39.960> every<00:04:40.620> day<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.460> then

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
a.m. to 10:00 p.m. every day and then

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.240 
a.m. to 10:00 p.m. every day and then
right<00:04:41.850> before<00:04:41.970> tests<00:04:42.660> more<00:04:43.200> like<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.530> 6:00<00:04:44.070> a.m.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
right before tests more like a 6:00 a.m.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.300 
right before tests more like a 6:00 a.m.
to<00:04:44.850> midnight<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.480> maybe<00:04:46.290> after<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> test<00:04:47.070> I

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
to midnight and maybe after a test I

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.060 
to midnight and maybe after a test I
might<00:04:47.460> take<00:04:47.730> it<00:04:47.880> easy<00:04:48.060> like<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.690> a.m.<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.710> 8:00

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
might take it easy like a a.m. to 8:00

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.020 
might take it easy like a a.m. to 8:00
p.m.<00:04:50.330> but<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.420> was<00:04:51.510> never<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.870> 9:00<00:04:52.140> to<00:04:52.170> 5:00<00:04:52.320> and

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
p.m. but it was never a 9:00 to 5:00 and

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.310 
p.m. but it was never a 9:00 to 5:00 and
so<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.240> was<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.390> really<00:04:54.840> really<00:04:55.050> big

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
so that was a really really big

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.010 
so that was a really really big
misconception<00:04:56.070> that<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.220> had<00:04:56.750> take<00:04:57.750> any

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
misconception that I had take any

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.170 
misconception that I had take any
individual<00:04:58.740> class<00:04:59.010> and<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.580> materials<00:05:00.030> not

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
individual class and the materials not

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.920 
individual class and the materials not
that<00:05:00.390> hard<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.690> learn<00:05:00.720> in<00:05:01.050> fact<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:02.100> probably

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
that hard to learn in fact it's probably

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.200 
that hard to learn in fact it's probably
pretty<00:05:03.930> easy<00:05:04.080> but<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.190> volume<00:05:05.760> that<00:05:06.090> you're

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
pretty easy but the volume that you're

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.580 
pretty easy but the volume that you're
getting<00:05:06.420> that<00:05:06.540> material<00:05:07.110> in<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.290> number<00:05:07.560> of

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
getting that material in the number of

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.610 
getting that material in the number of
classes<00:05:07.920> that<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.310> have<00:05:08.510> make<00:05:09.510> it<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.080> it's

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
classes that you have make it so it's

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.010 
classes that you have make it so it's
very<00:05:10.920> demanding<00:05:11.190> on<00:05:11.430> your<00:05:11.490> time<00:05:11.820> some<00:05:12.690> people

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
very demanding on your time some people

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.290 
very demanding on your time some people
can<00:05:13.200> get<00:05:13.320> by<00:05:13.530> with<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:13.890> nine-to-five<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:15.180> know

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
can get by with a nine-to-five you know

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.610 
can get by with a nine-to-five you know
treating<00:05:15.600> med<00:05:15.750> school<00:05:15.990> like<00:05:16.170> 9:00<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.470> 5:00

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
treating med school like 9:00 to 5:00

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.110 
treating med school like 9:00 to 5:00
but<00:05:16.800> I<00:05:16.860> think<00:05:17.100> that's<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.490> exception<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.030> the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
but I think that's the exception to the

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.750 
but I think that's the exception to the
rule<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:19.020> rather<00:05:19.770> than<00:05:20.010> planning<00:05:20.250> on<00:05:20.550> being

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
rule and rather than planning on being

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.460 
rule and rather than planning on being
the<00:05:20.970> exception<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.690> rule<00:05:21.720> like<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.260> did

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
the exception to the rule like I did

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.350 
the exception to the rule like I did
plan<00:05:23.340> on<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.700> being<00:05:24.090> pretty<00:05:24.450> time-consuming

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
plan on it being pretty time-consuming

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.020 
plan on it being pretty time-consuming
now<00:05:27.360> um<00:05:27.690> so<00:05:28.530> those<00:05:28.710> were<00:05:28.890> my<00:05:29.030> misconceptions

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
now um so those were my misconceptions

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.060 
now um so those were my misconceptions
and<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.540> final<00:05:30.780> thing<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.020> have<00:05:31.200> were<00:05:31.470> you<00:05:31.980> know

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
and the final thing I have were you know

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.980 
and the final thing I have were you know
my<00:05:32.250> advice<00:05:33.620> first<00:05:34.620> stay<00:05:35.310> calm<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.790> panic<00:05:36.419> attack

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
my advice first stay calm a panic attack

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.570 
my advice first stay calm a panic attack
never<00:05:37.260> once<00:05:37.620> helped<00:05:37.919> me<00:05:38.040> get<00:05:38.190> better<00:05:38.310> grades

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
never once helped me get better grades

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.420 
never once helped me get better grades
in<00:05:38.940> medical<00:05:39.480> school<00:05:39.720> in<00:05:39.900> fact<00:05:40.530> there's<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.190> term

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
in medical school in fact there's a term

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.950 
in medical school in fact there's a term
called<00:05:41.700> punting<00:05:42.270> I<00:05:42.510> think<00:05:42.690> it's<00:05:42.810> pretty

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
called punting I think it's pretty

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.230 
called punting I think it's pretty
universal<00:05:43.620> but<00:05:44.160> it<00:05:44.280> essentially<00:05:44.880> means<00:05:45.120> that

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
universal but it essentially means that

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.720 
universal but it essentially means that
you're<00:05:45.630> going<00:05:45.780> into<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.110> test<00:05:46.550> without<00:05:47.550> ever

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
you're going into a test without ever

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.970 
you're going into a test without ever
seeing<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.210> material<00:05:48.350> so<00:05:49.350> you're<00:05:49.830> going<00:05:49.950> to

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
seeing the material so you're going to

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.110 
seeing the material so you're going to
pump<00:05:50.310> that<00:05:50.520> lecture<00:05:50.820> right<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:53.430> comparing

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
pump that lecture right so comparing

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.970 
pump that lecture right so comparing
panic<00:05:54.600> attacks<00:05:54.930> on<00:05:55.230> a<00:05:55.260> certain<00:05:55.560> lecture

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
panic attacks on a certain lecture

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.220 
panic attacks on a certain lecture
versus<00:05:56.580> punting<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.060> certain<00:05:57.300> lecture<00:05:57.660> I<00:05:57.810> got

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
versus punting a certain lecture I got

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.620 
versus punting a certain lecture I got
about<00:05:58.410> the<00:05:58.560> same<00:05:58.590> grade<00:05:59.040> and<00:05:59.250> so<00:05:59.970> it<00:06:00.300> was<00:06:00.510> very

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
about the same grade and so it was very

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.630 
about the same grade and so it was very
empowering<00:06:01.020> because<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:02.100> gave<00:06:02.430> myself

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
know I got to a point where I was like

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.720

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
this test I got so intense that I could

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.980 
this test I got so intense that I could
develop<00:06:16.530> tunnel<00:06:17.040> vision<00:06:17.400> and<00:06:17.600> what<00:06:18.600> that<00:06:18.750> does

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
develop tunnel vision and what that does

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.110 
develop tunnel vision and what that does

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
I found was that I was basically forced

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.950 
I found was that I was basically forced
to<00:06:57.740> be<00:06:57.860> more<00:06:58.070> effective<00:06:58.460> with<00:06:58.550> my<00:06:58.760> time<00:06:59.030> and<00:06:59.330> it

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
to be more effective with my time and it

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.960 
to be more effective with my time and it
was<00:07:00.169> liberating<00:07:00.680> because<00:07:01.040> I<00:07:01.460> could<00:07:01.669> spend

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970
