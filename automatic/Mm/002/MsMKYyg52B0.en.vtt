00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.540
 Hi guys, how are you? A bat? 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.010
 Here we talk about how to win 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.120
 money with crafts 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.219
 Today I want to talk is from that moment. 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.199
 that beat that dismay that you 're not 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.000
 Can not sell anything you say 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.869
 so I will not work with 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.289
 that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.570
 I love my hobby. It's a pleasure in me. 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.400
 life but I will not sell because the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.050
 people do not value 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.759
 You said that, it's not for me anymore. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 Who told you to come back a little message? 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.809
 I understand that sometimes a person 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.329
 do not talk two 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.840
 someone speaks well not today there is in 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.450
 There is no Italian work. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.070
 magnificent but I'm not going to buy it today 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.860
 what happened 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.730
 If it did not, it could come 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 to happen 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 ok this is very common to happen but 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.260
 What I wanted to tell you is that you do not 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.660
 Give up if this happens to you. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 This happens to ourselves, right? 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.159
 is walking in the mall and there you are 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.310
 needing a pair of jeans 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.830
 you see 45 in a shop you're going to buy 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.720
 a wall two in the buy 5, 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.310
 The less I do not buy five at a time, my 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.280
 husband beats but sometimes understands 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.869
 person likes to think it's beautiful but for one 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.299
 question 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.360
 I do not know financial there most of the time 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.820
 end up getting that at that moment 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.100
 okay does not mean that it does not 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.860
 value craftsmanship and that means 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.710
 who at the time did not make the purchase 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 example if someone offers a 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.439
 tractor camilla wants to buy a tractor 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.049
 I'm going to say no, it's not a brigade. 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.750
 Price is great, says my friend. 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.390
 Thank you, I do not use the factor does not have a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.310
 space to store a tractor that I 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.280
 I'll do it with a tractor, but I know that. 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.950
 someone somewhere in the world looking for 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.630
 It's not for buying, you do not want to. 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.879
 say that I do not value his product 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.480
 I give value to a tractor I know 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.510
 many times there is not enough food 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:20.239
 If you do not have a working tractor, 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:23.810
 then it is in tendon there is the circumstance ne 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.330
 the moment it takes a person to buy or not 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.120
 I will now propose an exercise if 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.200
 put in the place of your client 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.510
 the kit leads to buy something I go 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.720
 answer what I walk 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.250
 What makes me buy something, I buy 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.069
 something when I 'm needing it 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.660
 When I fall in love, people who 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.430
 Wonderful thing, I have to use this 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.120
 I have to take this to my 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.170
 home, then I think the enchantment 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.390
 For us women, the visual does not count. 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.810
 very impulse buying many times 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.790
 You must control it if you have not already seen it, but I 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.859
 I buy some things that I think 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.129
 those not to be missed 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:16.160
 the promotions the price is also a great 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.660
 fuel a major incentive for 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.019
 That I buy something so I 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.840
 I'm searching for research without 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.079
 no intention to buy anything 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.930
 but then there came that product 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.450
 in that pre-school people like this one 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:37.940
 product at that price and I came to 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.040
 shop the other day twice as expensive as there 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.970
 I'll have to buy it and have a 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.760
 too much help too on time 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.790
 Do you buy something? 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.060
 and I think we talk about each other 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.269
 videos at times is fraternization 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.879
 a birthday party and dates 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.239
 commemorative nÃ© valentines day 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:06.590
 mothers what else makes me buy 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:09.620
 sometimes it 's me walking around and I see a 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.040
 cool showcase call attention I finish 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.500
 Buying too, so this is what I 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.669
 wanna know see public that propose 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.960
 Do you want to hit it right and try to 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.360
 approach this audience with this magic 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.300
 know with a good product with a 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.780
 Little promotion 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.910
 I'll summarize this tip is in a formula 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.069
 that marketing people use 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.530
 my husband is an administrator of 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.569
 companies with an emphasis on marketing, I 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.120
 I studied it and he taught me that I 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:49.780
 I use a lot in my daily life is the formula 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:52.410
 4ps product promotion point of sale 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.229
 and price so if you can get together 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.479
 these four feet is not to use that in a 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.509
 formula is your business you have great 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.180
 chances of quitting growing a lot because 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:09.160
 this is a set of things that makes the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:14.289
 people buy more then of course 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:17.169
 that is exists there is an acceptance of 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.139
 product some more revenue than 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:24.370
 others are not utilitarian products that 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.949
 people use are more salable is 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.620
 different you make to make a one piece 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:33.340
 and a part that is 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:38.490
 decorative and utilitarian know-how I will give 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:41.770
 For example, a decorated bagger 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.500
 cute with the theme there 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.860
 kitchen of the person of kitty kitchen of 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.770
 cupcakes will go together will decorate and have 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.979
 that product that brings together these 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.110
 two things take from more than one 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.870
 another model of bag and pulls suddenly 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.469
 is stored in a drawer and that nobody 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:06.219
 will not visualize will not decorate know 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:09.580
 then what is the person going to use right? 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:13.659
 body as an accessory as investment 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.630
 it is as the same cosmetic product is the 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:19.270
 things people use comes too much 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.500
 One more tip for you, it's not for you. 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.190
 stop doing these things too 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.330
 because when someone is 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.940
 getting married decorating some place she goes 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:32.260
 look for decoration too but understand is 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.240
 it's a moment right the price is the opportunity 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.770
 it's an occasion 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.160
 all together that makes the sale 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.289
