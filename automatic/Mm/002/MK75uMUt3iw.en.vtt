00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.500
 welcome my name is falcon and 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.960
 this release I keep mine 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.630
 serials we talk today about 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.720
 second series of daredevil series 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.230
 I looked and and it seemed to me already 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.559
 much better one can say she 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.350
 even very cool the only thing that I do not 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:35.480
 I liked it that a lot of series 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.660
 distracted I was forced to look at 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.420
 the girl from the first series is a story that 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.290
 it seemed to me already finished and on friend 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.180
 muroka called phages but they 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.180
 uninteresting show me from any wrestler 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.690
 with crime he is the star of this show but 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.329
 No, we show that these two 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.540
 only that can be boring and that 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.050
 honest but one thing I know why was 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.509
 This storyline for driving time 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.329
 understand the main plot is enough but 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.509
 a maximum of 30 minutes and a series 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:14.330
 and should go 50 minutes and therefore 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.520
 Scriptwriters give the remaining time by this 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.490
 so do the two of them by the way in many 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.020
 TV shows there are even whole series that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.120
 only needed for the amount in which 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.100
 nothing at all going on some 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.770
 such unloading series well, for example 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.570
 if you take in all serious then the episode with 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.110
 fly he does not promote the plot at all 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.049
 no way and if this episode is cut out 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.060
 of the season the plotline of the whole 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.890
 the season will not suffer from this that is 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.100
 similar episodes are needed only to 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.479
 so that the season needed the number of episodes 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.159
 filmed they say so to the heap 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.680
 just as some are added 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.560
 storylines for the series to be necessary 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.330
 timekeeping and here I am forced 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.119
 tolerate moments of disclosure 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.640
 I donâ€™t know these two boring characters 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.939
 for now they are boring okay nelson 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.580
 it is necessary to open it suddenly Murdoch but 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.250
 I think that this young lady is no longer 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.789
 will appear in the series and no she is one of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.540
 characters and for its storyline me too 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.980
 forced to watch just do not speak 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.529
 me that she will then play some 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.329
 important in general this couple is not 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.020
 does in this series absolutely nothing 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.800
 except that 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.220
 that they thump yes everything is over 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.760
 their story line but let's get to the main 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.610
 so say the line who and which is cool and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.360
 so we in the last series ended up on that 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.320
 that someone kidnaps boy and morok 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.140
 hurries to the rescue 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.900
 probably between episodes he was ambushed 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.480
 and now it finds a new character 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.800
 series the beautiful nurse played 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.290
 Rosario Dawson 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.040
 she provides him free medical 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.920
 help 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.910
 because she had heard about his exploits 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.330
 well yes 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.150
 nurses all do so they don't even 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.850
 think to call the police they just drag 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.580
 wounded men to their home and treat them 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.000
 for many this is the only way to get out 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.620
 get married 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.990
 let's be honest and at this time Murdoch 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.270
 start visiting flashbacks from his 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.770
 I basically had enough of the past 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.890
 hero disclosures 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.410
 still in the first series well, I basically do not 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.530
 against the fact that its authors 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.930
 decided to deepen this very positive 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.010
 moment it looks interesting 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.320
 dramatically 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.260
 Murdoch motifs revealed through 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.870
 his father's story in the past actually 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.780
 before us are ordinary urban crazy 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.060
 whose hypertrophied feeling 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.080
 fairness interfering 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.690
 he lives normally and that is just 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.150
 revenge well such a poor blind batman 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.610
 something like that he is still 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.940
 vulnerable and distinguished from ordinary people 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.060
 only his blindness and 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.940
 Super abilities 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.490
 the long scuffle super hearing and super 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.740
 I liked the feeling 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.050
 what I can identify in principle 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.360
 him with himself that is before us not 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.300
 typical such hero he such 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.880
 mundane and realistic something 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.040
 more like an ordinary person in 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.859
 difference from the same ben affleck in the movie 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.350
 about a daredevil but back to the plot 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.500
 then some Russians appear again 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.460
 where, without them, I understand what exactly 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.860
 the Russians kidnapped that little fellow in the beginning 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.919
 at the end of the last series, they're kind of like 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.590
 general sale of people there ply well 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.750
 it's the Russians after interrogating one of 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.229
 Russian bandits Murdoch goes to help out 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.900
 the boy and the final action scene is just 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.650
 incredible talk more 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.900
 firstly the slow camera which is not 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.840
 rushes for the hero 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.870
 in general, such as if I was removed from 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.099
 so calm so u moves slowly 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.620
 so time departs and freezes and the whole action 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:09.639
 we watch with a static camera in 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.770
 secondly the whole scene is filmed in one double 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.310
 or so mounted that we don't see 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.780
 splicing in the third naturalistic 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.990
 the fight itself is beyond praise 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.930
 strikes choreography battle put almost 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.979
 not excellent in my opinion Murdoch 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.560
 tired him hurt he manages to rest 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.949
 in between fights we see that 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.590
 every movement is given to him with difficulty 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:40.960
 damn it's wonderful this scene i'm ready 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.800
 put on a par with the scene with 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.280
 hammer and 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.340
 is a cold fight or any other scene 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.190
 from the movie rate for example in general yes 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.190
 so it is good that it's just cool 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.320
 incredibly high-quality action 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.199
 interesting background of the hero 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.659
 Overall a beautiful series that takes away 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.960
 the bar for the rest of the show and 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.190
 if those two didn't interfere, then I generally 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.880
 could say that 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:13.180
 call this series a masterpiece as well 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.659
 I do not know at least joked normally and so 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:20.229
 only annoyed in general excellent but on 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:22.360
 this will all watch the third series with 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.539
 you were a falcon 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.650
 hand early understood with you was 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:32.699
 what is it with us was the falcon yet 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.699
 Now in time raised
