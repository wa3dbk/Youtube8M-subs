00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.230 
just trying to heat up my tires okay you
get<00:02:24.700> away<00:02:24.819> with<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> bit<00:02:25.239> more<00:02:25.390> idiocy

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.940 

they're<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:31.020> why<00:02:31.230> do<00:02:31.290> accelerating

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
they're like why do accelerating

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.290 
they're like why do accelerating
straight<00:02:32.130> towards<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.490> stoplight<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.180> then

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
straight towards a stoplight and then

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.180 
straight towards a stoplight and then
just<00:02:33.450> breaking<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.050> hard<00:02:34.320> once<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:34.950> love

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
just breaking so hard once you know love

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.550 
just breaking so hard once you know love
because<00:02:35.580> I'm<00:02:35.670> kind<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:35.970> my<00:02:36.030> tire<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.240> hot

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560

racing slicks on right now i'm still
getting<00:02:58.310> nervous<00:02:58.640> because<00:02:59.090> i<00:02:59.300> know<00:02:59.510> for<00:03:00.470> a

wet or and or dirty road and there's
always<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.800> chance<00:03:10.100> i<00:03:10.340> could<00:03:10.400> be<00:03:10.550> taking<00:03:10.790> one<00:03:10.880> of

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
always a chance i could be taking one of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.700 
always a chance i could be taking one of
these<00:03:11.060> corners<00:03:11.540> here<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.020> there<00:03:12.560> could<00:03:12.680> be

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
these corners here and there could be

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.860 
these corners here and there could be
water<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.550> road<00:03:13.760> especially<00:03:14.270> in<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
water on the road especially in the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.250 
water on the road especially in the
mountain<00:03:15.110> sometimes<00:03:15.410> people<00:03:16.100> will<00:03:17.080> come<00:03:18.080> out

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
mountain sometimes people will come out

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.020 
mountain sometimes people will come out
of<00:03:18.380> their<00:03:18.470> houses<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.010> i'll<00:03:19.160> take<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.460> hose<00:03:19.730> and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
of their houses and i'll take a hose and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.380 
of their houses and i'll take a hose and
it'll<00:03:20.060> spray<00:03:20.510> down<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.720> street<00:03:21.140> like<00:03:22.390> I've

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
it'll spray down the street like I've

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.090 
it'll spray down the street like I've
asked<00:03:24.200> questions<00:03:24.590> on<00:03:24.710> why<00:03:24.800> they<00:03:24.950> do<00:03:25.010> that

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
asked questions on why they do that

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.280 
asked questions on why they do that
because<00:03:25.370> it's<00:03:25.520> really<00:03:25.670> common<00:03:26.060> here<00:03:26.300> and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
because it's really common here and

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.600 
because it's really common here and
supposedly<00:03:27.890> they're<00:03:28.100> trying<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.280> dissipate

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
supposedly they're trying to dissipate

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.810 
supposedly they're trying to dissipate
the<00:03:28.670> heat<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.650> Sun<00:03:30.920> like<00:03:31.220> the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
the heat like the the Sun like the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.370 
the heat like the the Sun like the
pavement<00:03:32.270> absorbs<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:32.720> heat<00:03:32.750> from<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.080> Sun

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
pavement absorbs the heat from the Sun

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.260 
pavement absorbs the heat from the Sun
and<00:03:33.620> then<00:03:33.830> it<00:03:33.950> makes<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.550> just<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:34.880> raises

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
and then it makes it just it raises

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.090 
and then it makes it just it raises
temperature<00:03:35.750> in<00:03:35.990> front<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.590> their<00:03:36.680> print<00:03:36.890> for

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
temperature in front of their print for

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.160 
temperature in front of their print for
by<00:03:37.460> a<00:03:37.490> couple<00:03:37.730> of<00:03:37.790> degrees<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.570> they<00:03:38.690> get<00:03:38.870> water

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
by a couple of degrees so they get water

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.320 
by a couple of degrees so they get water
and<00:03:39.350> they<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:39.800> like<00:03:39.980> haste<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.120> they're

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
and they just like haste and they're

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.780 
and they just like haste and they're
spraying<00:03:41.690> water<00:03:41.930> on<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.350> road<00:03:42.560> just<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.640> help

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
spraying water on the road just to help

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.530 
spraying water on the road just to help
to<00:03:43.970> dissipate<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.780> heat<00:03:46.390> so

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.410 

so<00:03:51.110> yeah<00:03:51.829> so<00:03:52.129> I<00:03:52.159> never<00:03:52.310> know<00:03:52.670> even<00:03:53.209> though<00:03:53.299> even

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
so yeah so I never know even though even

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.640 
so yeah so I never know even though even
if<00:03:53.569> even<00:03:53.719> though<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.019> could<00:03:54.110> be<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.230> perfectly

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
if even though it could be a perfectly

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.160 
if even though it could be a perfectly
sunny<00:03:54.920> day<00:03:55.159> with<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.579> it<00:03:55.969> hasn't<00:03:56.299> rained<00:03:56.420> in<00:03:56.629> a

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
sunny day with and it hasn't rained in a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.869 
sunny day with and it hasn't rained in a
long<00:03:57.379> time<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.950> could<00:03:58.310> still<00:03:58.489> be<00:03:58.579> going<00:03:58.790> around

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
long time I could still be going around

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:59.949 
long time I could still be going around
one<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.090> these<00:03:59.209> corners<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.719> all<00:03:59.840> of<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.930> sudden

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
one of these corners and all of a sudden

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.949 
one of these corners and all of a sudden
roads<00:04:00.409> wet<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.579> with<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.239> in<00:04:02.450> mind<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.840> know

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
roads wet and with that in mind you know

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.369 
roads wet and with that in mind you know
it<00:04:03.109> makes<00:04:03.469> me<00:04:03.560> leery<00:04:03.939> so<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:06.079> it<00:04:06.170> makes<00:04:06.319> me

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
it makes me leery so and it makes me

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.339 
it makes me leery so and it makes me
leery<00:04:06.680> enough<00:04:07.010> that<00:04:07.189> i<00:04:07.220> don't<00:04:07.609> think<00:04:07.670> i<00:04:07.879> will

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
leery enough that i don't think i will

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.539 
leery enough that i don't think i will
go<00:04:09.349> with<00:04:09.379> racing<00:04:09.829> slicks<00:04:10.040> again<00:04:10.340> in<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
go with racing slicks again in the

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.210 
go with racing slicks again in the
future<00:04:11.079> because<00:04:12.079> there<00:04:12.290> are<00:04:12.709> enough<00:04:12.950> tires

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
future because there are enough tires

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.670 
future because there are enough tires
out<00:04:13.519> there<00:04:13.819> that<00:04:14.689> you<00:04:14.810> don't<00:04:14.840> have<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.260> get

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
out there that you don't have to get

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.550 
out there that you don't have to get
racing<00:04:15.980> slicks<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:17.660> be<00:04:17.810> competitive<00:04:18.199> on<00:04:18.500> a

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
racing slicks to be competitive on a

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.370 
racing slicks to be competitive on a
racetrack<00:04:19.509> because<00:04:20.509> there's<00:04:20.690> there<00:04:21.259> are

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
racetrack because there's there are

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.499 
racetrack because there's there are
tires<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:21.919> are<00:04:22.039> there<00:04:23.000> are<00:04:23.060> actually<00:04:23.300> tires

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
tires that are there are actually tires

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.770 
tires that are there are actually tires
