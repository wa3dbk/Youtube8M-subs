HD<00:00:59.820> move<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> springs<00:01:00.870> around<00:01:00.990> so<00:01:01.320> wherever

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
HD move the springs around so wherever

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.290 
HD move the springs around so wherever
you<00:01:01.650> want<00:01:01.830> the<00:01:01.890> position

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.720 

so<00:01:04.900> when<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.110> go<00:01:05.230> into<00:01:05.500> what<00:01:06.160> applications

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
so when you go into what applications

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.160 
so when you go into what applications
are

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
are

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.990 
are
the<00:01:08.650> absence<00:01:08.979> showing<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.280> standard<00:01:09.759> but<00:01:09.909> if

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
the absence showing a standard but if

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.370 
the absence showing a standard but if
you<00:01:10.119> look<00:01:10.240> carefully<00:01:10.479> here's<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.170> little

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
you look carefully here's a little

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.740 
you look carefully here's a little
defining<00:01:11.799> line

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
defining line

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.990 
defining line
so<00:01:14.350> we'll<00:01:14.980> go<00:01:15.100> into<00:01:15.220> each<00:01:15.340> section<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.880> the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
so we'll go into each section of the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.270 
so we'll go into each section of the
applications<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.770> scoot<00:01:18.010> over<00:01:18.160> to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
applications when you scoot over to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.400 
applications when you scoot over to
where<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:18.430> star<00:01:18.730> is<00:01:18.760> this<00:01:19.720> will<00:01:19.900> show<00:01:20.080> what<00:01:20.320> if

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
where the star is this will show what if

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.770 
where the star is this will show what if
the<00:01:20.470> most<00:01:20.650> frequent<00:01:21.130> use<00:01:22.060> apps<00:01:22.300> are<00:01:22.540> so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
the most frequent use apps are so

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.640 
the most frequent use apps are so
instead<00:01:22.960> of<00:01:23.080> scrolling<00:01:23.260> through

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
instead of scrolling through

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.500 
instead of scrolling through
alphabetical<00:01:24.580> order<00:01:24.820> is<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.910> lot<00:01:25.060> quicker<00:01:25.300> and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
alphabetical order is a lot quicker and

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.970 
alphabetical order is a lot quicker and
easier<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:26.110> show<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.860> what's<00:01:27.070> been<00:01:27.100> used

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
easier to show you what's been used

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.710 
easier to show you what's been used
when<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> screw<00:01:29.850> over<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
when you screw over to here now this

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.790 
when you screw over to here now this
will<00:01:30.840> show<00:01:30.870> you<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> app<00:01:31.260> stuff<00:01:31.560> and

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
sharp it is if I move this down it would

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.520 
sharp it is if I move this down it would
trust<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.940> size<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.480> so<00:04:23.230> I'm<00:04:23.320> just<00:04:23.410> going

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
trust the size of it so I'm just going

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.900 
trust the size of it so I'm just going
to<00:04:23.590> put<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.830> over<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:26.050> handset<00:04:26.440> itself<00:04:26.910> so

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
to put it over the handset itself so

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.760 
to put it over the handset itself so
when<00:04:28.450> I<00:04:28.480> put<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.720> on<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.930> handset<00:04:29.380> stock<00:04:29.620> you
