those criteria perfectly I've been using

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.010 
those criteria perfectly I've been using
it<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.440> several<00:00:46.980> years<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.270> unique<00:00:48.660> force

it for several years it's a unique force
that<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.440> stand<00:00:49.800> alone<00:00:49.860> or<00:00:50.309> be<00:00:51.030> combined<00:00:51.480> with

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
that can stand alone or be combined with

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.189 
that can stand alone or be combined with
other<00:00:52.020> tricks<00:00:52.969> when<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> want<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> make<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> trick

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
other tricks when I want to make a trick

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.430 
other tricks when I want to make a trick
out<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> force<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.430> even<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.360> often<00:00:57.780> when

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
out of a force or even more often when

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.029 
out of a force or even more often when
my<00:00:59.370> entire<00:00:59.760> trick<00:01:00.030> depends<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.800> force

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
my entire trick depends on the force

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.080 
my entire trick depends on the force
this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> method<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.449> use<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.729> too

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this is the method I use and now you too

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.659 
this is the method I use and now you too
