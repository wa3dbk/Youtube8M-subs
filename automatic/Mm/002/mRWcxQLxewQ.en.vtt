a<00:00:22.350> feature<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.800> comes<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.340> fences<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
a feature that comes with fences and is

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.870 
a feature that comes with fences and is
available<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> free<00:00:25.859> version<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.519> so

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
available in the free version of it so

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.029 
available in the free version of it so
it's<00:00:27.060> good<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.720> actual<00:00:28.140> reason<00:00:28.830> why<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
it's good the actual reason why you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.310 
it's good the actual reason why you
would<00:00:29.369> use<00:00:29.580> fences<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:31.019> allows

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
would use fences is because it allows

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.830 
would use fences is because it allows
you<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.590> create<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:32.579> allocated<00:00:33.390> spaces

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
you to create little allocated spaces
