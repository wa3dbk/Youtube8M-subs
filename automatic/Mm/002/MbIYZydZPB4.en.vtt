00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.130
 today the adventure of the 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.210
 videorectas for sweet hours 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.250
 we'll start with a cava cake and 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.839
 strawberries that I learned to do thanks to 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.440
 one of the books that I brought from my 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.880
 last trip to bavaria 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.760
 we started putting the butter 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 melted on steve cookies 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.439
 that should be well crushed 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.610
 and stir well with a spoon 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.560
 now we will put the cookies in our 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.570
 22 cm mold that should be 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.570
 previously papered with vegetal paper 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.850
 we will crush well with a spoon 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.770
 worrying that the whole cookie 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.320
 is well spread all the edges 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.899
 if it is not then we seem well 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.899
 we would get the liquid underneath 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.149
 then we will take our 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.470
 strawberry jam and we will break them well 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.470
 for the entire cookie base 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.500
 and I use a silicone spatula and I 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.500
 It goes very well 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.220
 now with some strawberries that we have 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.110
 filleted about a quarter 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.209
 part of the 500 grams 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.599
 we will complete the edge of all our 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.599
 mold 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.630
 we will try not to leave space between 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.580
 strawberry and strawberry 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.820
 and then you will see that is very nice to 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.820
 final 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.020
 Now we will make our filling by putting 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.800
 the yogurt 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.800
 in a bowl 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.840
 the sugar 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.040
 the strawberries that have to be fine 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.040
 chopped 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.640
 and the champagne in which we will have diluted 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.640
 the gelatin sheets 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.230
 It is convenient that it is a little hot on 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.120
 champagne because the gelatine melts 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.420
 best 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.640
 we will give a couple of laps 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.580
 and with the cream that we will previously have 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.850
 mounted 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.850
 we will put everything together and perform 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.900
 enveloping movements with the spatula 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.900
 until you get the result 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.830
 now we will take everything and put it to 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.830
 our mold and flatten we have good 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.000
 when we have finished we found it 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.510
 in the fridge while doing the 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.510
 cover 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.300
 we will talk about the cover 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.159
 with the strawberry gelatin that we will make 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.309
 according to package instructions with 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:56.330
 150 milliliters of water 3 tablespoons 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.330
 sugar tureens 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.150
 and the other half of the cava 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.689
 Let cool and put it on 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.580
 our mold 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.159
 when they have gone from five to six 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.209
 hours we unmold and I hope that I have 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.209
 liked this dessert
