why there might not be a way to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.029 
why there might not be a way to
jailbreak<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.300> point<00:00:48.570> o<00:00:49.010> firmware<00:00:50.010> which

this is freaking stupid we need to make
third<00:01:51.030> party<00:01:51.390> apps<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.290> firmware<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
third party apps for this firmware you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.969 
third party apps for this firmware you
know<00:01:53.729> whatever<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.689> they<00:01:54.840> say<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.740> make

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
know whatever so they say we make

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.870 
know whatever so they say we make
installer<00:01:56.759> app<00:01:57.320> installer<00:01:58.320> dot<00:01:58.619> app<00:01:58.799> seed<00:01:59.579> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
installer app installer dot app seed and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.749 
installer app installer dot app seed and
they<00:02:00.329> find<00:02:00.600> an<00:02:00.750> exploit<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.979> get<00:02:02.219> installer

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
they find an exploit to get installer

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.850 
they find an exploit to get installer
app<00:02:03.180> onto<00:02:04.369> for<00:02:05.369> more<00:02:05.610> 1<00:02:05.850> point<00:02:06.149> 1<00:02:06.329> point<00:02:06.600> 1<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
app onto for more 1 point 1 point 1 and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.969 
app onto for more 1 point 1 point 1 and
then<00:02:08.789> people<00:02:09.149> start<00:02:09.599> making<00:02:09.929> apps<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.679> fit

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
then people start making apps which fit

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.500 
then people start making apps which fit
the<00:02:11.129> framework<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.879> work

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the framework and work

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.720 
the framework and work
these<00:02:13.720> are<00:02:13.900> all<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.170> gritty<00:02:14.709> little<00:02:15.129> apps<00:02:15.370> and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
these are all the gritty little apps and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.380 
these are all the gritty little apps and
they<00:02:16.420> all<00:02:16.599> work<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:17.439> all<00:02:17.650> fun<00:02:17.920> until

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390

said<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.140> f-word<00:02:26.290> all<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.860> kids<00:02:27.189> okay<00:02:28.500> then

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
said the f-word all you kids okay then

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.520 
said the f-word all you kids okay then
hackers<00:02:30.760> say<00:02:31.239> no<00:02:31.540> no<00:02:31.720> no<00:02:32.220> screw<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.579> mr.<00:02:34.150> jobs

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
hackers say no no no screw you mr. jobs

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.160 
hackers say no no no screw you mr. jobs
cuz<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:35.769> have<00:02:36.069> another<00:02:36.670> exploit<00:02:37.360> right<00:02:37.840> there

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
cuz we have another exploit right there

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.319 
cuz we have another exploit right there
and<00:02:38.470> then<00:02:39.069> all<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.400> pretty<00:02:39.760> apps<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.299> people

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
and then all the pretty apps that people

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.429 
and then all the pretty apps that people
made<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:41.319> go<00:02:41.500> back<00:02:42.209> yay<00:02:43.209> now<00:02:43.900> everyone's

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
made can go back yay now everyone's

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.670 
made can go back yay now everyone's
happy<00:02:44.859> and<00:02:45.040> then<00:02:45.489> Steve<00:02:45.790> Jobs<00:02:46.260> does<00:02:47.260> two<00:02:47.470> more

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
happy and then Steve Jobs does two more

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.360 
happy and then Steve Jobs does two more
screws<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.400> screw<00:02:49.239> use<00:02:49.629> and<00:02:50.099> releases<00:02:51.099> new

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
screws you screw use and releases new

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.210 
screws you screw use and releases new
firmwares<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.329> then<00:02:52.599> in<00:02:52.840> turn<00:02:53.079> hackers<00:02:53.950> find

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
firmwares and then in turn hackers find

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.180 
firmwares and then in turn hackers find
exploits<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.060> all<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.480> apps<00:02:55.629> work<00:02:56.019> okay<00:02:56.590> now

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
exploits and all the apps work okay now

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.149 
exploits and all the apps work okay now
this<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:57.760> why<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.079> easy<00:02:59.109> on<00:02:59.769> firmware

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
this is why it's not so easy on firmware

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.690 
this is why it's not so easy on firmware
to<00:03:00.579> point<00:03:00.849> out<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.659> see<00:03:01.900> job<00:03:02.349> says<00:03:02.769> screw<00:03:03.430> you

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700

to point out you see job says screw you
again<00:03:04.239> I'm<00:03:05.079> gonna<00:03:05.530> make<00:03:05.799> new<00:03:06.310> frameworks<00:03:07.239> for

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
again I'm gonna make new frameworks for

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.800 
making apps and release firmware to 10
and<00:03:11.260> then<00:03:11.709> hackers<00:03:12.010> say<00:03:12.340> no<00:03:12.519> no<00:03:12.760> screw<00:03:13.329> you<00:03:13.510> mr.
