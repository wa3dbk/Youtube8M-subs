00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.840
 there, Easter will be later 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.219
 she is at the beginning of May and as well as asked in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.050
 Does this need to be done in any way? 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.599
 I am against the seeds and how it will affect in general 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.009
 for landing I understand that on the part 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.289
 Questions answered but still can 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.239
 be clarified yet this moment yes this 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.869
 the question also generally has some 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:34.910
 value because this year easter y 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:39.050
 we are on May 5 a trinity respectively June 23 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.050
 true and sunday April 28th usually as 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.900
 Would these people have proceeded from these dates 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.930
 when planting some crops is considered 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.890
 the fact that generally planting in open ground 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.150
 you can start only when past 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.080
 trinity i.e. then the threat passes 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.420
 the last frosts but in general how much am I 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.280
 do gardening and horticulture 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.350
 I have a big garden practice 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.979
 and I have this habit of leading 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.490
 diaries and me diaries for 20 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.840
 For years, they are constantly maintained 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.240
 eight years I'm not skipping at all 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.020
 one day everything is fixed I looked 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.970
 my old records found that 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.040
 last return frosts which 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.050
 were on May 23 they happened only one 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.229
 one thousand nine hundred and ninety-three 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.380
 that is, it is in the conditions of the area that is 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.229
 20 years intermediary actually frosts 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.780
 there was of course climate warming she 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.570
 obviously there is therefore in general 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.200
 threats but you can be afraid you can not be afraid 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.549
 you can take some risks but all 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.430
 equal for example until May 9 anyway 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.940
 no risk and some landing 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.750
 it is better not to produce it as it were in 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.909
 axion 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.909
 yes it is an axiom that well
