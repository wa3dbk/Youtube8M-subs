roles the world we're running out of
fish<00:00:38.120> people<00:00:39.120> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.420> eat<00:00:39.510> more<00:00:39.720> seafood

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
fish people want to eat more seafood

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.950 
fish people want to eat more seafood
because<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:42.060> understanding<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.900> the

because of the understanding of the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440 
because of the understanding of the
health<00:00:43.230> benefits<00:00:43.770> associated<00:00:44.130> with<00:00:44.520> simple

health benefits associated with simple
wave<00:00:45.630> diet<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.160> fish<00:00:47.580> are<00:00:47.730> made<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> are

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
wave diet so the fish are made and are

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090 
wave diet so the fish are made and are
getting<00:00:48.600> more<00:00:48.900> creative<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.500> oceans<00:00:49.830> cannot

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
getting more creative the oceans cannot

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.910 
getting more creative the oceans cannot
give<00:00:50.340> any<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.330> we<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:52.110> respond<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
give any more so we are like respond to

in<00:01:12.210> large<00:01:12.390> positive<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:13.649> problem<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.249> that

in large positive the problem is that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.239 
in large positive the problem is that
most<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> practices<00:01:15.990> right<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:16.530> for

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
most of the practices right now for

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.270 
most of the practices right now for
aquaculture<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:19.079> very<00:01:19.350> efficient<00:01:20.039> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
aquaculture are not very efficient and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.090 
aquaculture are not very efficient and
also<00:01:20.850> mainly<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.719> have<00:01:21.899> some<00:01:22.170> big<00:01:22.560> adverse

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
also mainly you have some big adverse

large cages we got from water and this

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.679 
large cages we got from water and this
is<00:01:33.749> a<00:01:33.929> very<00:01:34.259> problematic<00:01:34.799> practice<00:01:35.700> because

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
is a very problematic practice because

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.279 
is a very problematic practice because
it<00:01:37.079> has<00:01:37.319> an<00:01:38.009> adverse<00:01:38.399> environmental<00:01:39.210> impact

the mobile food goes into the water a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.719 
the mobile food goes into the water a
lot<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.810> white<00:01:46.079> cotton<00:01:46.380> flew<00:01:46.710> over<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.490> water

the<00:01:50.999> police<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.659> can't<00:01:51.929> see<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:53.219> immune

the police you can't see the immune
system<00:01:54.359> is<00:01:54.509> compromised<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.609> system

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
system is compromised and so the system

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.239 
system is compromised and so the system
is<00:01:57.299> very<00:01:57.659> gross<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.289> addressing<00:01:58.709> in<00:01:58.859> event<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
is very gross and addressing in event of

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.530 
is very gross and addressing in event of
the<00:01:59.429> environment<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.899> not

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
the environment but it's not

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.720 
the environment but it's not
really<00:02:01.900> optimal<00:02:02.500> position<00:02:03.010> provide<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.520> fish

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
really optimal position provide the fish

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.500 
really optimal position provide the fish
in<00:02:04.030> there<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:05.110> what<00:02:05.260> we<00:02:05.440> developed<00:02:05.920> here<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.400> a

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
in there so what we developed here is a

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.500 
in there so what we developed here is a
unique<00:02:07.510> new<00:02:08.290> generation<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.520> agriculture
