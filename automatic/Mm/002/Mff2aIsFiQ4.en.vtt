still<00:00:08.010> would've<00:00:08.220> hit<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.370> tree<00:00:09.110> even<00:00:10.110> if<00:00:10.170> he

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
still would've hit the tree even if he

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.910 
still would've hit the tree even if he
did<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.440> break<00:00:10.830> switch<00:00:11.219> now<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:12.210> will<00:00:12.420> have

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
what I've been doing is I've been using

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.320 
what I've been doing is I've been using
the<00:01:03.030> die<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.739> know<00:01:04.860> cut<00:01:05.330> because

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the die to kind of you know cut because

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.000 
the die to kind of you know cut because
the<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.729> brake<00:01:09.240> cables<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.530> part<00:01:10.860> that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the the brake cables this part that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.820 
the the brake cables this part that
comes<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.340> from<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:13.290> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
comes down from here down is kind of the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.039 
comes down from here down is kind of the
bulb<00:01:14.010> part<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> stops<00:01:15.570> normally

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
bulb part about here it stops normally

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.260 
bulb part about here it stops normally
and<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.100> part<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.640> threaded<00:01:18.000> so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and then this part is not threaded so

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
and then this part is not threaded so
I've<00:01:18.600> threaded<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> rest<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.920> then<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
I've threaded the rest of it and then I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.880 
I've threaded the rest of it and then I
took<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> spring<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.659> when<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> clamp<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
took the spring which when you clamp it

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
took the spring which when you clamp it
far<00:01:23.100> enough<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> spring<00:01:23.790> binds<00:01:24.090> flat<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
far enough the spring binds flat and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.270 
far enough the spring binds flat and
then<00:01:24.869> basically<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.560> having<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> collar

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
then basically it's like having a collar

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.420 
then basically it's like having a collar
you<00:01:26.369> can't<00:01:26.610> possibly<00:01:26.820> push<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> any<00:01:27.600> further

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
you can't possibly push it any further

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.149 
you can't possibly push it any further
so<00:01:30.200> because<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.320> ran<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> room<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
so because I ran out of room in the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.679 
so because I ran out of room in the
cable<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.880> don't<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> shoes<00:01:33.479> are<00:01:33.600> just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
cable I don't know if the shoes are just

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.560 
cable I don't know if the shoes are just
worn<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.799> adjusted<00:01:35.220> wrong

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
worn out or this is adjusted wrong

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.760 
worn out or this is adjusted wrong
because<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.140> actually<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.619> has

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
because you get this is actually it has

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
because you get this is actually it has
teeth<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.909> fine<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.509> move<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
teeth we can it's fine you can move it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
teeth we can it's fine you can move it
and<00:01:40.340> I'm<00:01:41.340> sure<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> had<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.729> apart<00:01:42.030> before<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.420> I

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and I'm sure I had it apart before so I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.760 
and I'm sure I had it apart before so I
might<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> wrong<00:01:43.409> spot

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
might just have that in the wrong spot

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.929 
might just have that in the wrong spot
but<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.509> cut<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> spring<00:01:45.899> down<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.610> this

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
but I cut the spring down so that this

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.600 
but I cut the spring down so that this
can<00:01:48.149> move<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.450> further<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:50.009> took<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.310> cable

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
can move up further and I took the cable

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.330 
can move up further and I took the cable
off<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.090> spent<00:01:51.600> some<00:01:51.750> time<00:01:51.990> running<00:01:52.500> wd-40

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
off and spent some time running wd-40

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.780 
off and spent some time running wd-40
down<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.939> moving<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.540> up<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.640> it's<00:01:56.640> about

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
down it for moving it up and it's about

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.730 
down it for moving it up and it's about

used to work really good
what<00:02:06.130> else<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.399> got<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:09.129> got<00:02:09.160> uh<00:02:09.670> yeah<00:02:09.940> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
what else we got we got uh yeah the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.850 
what else we got we got uh yeah the
reverse<00:02:11.170> right<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.650> don't<00:02:11.800> have<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> rear<00:02:12.310> I

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
reverse right so I don't have the rear I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.059 
reverse right so I don't have the rear I
don't<00:02:14.860> have<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.010> rear<00:02:15.280> brake<00:02:15.640> cable<00:02:16.090> on<00:02:16.150> here<00:02:17.069> so

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
don't have a rear brake cable on here so

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.559 
don't have a rear brake cable on here so
this<00:02:19.349> with<00:02:20.349> them<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.269> these<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
this with them to get these in the

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.820 
this with them to get these in the
reverse<00:02:22.900> what<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.170> got<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.379> do<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.650> there's

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
reverse what you got to do is there's

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.680 
reverse what you got to do is there's
button<00:02:24.129> you<00:02:24.190> push<00:02:24.370> down<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.879> it<00:02:25.180> locks<00:02:25.390> in

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
button you push down and it locks in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.720 
button you push down and it locks in
this<00:02:25.870> lower<00:02:26.769> level<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.840> lower<00:02:29.110> lever<00:02:29.730> and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
this lower level this lower lever and

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.400 
this lower level this lower lever and
then<00:02:30.879> it<00:02:31.000> pulls<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.269> cable<00:02:31.629> that<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.080> know

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
then it pulls the cable that you know

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.690 
then it pulls the cable that you know
allows<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.860> go<00:02:32.980> into<00:02:33.160> reverse<00:02:33.280> when<00:02:33.640> you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
allows it to go into reverse when you

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.630 
allows it to go into reverse when you
kick<00:02:33.879> down<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.129> parking<00:02:36.519> brake

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
kick down so this is a parking brake

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.339 
kick down so this is a parking brake
handle<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.120> unscrewed<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.930> tightened<00:02:38.260> it

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
handle I unscrewed it and tightened it

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.280 
handle I unscrewed it and tightened it
down<00:02:38.380> on<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> button<00:02:39.069> so<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.840> don't<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.140> to

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
down on the button so you don't have to

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.479 
down on the button so you don't have to
push<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.650> button<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.010> if<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.160> wanna<00:02:42.280> get<00:02:42.370> in

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
push that button so if you wanna get in

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.100 
push that button so if you wanna get in
reverse<00:02:42.730> now<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.000> got<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.420> do<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.630> do<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.750> and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
reverse now I got to do is do that and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.550 
reverse now I got to do is do that and
then<00:02:44.230> kick<00:02:44.440> down<00:02:44.620> once<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.220> then<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.489> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
then kick down once and then like a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.839 
then kick down once and then like a
which<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.680> gonna<00:02:47.769> be<00:02:47.860> way<00:02:48.040> faster<00:02:48.250> than<00:02:48.549> like

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
which is gonna be way faster than like

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.280 
which is gonna be way faster than like
trying<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.120> push<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.480> down<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.049> pull<00:02:50.230> it

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
trying to push that down and pull it

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.550 
trying to push that down and pull it
back<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.970> with<00:02:51.970> no<00:02:52.120> brake<00:02:52.420> cable<00:02:53.049> it's<00:02:53.319> really

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
back and with no brake cable it's really

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.309 
back and with no brake cable it's really
easy<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.799> pull<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.660> big<00:02:55.660> improvement<00:02:56.140> there

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
easy to pull to so big improvement there

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.699 
easy to pull to so big improvement there
I<00:02:56.530> was<00:02:57.430> gonna<00:02:57.579> just<00:02:57.880> adjust<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.810> you

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
I was gonna just adjust it so that you

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.530 
I was gonna just adjust it so that you
don't<00:02:59.860> have<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.160> pull<00:03:00.340> anything<00:03:00.579> and<00:03:01.209> you<00:03:01.420> can

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
don't have to pull anything and you can

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.920 
don't have to pull anything and you can
just<00:03:01.690> kick<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.930> down<00:03:02.049> into<00:03:02.230> reverse<00:03:02.560> but<00:03:03.930> first

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
just kick it down into reverse but first

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.960 
just kick it down into reverse but first
I'm<00:03:05.110> really<00:03:05.170> worried<00:03:05.860> about<00:03:05.920> I'm<00:03:06.370> sure<00:03:06.790> I

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
I'm really worried about I'm sure I

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.490 
I'm really worried about I'm sure I
would<00:03:07.180> do<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.360> at<00:03:07.450> some<00:03:07.569> point<00:03:07.629> too<00:03:07.930> but<00:03:08.140> Adam

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
would do it at some point too but Adam

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.140 
would do it at some point too but Adam
would<00:03:08.980> probably<00:03:09.370> definitely<00:03:09.730> end<00:03:09.850> up<00:03:09.910> down

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
would probably definitely end up down

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.379 
would probably definitely end up down
shifting<00:03:11.430> straight<00:03:12.430> into<00:03:12.850> reverse

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
shifting straight into reverse

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.729 
shifting straight into reverse
and<00:03:13.690> blown<00:03:13.870> up<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.109> transmission<00:03:14.500> or

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
and blown up to transmission or

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.040 
and blown up to transmission or
something<00:03:15.480> so

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.110 

so<00:03:19.740> I<00:03:19.770> got<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:22.490> this<00:03:23.490> fender<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:23.940> like

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
so I got that this fender is like

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.540 
so I got that this fender is like
completely<00:03:24.720> falling<00:03:25.080> off<00:03:25.200> I'm<00:03:26.160> gonna<00:03:26.310> have<00:03:26.460> to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
completely falling off I'm gonna have to

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.790 
completely falling off I'm gonna have to
either<00:03:26.610> attach<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.180> better<00:03:27.360> or<00:03:27.660> give<00:03:28.140> up<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.470> it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.240 

see<00:03:31.800> how<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:31.980> goes<00:03:35.210> what<00:03:36.210> else<00:03:36.360> we<00:03:36.570> gonna<00:03:36.660> say<00:03:36.930> I
