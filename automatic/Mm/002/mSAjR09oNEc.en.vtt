00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello swami uks we put in this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.240
 video I would like to move away from the subject 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.429
 apple and make a small review 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.349
 and unpacking to a new console from 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 sony company called sony 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.910
 playstation 4 so let's start with the design 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.690
 boxes on the front of us 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.210
 drawn 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.099
 and the ps4 itself and next to it is 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.869
 The inscription ps4 and also here we have drawn 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.960
 new sony joystick 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.399
 dualshock 4 so you and I have a version on 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.380
 500 gigabytes and let's start looking 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.070
 on the other sides of the box so on this 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.750
 side we have the inscription sony ps4 and on 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.489
 the opposite of our country drawing on 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.129
 which depicts what is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.520
 inside the box on the back of the box 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.190
 we have all the sony family and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
 games that will soon be released on ps4 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.309
 and so let's start unpacking our 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.949
 short and we need you Che's cut 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.559
 this one is a sticker to get to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.100
 the contents of the box and of course open 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.250
 the box itself and so raise this 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.520
 strap store and unpack our 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.350
 box of course box design from ps4 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.509
 no way to compare with the design action 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 boxes of apple company where everything is simple 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.310
 and fast so channel here inside us 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.750
 itself ps4 on which while to look not 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.140
 we will and see what else we have 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 inside 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.549
 let's get a new joystick from 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.689
 sony company called sony 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.820
 4 smell not as deduced by design 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.549
 almost unchanged besides 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.450
 A new trackpad has been added, both in MacBooks and 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.909
 other laptops well, basically a joystick 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.220
 Feels the same as the previous one 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.710
 generations well, although there is such a feeling 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.420
 novelty because we just got it 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.490
 out of the box basically a joystick 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.950
 normal and think what to play on it 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.189
 it will be convenient and comfortable let's take off 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.170
 these stickers that nobody needs well 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.850
 here is such a joystick but 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.770
 good enough joystick trackpad 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.530
 again works quite well on 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.390
 right 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.959
 happy with him him more in the following videos about 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.850
 ps4 well, so on the first sensations all 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.840
 done pretty very good i would 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.000
 even said in spirit 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.830
 apple and let's gotta joystick and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.780
 let's see what else we have inside 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.600
 boxes so this is such an envelope 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.650
 in which we have a subscription to sony 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.370
 playstation plus 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.170
 and here is such an instruction on 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.720
 users and so we still have here 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.510
 a bunch of wires we need too 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.239
 consider and start with the first wire 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.190
 that grow lies this headset then 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.390
 there are headphones through which you can 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.970
 connect to the gamepad and listen to the sounds 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.570
 games and movies well, in general, what do you want 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.590
 But then we have the wire goes already 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.860
 which allows you to connect sony ps4 to 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.380
 Well TV or other monitor and 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.500
 Well, the usual hdmi wire principle here 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.930
 nothing to say packed again not in 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.420
 the spirit of the apple is all so wrapped up somehow on 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.370
 it is very beautiful but although someone is 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.600
 interested in when we buy such a thing 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.010
 and so on we have a wire network that is 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.970
 in order to connect 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.640
 on ps4 itself and the last wire is 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.489
 yusb to connect the joystick and so 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.470
 Now let's get to it very ps4 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.500
 We again packaged in a spirit of apple 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.690
 never once in films of some kind but in 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.500
 overall not very nice sony packed 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.540
 your own product but ps4 as you can see 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.940
 beautiful so now i focus on me 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.280
 cameras that is the angle and we are with you 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.620
 look at the design of this console 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.030
 so i changed the camera focus and now we 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.370
 we can put on the design I want right away 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.299
 say he 's cut in the side 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.040
 as you can see, well, in general, I do not know 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.810
 why in sony did so but looks 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.609
 cool enough and so let's 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.400
 look at the ports which is on 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.810
 of our console and so this is our pro for 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.460
 Internet as I understand it 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.430
 I already have ethernet in my opinion 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.640
 and wire to connect to the network like me 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.140
 I understand I can be wrong again in this I 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.270
 not sure and so also with us here 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.820
 there is a cooler and which are very strong 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.760
 rustle well which cools itself 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.220
 prefix well here I think the explanation is necessary and 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.200
 so from this side we have drawn something 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.970
 what to support ps4 that is what 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.730
 technology as we see blue-ray here 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.180
 hdmi and much more interesting and on 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.480
 front of us is the inscription sony ps4 and 2 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.190
 yusb port in principle, these are all ports 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.410
 are located which is on this 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.570
 console and feel like I want to say that 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.220
 console top is really nice and 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.370
 to the feeling that she has this 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.610
 soft-touch plastic and glass I liked 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.380
 ps4 design 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.070
 in the spirit I was in the spirit of some 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.620
 and strong minimalism but to me in general 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.910
 I like the design and feel ps4 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.980
 really turned out good 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.900
 Prefix 4 is also good 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.060
 controller and which one is perfect 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.220
 fits into the design of this console 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.570
 and here such turned out for today 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.190
 review i hope you liked it 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.170
 video do not forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.170
 put video evaluation to write an opinion 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:20.450
 about sony ps4 in the comments at the microphone 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.450
 as always, there was fx for all
