00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
the money that I collect would go right

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.520 
the money that I collect would go right
back<00:03:54.090> into<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.449> youtube<00:03:54.750> channel<00:03:54.780> somehow

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
back into the youtube channel somehow

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.409 
back into the youtube channel somehow
some<00:03:56.009> way<00:03:56.040> most<00:03:56.609> of<00:03:56.699> would<00:03:56.849> be<00:03:56.970> upgrading

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
some way most of would be upgrading

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.999 
some way most of would be upgrading
hardware<00:03:57.810> for<00:03:58.109> example<00:03:58.530> I'd<00:03:58.650> get<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.829> better

00:03:58.999 --> 00:03:59.009 
hardware for example I'd get a better

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.479 
hardware for example I'd get a better
mic<00:03:59.310> or<00:03:59.609> I<00:03:59.870> would<00:04:00.870> get<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.799> better<00:04:02.069> computer

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
mic or I would get a better computer

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.800 
mic or I would get a better computer
that<00:04:02.759> might<00:04:02.879> be<00:04:03.000> more<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.329> long-term<00:04:03.540> thing

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
that might be more of a long-term thing

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.080 
that might be more of a long-term thing
one<00:04:04.319> that's<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:04.560> faster<00:04:05.189> can<00:04:05.430> hold<00:04:05.669> more

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
one that's just faster can hold more

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.309 
one that's just faster can hold more
information<00:04:06.840> all<00:04:07.409> that<00:04:07.680> kind<00:04:07.889> of<00:04:07.949> stuff<00:04:08.009> and

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
information all that kind of stuff and

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.009 
information all that kind of stuff and
really<00:04:10.319> it's<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.889> kind<00:04:11.729> of<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:12.120> decision<00:04:12.870> that

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
really it's just kind of a decision that

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.020 
really it's just kind of a decision that
I'm<00:04:13.199> making<00:04:13.560> because<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:13.949> feel<00:04:14.519> that<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.729> put<00:04:15.000> a

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
I'm making because I feel that I put a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.539 
I'm making because I feel that I put a
lot<00:04:15.359> of<00:04:15.419> hard<00:04:15.720> work<00:04:15.780> into<00:04:16.079> these<00:04:16.289> videos<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.009> I

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
lot of hard work into these videos and I

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.370 
lot of hard work into these videos and I
spent<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.030> much<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.209> my<00:04:18.329> time<00:04:18.389> doing<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.169> that

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
spent so much of my time doing it that

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.899 
spent so much of my time doing it that
may<00:04:19.650> be<00:04:19.709> making<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.159> little<00:04:20.280> bit<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.549> revenue

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
may be making a little bit of revenue

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.670 
may be making a little bit of revenue
would<00:04:21.030> be<00:04:21.180> something<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.599> would<00:04:21.780> be<00:04:22.409> pretty

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
would be something that would be pretty

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.219 
would be something that would be pretty
fair<00:04:23.009> for<00:04:23.250> me<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.430> get<00:04:24.150> because<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.840> put<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.139> much

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
fair for me to get because I put so much

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.860 
fair for me to get because I put so much
work<00:04:25.470> into<00:04:25.680> what<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.159> do<00:04:26.280> here<00:04:26.639> on<00:04:26.789> YouTube<00:04:27.180> but

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
work into what I do here on YouTube but

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.659 
work into what I do here on YouTube but
don't<00:04:28.139> get<00:04:28.229> me<00:04:28.289> wrong<00:04:28.529> I<00:04:28.680> love<00:04:28.950> what<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.219> do<00:04:29.310> I

don't get me wrong I love what I do I

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.459 
don't get me wrong I love what I do I
wouldn't<00:04:30.479> give<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.690> up<00:04:30.870> for<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.050> world<00:04:31.260> I

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:31.469 
wouldn't give this up for the world I

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:32.300 
wouldn't give this up for the world I
love<00:04:31.710> making<00:04:31.950> big

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
love making big

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.850 
love making big
for<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.790> guys<00:04:32.940> it's<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.360> much<00:04:33.510> fun<00:04:33.750> but<00:04:34.620> it

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
for you guys it's so much fun but it

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.100 
for you guys it's so much fun but it
does<00:04:35.070> take<00:04:35.220> up<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.580> lot<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:35.760> my<00:04:35.910> time<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.750> think

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
does take up a lot of my time so I think

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.570 
does take up a lot of my time so I think
it's<00:04:37.290> fair<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.800> can<00:04:38.010> just<00:04:38.220> generate<00:04:38.400> a

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
it's fair that I can just generate a

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.270 
it's fair that I can just generate a
little<00:04:38.790> bit<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.090> revenue<00:04:39.420> from<00:04:39.540> this<00:04:40.280> sophal

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
something like that so I'll probably end

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.900

up<00:05:22.530> doing<00:05:22.800> that<00:05:22.950> just<00:05:23.400> because<00:05:23.610> it's<00:05:23.730> kind<00:05:23.820> of

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
up doing that just because it's kind of

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.540
