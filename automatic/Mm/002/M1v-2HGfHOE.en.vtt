this<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.879> another<00:03:42.150> block<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.689> just<00:03:43.560> find<00:03:43.799> the

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
this is another block we just find the

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.059 
this is another block we just find the
wine<00:03:44.010> bar<00:03:44.250> through<00:03:44.629> and<00:03:45.629> it's<00:03:46.620> already<00:03:46.950> been

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
wine bar through and it's already been

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.619 
wine bar through and it's already been
bored<00:03:47.340> for<00:03:47.609> tea<00:03:47.760> but<00:03:47.969> what<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.269> want<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.480> show

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
bored for tea but what I want to show

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.649 
bored for tea but what I want to show
you<00:03:48.689> here<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.129> the<00:03:50.129> bearings<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.420> how<00:03:51.569> the

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
you here is the bearings and how the

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.009 
you here is the bearings and how the
case<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.170> shifted<00:03:52.969> you<00:03:53.969> can<00:03:54.120> see<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.689> left

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
case is shifted you can see to the left

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.759 
case is shifted you can see to the left
there<00:03:55.260> how<00:03:55.469> it's<00:03:56.310> uncut<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.930> look<00:03:58.139> up

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
there how it's uncut and you look up

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.129 
there how it's uncut and you look up
here<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.219> top<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.730> on<00:03:59.909> the<00:04:00.090> right<00:04:00.900> hand

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
here on the top it's on the right hand

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.259 
here on the top it's on the right hand
side<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:02.340> means<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.849> case<00:04:03.030> is

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
side so that means that the case is

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.809 
side so that means that the case is
shifted<00:04:03.659> at<00:04:03.780> some<00:04:03.989> point<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.609> one<00:04:05.760> of

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
shifted at some point and this is one of

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.390 
shifted at some point and this is one of
the<00:04:05.879> reasons<00:04:06.209> why<00:04:06.359> we<00:04:06.540> made<00:04:06.719> our<00:04:07.069> special<00:04:08.069> jig

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the reasons why we made our special jig

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.429 
the reasons why we made our special jig
for<00:04:08.700> putting<00:04:09.180> in<00:04:09.329> shuffle<00:04:09.900> pins<00:04:10.079> on<00:04:10.290> these

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
for putting in shuffle pins on these

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.099 
for putting in shuffle pins on these
things<00:04:10.620> where<00:04:10.950> we<00:04:11.069> actually<00:04:11.189> put<00:04:11.400> six<00:04:12.389> pins<00:04:12.750> in

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
things where we actually put six pins in

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.619 
things where we actually put six pins in
