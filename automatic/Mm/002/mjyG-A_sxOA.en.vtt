00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.680
 hello to all that as they are waiting 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.810
 that are very well in these last days 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.780
 as I've been watching the video a lot 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.610
 shakira with pitbull and I love it as much as 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.309
 it looks specifically I like the part 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.080
 that she sang more but I love 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.390
 As you can see that suit I want it 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.640
 I want a suit like that so with what color 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.980
 Gold is perfect at the stop for 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.020
 Christmas I 'm not going I want a so be 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.630
 new and specifically true me 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.850
 it costs expensive but like five 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.160
 colors without you to see if I get one 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.479
 and then nothing to me I love the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.580
 machinist who is already there because 

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:40.120
 it's still super natural as well as that 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.519
 he wants bright I love it and he is also 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.580
 a typical makeup of her I do not know if 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.470
 you see pictures of them and all this 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.360
 It was a makeup that already tends to 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.489
 use constantly specifically already 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.379
 uses a lot of gold and bronze colors I do not know 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.390
 how I love they fascinate me 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.049
 choose why they illuminate both the face to 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.750
 I do not love myself very much and then nothing 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:06.210
 I wanted to adapt that look like that to my 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.210
 in my style I just hope you like it 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.820
 since we have our base applied 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.920
 we are going to apply a pre-base for 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.600
 shadows all over the mobile eyelid towards 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.000
 the eyebrow bone to match the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.070
 area we apply a shadow in cream with 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.230
 the bronze around the mobile eyelid this 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.630
 optional step but I like to do it 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.640
 I do not know why it gives you a little more 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.790
 shine to these shadows come out a little bit 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.010
 more vibrant we are going to take a shadow 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.020
 gold a little pink and we will be 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.000
 applying from the arch of the eyebrow towards 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.880
 the basin to have that area much more 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.979
 illuminated we apply a shade color 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.720
 bronze around the mobile eyelid we're going 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.100
 to be applying to taps and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.100
 subtly dragging 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.930
 we also apply the shadow with the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.930
 bronze in the lower part of the eyes 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.030
 followed by a brown eyeliner 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.719
 dark as close as possible to the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.719
 upper lashes 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.990
 and we are going to apply it slightly 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.780
 we blur this delineated pretty well 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.780
 that almost does not look 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.590
 now let's blur all those 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.750
 shadows and eyeliners that we apply 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.670
 previously we will blur it to 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.400
 everything joins and nothing is noticed 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.410
 We apply a brown eyeliner 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.850
 medium tone throughout the water line 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.280
 so that it looks a bit more like that 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.290
 natural we illuminate the lacrimal with a 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 Vanilla shadow gives these colors are 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.520
 perfect to illuminate I love them 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.550
 we soften the shadow a bit with the 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.410
 fingers yes I know it's not the same mask to 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.240
 the typical original mask of l'orÃ©al 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.390
 I use but nothing I'm trying 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.800
 new things so well then we're going 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.930
 to be applying on the tabs 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.160
 superiors or kant we are also going to 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.380
 apply the mask on the eyelashes 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.420
 inferiors but this time only in the 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.040
 second half so that the eye can 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.230
 see a little bit bigger we apply 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.240
 bronzer where we usually stay 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.520
 by the sun and at the same time we are going to 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.860
 do the outline but very slightly 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.750
 we apply a pink coral blush in the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.500
 cheeks so we can see a little more 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.500
 tanned 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.450
 we apply illuminator on the face to 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.850
 have that extra brightness like me 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.250
 I love I do not know about you but me 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.530
 love how this lip smells we apply 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.690
 a little touch in old pink lipstick for 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.640
 almost not so strong and so what 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.620
 let's blur with your fingers so that 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:55.610
 Join us a little more with our color 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:57.200
 current of the lips good to have it 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.060
 finished they saw that it's super easy to 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.130
 make it simple and bring an appearance 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.710
 well clean well fresh natural well 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.750
 well typical of shakira and it is also 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.520
 perfect for the daily show because I 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.710
 I imagine that all of us or the majority 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.970
 of us we almost always look for 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.010
 that look natural but with makeup 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.580
 I do not know how to highlight a little more 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.440
 the factions and all that but if I do not know 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.150
 without putting a lot of color on the face aside 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.870
 of that I mean like that without putting 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.389
 a lot like in the face 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.610
 we are pushing handlebars and all that 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.380
 only but you understand me as 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.660
 it's in makeup 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.320
 it's not made up anyway I hope you 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.320
 have liked today 

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.799
 today
