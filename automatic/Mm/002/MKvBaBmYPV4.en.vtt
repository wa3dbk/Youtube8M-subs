00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
working on a project called spot which

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.859 
working on a project called spot which
is<00:01:54.710> location-based<00:01:55.340> file-sharing<00:01:55.940> it's

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
is location-based file-sharing it's

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.630 
is location-based file-sharing it's
essentially<00:01:57.350> giving<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.830> digital<00:01:58.280> memory<00:01:58.429> to

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
essentially giving a digital memory to

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.669 
essentially giving a digital memory to
invisible<00:01:59.030> location<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.140> what<00:02:00.530> we're<00:02:00.649> trying

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
invisible location so what we're trying

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.979 
invisible location so what we're trying
to<00:02:00.860> do<00:02:01.009> is<00:02:01.280> an<00:02:01.970> example<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.539> actually<00:02:02.929> this

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
to do is an example is actually this

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.300 
to do is an example is actually this

four dollars a month to their account

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.520 
four dollars a month to their account
every<00:02:37.129> every<00:02:37.730> month<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.090> eventually<00:02:39.080> sort<00:02:39.440> of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
every every month and eventually sort of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.970 
every every month and eventually sort of
decide<00:02:40.400> where<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.790> give<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.269> based<00:02:41.540> on<00:02:41.750> a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
decide where to give that to based on a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.320 
decide where to give that to based on a
crowd-sourced

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
crowd-sourced

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.059 
crowd-sourced
so<00:02:44.330> our<00:02:44.510> company<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:44.930> called<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.290> tow<00:02:45.440> truck<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
so our company is called a tow truck and

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.470 
so our company is called a tow truck and
we're<00:02:46.250> trying<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.520> make<00:02:46.670> an<00:02:46.790> online<00:02:47.180> website

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
we're trying to make an online website

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.210 
we're trying to make an online website
or<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.080> can<00:02:48.230> compete<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.709> save<00:02:49.010> energy

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
or you can compete the save energy

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.880 
or you can compete the save energy
amongst<00:02:49.819> your<00:02:49.940> friends<00:02:50.200> let's<00:02:51.200> written<00:02:51.560> so

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
amongst your friends let's written so

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.710 
amongst your friends let's written so
basically<00:02:52.310> we<00:02:52.430> comfort<00:02:52.790> from<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.120> energy

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
basically we comfort from the energy

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.750 
basically we comfort from the energy
environment<00:02:54.380> background<00:02:55.010> at<00:02:55.160> Stanford<00:02:55.580> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
environment background at Stanford and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.960 
environment background at Stanford and
so<00:02:56.090> we're<00:02:56.720> trying<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.110> create<00:02:57.800> a<00:02:57.980> platform<00:02:58.640> for

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
so we're trying to create a platform for

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.729 
so we're trying to create a platform for
competition<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.750> encourage<00:03:00.110> green<00:03:00.319> behavior

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
competition to encourage green behavior

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.470 
competition to encourage green behavior
like<00:03:00.890> taking<00:03:01.220> public<00:03:01.370> transportation<00:03:01.819> using

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
like taking public transportation using

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.240 
like taking public transportation using
energy<00:03:02.840> efficient<00:03:03.290> lighting<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:04.040> just

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
energy efficient lighting and just

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.089 
energy efficient lighting and just
making<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.610> fun<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:05.090> incentivize<00:03:05.599> further

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
making it fun to incentivize further

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.160 
making it fun to incentivize further
energy<00:03:07.099> changing<00:03:07.550> measures<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.750> how<00:03:09.019> is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
energy changing measures and how is

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.540 
energy changing measures and how is
being<00:03:09.380> here<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:09.709> weekend<00:03:10.040> helping<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.430> guys

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
time at Stanford and it isn't this like

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.059 
time at Stanford and it isn't this like
Silicon<00:03:14.630> Valley<00:03:14.870> area<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.769> know<00:03:15.890> there's

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
Silicon Valley area and you know there's

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.650 
Silicon Valley area and you know there's
so<00:03:16.160> much<00:03:16.280> energy<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:17.030> lot<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.209> people<00:03:17.630> just

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660
