00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780
 due to the race of your rodrigo and this is 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.780
 wonder 21 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.550
 today was a movie one 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.010
 ranchera without gay because I fake because I 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.810
 enough for our lasagna we will be 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.490
 perfectly likes the ranchera and a 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.200
 Once it's ready let's lower it 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.700
 perfectly that it is in house for 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.890
 accompany thousands of vegetable samples 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.480
 pumpkin peppers and onions 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.920
 we take the actuators at the time 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.349
 to propose a little later 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.600
 leave them thin then we will perform 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.030
 a bÃ©chamel sauce based on a mixture 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.250
 of flour and butter which 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.379
 we will take a paste 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.390
 homogeneous once we have this 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.100
 homogenous mix what we are going to do is 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.960
 start diluting with a little milk 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.519
 little by little until you dilute the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.949
 completely that has nothing of 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.070
 very important lumps let's give it a 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.920
 touch of nutmeg salt and a bit of 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.210
 white pepper to hold the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.220
 incorporating a bit of onion to 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.049
 To flavor our sauce a little we are going to 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.790
 continue doing until you have a 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.409
 little more consistency once ready 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.940
 our sauce we proceed to scratch the 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.950
 cheese and we start with our brother 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.930
 for the assembly in our lasagna in a 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.720
 rectangular or square container 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.940
 aluminum or some salary that we have 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.210
 at home we proceed to put a base of 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.460
 ranchera vegetables sauce and a little the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.220
 grated cheese repeating this neither a nor 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 two three times taking our three 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.550
 levels the only thing we're going to do is 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.500
 finish with a little cheese and we 're going 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.300
 to take to our coffin until 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.300
 our case is totally gratinated 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.720
