numbers<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.289> down<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.800> bit

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
numbers are down a little bit

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.020

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
particularly in the wide receiver

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
particularly in the wide receiver
position<00:00:48.230> but<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:49.980> were<00:00:50.100> able<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> we

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
position but you know we were able to we

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.650 
position but you know we were able to we
were<00:00:50.789> able<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.120> through<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.300> pretty<00:00:51.420> well

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
were able to get through it pretty well

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.740 
were able to get through it pretty well
I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.260> everybody's<00:00:53.449> working<00:00:54.449> hard<00:00:54.480> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
I think everybody's working hard you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.139 
I think everybody's working hard you
know<00:00:55.070> he's<00:00:56.070> creating<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> different<00:00:56.820> sense<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
know he's creating a different sense of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.630 
know he's creating a different sense of
urgency<00:00:57.210> around<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:01.640> think

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
urgency around here so I think I think

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
urgency around here so I think I think
it's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> good<00:01:03.180> atmosphere<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
moving the right direction very positive

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.450 
moving the right direction very positive
what<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:40.070> know<00:01:40.390> with<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.450> coaches<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.900> his

us to do and their expectations I think

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.330 
us to do and their expectations I think
it's<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.710> very<00:01:49.130> positive<00:01:49.720> I<00:01:51.100> think<00:01:52.100> we're<00:01:52.220> had

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
it's a very positive I think we're had

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.219 
it's a very positive I think we're had
you<00:01:52.490> know<00:01:52.580> heading<00:01:52.790> in<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.060> good<00:01:53.090> direction<00:01:53.270> you

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
you know heading in a good direction you

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.370 
you know heading in a good direction you
know<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.380> think<00:01:54.710> there's<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.190> clear<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:56.570> think

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
know I think there's a clear I think

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.350 
know I think there's a clear I think
coach<00:01:58.310> Schwartz<00:01:58.640> has<00:01:58.760> a<00:01:58.790> clear<00:01:59.000> vision<00:01:59.150> of

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
coach Schwartz has a clear vision of

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.810 
coach Schwartz has a clear vision of
what<00:01:59.420> he<00:01:59.660> wants<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.920> communicates<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.640> very

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
what he wants and communicates it very

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.510 
what he wants and communicates it very
well<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:03.229> think<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.830> players<00:02:04.040> are<00:02:04.250> working

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
well and I think the players are working

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.240 
well and I think the players are working
hard<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:06.260> accomplish<00:02:06.710> those<00:02:06.830> things<00:02:06.890> these

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
hard to to accomplish those things these

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.190 
hard to to accomplish those things these
actions<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.479> try<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.259> achieve<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:11.200> you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
actions to to try to achieve and you

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.530 
actions to to try to achieve and you
know<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.290> think<00:02:12.500> right<00:02:12.950> now<00:02:13.130> it's<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:13.760> you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
know I think right now it's it's you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.270 
know I think right now it's it's you
know<00:02:14.630> we're<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.260> good<00:02:15.440> situation<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:16.100> think

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
know we're in a good situation I think

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.310 
know we're in a good situation I think
we've<00:02:16.370> had<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.520> great<00:02:16.730> offseason<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.540> think

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
we've had a great offseason I think

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.940 
we've had a great offseason I think
we've<00:02:18.620> gotten<00:02:18.890> done<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.640> know<00:02:19.820> our<00:02:20.000> coaches

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
we've gotten done to know our coaches

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.460 
we've gotten done to know our coaches
well<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:23.480> think<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:23.959> figured<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.320> what

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
well and we think we figured out what

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.740 
well and we think we figured out what
they<00:02:24.590> expect<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.550> think<00:02:26.390> they've<00:02:26.540> had<00:02:26.720> a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
they expect and I think they've had a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.970 
they expect and I think they've had a
chance<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:28.390> kind<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.420> see<00:02:29.600> what<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.200> know<00:02:30.320> us
