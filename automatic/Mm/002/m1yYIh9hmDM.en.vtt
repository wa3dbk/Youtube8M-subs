that possibility when we get together

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.619 
that possibility when we get together
we're<00:03:14.769> going<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:15.189> make<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.549> changes<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.180> are

we're going to make the changes that are

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.610 
we're going to make the changes that are
needed<00:03:16.900> now<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:18.700> Abington<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.689> can<00:03:20.139> do<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.439> I

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
needed now it's Abington I can do it I

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.490 
needed now it's Abington I can do it I
can<00:03:21.280> do<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.700> with<00:03:21.849> your<00:03:21.969> help<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:23.019> can<00:03:23.260> do<00:03:23.409> it

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
can do it with your help you can do it

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.770 
can do it with your help you can do it
and<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:23.799> they<00:03:24.400> can<00:03:24.639> do<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:24.909> they<00:03:24.939> can<00:03:25.120> go<00:03:25.420> before

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
and so they can do it they can go before

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.640 
and so they can do it they can go before
we<00:03:25.959> know<00:03:26.139> it<00:03:26.430> get<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:28.840> can<00:03:29.019> clean<00:03:29.319> up<00:03:29.349> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
we know it get it we can clean up the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.530 
we know it get it we can clean up the
oceans<00:03:29.859> we<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.430> do<00:03:30.639> something<00:03:30.939> for<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.419> air

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
oceans we can do something for the air

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.110 
oceans we can do something for the air
we<00:03:31.810> can<00:03:31.840> help<00:03:32.349> them<00:03:32.620> hunger<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.579> this<00:03:34.060> country

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
we can help them hunger in this country

we can help them hunger in this country
in<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.230> world<00:03:35.819> we<00:03:36.819> can<00:03:37.030> stop<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:38.040> inequities

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
in this world we can stop the inequities

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.530 
in this world we can stop the inequities
because<00:03:40.629> one<00:03:41.019> by<00:03:41.290> one<00:03:41.590> by<00:03:41.889> one<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.639> a<00:03:42.969> huge
