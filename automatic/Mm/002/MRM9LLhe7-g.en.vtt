00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.479 
or the choice to grab them all I should
say<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:05.780> it's<00:03:06.780> even<00:03:07.109> more<00:03:07.349> of<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.620> toolbox<00:03:08.099> stack

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
say so it's even more of a toolbox stack

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.689 
say so it's even more of a toolbox stack
so<00:03:08.849> uh<00:03:11.540> yeah<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.569> mean<00:03:13.109> that's<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.859> mean<00:03:14.579> the

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
so uh yeah I mean that's it I mean the

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.189 
so uh yeah I mean that's it I mean the
addresses<00:03:15.209> are<00:03:15.419> in<00:03:15.480> there<00:03:15.690> just<00:03:16.049> because

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.199 
addresses are in there just because

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.619 
addresses are in there just because
you're<00:03:16.500> melling<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.099> much<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:18.239> then<00:03:18.389> you<00:03:18.510> can

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
you're melling so much and then you can

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.270 
you're melling so much and then you can
synchro<00:03:19.049> summon<00:03:19.379> so<00:03:19.590> much<00:03:19.829> you're<00:03:20.069> going<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
synchro summon so much you're going to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.039 
synchro summon so much you're going to
have<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.549> monsters<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.299> graveyard<00:03:21.419> and

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
have the monsters in the graveyard and

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.879 
have the monsters in the graveyard and
then<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:23.069> allows<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.639> get<00:03:23.849> some<00:03:24.030> pluses

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
then that allows you to get some pluses

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.170 
then that allows you to get some pluses
the<00:03:25.889> rekindling<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:28.560> really<00:03:29.099> hurts<00:03:29.310> for<00:03:30.120> a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
the rekindling it really hurts for a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.750 
the rekindling it really hurts for a
deck<00:03:30.389> like<00:03:30.419> this<00:03:30.810> for<00:03:31.169> heavy<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.620> be<00:03:31.769> gone<00:03:32.010> just

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
deck like this for heavy to be gone just

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.339 
deck like this for heavy to be gone just
because<00:03:33.030> now<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.329> just<00:03:33.629> have<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.109> Nate<00:03:34.319> and

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
because now you just have to Nate and

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.250 
because now you just have to Nate and
cold<00:03:34.739> wave<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.790> let<00:03:36.000> your<00:03:36.209> big<00:03:36.660> place<00:03:36.989> go

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
cold wave to let your big place go

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.280 
cold wave to let your big place go
through<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.209> my<00:03:39.209> advice<00:03:39.329> to<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:40.079> don't

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
through so my advice to you just don't

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.150 
through so my advice to you just don't
go<00:03:40.410> crazy<00:03:40.440> when<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.940> know<00:03:42.769> want<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.919> try

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
go crazy when you you know want to try

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.150 
go crazy when you you know want to try
and<00:03:44.280> go<00:03:44.400> for<00:03:44.430> game<00:03:45.319> you<00:03:46.319> know<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.769> do<00:03:46.949> little

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
and go for game you know just do little

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.159 
and go for game you know just do little
pushes<00:03:47.730> because<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.419> don't<00:03:48.569> want<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.810> do<00:03:48.959> all

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
pushes because you don't want to do all

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.289 
pushes because you don't want to do all
this<00:03:49.290> stuff<00:03:49.349> if<00:03:49.769> your<00:03:49.980> opponent<00:03:50.190> has<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:51.180> know

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
this stuff if your opponent has you know

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.879 
this stuff if your opponent has you know
to<00:03:51.359> back<00:03:51.810> roads<00:03:52.139> or<00:03:52.319> something<00:03:52.709> like<00:03:52.829> that

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
to back roads or something like that

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.259 
to back roads or something like that
because<00:03:53.220> you're<00:03:53.549> probably<00:03:53.819> going<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.150> get

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
because you're probably going to get

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.649 
because you're probably going to get
hurt<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:56.030> really<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.359> marauding

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
hurt so I really like the marauding

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.020 
hurt so I really like the marauding
captain<00:03:57.780> attack<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.709> was<00:03:59.310> reading<00:03:59.609> over<00:03:59.699> it<00:03:59.940> I

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
captain attack I was reading over it I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.610 
captain attack I was reading over it I
always<00:04:00.299> thought<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.629> was<00:04:00.750> just<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.079> level<00:04:01.260> 4

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
always thought it was just the level 4

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.890 
always thought it was just the level 4
but<00:04:01.919> it's<00:04:02.069> level<00:04:02.430> 4<00:04:02.669> or<00:04:02.699> lower<00:04:03.299> so<00:04:03.659> you<00:04:03.750> can

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
but it's level 4 or lower so you can

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.649 
but it's level 4 or lower so you can
summon<00:04:04.169> all<00:04:04.500> these<00:04:04.739> guys<00:04:04.979> well<00:04:05.879> majority<00:04:06.629> of
