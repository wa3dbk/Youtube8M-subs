00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
ahead and put together would end up

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.770 
ahead and put together would end up

type was that I opened a night haller

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.139 
type was that I opened a night haller
which<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> rare<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.640> theorists<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.059> then

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
which is a rare from theorists and then

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.939 
which is a rare from theorists and then
I<00:01:03.210> also<00:01:03.390> opened<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> next<00:01:04.409> Weaver<00:01:04.559> which<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.830> one

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I also opened a next Weaver which is one

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.000 
I also opened a next Weaver which is one
of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> new<00:01:05.189> cars<00:01:05.430> from<00:01:05.610> journey<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
of the new cars from journey and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.440 
of the new cars from journey and
although<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> only<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.939> many<00:01:09.030> cards<00:01:09.360> we

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
although you only have so many cards we

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
although you only have so many cards we
have<00:01:09.540> 40<00:01:09.810> cards<00:01:09.990> unlimited<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.619> figured<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
have 40 cards unlimited I figured I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.330 
have 40 cards unlimited I figured I
could<00:01:11.220> fade<00:01:12.210> enough<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.130> enough<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
could fade enough of it enough of the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.280 
could fade enough of it enough of the
mill<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.150> warrant<00:01:15.509> being<00:01:15.540> able<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> put

good card I can see why they put it at

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.589 
good card I can see why they put it at
the<00:04:20.690> uncommon<00:04:21.440> slot<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:22.490> did<00:04:22.940> 24<00:04:23.240> when<00:04:23.330> somebody

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
the uncommon slot I did 24 when somebody

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:24.790 
the uncommon slot I did 24 when somebody
at<00:04:23.690> six<00:04:23.960> with<00:04:24.199> this<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.560> killed<00:04:24.740> two

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800

at six with this and killed two
creatures<00:04:25.720> also<00:04:26.720> then<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.199> have<00:04:27.349> a<00:04:27.380> Nixon

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979

fusion<00:04:28.370> here<00:04:28.639> I<00:04:28.789> really<00:04:29.210> like<00:04:29.330> this<00:04:29.479> one

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
fusion here I really like this one

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.240 
fusion here I really like this one
because<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.990> can<00:04:30.830> put<00:04:30.979> you<00:04:31.039> in<00:04:31.099> a<00:04:31.130> situation

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
because it can put you in a situation

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.219 
because it can put you in a situation
where<00:04:31.729> it<00:04:31.820> makes<00:04:32.000> something<00:04:32.630> like<00:04:32.840> cavern

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
where it makes something like cavern

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.070 
where it makes something like cavern
whimper<00:04:33.590> bigger<00:04:34.449> or<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.750> night<00:04:35.900> Haller

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
whimper bigger or the night Haller

whimper bigger or the night Haller
obviously<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:37.580> know<00:04:37.669> so<00:04:37.849> it<00:04:37.940> can<00:04:38.030> serve<00:04:38.210> as

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
obviously you know so it can serve as

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.080 
obviously you know so it can serve as
pump<00:04:38.599> or<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.380> can<00:04:39.500> actually<00:04:39.830> serve<00:04:40.669> as<00:04:40.789> removal

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
pump or it can actually serve as removal

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.980 
pump or it can actually serve as removal
which<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.270> lot<00:04:41.389> of<00:04:41.419> times<00:04:41.599> that's<00:04:41.720> what's<00:04:41.900> going

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
which a lot of times that's what's going

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.580 
which a lot of times that's what's going
to<00:04:42.110> happen<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:43.580> it's<00:04:43.699> very<00:04:43.820> good<00:04:44.090> it's<00:04:44.449> very
