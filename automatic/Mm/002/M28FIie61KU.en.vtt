00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.600
 Bank of England has published a report in which 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 noted 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.800
 cryptocurrencies can be critical for 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.420
 financial system of england about this we 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.930
 communicated mikhailom shepherd and us from 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.670
 kuna bitcoin agency if we talk about 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.439
 the impact of bitcoin on the financial system 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.560
 this is specifically the bank of england 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.970
 issued even which stated that 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.240
 cryptocurrency can hurt financial 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.529
 Sector England if they will 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.500
 significant amount and significant 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.930
 way will affect the market when 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.120
 will come and whether it will be as critical as 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:46.640
 plan and why definitely will 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:49.620
 the influence of bitcoin refers to so called 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.440
 destructive technologies that 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.820
 destroy the old device and build 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.120
 completely new world by analogy as 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.920
 cars changed the world of electricity and 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.589
 the last such revolutionary resolving 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.680
 technology it was internet she 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.650
 completely destroyed 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.619
 mail and telegraph we are such even difficult not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.320
 remember here nevertheless created a new 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.970
 ground for new absolute industry and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.140
 new turns of development have received from this 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.000
 respectively the fear of the bank of england 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.720
 understandable 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.670
 this is bitcoin first and foremost dangerous for 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.760
 existing financial system he 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.560
 dangerous for the dollar well and accordingly 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.750
 all other banks they anyway 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.790
 tied to american dollars and 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.150
 federal reserve system how 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.369
 way exactly bitcoin will be destroys 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.460
 system and how fast is it 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.940
 what happens is why bitcoin 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.800
 why are cryptocurrencies dangerous for the dollar 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.690
 as for the banking system you even 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.090
 destroy do not need itself fray we it 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.369
 see therefore bitcoin is just 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.920
 a tool that appeared on time and 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.979
 shows that there is an alternative to more 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.899
 interesting more transparent more 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.400
 controlled directly by humans 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.470
 which money they are banks or bankers 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.090
 accordingly here even destroy 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.520
 don't need anything ie we just give 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.850
 alternative which is more interesting here 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.590
 and all about the dollar on 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.000
 dollar well the whole world anyway 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.090
 tied to this backup 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.440
 finals reserve currency british 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.870
 the agreement is still valid 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.720
 accordingly, but the first is who it is 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.840
 dollar all other currencies are they under it 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.500
 anyway therefore of course it is also 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.320
 can be dangerous for the dollar let's say 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.510
 what could be the impetus for each 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.880
 will use bitcoin and in 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.280
 particular then 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.530
 cryptocurrency will be able to replace 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.880
 traditional currency because so far 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.940
 to quantify bitcoin does not 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.370
 so many people at the moment yes 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.860
 I agree 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.590
 impulse states already do everything 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.510
 to develop bitcoin that is any 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.270
 regulation it stimulates people 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.810
 switch to alternative alternative 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.989
 now this bitcoin is a prime example of this 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.320
 Cypriot crisis that was when 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.040
 colossal 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.790
 splash in bitcoin price as demand 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.730
 Here is an example when regulation 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.920
 or externally some kind of state or 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.989
 the regulator makes its own changes to 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.510
 existing financial system 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.000
 Restrictions of some kind here 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.820
 naturally desire appears this 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.950
 go somewhere where you control your 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.130
 money he bitcoins that is such a system 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.250
 that is, it turns out that investors are 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.320
 were in cyprus moved to bitcoin fearing for 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.400
 their money even those who were not in cyprus 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.410
 so it turns out that business is 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.350
 stimulating such a source of development 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.920
 bitcoin is not ready to say that business 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.170
 switched to bitcoin is more all the same 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.880
 panic any mood related 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.360
 with Cyprus, that is, we know that it is frozen 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:16.340
 there were both personal accounts and personal deposit and 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.340
 respectively some part 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.680
 individuals invested a bitcoin 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.009
 that is, got out of this situation through 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.139
 bitcoin at that time bitcoin was 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.539
 significantly less in price capitalization 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.820
 less accordingly there is an infusion in 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.979
 several million dollars could or to 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.820
 and actually they called this one 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:39.070
 splash in price up to 260 dollars for 1 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.380
 bitcoin bitcoin now use 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.139
 particular to investment funds or 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.030
 ability to convert traditionally 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.910
 currency through bitcoin export abroad 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.020
 and do not fall under the regulation and eke out 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.870
 some services goods is all you 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.729
 said besides it is worth considering 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.460
 its like billing first 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.560
 system and if you dig deeper then this 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.630
 tool precision instrument 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.520
 which the person himself defines 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.830
 determines what my instrument is on 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.009
 currently need it hammer it 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.300
 machine is a rake shovel or is it 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.889
 computer that is, everyone himself 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.139
 determine what he needs now 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.419
 bitcoin it can perform all functions 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.960
 that is, it can dig and be 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.669
 high-precision computer so in 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.729
 depending on the situation, that is, if 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.340
 someone problems with exercise 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:35.139
 payments for the same from abroad 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:38.979
 then bitcoin is the solution here is the withdrawal 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.780
 from the country there is also such a problem yes 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.280
 here we know that there was a regulation recently 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.990
 freedom national bank canceled it 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.979
 the ruling is now people again 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.509
 can receive translations from abroad 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.970
 There is bitcoin under these all prohibitions not 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:57.190
 falls accordingly there are no such risks 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:59.440
 But in general, by definition, he did not get 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.889
 maybe because it is not controlled not 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.870
 one state is not one person then 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.030
 there is no fiscal authority 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.070
 vanin that is national over 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.280
 state system that lives 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.900
 on the internet to everyone how business can 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.510
 use this tool if 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.460
 talking not about private investors not 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:27.580
 about individuals exactly business how 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:30.250
 mean if we are talking about america and 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.560
 Europe, then there business is already active 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.040
 enjoys bitcoin he's just him 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.760
 uses both as i repeat 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.440
 payment instrument. dark net then 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.680
 there is a visa mastercard 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:48.060
 the third is bitcoin up for example why 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.710
 because in their countries there is 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.180
 legislation has 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.370
 processing company which 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.050
 accept bitcoin automatically 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.400
 converts to local currency and 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:02.410
 sent to us by so and 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.470
 this scheme works cases on this scheme 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:10.150
 p baltic works according to this scheme 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.310
 virgin galactic expedia that is all 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.990
 big companies which here we are in 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.640
 made the news that they began to take 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.770
 bitcoin they are exactly working on this 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.970
 scheme, that is, there are no problems in Ukraine 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:23.200
 Unfortunately 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:25.930
 bitcoin is still in the gray area but 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.330
 if the gray area for individuals is allowed then 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.600
 gray area for legal entities is still more 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.970
 prohibition than allowed 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.850
 plus there is a problem with VAT that is 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.670
 how to charge vat on transactions in 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:44.590
 bitcoin here is the connection with these problems 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:48.040
 so far unfortunately legal entity we are talking about 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.320
 can't use bitcoin ie we 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.820
 talking only about business is small 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.400
 business fob 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.990
 first second third group yes they can 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.750
 individuals can use 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:04.000
 use about possible negative 

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.860
 the effects of bitcoin on 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.200
 the financial system of england we communicated 

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.690
