00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that so we have that now now go in front

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.380 
that so we have that now now go in front
of<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.559> pressure<00:01:04.890> plate<00:01:05.220> dig<00:01:05.670> down<00:01:05.909> three

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of your pressure plate dig down three

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.870 
of your pressure plate dig down three
and<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:06.930> dig<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.409> six<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.040> front<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and now dig out six in front of you and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
and now dig out six in front of you and
the<00:01:09.540> block<00:01:09.869> right<00:01:10.290> under<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> pressure<00:01:11.040> plate

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the block right under the pressure plate

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.320 
the block right under the pressure plate
dig<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.060> two<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:13.049> fill<00:01:13.380> those<00:01:13.560> blocks<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.330> so

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
dig out two now fill those blocks in so

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
dig out two now fill those blocks in so
you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> place<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:15.780> redstone<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.470> top<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
you can place some redstone on top of it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
you can place some redstone on top of it
so<00:01:17.270> you'll<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.450> exactly<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
so you'll see exactly how it's going to

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.200 
so you'll see exactly how it's going to
flow<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.890> let's<00:01:20.310> put<00:01:20.520> three<00:01:20.670> redstone<00:01:21.180> here

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
flow so let's put three redstone here

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
flow so let's put three redstone here
and<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.900> there<00:01:21.930> we're<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> build<00:01:23.310> back

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and one there we're going to build back

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.190 
and one there we're going to build back
up<00:01:23.640> we're<00:01:23.970> gonna<00:01:24.060> make<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> very<00:01:24.420> discreet

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
up we're gonna make it very discreet

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080 
up we're gonna make it very discreet
here<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.520> we're<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.000> we're

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
here and what we're going to do is we're

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030 
here and what we're going to do is we're

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
going to go to the left of this sticky

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.240 
going to go to the left of this sticky
piston<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.020> put<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> redstone<00:01:31.380> torch<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
piston here and put a redstone torch and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.160 
piston here and put a redstone torch and
cover<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.479> should<00:01:33.600> activate

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
cover that up and it should activate

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.480 
cover that up and it should activate
that<00:01:34.320> sticky<00:01:34.680> piston<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.250> right

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that sticky piston there it is right

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.460 
that sticky piston there it is right
there<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> activate<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> top<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.380> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
there now to activate the top one you

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350 
there now to activate the top one you
just<00:01:37.619> put<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> redstone<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.790> that's

just put the redstone there and that's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730 
just put the redstone there and that's
pretty<00:01:39.600> much<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.320> walk<00:01:40.439> over<00:01:40.560> the
