00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
 cyberport presents the new ipad from 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.740
 apple 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.750
 On 22 october 2013, the fifth became 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.139
 generation of the ipad presented 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.600
 the ipad is the new nickname 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.100
 of course to the macbook air which ago 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.390
 all through its ease and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.939
 elegance can score 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 if the ipad lives up to its name 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.720
 and whether it pays off on the successor 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.949
 we want to change now 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.009
 find out 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.710
 the technical data the ipad measures 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.460
 24 cm height 17 cm wide and 75 mm deep 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.530
 at a total weight of 469 grams 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.500
 the screen is a 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.809
 9 7 inch large retina display with a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.360
 resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels in the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.360
 inside of the ipad worked out a 1 3 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.120
 gigahertz apple a70 core processor with 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.329
 a gigabyte of memory 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.470
 application memory is optional 16 32 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.510
 64 or 128 gb and can not 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.950
 be extended 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.900
 If you take the device falls into your hands 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.080
 especially the extremely small one 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 weight on whopping 200 grams you have in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.009
 compared to the predecessor namely 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.810
 slimmed down to achieve this 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.110
 Apple but also the dimensions of the new 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.510
 tinkered 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.400
 it is now narrower and even smaller 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.720
 as the fourth generation the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.830
 display size is, however 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.020
 unchanged 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.000
 As far as the processing is concerned, one can 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.390
 apple once again nothing to fool 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.350
 everything looks robust high quality and noble 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.060
 thumbs up the display resolution is in 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.479
 Compared to the previous model the same 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.430
 stayed and offers with its 2048 x 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.210
 1536 pixels a pixel density of 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.430
 326 ppi 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.259
 that's enough for both texts and 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.190
 pics sharp and crisp 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.800
 show 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.320
 thanks to the ips technology , colors become 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.479
 and contrasts play perfectly no matter 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.310
 From what angle you look the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.410
 display brightness has a bit 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.790
 but it is up in the sunny sky 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.570
 still difficult from the screen 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.020
 read 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.959
 we give a good the operating system 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.970
 is called ios 7 and brings a whole series 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.330
 of new features and features 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.670
 yourself 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.830
 There is, for example, the new task 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.720
 manager bringing you apps comfortable 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.000
 manage and quit 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.620
 Furthermore, one can by horizontal 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.810
 or vertical between on the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.380
 homescreen quick access and programs 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.570
 to open 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.209
 The look of ios has also changed 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.940
 the apps are now looking flatter 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.280
 and the design more modern who 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.930
 especially an ipad grows the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.030
 also benefits from a whole 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.489
 special highlight apple donated 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.370
 namely the full version for all buyers 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.260
 ilife and iwork are installed these 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.540
 However, programs initially can not 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.989
 via the app store for free 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 be downloaded 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.519
 no matter if texts write calculations 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.180
 create movies or cut music 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.150
 compose 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.430
 it's all about it that transforms you 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.190
 The iPad he directly into an extensive 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.810
 We find office and leisure machine 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.730
 Great 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.930
 the camera on the back is after 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.870
 as before unchanged 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.730
 it resolves with 5 megapixels on has no 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.829
 lightning to the side and makes a total 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.560
 only a mediocre quality 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.480
 too bad is unchanged 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.799
 fact that the internal memory is not 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.930
 can be extended 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.989
 but there is a model with up to 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.849
 128 gigabytes of flash memory the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.380
 speaker on the bottom seems 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.450
 get a little more power 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.510
 Anyway, they sound like that now 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.250
 stronger and a bit louder otherwise 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.640
 the device still wlan bluetooth and 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.180
 alternatively lte on board nfc missing unfortunately 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.730
 again 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.560
 we will enter for this hardware package 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.030
 Well 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.220
 The battery has lost a little in size 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.930
 but does almost the same term 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.819
 like the ipad 4 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.340
 with average use he holds 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.200
 a full day of playback 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.150
 The device after ten makes the device after ten 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.760
 hours sleep provided the brightness 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.700
 the display accordingly decreases 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.230
 very good value 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.640
 summarized the ipad he has three 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.370
 new properties 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.190
 it is slimmer easier and faster 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.020
 as his predecessor except for the processor 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.739
 has hardly anything in the hardware area 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.680
 changed 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.509
 nevertheless, the ipad r 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.910
 still an excellent product 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.250
 Who does not have one can certainly 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.380
 think about a purchase especially 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.020
 the free software packages names 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.479
 sky live and iwork the ipad to one 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.820
 real all-rounder make the sooner 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.009
 upscale price in combination with 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.500
 the mediocre camera lets at this time 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.900
 But not the full score to us 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.430
 give 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.430
 4,55 cyber stars
