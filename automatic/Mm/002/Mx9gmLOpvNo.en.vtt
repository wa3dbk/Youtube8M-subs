this<00:01:22.710> other<00:01:22.950> container<00:01:23.479> then<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.840> are

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
this other container then which we are

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.590 
this other container then which we are
going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.130> melt<00:01:27.140> 50<00:01:28.140> grams<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.649> rock<00:01:28.920> sugar

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
going to melt 50 grams of rock sugar

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.819 
going to melt 50 grams of rock sugar
I've<00:01:30.600> been<00:01:30.810> tried<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.140> other<00:01:31.320> sugar<00:01:31.679> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
I've been tried with other sugar it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
I've been tried with other sugar it
could<00:01:31.979> possibly<00:01:32.280> work<00:01:32.429> but<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.909> want<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
could possibly work but if you want to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.760 
could possibly work but if you want to
find<00:01:33.479> rock<00:01:33.689> sugar<00:01:33.929> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.320> find<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.619> your

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
find rock sugar you can find that your

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.850 
find rock sugar you can find that your
load<00:01:34.979> local<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.990> find<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.110> my<00:01:37.259> local<00:01:37.409> Chinese

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
load local I find that my local Chinese

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.930 
load local I find that my local Chinese
supermarket<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> assume<00:01:41.459> your<00:01:41.610> local

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940

supermarket so I assume your local
Chinese<00:01:42.270> supermarket<00:01:42.569> and<00:01:43.200> now<00:01:44.039> we<00:01:44.100> wait<00:01:44.369> for

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
Chinese supermarket and now we wait for

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.300 
Chinese supermarket and now we wait for
the<00:01:44.759> gelatine<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> melt<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.950> rock<00:01:47.100> sugar

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the gelatine to melt and the rock sugar

00:01:47.310 --> 00:02:07.560 
the gelatine to melt and the rock sugar
to<00:01:47.490> melt<00:01:48.890> patience<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:49.979> necessary

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.889 

so<00:02:08.350> now<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.560> our<00:02:08.979> gelatin<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.030> melted<00:02:10.300> and

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
so now that our gelatin is melted and

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.500 
so now that our gelatin is melted and
our<00:02:11.410> sugar<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:12.010> melted<00:02:12.490> as<00:02:12.640> well<00:02:12.820> we<00:02:13.180> are<00:02:13.270> going

process we have to combine them with a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:14.670 
process we have to combine them with a
spoon<00:03:01.170> combining<00:03:03.600> with<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:14.110> okay<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.440> would

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
spoon combining with it and okay I would

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.199
