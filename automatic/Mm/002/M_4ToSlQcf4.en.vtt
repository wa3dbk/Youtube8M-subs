00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello friends there in casita I am 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.100
 trans and selene and I want to share with 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.010
 you my segment the recipes of the 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.670
 francis grandmother on the day I 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.919
 to make the cancer recipe yes sir and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.740
 we need for this recipe look 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:23.189
 very important ingredients the penca of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 Aloe Vera 3 penis of Aloe Vera 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.509
 rustic and at stake if you're the handy 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.619
 and you are what can be achieved in the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.520
 market 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.000
 We are going to need a liter or a half kilo 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.270
 I always recommend honey honey 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 which you are in that state is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.880
 say in the country or in the city where 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.160
 you live does not get to look honey 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.070
 other countries because you can always 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.220
 develop allergies besides that a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.380
 a dram is outside that more or 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.630
 least you can locate them but it's a chat 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.380
 they call him a glass of louis 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.590
 either brandy or cognac that 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.590
 would be the catalyst for this recipe a 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.760
 true knife and a blender that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.210
 way we will be able to 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 Blend and mix all the ingredients 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.580
 First of all we are going to eliminate all 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.630
 the thorns that are around 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.490
 of this wonderful and sacred maca these 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.680
 would the thorns only come in 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.290
 the ends is the way I 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 I anticipated what would be left at the end 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.750
 then you moving the crystal 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.720
 landmark of what aloe vera is going to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.340
 to be as in pieces more or less than 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.090
 this way and we're going to introduce them 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.030
 inside the blender well washed well 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.220
 clean and will not take away 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 no other part of the shell at 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.000
 introduce these elements we are going to 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.000
 add of course the liter of honey 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 or in the middle of honey 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.770
 have already been able to buy we are going to 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.830
 then add the brandy glass 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.009
 of the cognac whiskey remember that 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.459
 just catalyst a lot of people ask me 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.100
 but francis this would be then 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.600
 intervening with some medical formula 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.820
 not because they remember that it is a 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.310
 catalyst but if you have any doubt it is 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.140
 better ask your doctor about this 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.300
 we plug the blender 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.700
 in the speed that we most want 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.209
 us so we can make that pill 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.310
 we are going to pour everything into the set of 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.610
 the three banks that we have liquefied in 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.160
 a container preferably of glass and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.170
 you are going to keep it well in the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.620
 refrigerator or outside the refrigerator 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.520
 as you prefer it more as I go to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.060

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.310
 before as soon as 15 minutes before 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.260
 each community is to say if you eat 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.180
 three times a day to do three 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.689
 spoonfuls 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.319

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.780
 accesses on the skin and this is a symptom 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.569
 bad, this is not the best symptom 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.859
 you can have against this disease 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.780
