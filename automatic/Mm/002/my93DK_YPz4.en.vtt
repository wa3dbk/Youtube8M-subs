00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.019
 p 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.980

 a status of eta eta facebook if I wanted 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.670
 who has all the part of what is being light min 7 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 to which we are accustomed us in facebook also 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 so much torrox and are basically a floor in my friends 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.270
 and well that area one by one the sample is growing us everything that I am 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.740
 related people that we are concentrating in one place the 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.900
 phone in the essentials that we all go to the moment with rigor on the phone 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.420
 out of the box and added these stories and single translator information 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.570
 other part 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.560
 another focus for example handles produced that his son's 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.030
 of stocks that xbox osuna this one says that you are only going to be able to have 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.229
 smartphones that are very are not any other lee platform will not support 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.230
 and because it is important that we have a base of users of xbox 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.030
 per hundred that is very interesting that well you care a lot the part keep on 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.990
 example everything we did a first scooter with its 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.440
 his actions 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.110
 is 100% complete the social part here are not where the attack is the same 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.500
 who fears that there are elections in my house 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.520
 in this essay from mexico and that in this last one he managed that all this game of 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.510
 was with everything for example 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.190
 here if I had for example invitations from friends to play a 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.770
 I think it's a month and a half 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.459
 x person who better with you this game and if you can not download it right there 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.330
 I have several games 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.690
 which are registered for example 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.690
 so I never used a stick 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.689
 regarding this friendship 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.040
 failure of studies is an important part also that is what 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.439
 you comment cargo 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.579
 Last May, I believe that it is the only mobility company that has a 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.709
 client 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.499
 studied internal game development there is no company that what not only 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.109
 we have had time 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.239
 by xbox 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.849
 and it has very important titles like a small fire to be bribed by 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.609
 example the sojero 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:34.959
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.620
 the interesting thing about all this is true is that it will touch us power for the internet and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.730
 handcuffs two things 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.169
 a few hours 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:50.829
 after his words he expressed himself because it influences cavenaghi agr 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.749
 2 twelve months 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:00.479
 this since we have to leave the scene waiting list that allows us 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.979
 the case is that they look for an exit in any other side 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:08.209
 then this is one of the 13 games that succumbed coke beat the local 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.949
 avoid market 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:10.929
 percent 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:15.339
 is patent the mouth to explain slap the weak part of this writes is 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.399
 totally configurable for what is important to you, then put what 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.889
 you want here you can see 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.589
 for example that I have direct access to an internet page 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.949
 that is expressed aldrey 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.949
 I have percent applications that are frequently used 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.919
 read 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.359
 the southern part although that is not our media player 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.409
 we have the music player and radio sports 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.689
 and good for a hundred 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.869
 the idea is that chivas to the concept all everything that he himself the consumption of 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.900
 means and percent in one place what is when you buy a song 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.639
 wineries a song to 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.930
 mouth had windows phone automatically the phone will recognize it as 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:56.560
 music started to put where to be the same if it's my other wherever 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.909
 Ivan Acosta also integrated 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.719
 to make up the store d the May video that presides musical 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.889
 efe de sun create what our mp3 players demonstrate 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.019
 that we launched a few years ago and that now such an experience that could be 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.069
 present in all windows fox 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.189
 we also have gijÃ³n left a cesc is a young constants 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.919
 because we believe that we have the best experience of trade because another 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.999
 platform obviously we develop well because we are two 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.449
 properties and we wanted that in windows as for the best experience 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.169
 has things like banorte make up the air 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.919
 you can open percent while the axel files of now the speaker 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.370
 in short as a simple 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.529
 that almost a month 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.960
 detected the bridge 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.889
 tension for example is the biggest smallest 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.830
 Beijing could sit 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.300
 all the documents since hector roquel and without explorer ferrer 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.580
 by the main opponent 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.879
 joaquÃ­n otero confided yesterday to be seen as one of the tools of 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.780
 companies that has grown the most in terms of milestones that have taken Microsoft 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.329
 and these are basically nyse points and 13 bridges instead of collaboration that 

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:13.109
 is in life internal network of companies to be able to work in 

00:05:13.109 --> 00:05:15.460
 documents in conjunction with other people 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.460
 all of them can be done from here too 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.370
 other tools that are already something something that people expect to be accused of 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.740
 antezana part mail we have the integration with others 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.469
 g 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.609
 that obviously also changed a lot and local 13 6 points 5 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.330
 explicit the choirs in different ways of tdt is an advantage in 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.519
 each pressed for that angel applies only so simple 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.449
 emerging markets 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.610
 crisis the economic crisis 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.289
 ea and other improvements that also the exercise in time for example the 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.499
 explorer now and has assumed that it is multitouch i was something I wanted to go 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:58.020
 that we improve a lot on the continent exhaustion maps 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.559
 what a pity and 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.610
 this and obviously the part of the make this that exists 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.610
 is where you can buy both casinos and games with music 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.530
 but basically, basically, how can we see what we are trying to do? 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.449
 phone that works differently other tribes that will follow 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.349
 different 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.650
 and we want the functionality of the phones 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.860
 is more or less similar already in terms of passes dyes platforms but not 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.350
 only important what a phone killer like the corners we suffocate 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.779
 much in our philosophy develop 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.229
 thanks the cartagena
