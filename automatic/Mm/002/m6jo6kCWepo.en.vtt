this<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.250> being<00:00:41.489> big<00:00:41.750> mostly<00:00:42.750> because<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this one being big mostly because of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.979 
this one being big mostly because of
replayability<00:00:44.329> what<00:00:45.329> am<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.510> even<00:00:45.539> talking

constitutes the play area of this game
each<00:01:22.820> other<00:01:23.180> player<00:01:23.479> will<00:01:23.750> then<00:01:23.900> place<00:01:24.200> six

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
each other player will then place six

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.930 
each other player will then place six
cards<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.160> front<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.369> them<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:25.640> let's<00:01:25.790> say<00:01:25.910> I

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
cards in front of them so let's say I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.140 
cards in front of them so let's say I
have<00:01:26.030> satellites<00:01:26.450> diving<00:01:27.170> suit<00:01:27.410> bronze

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
have satellites diving suit bronze

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.600 
have satellites diving suit bronze
railroad<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.420> metric<00:01:30.110> system<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.649> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
railroad and metric system and the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.609 
railroad and metric system and the
violin<00:01:32.180> those<00:01:32.630> are<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.899> cards<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.470> front

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
violin those are the cards and in front

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.859 
violin those are the cards and in front
of<00:01:33.710> me<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:34.850> pick<00:01:35.090> one<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.390> these<00:01:35.450> cards

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
of me so I now pick one of these cards

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.840 
of me so I now pick one of these cards
so<00:01:35.960> let's<00:01:36.110> say<00:01:36.259> I'll<00:01:36.590> say<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.130> railroad<00:01:37.520> I'm

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
so let's say I'll say the railroad I'm

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.120 
so let's say I'll say the railroad I'm
pretty<00:01:38.090> sure<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.390> railroad<00:01:38.750> came<00:01:39.050> before<00:01:39.500> the

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
pretty sure the railroad came before the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.249 
pretty sure the railroad came before the
accordion<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.119> put<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.420> year<00:01:41.690> before<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
accordion so I put a year before the

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.710 
accordion so I put a year before the
accordion<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:42.890> then<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.070> flip<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.369> over<00:01:43.610> I<00:01:43.970> was

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
accordion and then I flip it over I was

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.469 
accordion and then I flip it over I was
right<00:01:45.250> 1763<00:01:46.250> haha

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
right 1763 haha

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.190 
right 1763 haha
now<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.670> next<00:01:49.940> player<00:01:50.180> they're<00:01:50.780> gonna<00:01:50.960> take

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
now the next player they're gonna take

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.359 
now the next player they're gonna take
one<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.410> their<00:01:51.500> cards<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:51.830> they<00:01:51.950> can<00:01:52.100> put<00:01:52.280> it

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
one of their cards and they can put it

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.310 
one of their cards and they can put it
either<00:01:52.580> before<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.090> railroad<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.690> between

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
either before the railroad in between

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.900 
either before the railroad in between
the<00:01:54.410> railroad<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.950> accordion<00:01:55.369> or<00:01:55.460> after

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
the railroad in the accordion or after

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.820 
the railroad in the accordion or after
the<00:01:56.000> accordion<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.600> diving<00:01:56.869> suit<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.410> think

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
the accordion so the diving suit I think

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.200 
the accordion so the diving suit I think
that<00:01:58.070> was<00:01:58.160> between<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.550> railroad<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.149> the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
that was between the railroad and the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.050 
that was between the railroad and the
accordion<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.690> turn<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.960> over<00:02:00.670> 1679<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:01.700> was

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
accordion I turn it over 1679 I was

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.830 
accordion I turn it over 1679 I was
wrong

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
wrong

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.899 
wrong
so<00:02:02.990> when<00:02:03.140> you're<00:02:03.260> wrong<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.220> discard<00:02:04.760> the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
so when you're wrong you discard the

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.149 
so when you're wrong you discard the
card<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.360> then<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:05.990> draw<00:02:06.380> another<00:02:06.680> card<00:02:06.950> to

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
card and then you draw another card to

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.859 
card and then you draw another card to
take<00:02:07.310> its<00:02:07.490> place<00:02:07.760> and<00:02:07.939> place<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.600> front

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
take its place and place that in front

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.170 
take its place and place that in front
of<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.140> your<00:02:10.100> object<00:02:10.519> is<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.760> get<00:02:10.880> rid<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.030> all

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
of you your object is to get rid of all

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.610 
of you your object is to get rid of all
the<00:02:11.330> cards<00:02:11.450> in<00:02:11.660> front<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.019> first<00:02:12.230> person<00:02:12.560> to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the cards in front the first person to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.560 
the cards in front the first person to
do<00:02:12.739> that<00:02:12.769> wins<00:02:12.950> I'm<00:02:13.910> not<00:02:14.120> going<00:02:14.299> to<00:02:14.360> show<00:02:14.510> you

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
do that wins I'm not going to show you

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.610 
do that wins I'm not going to show you
anymore<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.140> don't<00:02:15.260> want<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.440> show<00:02:15.560> you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
anymore because I don't want to show you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.199 
anymore because I don't want to show you
all<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.950> dates<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.310> these<00:02:16.400> cards<00:02:16.730> not<00:02:16.880> like<00:02:17.090> I

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
all the dates on these cards not like I

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.370 
all the dates on these cards not like I
think<00:02:17.269> you're<00:02:17.540> going<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.810> memorize<00:02:17.959> them

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
think you're going to memorize them

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.009 
think you're going to memorize them
anyway<00:02:18.799> but<00:02:19.549> that's<00:02:19.730> basically<00:02:20.180> how<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.690> game

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
anyway but that's basically how the game

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.930 
anyway but that's basically how the game
works<00:02:21.260> you're<00:02:21.590> trying<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.920> figure<00:02:22.070> out<00:02:22.220> where

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
works you're trying to figure out where

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.910 
works you're trying to figure out where
and<00:02:23.209> as<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.480> timeline<00:02:23.959> here<00:02:24.170> gets<00:02:24.380> longer<00:02:24.769> you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
and as the timeline here gets longer you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.590 
and as the timeline here gets longer you
have<00:02:25.010> more<00:02:25.280> more<00:02:25.519> spots<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.030> put<00:02:26.209> them<00:02:26.390> and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
have more more spots to put them and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.090 
have more more spots to put them and
sometimes<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.380> can<00:02:27.500> get<00:02:27.620> pretty<00:02:27.799> hairy

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
sometimes you can get pretty hairy

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.740 
sometimes you can get pretty hairy
because<00:02:28.459> you're<00:02:28.610> guessing<00:02:28.820> by<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> few<00:02:29.390> years

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
because you're guessing by a few years

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.509 
because you're guessing by a few years
whether<00:02:30.290> something<00:02:30.769> goes<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:30.980> there<00:02:31.370> and

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
whether something goes in there and

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.310 
whether something goes in there and
sometimes<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:32.329> best<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.810> save<00:02:33.019> something

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
sometimes it's best to save something

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.229 
sometimes it's best to save something
that<00:02:33.440> you're<00:02:33.709> pretty<00:02:34.220> sure<00:02:34.549> like<00:02:34.760> maybe<00:02:34.970> I'm

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
that you're pretty sure like maybe I'm

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.090 
that you're pretty sure like maybe I'm
pretty<00:02:35.600> sure<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.870> know<00:02:35.989> when<00:02:36.260> satellites<00:02:36.829> was

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
pretty sure I know when satellites was

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.009 
pretty sure I know when satellites was
and<00:02:37.370> save<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.360> end<00:02:38.540> because<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.840> can

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
and save that to the end because I can

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.500 
and save that to the end because I can
stick<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.440> one<00:02:39.620> out<00:02:40.030> first<00:02:41.030> person<00:02:41.329> to<00:02:41.390> get

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
stick that one out first person to get

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.780 
stick that one out first person to get
rid<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.660> all<00:02:41.810> their<00:02:41.959> cards<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.829> winner<00:02:42.980> now

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
rid of all their cards is the winner now

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.000 
rid of all their cards is the winner now
you<00:02:43.850> have<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.269> realize<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.739> timeline<00:02:46.209> it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
you have to realize that timeline it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.069 
you have to realize that timeline it
there's<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.850> one<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.329> six<00:02:50.959> different

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
there's this is one of six different

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.199 
there's this is one of six different
sets<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.130> invention<00:02:52.519> set<00:02:52.970> there's

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
sets this is the invention set there's

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.850 
sets this is the invention set there's
also<00:02:53.390> discoveries<00:02:54.019> historical<00:02:54.530> events

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
also discoveries historical events

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.979 
also discoveries historical events
monuments<00:02:55.430> arts<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.880> literature<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.360> music

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
monuments arts and literature and music

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.949 
monuments arts and literature and music
music<00:02:57.650> would<00:02:57.769> be<00:02:57.890> cool<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.700> even<00:02:59.540> this<00:02:59.900> one

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
music would be cool and even this one

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.350 
music would be cool and even this one
even<00:03:00.290> though<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.650> inventions<00:03:01.280> has<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.790> few

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
even though it is inventions has a few

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.810 
even though it is inventions has a few
cards<00:03:02.810> from<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.380> other<00:03:03.530> sets<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.459> kind<00:03:04.670> of

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
cards from the other sets in it kind of

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.670 
cards from the other sets in it kind of
sort<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.239> think<00:03:05.780> when<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.050> mix<00:03:06.349> all<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
sort of I think when you mix all the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.540 
sort of I think when you mix all the
sets<00:03:06.860> together<00:03:07.010> you're<00:03:07.250> going<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.400> get<00:03:07.520> a

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
sets together you're going to get a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.790 
sets together you're going to get a
really<00:03:07.730> cool<00:03:07.819> game

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
really cool game

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.060 
really cool game
this<00:03:08.980> game<00:03:09.670> has<00:03:10.120> worked<00:03:10.630> really<00:03:11.230> well<00:03:11.440> with

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
this game has worked really well with

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.800 
this game has worked really well with
everyone<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.400> put<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.820> everyone<00:03:13.150> has<00:03:13.360> really

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
everyone I put it everyone has really

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.770 
everyone I put it everyone has really
enjoyed<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.860> yeah<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:15.910> could<00:03:16.150> argue<00:03:16.330> that

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
enjoyed it and yeah you could argue that

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.510 
enjoyed it and yeah you could argue that
there's<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.200> replayability<00:03:17.770> problem<00:03:18.220> but<00:03:18.340> most

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
there's a replayability problem but most

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.040 
there's a replayability problem but most
of<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.730> dates<00:03:18.910> are<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.240> obscure<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.780> you

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
of the dates are so obscure that you

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.720 
of the dates are so obscure that you
really<00:03:20.380> cannot<00:03:20.890> remember<00:03:21.190> them<00:03:21.430> anyway<00:03:21.700> and

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
really cannot remember them anyway and

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.090 
really cannot remember them anyway and
if<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.180> do<00:03:22.480> remember<00:03:22.870> them<00:03:23.020> then<00:03:23.200> hey<00:03:23.470> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
if you do remember them then hey the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.580 
if you do remember them then hey the
game<00:03:24.340> has<00:03:24.550> been<00:03:24.700> educational<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.660> think<00:03:26.500> this

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
game has been educational I think this

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.650 
game has been educational I think this
game<00:03:26.740> will<00:03:26.920> work<00:03:27.070> best<00:03:27.370> when<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.480> said

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
game will work best when it like I said

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.970 
game will work best when it like I said
when<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.900> comes<00:03:28.930> mixed<00:03:29.470> with<00:03:29.620> all<00:03:29.800> the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
when it comes mixed with all the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.280 
when it comes mixed with all the
different<00:03:30.280> sets<00:03:30.520> and<00:03:30.730> I'm<00:03:30.880> hoping<00:03:31.360> I'm<00:03:32.140> hoping

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
different sets and I'm hoping I'm hoping

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.960 
different sets and I'm hoping I'm hoping
that<00:03:34.260> there<00:03:35.260> will<00:03:35.500> be<00:03:35.530> ID<00:03:36.040> luck<00:03:36.340> set<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.850> you

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
that there will be ID luck set that you

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.240 
that there will be ID luck set that you
can<00:03:37.180> buy<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.810> will<00:03:38.050> be<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> great<00:03:38.710> party

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
can buy and that will be a great party

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.030 
can buy and that will be a great party
style<00:03:39.550> game<00:03:39.820> so<00:03:40.720> while<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.620> not<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.950> game

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
style game so while this is not the game

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.290 
style game so while this is not the game
that<00:03:42.220> I'm<00:03:42.310> gonna<00:03:42.430> want<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.670> pull<00:03:42.880> out<00:03:43.000> all<00:03:43.180> the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
that I'm gonna want to pull out all the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.030 
that I'm gonna want to pull out all the
time<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.660> is<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> game<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.170> has<00:03:44.620> worked<00:03:44.950> really

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
time it is a game that has worked really
