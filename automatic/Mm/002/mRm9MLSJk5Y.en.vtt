00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.680
 There is space for everyone on the playground 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.070
 creativity is not one 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.150
 make you a creative person but 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.730
 your attitude to your doing 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.660
 no matter which activity you do 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.260
 after going to a hairdresser or cook 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.530
 Handyman can do his job as high 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.500
 understand art and he will be there 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.340
 Being successful with this one 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:49.060
 Setting energy free and open 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:53.809
 becomes the word for inspiration 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:58.489
 Inspiration is a very old word and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:02.440
 means inspiration or breathe of 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.140
 Ghost you get subtle 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.930
 support that expresses itself in that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.290
 gate for a while 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.759
 about no ordinary skills 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.030
 It also grows to what extent depends 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.150
 from how far you can open yourself 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.420
 how much you and your self 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.310
 take back intentions when scooping 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.189
 can make this invisible source 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.220
 can work 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.080
 Inspiration is a form of clairvoyance 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.110
 the permeability 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.990
 contrary to the general concept 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.800
 In this case, it is not a question 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.760
 gift you have or not you have 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.070
 to bring about a state that everyone 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.340
 can 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:03.360
 it's about letting something through 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.700
 by eliminating something before that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.259
 blocked for example your ego wave 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 expectation of the fear of failure 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.600
 or your artist's impatience struggles 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.580
 not with his work but with the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:27.000
 what hinders him the more you do 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.959
 the inspiration tries convulsively 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.700
 The less you listen to them because you hear 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.060
 by forcing yourself to become inwardly loud 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.060
 Imagine you are on a river 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.770
 the flow of creative creation 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.680
 carry your boat in the right direction 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.760
 and you have nothing to do but 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.890
 to trust the direction 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 the water splashes quietly to himself 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.390
 and you hear the voice of inspiration 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.660
 she stands at the edge of the river and guides you 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.840
 now and then gently with their impulses 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.310
 To easily the direction to 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.810
 correct for rock or cargo 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.480
 dodge 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.120
 but as soon as your ego is his 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.570
 expectation your failure fear 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.660
 or your impatience to word reports and 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.570
 want to tell you that you can do more or 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.560
 you should get started faster 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.080
 to row 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.040
 instead of just being open-minded 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.280
 and to let devotion continue 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.980
 the rhoder splash into the water and 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.910
 drown out the soft voice he agreed 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.250
 inspiration on the riverside 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.430
 you lose your serenity and 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.370
 begin to row closer to the riverbank 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.180
 so you have the voice of inspiration 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:00.120
 You can hear it louder 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.410
 just the oars back to the side 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.269
 lay down and become still 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.989
 Instead, you pay attention to the river 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.480
 not anymore but stubbornly looking for those 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.459
 inspiration out of carelessness 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.479
 a boat collides in the water 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.669
 all sorts of obstacles and you are 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.880
 blocked angry you decide that 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:28.320
 Boat off the shore and walk to 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:33.120
 to seek the inspiration and you are 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:36.360
 you are no longer in flux only where 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:41.270
 serenity and devotion are rooted 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:45.210
 God makes a tree out of it 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.780
 serenity is your inner peace when 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.540
 create a creative happen 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.770
 creatures without 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.020
 expectant attitude 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.640
 while you are in the flow 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.479
 flow is devotion is the 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:06.060
 In addition, love to your creative create 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:10.140
 Gift that you make the man 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.440
 you want to be creative only around 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.410
 to be something special or yourself 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:20.580
 to prove something you lose yours 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.979
 serenity and devotion then r 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.090
 you do not love a present but 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.039
 an effigy in glory full pose of you 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.289
 even 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:34.800
 you are then with your attention 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:39.320
 no longer in the flow but mentally 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:43.410
 already at the end of your journey arrived 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.500
 Trust in your creative journey too 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.520
 if you do not know when the inspiration 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.400
 begins to speak with you 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.810
 one of your most famous painters of the 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.960
 Last century noted the 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.590
 inspiration exists but it must be you 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.720
 find at work 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.300
 if you just drift a bit 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.169
 want to leave without really aiming 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.440
 the inspiration seems to want to arrive 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.539
 maybe no reason to talk with 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.900
 to look for her 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:24.919
 sets a concrete creative goal 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.220
 Take time constitutional courage and come up to you 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.740
 then just into the boat 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:34.360
 the perfect moment for the beginning 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.860
 there is no river ride 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.940
 so do not waste time with it 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.940
 No matter what you aim at, your brain does not brood 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:47.060
 you are expected during the trip 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.969
 Learn more about yourself 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:55.099
 Finally, you have your attention 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:59.870
 inward attention is 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:03.380
 energy if you keep your attention 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.819
 nothing specific in the outside has long since flowed 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.440
 the energy often nowhere 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:14.160
 do you judge them purposefully 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:17.550
 inside to hear the inspiration 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.970
 then you do not lose the energy you 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.330
 migrates into the created by you that 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:27.270
 a part of you is and the more you are 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.600
 you start to explore your inner world 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.320
 and friendship with the inspiration too 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.350
 shut down 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.370
 if you are less important we will be all those 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:41.280
 Things in the outside with which you do not 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:44.370
 agree you will be freelance of 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:48.210
 the entanglements and attachments you 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:52.470
 your own world inside you 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:56.040
 opens up this expedition is 

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:58.610
 more important than the creative success in the 

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.610
 Outside
