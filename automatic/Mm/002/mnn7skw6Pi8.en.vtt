that much on that machine I don't know

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
that much on that machine I don't know
if<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.230> didn't<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.680> adjusted

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
if it was because I didn't know adjusted

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.330 
if it was because I didn't know adjusted
correctly<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.239> whatnot<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.190> think<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.250> hit

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
correctly or whatnot but I think it hit

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
don't believe seven set same thing

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
don't believe seven set same thing
unless<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.680> abs<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.280> calves<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.790> something

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
unless it's abs or calves or something

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.240
