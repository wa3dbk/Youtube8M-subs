00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.180 
to c6 and Knight to d5 however in this
position<00:02:31.350> pretty<00:02:32.350> much<00:02:32.560> all<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.860> whites

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
position pretty much all of whites

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.720 
position pretty much all of whites
pieces<00:02:33.700> are<00:02:33.850> active<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.980> blacks<00:02:35.980> bishop<00:02:36.520> on

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
pieces are active and blacks bishop on

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.640 
pieces are active and blacks bishop on
c8<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.030> completely<00:02:40.380> completely<00:02:41.380> trapped

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
c8 here is completely completely trapped

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.570 
c8 here is completely completely trapped
in<00:02:41.920> into<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.910> pawn<00:02:43.330> structure<00:02:43.720> still<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:44.950> you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
in into the pawn structure still so you

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.840 
in into the pawn structure still so you
know<00:02:45.700> from<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.060> position<00:02:47.640> really<00:02:48.640> it

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
know from this position really it

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.790 
know from this position really it
doesn't<00:02:49.000> favor<00:02:49.240> black<00:02:49.540> at<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.930> another

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
doesn't favor black at all another

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.949 
doesn't favor black at all another
variation<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.610> Danish<00:02:51.970> gambit<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.600> the

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
variation of the Danish gambit is the

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.140 
variation of the Danish gambit is the
half<00:02:53.770> Danish<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.790> actually

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
half Danish and this is actually

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.810 
half Danish and this is actually
recommended<00:02:55.660> by<00:02:55.750> ala<00:02:55.959> kine<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.670> half

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
recommended by ala kine and the half

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.750 
recommended by ala kine and the half
Danish<00:02:58.180> goes<00:02:58.720> as<00:02:58.870> follows<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.400> opening

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
Danish goes as follows so the opening

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.060 
Danish goes as follows so the opening
sequence<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.360> pretty<00:03:01.600> much<00:03:01.780> identical

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
sequence is pretty much identical

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.770 
sequence is pretty much identical
however<00:03:03.070> at<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.610> stage<00:03:03.940> instead<00:03:04.450> of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
however at this stage instead of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.740 
however at this stage instead of
developing<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.739> Bishop<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.310> c4<00:03:06.820> White<00:03:07.510> would

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
developing the Bishop to c4 White would

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.449 
developing the Bishop to c4 White would
play<00:03:07.989> Knight<00:03:08.680> Knight<00:03:09.310> takes<00:03:09.640> pawn<00:03:10.000> on<00:03:10.300> c3

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
play Knight Knight takes pawn on c3

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.430 
play Knight Knight takes pawn on c3
right<00:03:12.459> there<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.570> this<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:13.780> called<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> half

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
right there so this is called the half

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.810 
right there so this is called the half
Danish<00:03:15.150> now<00:03:16.150> from<00:03:16.360> this<00:03:16.510> position<00:03:16.720> here<00:03:17.820> you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
Danish now from this position here you

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.120 
Danish now from this position here you
know<00:03:18.910> looking<00:03:19.239> at<00:03:19.360> weights<00:03:19.570> pieces<00:03:20.080> there's<00:03:21.070> a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
know looking at weights pieces there's a

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.130 
know looking at weights pieces there's a
lot<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.459> rapid<00:03:21.820> development<00:03:21.850> still<00:03:22.570> available

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
lot of rapid development still available

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.740 
lot of rapid development still available
to<00:03:23.290> white<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.850> we've<00:03:25.060> got<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.360> bishop

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
to white here so we've got the bishop

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.860 
to white here so we've got the bishop
open<00:03:26.200> up<00:03:26.380> here<00:03:26.709> we've<00:03:27.250> got<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.580> Queen<00:03:27.870> with

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
open up here we've got the Queen with

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.500 
open up here we've got the Queen with
three<00:03:29.170> options<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.760> bishop<00:03:31.090> here<00:03:31.299> with

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
three options and the bishop here with

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.949 
three options and the bishop here with
options<00:03:32.190> plus<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.430> Knight<00:03:33.700> can<00:03:34.420> impact<00:03:34.750> a

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
options plus this Knight can impact a

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.759 
options plus this Knight can impact a
lot<00:03:35.110> of<00:03:35.260> squares<00:03:35.620> here<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:36.580> they're<00:03:36.820> they're

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
lot of squares here so they're they're

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.830 
lot of squares here so they're they're
near<00:03:39.120> here<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.280> attack<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:43.330> while<00:03:43.540> black

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
near here on the attack so while black

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.080 
near here on the attack so while black
would<00:03:44.080> have<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.410> be<00:03:44.560> plain<00:03:44.860> pawn<00:03:45.580> moves<00:03:45.910> to

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
would have to be plain pawn moves to

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.940 
would have to be plain pawn moves to
open<00:03:46.390> up<00:03:46.510> access<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.170> majority<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.709> its

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
open up access to the majority of its

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.970 
open up access to the majority of its
pieces<00:03:48.570> because<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.870> black<00:03:50.079> Bishop<00:03:50.560> here<00:03:50.799> is

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
pieces because the black Bishop here is

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.670 
pieces because the black Bishop here is
really<00:03:51.940> one<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.239> only<00:03:52.420> pieces<00:03:53.170> along<00:03:53.620> with

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
really one of the only pieces along with

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.120 
really one of the only pieces along with
the<00:03:53.829> Queen<00:03:54.190> other<00:03:54.850> than<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.299> Knights<00:03:55.540> that

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the Queen other than the Knights that

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.039 
the Queen other than the Knights that
has<00:03:57.130> access<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.910> board<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.360> those

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
has access to the board and those

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.660 
has access to the board and those
Knights<00:03:59.320> have<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.680> be<00:03:59.829> played<00:04:00.100> out<00:04:00.130> before

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
Knights have to be played out before

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.120 
Knights have to be played out before
they<00:04:00.790> can<00:04:00.970> be<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.269> much<00:04:01.720> use<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:02.739> white<00:04:02.950> can

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
they can be of much use so white can

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.100 
they can be of much use so white can
still<00:04:03.370> develop<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.880> very<00:04:04.090> rapid<00:04:04.540> attack<00:04:04.840> here

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
still develop a very rapid attack here

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.190 
still develop a very rapid attack here
with<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.380> half<00:04:05.530> Danish<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:07.690> course<00:04:07.900> Black

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
with the half Danish and of course Black

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.530 
with the half Danish and of course Black
has<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.440> number<00:04:08.829> of<00:04:08.860> ways<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.400> can<00:04:09.640> avoid

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
has a number of ways that it can avoid

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.729 
has a number of ways that it can avoid
the<00:04:10.720> gambit<00:04:11.110> all<00:04:11.230> together<00:04:12.060> for<00:04:13.060> example<00:04:13.739> the

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
the gambit all together for example the

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.300 
the gambit all together for example the
following<00:04:14.950> could<00:04:15.340> take<00:04:15.549> place<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.870> on<00:04:17.380> move

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
following could take place so on move

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.190 
following could take place so on move
three<00:04:18.729> after<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.660> following<00:04:22.050> instead<00:04:23.050> of

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
three after the following instead of

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.790 
three after the following instead of
taking<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.620> pawn<00:04:24.040> on<00:04:24.280> b2<00:04:25.140> what<00:04:26.140> black<00:04:26.349> can<00:04:26.590> do

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
taking that pawn on b2 what black can do

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.320 
taking that pawn on b2 what black can do
is<00:04:27.130> play<00:04:27.700> for<00:04:28.120> example<00:04:28.599> d5

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
is play for example d5

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.189 
is play for example d5
so<00:04:31.330> black<00:04:31.569> plays<00:04:31.899> d5<00:04:32.469> with<00:04:32.739> the<00:04:32.860> pawn<00:04:34.020> okay<00:04:35.020> and

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
so black plays d5 with the pawn okay and

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.969 
so black plays d5 with the pawn okay and
this<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:35.919> called<00:04:36.309> the<00:04:36.610> Sorensen<00:04:37.539> defense<00:04:38.169> so

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
this is called the Sorensen defense so

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.109 
this is called the Sorensen defense so
basically<00:04:39.309> the<00:04:39.550> gambits<00:04:39.969> been<00:04:40.149> stopped<00:04:40.929> and

00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:42.119 
basically the gambits been stopped and

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:44.699 
basically the gambits been stopped and
black<00:04:43.119> can<00:04:43.330> proceed<00:04:43.719> to<00:04:43.749> develop<00:04:44.080> from<00:04:44.529> this

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:44.709 
black can proceed to develop from this

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:45.269 
black can proceed to develop from this
point

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.279 
point

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:49.129 
point
another<00:04:45.789> option<00:04:46.239> is<00:04:46.360> d6<00:04:47.050> on<00:04:47.379> that<00:04:47.919> same<00:04:48.219> move

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
another option is d6 on that same move

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.679 
another option is d6 on that same move
so<00:04:50.139> for<00:04:50.439> example<00:04:51.209> right<00:04:52.209> there

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:52.689 
so for example right there

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.949 
so for example right there
d6<00:04:53.199> so<00:04:54.129> from<00:04:54.339> here<00:04:54.519> black<00:04:54.669> can<00:04:55.169> pretty<00:04:56.169> much

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:57.959 
d6 so from here black can pretty much

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:04.159 
d6 so from here black can pretty much
develop<00:04:58.959> normally<00:04:59.259> and<00:04:59.619> it's<00:04:59.889> up<00:05:00.069> to<00:05:00.309> pawns

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.809 

now<00:05:05.169> another<00:05:05.409> response<00:05:05.919> to<00:05:06.249> the<00:05:06.399> Danish

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
now another response to the Danish

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.659 
now another response to the Danish
gambit<00:05:07.269> which<00:05:08.199> Wikipedia<00:05:08.830> cites<00:05:09.219> is<00:05:09.490> the

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
gambit which Wikipedia cites is the

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.999 
gambit which Wikipedia cites is the
primary<00:05:10.629> reason<00:05:10.959> the<00:05:11.199> Danish<00:05:11.499> gambit<00:05:11.800> lost

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
primary reason the Danish gambit lost

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.429 
primary reason the Danish gambit lost
his<00:05:12.189> popularity<00:05:12.669> was<00:05:13.029> thus<00:05:13.539> Lester<00:05:13.990> defense

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:14.439 
his popularity was thus Lester defense

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.759 
his popularity was thus Lester defense
and<00:05:14.740> thus<00:05:15.369> Lester<00:05:15.669> defense<00:05:16.029> goes<00:05:16.269> as<00:05:16.449> follows

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:17.769 
and thus Lester defense goes as follows

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:20.779 
and thus Lester defense goes as follows
black<00:05:18.129> offers<00:05:18.610> back<00:05:19.240> upon<00:05:19.659> now<00:05:19.929> to<00:05:20.289> white

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:23.019 
after losing three of its own pawns

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:26.519 
after losing three of its own pawns

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:37.179 
the King doesn't really have a lot of

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:38.959 
the King doesn't really have a lot of
options<00:05:37.360> in<00:05:37.719> this<00:05:37.809> in<00:05:38.079> this<00:05:38.199> position<00:05:38.409> for

options in this in this position for

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.119 
options in this in this position for
example<00:05:39.969> you<00:05:40.179> could<00:05:40.419> play<00:05:40.629> here<00:05:40.990> but<00:05:41.889> what

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
example you could play here but what

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.219 
example you could play here but what
this<00:05:42.309> does<00:05:42.550> is<00:05:42.729> it<00:05:42.879> just<00:05:42.909> causes<00:05:43.749> black<00:05:43.990> to

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
this does is it just causes black to

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.949 
this does is it just causes black to
lose<00:05:44.409> the<00:05:44.589> Queen<00:05:44.829> outright<00:05:45.659> without<00:05:46.659> gaining

the<00:05:47.229> White<00:05:47.379> Queen<00:05:47.589> back<00:05:47.949> so<00:05:48.339> it's<00:05:48.579> a<00:05:48.699> losing

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.029 
the White Queen back so it's a losing

position but part of the Celestra

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.919 
position but part of the Celestra
defense<00:05:51.519> is<00:05:51.699> just<00:05:51.729> to<00:05:51.999> outright<00:05:52.360> take<00:05:52.719> this

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.369 
bishop and from here white can take the
queen<00:05:57.309> but<00:05:58.029> there's<00:05:58.240> a<00:05:58.300> discovered<00:05:58.809> attack<00:05:58.899> on

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:04.899 
is now gone as well

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:07.889 
is now gone as well
now<00:06:05.289> if<00:06:06.249> white<00:06:06.610> were<00:06:06.639> to<00:06:06.999> play<00:06:07.269> say<00:06:07.629> for

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:07.899 
now if white were to play say for

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.980 
now if white were to play say for
example<00:06:08.379> King<00:06:08.619> moves<00:06:09.419> it's<00:06:10.419> a<00:06:10.539> bad<00:06:10.689> move<00:06:10.959> for

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
example King moves it's a bad move for

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.919 
example King moves it's a bad move for
white<00:06:11.289> because<00:06:11.589> white<00:06:11.889> loses<00:06:12.099> the<00:06:12.459> Queen<00:06:12.929> and

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:13.929 
white because white loses the Queen and

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:15.899 
white because white loses the Queen and
also<00:06:14.289> develops<00:06:14.769> the<00:06:14.949> black<00:06:15.129> rook<00:06:15.459> at<00:06:15.579> the<00:06:15.699> same

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
also develops the black rook at the same

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.019 
also develops the black rook at the same
time<00:06:16.409> so<00:06:17.409> even<00:06:17.679> though<00:06:17.829> the<00:06:18.159> black<00:06:18.369> king<00:06:18.729> can't

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:19.029 
time so even though the black king can't

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:23.159 
time so even though the black king can't
castle<00:06:19.599> its<00:06:20.559> rook<00:06:20.829> is<00:06:20.949> developed<00:06:21.429> here<00:06:21.779> so<00:06:22.779> it

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
castle its rook is developed here so it

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.049 
castle its rook is developed here so it
the<00:06:23.740> line<00:06:23.949> goes<00:06:24.189> as<00:06:24.369> follows

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:25.059 
the line goes as follows

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:27.769 
the line goes as follows
but<00:06:25.449> King<00:06:25.779> takes<00:06:26.019> bishop<00:06:26.439> Queen<00:06:27.249> takes<00:06:27.459> Queen

discovered<00:06:28.779> check<00:06:28.809> and<00:06:29.610> now<00:06:30.610> white<00:06:30.849> just

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:31.059 
discovered check and now white just

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:32.759 
discovered check and now white just
brings<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.419> Queen<00:06:31.659> down<00:06:31.899> to<00:06:32.079> block<00:06:32.319> the<00:06:32.499> check

however according to Wikipedia and just

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:45.589 
however according to Wikipedia and just
by<00:06:42.749> looking<00:06:43.080> at<00:06:43.199> the<00:06:43.289> board<00:06:44.120> some<00:06:45.120> people<00:06:45.449> say

by looking at the board some people say

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.270 
by looking at the board some people say
that<00:06:45.629> the<00:06:45.870> queenside<00:06:46.110> majority<00:06:46.919> of<00:06:47.039> blacks

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
that the queenside majority of blacks

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:54.860 
that the queenside majority of blacks

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
pieces here give it an advantage so that

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.659

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:10.529 
take a look at the goring gambit some

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:14.269 
take a look at the goring gambit some
day<00:07:10.710> and<00:07:11.210> the<00:07:12.210> main<00:07:12.389> line<00:07:12.689> on<00:07:13.020> the<00:07:13.680> Danish

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:14.279 
day and the main line on the Danish

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:17.179 
day and the main line on the Danish
gambit<00:07:14.729> can<00:07:15.569> sometimes<00:07:16.050> lead<00:07:16.590> to<00:07:16.800> the<00:07:16.889> Scotch

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:17.189 
gambit can sometimes lead to the Scotch

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:19.969 
gambit can sometimes lead to the Scotch
gambit<00:07:17.669> by<00:07:17.819> transposition<00:07:18.629> so<00:07:19.289> it's<00:07:19.529> a<00:07:19.710> it's

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
gambit by transposition so it's a it's

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.209 
gambit by transposition so it's a it's
an<00:07:20.099> interesting<00:07:20.159> opening<00:07:20.969> it's<00:07:22.219> definitely

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:23.219 
an interesting opening it's definitely

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:25.700 
an interesting opening it's definitely
gives<00:07:23.669> white<00:07:23.969> the<00:07:24.629> capabilities<00:07:25.289> of<00:07:25.319> getting

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
gives white the capabilities of getting

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.800 
gives white the capabilities of getting
a<00:07:25.800> lot<00:07:25.919> of<00:07:25.979> attacks<00:07:26.400> going<00:07:26.759> but<00:07:27.599> with<00:07:27.719> the

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
a lot of attacks going but with the

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.309 
a lot of attacks going but with the
Celestra<00:07:28.199> defense<00:07:28.650> it<00:07:29.189> can<00:07:29.250> be<00:07:29.520> countered

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 
Celestra defense it can be countered

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.839 
Celestra defense it can be countered
quite<00:07:31.319> quite<00:07:31.740> well<00:07:31.889> actually<00:07:32.129> so<00:07:32.610> what<00:07:32.759> I'm

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:32.849 
quite quite well actually so what I'm

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:35.749 
quite quite well actually so what I'm
going<00:07:33.000> to<00:07:33.089> do<00:07:33.270> is<00:07:33.419> for<00:07:33.900> the<00:07:33.930> PGN<00:07:34.639> version<00:07:35.639> of

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 
going to do is for the PGN version of

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.149 
going to do is for the PGN version of
this<00:07:35.909> I've<00:07:36.539> been<00:07:36.659> adding<00:07:36.870> PGN<00:07:37.469> files<00:07:37.800> of<00:07:38.069> all

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:38.159 
this I've been adding PGN files of all

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.829 
this I've been adding PGN files of all
the<00:07:38.370> book<00:07:38.550> moves<00:07:38.819> for<00:07:39.089> the<00:07:39.120> openings<00:07:39.569> that<00:07:39.659> I'm

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 
you can go through the opening still but

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.779 
you can go through the opening still but
you'll<00:07:49.169> also<00:07:49.319> have<00:07:49.620> the<00:07:49.680> slicer<00:07:50.159> defense<00:07:50.580> to
