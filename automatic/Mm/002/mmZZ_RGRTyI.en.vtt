00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:31.450
 in 1980 a game of names appeared 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:35.340
 bears for arcade machines developed 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.340
 by esther electronics 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.950
 its creator to the cmac neo employee of 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.310
 universal blazers the dream with a game 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.280
 in black and white in which we 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:53.200
 we faced robots so he put 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.200
 hands to work and created the game 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.570
 the goal of the game was simple 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.190
 go through long corridors avoiding 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.130
 collide with robots walls and at all costs 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.510
 avoiding our weak enemy another 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.770
 who was based on dave other who 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.799
 he was the head of neo 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.799
 The fact is that this was the first 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.460
 video game involved in the death of 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.460
 a player 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.780
 since in 1981 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.850
 jeff daily died of a just heart attack 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.150
 after recording your initials 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.570
 in the top of scoring records of 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.659
 game the case would have been as mere 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.299
 coincidence one more anecdote but the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.850
 thing did not stop there since in 1982 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.119
 Peter Burke vsc and again beat the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.780
 scoring record this time twice 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.830
 followed and by putting your initials on the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.930
 records 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.390
 He also died of a heart attack 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.210
 of the tragic deaths have made people believe 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.300
 that if you beat the game record you will die 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.540
 of a heart attack right after putting your 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.939
 initials in the top of records 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.730
 and what happens after beating the 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.489
 good record that I leave to the most 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.090
 brave and you would dare to 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.090
 try
