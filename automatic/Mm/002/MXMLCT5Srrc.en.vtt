Invisalign<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.589> brilliant<00:00:02.010> new<00:00:02.520> innovative

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
Invisalign is a brilliant new innovative

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.619 
Invisalign is a brilliant new innovative
technique<00:00:04.310> it's<00:00:05.310> made<00:00:05.549> possible<00:00:06.120> by<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.359> use

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
technique it's made possible by the use

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.680 
technique it's made possible by the use
of<00:00:06.660> computers<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:07.980> new<00:00:08.639> age<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:09.150> computer

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
of computers in this new age of computer

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.459 
of computers in this new age of computer
robotics<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:11.000> devices<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.330> really<00:00:13.320> weren't

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
robotics and devices that really weren't

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.180 
robotics and devices that really weren't
available<00:00:13.799> much<00:00:14.219> like<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:15.360> century<00:00:15.809> before

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
available much like the century before

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.590 
available much like the century before
so<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> truly<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> new

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so this is this is truly a new

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
so this is this is truly a new
technology<00:00:19.410> made<00:00:19.680> possible<00:00:20.189> only<00:00:20.340> through

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
technology made possible only through

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.689 
technology made possible only through
the<00:00:20.789> use<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> computers<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.740> way<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.070> works<00:00:23.100> is

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the use of computers the way it works is

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.210 
the use of computers the way it works is
you<00:00:23.760> get<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> model<00:00:25.050> or<00:00:25.260> an<00:00:25.289> imprint<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
you get a model or an imprint of the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
you get a model or an imprint of the
patient's<00:00:26.699> teeth<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.180> put<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.510> into<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
patient's teeth and you put it into the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.259 
patient's teeth and you put it into the
computer<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.070> bring<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
computer and you bring it up and it's a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.060 
computer and you bring it up and it's a
three-dimensional<00:00:31.080> representation<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
three-dimensional representation of the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.000 
three-dimensional representation of the
upper<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.369> lower<00:00:32.460> sets<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> teeth<00:00:34.010> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
upper and lower sets of the teeth the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.700 
upper and lower sets of the teeth the
programmers<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.880> myself<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> dentist<00:00:37.469> get

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
programmers and myself as a dentist get

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.290 
programmers and myself as a dentist get
together<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.399> straighten<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.180> these

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
together and straighten all of these

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.540 
together and straighten all of these
teeth<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.649> nice<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
teeth out so they look nice and this is

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.670 
teeth out so they look nice and this is
what<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> patient<00:00:42.210> wants<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> end<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
what the patient wants in the end and so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.270 
what the patient wants in the end and so
what<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:45.440> set<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> software

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
what we do then is set the software

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.720 
what we do then is set the software
program<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.910> divide<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.899> small<00:00:49.730> motions

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
program to divide up in small motions

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270 
program to divide up in small motions
each<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.390> step<00:00:51.600> until<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
each little step until we have the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.299 
each little step until we have the
crooked<00:00:53.820> teeth<00:00:53.969> starting<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.920> step<00:00:55.920> by<00:00:56.070> step

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
crooked teeth starting and step by step

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.740 
crooked teeth starting and step by step
by<00:00:56.460> step<00:00:56.670> all<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> where<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> teeth

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
by step all the way to where the teeth

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.439 
by step all the way to where the teeth
are<00:00:57.989> straight<00:00:58.460> each<00:00:59.460> little<00:00:59.820> step<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
are straight each little step then is

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.750 
are straight each little step then is
sent<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.109> machine<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.649> makes<00:01:01.829> plastic<00:01:02.460> set

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
sent to a machine that makes plastic set

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810 
sent to a machine that makes plastic set
of<00:01:02.879> teeth<00:01:03.059> at<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.420> point<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.670> invisible<00:01:05.670> or

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
of teeth at that point and invisible or

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
of teeth at that point and invisible or
this<00:01:05.970> clear<00:01:06.479> aligner<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.290> made<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.770> fit

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
this clear aligner is then made to fit

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000 
this clear aligner is then made to fit
that<00:01:08.479> all<00:01:09.479> these<00:01:09.750> liners<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.740> made

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that all these liners are all then made

that all these liners are all then made
package<00:01:11.700> serial<00:01:12.210> numbers<00:01:13.159> sent<00:01:14.159> right<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> us

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
package serial numbers sent right to us

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.880 
package serial numbers sent right to us
and<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.299> arrive<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.770> do

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and then they arrive here and what we do

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
and then they arrive here and what we do
is<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> started<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:19.049> have

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
is we get you started with it we have

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630 
is we get you started with it we have
you<00:01:19.290> put<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.680> first<00:01:19.950> aligner<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.549> that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you put on that first aligner and that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.109 
you put on that first aligner and that
first<00:01:20.820> aligner<00:01:21.119> snaps<00:01:21.509> onto<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> teeth<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
first aligner snaps onto the teeth and

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.399 
first aligner snaps onto the teeth and
while<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.330> teeth<00:01:24.509> are<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> crooked<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
while your teeth are kind of crooked the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.690 
while your teeth are kind of crooked the
aligner<00:01:25.680> looks<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:26.490> crooked

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
aligner looks like it's got crooked

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
aligner looks like it's got crooked
teeth<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.420> put<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.990> there<00:01:28.140> but

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
teeth on it you put that on there but

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.370 
teeth on it you put that on there but
it's<00:01:28.470> actually<00:01:28.890> slightly<00:01:29.130> straighter<00:01:30.380> than

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it's actually slightly straighter than

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.440 
it's actually slightly straighter than
your<00:01:31.680> teeth<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:32.159> okay<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> get<00:01:33.329> this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
your teeth are okay so you get this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.120 
your teeth are okay so you get this
thing<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.380> got<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.710> squeeze

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
thing on and it's got a little squeeze

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.700 
thing on and it's got a little squeeze
to<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.720> wear<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.290> two<00:01:37.530> weeks

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
to it and you wear this about two weeks

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
to it and you wear this about two weeks
and<00:01:37.950> after<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.280> two<00:01:38.549> weeks<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and after about two weeks it's not the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.390 
and after about two weeks it's not the
squeeze<00:01:40.170> seems<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> disappear<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> but

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
squeeze seems to disappear on it but

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
squeeze seems to disappear on it but
what's<00:01:41.549> actually<00:01:41.790> happened<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.540> teeth

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
what's actually happened is your teeth

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.760 
what's actually happened is your teeth
have<00:01:42.930> actually<00:01:43.200> gotten<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.409> little<00:01:43.560> bit

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
have actually gotten a little bit

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
have actually gotten a little bit
straighter<00:01:44.299> once<00:01:45.299> they've<00:01:45.479> straightened<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
straighter once they've straightened a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.030 
straighter once they've straightened a
little<00:01:46.110> bit<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.950> I'm

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
little bit then you get out and I'm

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
little bit then you get out and I'm
liner<00:01:47.640> number<00:01:47.970> two<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:49.049> bit

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
liner number two and it's a little bit

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.230 
liner number two and it's a little bit
straighter<00:01:49.470> than<00:01:49.649> number<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.579> snap<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
straighter than number one you snap it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.289 
straighter than number one you snap it
on<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.770> tight<00:01:53.100> too<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> wear<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> two

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.190 
weeks and the teeth shift again a little
bit<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> liner<00:01:57.869> number

three you snap it on it's a little
straighter<00:02:00.119> than<00:02:00.270> number<00:02:00.540> two<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.049> just

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
all nice and straight you snapped

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.370 
all nice and straight you snapped
on<00:02:12.400> if<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.780> got<00:02:13.990> straight

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.400 
on if you have that on you got straight
teeth<00:02:14.700> that's<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.180> simplicity<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.870> exactly

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
teeth that's the simplicity of exactly

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.559 
teeth that's the simplicity of exactly
how<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.770> works<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.819> technology<00:02:19.240> is

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
how it works so that the technology is

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.690 
how it works so that the technology is
here<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.170> do<00:02:20.350> not<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.890> wear<00:02:21.010> braces<00:02:21.340> in

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
here you do not have to wear braces in

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.120 
here you do not have to wear braces in
most<00:02:22.060> cases<00:02:22.390> now<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.709> can<00:02:23.800> get<00:02:23.950> your

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
most cases now and you can get your

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.850 
most cases now and you can get your
teeth<00:02:24.310> straightened<00:02:24.730> out
