00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.720
 very good all kids how are you 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.549
 I hope very well of course and here 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.680
 we are a newer day video in the 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.620
 channel after a few days of 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.090
 rest barral absence and explain the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.040
 reasons for twitter but in case someone 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.380
 he does not follow me on twitter I explain it for 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.239
 here the last video that about the channel 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.849
 it's a pretty cucumber mount or montage 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:23.829
 a great job that he did daiquiri for 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.779
 mix some clips from both the bat field 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.909
 as of the call of duty coast that good 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.009
 for certain copyright issues of 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.599
 hiccups with general youtube 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.699
 He has not had the visits or the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.469
 likes that I would have liked that 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.929
 take it because you already know not the 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.910
 montages in this channel is what we 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.370
 passionate what we liked from 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.859
 always and unfortunately because then 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.600
 when such a good montage does not catch what 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.179
 that you want me to catch then well 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.559
 Well, let's be discouraged, so let's not say 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.570
 I said it 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.089
 today better said yesterday yes between today and yesterday 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.579
 that depends on how you look at it yesterday 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.489
 the night before going to sleep then 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.499
 I was watching a video about the toilet 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.689
 next film let's say a mixture between 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.030
 the next film paper and the call of duty 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.010
 because you already know the battlefield 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.690
 and do not know what I say the toilet fit 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.909
 is approaching pretty close 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.490
 that is the call of duty putting games 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.950
 as domination putting in 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.659
 movements let's say fast although the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.850
 battlefield someone less in this does not 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.800
 can not jump and jump sony drop 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.050
 shott et cetera behind but let's say 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.780
 there is a certain approach to the call of 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.250
 duty not in the latter at least the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.530
 bat fill 4 let's say it's the one that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.869
 I know quite well in fact well 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.340
 that nothing has encouraged me to do this 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.710
 video because I want you to know 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.060
 this information not because to me the bat 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.640
 fil i love the call of duty me 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.410
 love and a mixture of both in the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.990
 future in this next year has to be 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.460
 something brutal no longer you know it has been and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.190
 also information about the new 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.929
 call of duty the Albanian warfare or something 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.850
 well it seems to me that it is called and has a 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.420
 term so very very very futuristic 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.399
 a little policeman so very good and is 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.290
 something also what the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.450
 creators bar 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.240
 producers of the bat of the film or not only 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.070
 you give us tells us who are going to do it 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.960
 the game is going to be another different company 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.400
 but vain to put the name of the bat 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.040
 the film or indeed is called butterfield 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.870
 hartline that in Spanish because it is line 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.240
 it lasts not as it has been translated 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.520
 always the advantages of call of duty and 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.080
 in those we are not in creating a 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.290
 a little derogatory is a little 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.910
 passion about this new mix as well 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.320
 that his wine mixes from the battlefield and the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.750
 call of duty in the last assembly 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.050
 they're going to do that same thing they're not going to create a 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.700
 film film dedicated to the periods 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.650
 shorts, not short farms as he says to the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.690
 at short distances it's going to be 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.459
 police against thieves is going to have 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.890
 bates will see four will see 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.480
 medical syringes of everything will be 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.950
 a mixture that in my opinion quite 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.920
 beautiful not one thing I'm looking forward to 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.990
 prove I do not know if many of you 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.310
 you follow the battlefield or if you are 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.110
 only here for the call of duty and 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.790
 good you see battlefield because you like 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.150
 more or less as I comment you like my 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.470
 videos you like how I move and play 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.340
 at the same time 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.980
 the fact is that we are here I am 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.320
 here to play and have fun and 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.810
 if I mix the battlefield with the saga 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.920
 call of duty I think it's going to be something something 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.720
 wonderful not because he is going to transmit 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.360
 Awesome things the call of 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.130
 duty also has them and if the game 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.320
 while it's fun while it 's 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.970
 entertaining while dynamic gives me 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.200
 same as if it looked more like beating the edge 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.540
 plus the call of duty what I want is 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.970
 have fun not that that the foundation 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.110
 of all the video games then in that 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.240
 We are worth just wanted 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.640
 inform you in this video that this 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.250
 new year can fall a pretty game 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.260
 Cucumber is not giving much much 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.240
 advertising the same as they did with 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.880
 folk titan who were going to say it was the 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.340
 code killer not the game that killed the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.810
 alcalÃ¡ duty has not been like this and good to 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.520
 this one that is not giving him so much hype 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.740
 maybe it's not maybe it's the best 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.570
 game that unites the battlefield saga with 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.550
 the saga call of duty and we can take out 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.740
 something very good about that experience of 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.780
 I play not kids then I 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.550
 I just wanted to encourage those 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.290
 that you are watching the video we like the 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.690
 toilet film and nothing simply to here 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.790
 you go proving not to go 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.010
 experiencing this game 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.409
 now I told you about it because of the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.299
 rented servers is watching things 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.919
 very very cucumbers not because people are 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.100
 putting together for example in a very map 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.500
 small to 64 people is a complete 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.750
 chaos is better than heat has more 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.100
 action of course that the call of duty and 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.919
 to try not to stop and trying the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.509
 weapons how this game works more or 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.000
 least a little bit of playing strategies 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.370
 to objectives of shooting down helicopters of 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.080
 playing with tanks is not fun 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.870
 it was something that we are going to have in the new 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.729
 for telefilme clac call of duty and that 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.259
 well we can go practicing what 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.150
 is what we want to not go 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.860
 practicing for the month that for the year 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.270
 that comes to be able to enter with many 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.940
 forces eager to do well 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.310
 in the new game that they will take out not in 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.490
 My opinion, I think it's going to be pretty 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.229
 well if you mix a little the topics 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.660
 of small closed maps of the call of 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.130
 duty and they give us the classes we have 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.530
 here in the battlefield engineer of 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.870
 Recognition assault doctor can 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.400
 be a pretty pretty cool mix 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.009
 so at least I'm very 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.900
 attached not as they usually say I have 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.669
 eager to see more things to see more 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.780
 things you already know any opinion 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.150
 that you have the 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.600
 leave the comments section this 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.970
 last clip that I leave you is a bit a 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.500
 little dizzy but but I do not know I liked it and 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.880
 I said why are not we going to use this 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.430
 closing clip at the end of a video 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.780
 true so one kids I said 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.730
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.130
 we see in the next I do not know when it will be and 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.160
 I think that soon or never you know not like that 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.330
 that we see the next video a rock and 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.330
 never stop and see you later
