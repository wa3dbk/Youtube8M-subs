00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.390
 Hello everyone, good morning from Musicopolix Alcorcón. 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.440
 We speak to you from the workshop of luthería and we want to explain to you today one of the problems 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 more typical that we can find on a guitar and it is precisely when it is curved 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.290
 the mast, what is going on? 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:28.220
 We separate the action of the strings, making it a bit more uncomfortable to touch, 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.060
 How can we see it? 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.899
 There is a way to see what would be the following: a rule enough 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.239
 long as the guitar fretboard placing it from the first fret to the last and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 simply with a folio we realize that the sheet passes through the ruler, 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.170
 only where he will not be able to do it is on the first and last frets; this 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.280
 It is a very typical problem and what we are going to try to do is rectify the mast. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.071
 Well we are going to try to solve the problem, very important to rectify the mast 

00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:17.500
 if it is necessary that we have all the strings on and that the guitar has it 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.010
 tuned because right now it is holding the correct tension generated by the game of 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.620
 strings we have. 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.610
 In the sense of clockwise, is where we are going to be able to give tension 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.240
 to the mast, that is, bring this little tension that will always require us 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:52.681
 very progressive and little by little, while on the side we can see how the mast 

00:01:52.681 --> 00:02:11.450
 it is rectifying and it is taking that rectitude that we need. 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:34.069
 Sometimes it costs more to put the key than what comes to be the game that asks us, okay, 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:55.030
 little by little it is taking the form we need, we almost have it! 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.989
 Okay, if we can go appreciating the mast has returned to take a different curvature 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:09.430
 we always have to before we finish the work to check again what before 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.769
 It was the leaf that passed, now if we realize there are areas in which it passes and areas in 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:26.890
 which already the blade as you can see offers resistance, this means that the mast 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:35.849
 is reacting as we want. 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.890
 Well, why does this type of fault occur on our guitar? 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.060
 It includes a lot especially when we have changed a string gauge superior to that we had, 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.139
 since the guitar is supporting a very different tension and the mast is the one that suffers it; 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:02.609
 you can go through this, you can go through the weather interference, which suddenly comes a season 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:12.019
 very hot or very cold and do not forget that wood has no life? 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.260
 Wood is always going to put pressure on what the guitar is together with the pressure 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.989
 of the ropes. 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:28.810
 If now we look at how our work could have been left now, the sheet no longer passes through 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:41.220
 none of the frets; Now we can say that the neck of our guitar is totally 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220
 straight. 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.259
 What should we do as a last detail? 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:53.690
 Re-tune our guitar because with this adjustment some string could be modified 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.500
 and simply if you tune our guitar we will have it ready. 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.560
 See you later, see you in the next video.
