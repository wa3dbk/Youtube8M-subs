00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
at least one of my guesses was right and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.109 
at least one of my guesses was right and
this<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.130> where<00:00:23.279> some<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:23.730> words<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.029> the

past come back to bite me in my very
first<00:00:26.910> video<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.210> said<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> character<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
first video I said if the character that

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.259 
first video I said if the character that
I<00:00:29.070> donec<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.760> characters<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.090> don't

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I donec one of the characters I don't

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.060 
I donec one of the characters I don't
expect<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.630> get<00:00:30.750> him<00:00:30.900> Sinestro<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
expect to get him Sinestro because I

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
expect to get him Sinestro because I
believe<00:00:32.279> he'd<00:00:32.399> play<00:00:32.640> similarly<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> Green

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
believe he'd play similarly the Green

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.819 
believe he'd play similarly the Green
Lantern<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.989> don't<00:00:34.200> know<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.350> they<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
Lantern I don't know if they do that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.920 
Lantern I don't know if they do that
since<00:00:35.730> then<00:00:35.969> I've<00:00:36.090> seen<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.270> lot<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.660> gameplay

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
since then I've seen a lot more gameplay

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
since then I've seen a lot more gameplay
and<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.680> will<00:00:37.890> admit<00:00:38.040> my<00:00:38.370> opinion<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:39.030> least<00:00:39.090> for

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
and I will admit my opinion at least for

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.750 
and I will admit my opinion at least for
Sinestro<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.050> changed<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.190> believe

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
Sinestro has changed and I now believe

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.010 
Sinestro has changed and I now believe
that<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:42.120> could<00:00:42.270> at<00:00:42.360> least<00:00:42.540> play<00:00:42.899> him

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that they could at least play him

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
that they could at least play him
differently<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:44.160> don't<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> lot<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
differently and we don't see a lot of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.760 
differently and we don't see a lot of
gameplay<00:00:45.149> from<00:00:45.270> his<00:00:45.510> reveal<00:00:45.840> because<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.559> was

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
gameplay from his reveal because it was

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.170 
gameplay from his reveal because it was
an<00:00:47.010> ad<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> battle<00:00:48.030> arena<00:00:48.200> episodes<00:00:49.200> so

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
an ad for the battle arena episodes so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.580 
an ad for the battle arena episodes so
we<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> shot<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> his<00:00:51.780> intro<00:00:52.140> right<00:00:52.379> here

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
we get a shot of his intro right here

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.650 
we get a shot of his intro right here
and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.640> how<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.879> similar<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.329> Green

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
and I like how it's similar to Green

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.939 
and I like how it's similar to Green
Lantern's<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.590> sounds<00:00:55.800> weird

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
Lantern's and I know that sounds weird

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.319 
Lantern's and I know that sounds weird
cuz<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.399> said<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.969> he'll<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.270> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
with Sinestro fighting with what makes

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
with Sinestro fighting with what makes
his<00:01:15.869> element<00:01:16.200> work<00:01:16.409> which<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.799> fear<00:01:17.280> they<00:01:18.030> also

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.090 
that looks good also we get a shot of
what<00:01:25.920> appears<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:27.259> one<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> his<00:01:28.619> super<00:01:28.950> move

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
what appears to be one of his super move

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.310 
what appears to be one of his super move
and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.729> don't<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.060> he<00:01:30.150> creates<00:01:30.689> two<00:01:30.990> giant

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and I don't know if he creates two giant
