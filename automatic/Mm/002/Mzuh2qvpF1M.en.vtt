because<00:00:11.340> most<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.969> us<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.960> we<00:00:13.679> overeat

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
because most of us think that we overeat

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340 
because most of us think that we overeat
simply<00:00:14.549> because<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.660> lack<00:00:16.199> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
simply because we have lack of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.710 
simply because we have lack of
discipline<00:00:16.770> or<00:00:17.010> lack<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.460> willpower<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.630> I

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
discipline or lack of willpower but I

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.330 
discipline or lack of willpower but I
can<00:00:18.900> promise<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.920> not<00:00:20.130> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
can promise you that that is not the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.480 
can promise you that that is not the
case<00:00:20.810> actually<00:00:21.810> overeating<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
case actually overeating is not the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.550 
case actually overeating is not the
problem<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:24.029> truly<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> symptom<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
problem it's truly a symptom of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.830 
problem it's truly a symptom of
something<00:00:26.130> else<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.240> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840

something else that is going on for you
so<00:00:28.050> today<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.800> want<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.130> explore<00:00:29.550> some<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
so today I want to explore some of the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.200 
so today I want to explore some of the
avenues<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.170> might<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.679> worth<00:00:31.949> looking<00:00:32.820> at

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
avenues that might be worth looking at

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.020 
avenues that might be worth looking at
number<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.590> lack<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.160> awareness<00:00:35.399> so

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
number one is lack of awareness so

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
number one is lack of awareness so
simply<00:00:36.570> put<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.050> are<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.440> present<00:00:38.100> when<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
simply put you are not present when you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.299 
simply put you are not present when you
are<00:00:38.940> eating<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:40.020> your<00:00:40.200> brain<00:00:40.559> isn't<00:00:40.860> able<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
are eating so your brain isn't able to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.280 
are eating so your brain isn't able to
register<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.360> pleasure<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
register the pleasure and the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.990 
register the pleasure and the
nourishment<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.010> comes<00:00:44.489> along<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
nourishment that comes along with the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
nourishment that comes along with the
eating<00:00:45.270> experience<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.200> even<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.739> are

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
eating experience and so even if you are

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.670 
eating experience and so even if you are
not<00:00:47.190> physically<00:00:48.180> hungry<00:00:48.450> anymore<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.379> brain

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
not physically hungry anymore the brain

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.580 
not physically hungry anymore the brain
will<00:00:50.039> still<00:00:50.309> say<00:00:50.610> hungry<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.379> those

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
will still say hungry so in those

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110 
will still say hungry so in those
situations<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.640> want<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> bring<00:00:53.969> your

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
situations you really want to bring your

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.569 
situations you really want to bring your
attention<00:00:54.239> back<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.260> yourself<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.039> back<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
attention back to yourself and back to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
attention back to yourself and back to
the<00:00:56.670> plate<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.649> full

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the plate so that you can get the full

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.560 
the plate so that you can get the full
eating<00:00:59.699> experience

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
eating experience

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.770 
eating experience
number<00:01:01.170> two<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.710> skipping<00:01:02.550> meals<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.539> body

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
number two is skipping meals so the body

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.410 
number two is skipping meals so the body
loves<00:01:04.220> homeostasis<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.610> always<00:01:05.939> craving

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
loves homeostasis it's always craving

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.200 
loves homeostasis it's always craving
and<00:01:06.750> looking<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> balanced<00:01:08.250> state<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and looking for a balanced state so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.690 
and looking for a balanced state so
think<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.750> physical<00:01:10.200> hunger<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
think of your physical hunger as a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.120 
think of your physical hunger as a
pendulum<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.869> goes<00:01:12.990> too<00:01:13.530> far<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.890> one

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
pendulum if it goes too far in one

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.910 
pendulum if it goes too far in one
direction<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.790> will<00:01:15.270> come<00:01:15.770> swinging<00:01:16.770> back

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
direction it will come swinging back

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
direction it will come swinging back
with<00:01:17.400> vengeance<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> opposite<00:01:18.630> direction

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
with vengeance in the opposite direction

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.980 
with vengeance in the opposite direction
so<00:01:19.320> oftentimes<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.729> skip<00:01:21.119> meals<00:01:21.390> or<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.840> we

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
so oftentimes if we skip meals or if we

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.700 
so oftentimes if we skip meals or if we
go<00:01:22.170> too<00:01:22.650> far<00:01:23.040> past<00:01:23.090> physical<00:01:24.090> hunger<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:25.229> can

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
go too far past physical hunger that can

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.700 
go too far past physical hunger that can
lead<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.580> overeating<00:01:27.140> number<00:01:28.140> three<00:01:28.500> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
lead to overeating number three is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.190 
lead to overeating number three is
attempting<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> de-stress<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:31.020> this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
attempting to de-stress so get this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.249 
attempting to de-stress so get this
within<00:01:31.950> 30<00:01:32.430> seconds<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.180> chewing<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
within 30 seconds of chewing and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.460 
within 30 seconds of chewing and
swallowing<00:01:34.710> your<00:01:35.130> food<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.210> body<00:01:36.470> releases

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
swallowing your food the body releases

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.590 
swallowing your food the body releases
chemicals<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.430> automatically<00:01:39.150> put<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
chemicals that automatically put the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.679 
chemicals that automatically put the
body<00:01:39.750> into<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> state<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> relaxation<00:01:41.689> so
