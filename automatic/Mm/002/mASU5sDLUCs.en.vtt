00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.680
 very short a beach about a yes i am 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.450
 the countland specialist also called from the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.849
 Polar also provide agricultural extension 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.170
 and i am joris ethiopie 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.929
 gives wax time for paulus in your 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.750
 programs and then why is it 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.810
 increasingly important to that grass we 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.510
 actually want on my feet and legs 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.310
 viewing angle there account on average 2 to more 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.220
 drying off the coming years 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.710
 must pick up from our countland 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.570
 shit average on lakes and you see 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.370
 just put the cows aside and colleagues 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 yours measured that shit on which 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.170
 all a thousand kilos of that accident 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.610
 what I do now is 2 tons of dry matter 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.870
 each a little said to each other 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.579
 should be possible 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.940
 well what is important for that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.590
 anyway that i am disses 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.420
 large is quite fixed I have here 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.489
 l always take which I often bring 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.410
 so a meter or stock here all that to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.879
 the most beautiful and certainly now the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.890
 field capacity is actually how that 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.359
 stick shirt or seti more the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.070
 each other on those grass roots super 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.840
 centimeters deep just 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.360
 then I hardly come here you come 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490
 on yes no the angry are eaten and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.460
 poked the 30 centimeters then sit 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.689
 for the hard layer that we are all in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 back to work 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.830
 it's all the combination I say is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.240
 combination of machines and the year 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.250
 I prefer to feel a bit like that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.710
 great company but I always call it 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.619
 the next step there should be the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 warm to work then must be good 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.540
 West on November November eric days 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.970
 we also need a lot about this in the summer 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.799
 the people have been careful so not 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.780
 on that short grass 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.229
 when I always link myself there 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.990
 falls slightly longer in the summer 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.620
 combine the evidence and the wing beat with 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.440
 add a third of water 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.840
 For those warm who find it tasty 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.460
 Shane generally went on 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.560
 only a mechanical operation to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.550
 do then those next step 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.740
 to say what is very quickly cost-effective two 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.010
 tons of dry matter I just finished 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.390
 the harvest still cost you the 350 euros 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.690
 more her floor 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.850
 perry yes well you can go on and on 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.400
 sorry i say a grass seed and soon must 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.010
 you ask the man but evers 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.410
 the yes with such a machine only costs one 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.360
 you are grass seed when you hit the talc 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.360
 caused that we now use here 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.250
 tonight you are around 75 euros 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.470
 mass of hectares 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.750
 but you can also coolblue very well 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.120
 you doubt God is in spring 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.430
 whether or not needed by saying that I say 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.230
 always be as usual but the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.630
 combination of weed and genee 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.500
 is fantastic and just grab it 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.210
 italia italian row then you pick up 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.890
 weather euros a kilo then you are still 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.130
 did not lose 40 euros 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.980
 he almost always said they were not profitable 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.100
 what i flower for is biology and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.810
 closed grass solar it now also me 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.440
 think it's free throw them alone 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.170
 where you that he no weeds 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.380
 so that way is yes by boring and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.640
 also on this triangle of italian there is 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.410
 do in spring 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.000
 yes I also immediately drobo tons of dry matter 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:16.170
 more what you win in the pol pot season 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.150
 so it's all that combination of works 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.650
 because there was actually a short one at the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.530
 so the two choice securing in grasses 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.870
 scratches or types are by his and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.790
 I think these machines in the future 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.320
 even more important you 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.820
 itself by there must be a plan this is 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.620
 one come I'll come again my own 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.450
 area in which it will film one with 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.760
 by being his machine behind the tractor 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.360
 in the week really ahead of the towing ones 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.620
 combination can also concern me who 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.850
 that really is a super good in unison yes 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.290
 walk forward 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.960
 Sowing and also by his coming 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.710
 actually now in focus again in fact 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.650
 is 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.350
 August and you wipe the second at nice 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.330
 on now can gladly again from chairs that the 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.170
 bloom fly weight at so scratch you can 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.840
 again sound chair and created none 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:12.460
 make sense just concerned with business 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.460
