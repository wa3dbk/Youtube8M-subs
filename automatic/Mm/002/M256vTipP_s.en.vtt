my favorite part about having a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.650 
my favorite part about having a
leadership<00:01:28.860> position<00:01:29.160> is<00:01:29.790> being<00:01:30.150> able<00:01:30.480> to

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
leadership position is being able to

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.470 
leadership position is being able to
serve<00:01:30.900> others<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:32.430> other<00:01:32.700> people<00:01:33.120> enjoy

serve others and see other people enjoy

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.270 
serve others and see other people enjoy
the<00:01:34.200> work<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> they're<00:01:34.620> doing<00:01:34.680> because<00:01:35.070> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the work that they're doing because I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.990 
the work that they're doing because I
was<00:01:35.670> able<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.090> help<00:01:36.270> them<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.660> serve<00:01:36.840> them

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.850 

what<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> miss<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.360> most<00:01:42.510> about<00:01:43.080> being<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
what I miss the most about being on the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.520 
what I miss the most about being on the
field<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.520> probably<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.240> marching<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
field is probably the marching because I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.990 
field is probably the marching because I
used<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.830> be<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> pretty<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.340> marcher<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.910> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
used to be a pretty good marcher and I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.690 
used to be a pretty good marcher and I
miss<00:01:48.470> all<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.620> marching<00:01:49.950> fundamentals<00:01:50.460> like

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
miss all the marching fundamentals like

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
miss all the marching fundamentals like
keeping<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.210> chin<00:01:51.240> high<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.080> your<00:01:52.200> toes<00:01:52.410> up

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
keeping your chin high and your toes up

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:17.649
