00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.830 
always tried to learn new Bach pieces
when<00:01:30.670> I<00:01:30.700> finally<00:01:31.000> made<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.270> classical<00:01:31.690> record

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
when I finally made a classical record

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240 
when I finally made a classical record
and<00:01:32.110> I<00:01:32.170> took<00:01:32.230> them<00:01:32.470> you<00:01:32.740> know<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:32.890> more

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
and I took them you know a more

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.280 
and I took them you know a more
aggressive<00:01:33.970> approach<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.900> whole<00:01:35.050> thing

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
aggressive approach to the whole thing

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.020 
aggressive approach to the whole thing
and<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.920> learned<00:01:36.100> some<00:01:36.280> music<00:01:36.550> from<00:01:36.670> some<00:01:36.910> other

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
and I learned some music from some other

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.390 
and I learned some music from some other
people

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
people

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.600 
people
Paganini<00:01:39.240> Chopin<00:01:40.080> some<00:01:40.770> dates<00:01:40.950> open<00:01:41.160> some

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
Paganini Chopin some dates open some

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.600 
Paganini Chopin some dates open some
Debussy<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.710> some<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:43.890> music<00:01:44.250> works<00:01:44.430> on

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
Debussy and some of that music works on

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.260 
Debussy and some of that music works on
the<00:01:44.700> banjo<00:01:44.880> yeah<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:46.230> in<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.830> end<00:01:47.270> he's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the banjo yeah but in in the end he's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.190 
the banjo yeah but in in the end he's
trying<00:01:48.510> to<00:01:48.570> play<00:01:48.690> music<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.050> was<00:01:49.140> written

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
trying to play music that was written

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.010 
trying to play music that was written
for<00:01:49.380> another<00:01:49.650> instrument<00:01:49.980> force<00:01:50.370> so<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.020> like

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
for another instrument force so I like

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.360 
for another instrument force so I like
one<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.260> my<00:01:52.350> goals<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> write<00:01:53.010> music<00:01:53.340> for

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
one of my goals is to write music for

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.120 
one of my goals is to write music for
the<00:01:53.580> banjo<00:01:53.990> yes<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> harmony<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the banjo yes that kind of harmony and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.530 
the banjo yes that kind of harmony and
that<00:01:56.190> kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.580> motion<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.030> think<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that kind of motion I think kind of

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
that kind of motion I think kind of
depth<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:59.280> built<00:01:59.490> around<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
depth to it that it's built around the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910 
depth to it that it's built around the
banjo<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.870> feel<00:02:01.080> I<00:02:01.260> see<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
banjo and I feel I see that that is a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.210 
banjo and I feel I see that that is a
nice<00:02:02.910> big<00:02:03.450> hole<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:04.140> has<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.770> creating

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
nice big hole it has you know creating

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.710 
nice big hole it has you know creating
repertoire<00:02:05.670> written<00:02:05.970> repertoire<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
repertoire written repertoire for the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.480 
repertoire written repertoire for the
banjo<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.110> teaches<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:08.130> about<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
banjo the teaches you about the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.190 
banjo the teaches you about the
instrument<00:02:08.700> uses<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.270> open<00:02:09.390> strings<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
instrument uses the open strings and the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.900 
instrument uses the open strings and the
rolls<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.679> they're<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.610> different

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
rolls and they're the different

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
rolls and they're the different
techniques<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.300> I've<00:02:12.510> been<00:02:12.540> working<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.050> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
techniques that I've been working on to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.530 
techniques that I've been working on to
create<00:02:13.890> music<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> techniques<00:02:15.390> are

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
create music because the techniques are

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.830 
create music because the techniques are
kind<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:16.220> they're<00:02:17.220> just<00:02:17.490> flash<00:02:18.300> unless<00:02:18.660> you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
kind of they're just flash unless you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330 
kind of they're just flash unless you
actually<00:02:19.170> make<00:02:19.320> some<00:02:19.500> music<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.010> somebody

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
actually make some music that somebody

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.830 
actually make some music that somebody
wants<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> listen<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.480> want<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> write

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
wants to listen to so I want to write

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.960 
wants to listen to so I want to write
these<00:02:22.020> pieces<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.340> actually<00:02:23.700> want<00:02:23.880> to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
these pieces that you actually want to

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.990 
these pieces that you actually want to
listen<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.660> music
