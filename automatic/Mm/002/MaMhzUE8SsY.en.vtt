00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.080
 but the robberies 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.880
 I am 13 years old 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.550
 my teacher the only thing she did was 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.570
 call me from the head of dumb cork oak 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.950
 Beijing and it did not stop giving him dislikes and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.950
 headaches to my parents 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:55.300
 then how to say it the black beast 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.770
 of my childhood is a bully that I know 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.120
 he got alone because he envied me 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.120
 I also did everything 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.790
 we remove the pants and lower the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.790
 pants in the crotch 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.520
 and they tell me I'm asperger 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:27.530
 because I like to relate to myself now 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.530
 I understand ironies about this very much 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.220
 my love 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.800
 with 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.770
 I am 20 years old and I was diagnosed with 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.630
 special when I was 14 to 16 years old 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 because I want to talk to someone so 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.990
 general if I can think of what to talk about 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.719
 what I like to imagine is that inside 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.450
 20 years would be working maybe from 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.900
 Professor, I would like to have some 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.950
 Safe time or at least with girlfriend 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.160
 always having like to have a child 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.830
 or a couple this little one has always wanted 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.590
 have children 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.879
 that one day have a child boy who 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.879
 say this is my son 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.020
 when I wanted to be 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.159
 a paleontologist a first fossil I'm going 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:50.290
 to find is that of the iii reich is a 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:57.189
 tyrannosaurus rex audio thing or the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:03:02.170
 stegosaurus triceratops to the audio and 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:05.440
 the imagination of an imagination 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.720
 everything until the dinosaurs start to 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.900
 build the world until you finish it and 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.020
 there begins 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.980
 the bad news that is when I leave 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:25.620
 from there until that year 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:29.099
 I got fed up with that world between with a modem 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.500
 and power is to go down if the world is 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:36.739
 broke forever from my life and from 20 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.739
 years 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.950
 very bad and that's why 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.790
 Y 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.980
 and I good to other children came better 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.810
 as a person with 100 db asperger 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.410
 It would be a person 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.600
 what 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.710
 he wants to fit in but he does not know what 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.010
 who is doing wrong knows that people 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.120
 I repudiated them for something 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:23.380
 something that says something that makes 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:28.199
 I have difficulties living in a world 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.199
 I do not know that I do not understand 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.860
 each person with asperger syndrome 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.230
 he has a way to defend himself from the world 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.050
 outside for example mine is to bury 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:43.330
 of myself my books in my imagination 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.610
 I keep everything and then it takes me to 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.480
 a parallel world because then there is no 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.240
 could hurt me all those 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.990
 people who usually tend to be 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.520
 moderately ready and they have known um 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.180
 usually have syndrome 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.910
 Asperger 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.280
 I have a hope then to look like 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.560
 a little bit to them in that sense of doing 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:14.300
 something changed the world does not have to either 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:16.729
 be nothing if my name prevails 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.620
 the story many times I thought that 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.880
 christina name that does not want us now 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.940
 I think we are beginning to understand 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.970
 that the way of wanting is different from 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.100
 what we might feel we do not 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.630
 a person cry is not that I do not 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.699
 you feel that it seems you do not feel what 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.250
 we know how the past because if there 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.240
 social integration if there is no relationship 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.460
 Social 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.990
 there's nothing I think a person with 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.320
 Asperger's syndrome in our world is 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.720
 feels fatal because fundamentally the 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.460
 world is very social things that stops 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.360
 we are obvious they are logical of the day 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.360
 a day it costs them
