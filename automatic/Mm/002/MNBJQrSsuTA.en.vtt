00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
action I'm pretty sure the reason that

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.010 
action I'm pretty sure the reason that
sits<00:02:30.760> there<00:02:30.850> now<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.510> case<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.900> happens

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020
