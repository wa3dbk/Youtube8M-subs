I'm<00:00:14.759> really<00:00:14.880> seeing<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.389> video<00:00:15.690> comparing

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
I'm really seeing a video comparing

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.620 
I'm really seeing a video comparing
increases<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.340> once<00:00:17.699> that's<00:00:17.850> video<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
increases and once that's video the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.480 
increases and once that's video the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
of ideas for videos that I'm shooting

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.430 
of ideas for videos that I'm shooting
from<00:00:32.550> people<00:00:32.940> giving<00:00:33.360> me<00:00:33.390> suggestions<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
from people giving me suggestions and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
from people giving me suggestions and
the<00:00:34.860> reason<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.489> video<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.940> important

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the reason that this video is important

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.940 
the reason that this video is important
is<00:00:37.520> sometimes<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.640> pattern<00:00:38.940> will<00:00:39.090> tell<00:00:39.120> you

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
is sometimes a pattern will tell you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.139 
is sometimes a pattern will tell you
especially<00:00:40.950> older<00:00:41.280> patterns<00:00:41.430> will<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.000> say

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
especially older patterns will just say

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.869 
especially older patterns will just say
decrease<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:43.280> decrease<00:00:44.280> ten<00:00:44.489> times<00:00:44.670> across

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
decrease like decrease ten times across

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.940 
decrease like decrease ten times across
the<00:00:45.180> row<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.500> emails<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:46.829> people

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the row and I get emails from people

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.310 
the row and I get emails from people
saying<00:00:47.190> what's<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:48.450> decrease<00:00:48.960> should<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> do

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
saying what's what decrease should I do

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
saying what's what decrease should I do
they<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.739> specify<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:51.180> at<00:00:51.270> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
they don't specify and really at that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
they don't specify and really at that
point<00:00:51.480> its<00:00:51.960> knitters<00:00:52.289> choice<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
point its knitters choice if the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.740 
point its knitters choice if the
designer<00:00:53.430> hasn't<00:00:53.820> given<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.149> specific

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
designer hasn't given you specific

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360 
designer hasn't given you specific
instructions<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> use<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
instructions for which one to use you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.770 
instructions for which one to use you
can<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:56.969> whichever<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.660> want

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
can really use whichever one you want

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.569 
can really use whichever one you want
which<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.440> why<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> good<00:00:58.800> idea<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.460> how

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
which is why it's a good idea to see how

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.150 
which is why it's a good idea to see how
they<00:00:59.760> look<00:01:00.030> next<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.600> each<00:01:00.719> other<00:01:00.980> or<00:01:01.980> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
they look next to each other or you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.060 
they look next to each other or you
might<00:01:02.340> decide<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:03.290> do<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> different<00:01:04.680> decrease

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
might decide to do a different decrease

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.980 
might decide to do a different decrease
than<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> pattern<00:01:05.729> recommends<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
than the pattern recommends and so I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.450 
than the pattern recommends and so I
want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> show<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:07.950> look<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
want to show you what they look like so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
want to show you what they look like so
you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.610> make<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> good<00:01:09.060> choice<00:01:09.330> first<00:01:10.290> I'm

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

this weirdo piece of knitting I have

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.670 
this weirdo piece of knitting I have
here<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> different<00:01:36.930> decreases<00:01:37.470> I'm

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
here with the different decreases I'm

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
here with the different decreases I'm
going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> run<00:01:38.430> through<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.729> real<00:01:39.000> quick<00:01:39.210> so

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
you can see how they're worked there are

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.020 
you can see how they're worked there are
three<00:01:42.600> basic<00:01:42.840> decreases<00:01:43.619> I'm<00:01:43.740> sure<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.250> lot<00:01:44.970> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
three basic decreases I'm sure a lot of

three basic decreases I'm sure a lot of
you<00:01:45.180> already<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.509> how<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> work<00:01:45.840> these<00:01:46.909> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
you already know how to work these this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.789 
you already know how to work these this
here<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.960> knit<00:01:49.610> border

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.510 

and<00:01:55.719> this<00:01:56.719> first<00:01:56.929> one<00:01:57.259> knit<00:01:57.890> up<00:01:58.009> two<00:01:58.189> stitches

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
and this first one knit up two stitches

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.560 
and this first one knit up two stitches
before<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.880> marker<00:01:59.000> it's<00:01:59.570> knit<00:02:00.170> two<00:02:00.350> together

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
before the marker it's knit two together

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.090 
before the marker it's knit two together
and<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.659> find<00:02:02.929> that<00:02:03.020> just<00:02:03.110> about<00:02:03.409> every<00:02:03.829> knitter

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
and I find that just about every knitter

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.320 
and I find that just about every knitter
learns<00:02:04.429> knit<00:02:04.820> two<00:02:05.000> together<00:02:05.119> as<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.659> beginner

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
learns knit two together as a beginner

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.089 
learns knit two together as a beginner
because<00:02:08.330> they<00:02:08.599> they<00:02:09.289> find<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:09.800> an<00:02:09.920> easy

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
because they they find that it's an easy

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.949 
because they they find that it's an easy
way<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.459> get<00:02:10.789> their<00:02:10.970> stitch<00:02:11.180> count<00:02:11.480> back<00:02:11.690> down

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
way to get their stitch count back down

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.660 
way to get their stitch count back down
to<00:02:12.170> where<00:02:12.260> it's<00:02:12.410> supposed<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.799> be<00:02:12.920> they<00:02:13.400> figure

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
to where it's supposed to be they figure

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.180 
to where it's supposed to be they figure
it<00:02:13.730> out<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.940> their<00:02:14.060> own<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.870> next<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.379> is<00:02:15.410> SSK

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
it out on their own this next one is SSK

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.390 
it out on their own this next one is SSK
so<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:16.879> slip<00:02:17.360> one<00:02:17.569> stitch<00:02:17.599> as<00:02:17.989> if<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.170> knit<00:02:18.400> sit

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
so I slip one stitch as if to knit sit

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.280 
so I slip one stitch as if to knit sit
slip<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.940> second<00:02:20.299> stitch<00:02:20.480> as<00:02:20.599> if<00:02:20.629> to<00:02:20.780> knit<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
slip the second stitch as if to knit and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.619 
slip the second stitch as if to knit and
knit<00:02:22.280> those<00:02:22.489> two<00:02:22.819> together<00:02:22.970> through<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.599> back

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
knit those two together through the back

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:30.490 
knit those two together through the back
loop<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:27.530> next<00:02:27.799> one<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.090> psso<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:29.500> going

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
loop and this next one is psso I'm going

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.660 
loop and this next one is psso I'm going
to<00:02:30.590> slip<00:02:30.920> one<00:02:30.950> stitch<00:02:31.190> as<00:02:31.549> if<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.730> purl<00:02:32.060> knit

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
to slip one stitch as if to purl knit

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.140 
to slip one stitch as if to purl knit
one<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.440> then<00:02:36.440> bind<00:02:36.799> one<00:02:37.099> stitch<00:02:37.430> off<00:02:37.610> over

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
one and then bind one stitch off over

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.759 
one and then bind one stitch off over
the<00:02:38.269> other<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.690> that's<00:02:38.900> passing<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> slip

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
the other one that's passing the slip

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.100 
the other one that's passing the slip
stitch<00:02:40.069> over<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:41.360> let<00:02:41.420> me<00:02:41.569> finish<00:02:41.720> up<00:02:41.959> this

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
stitch over just let me finish up this

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.930 
stitch over just let me finish up this
row<00:02:42.170> real<00:02:42.590> quick<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.280> we'll<00:02:43.400> take<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.640> look<00:02:43.819> at

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
row real quick and we'll take a look at

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.440 
row real quick and we'll take a look at
these

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.650 

okay<00:02:51.610> now<00:02:52.610> as<00:02:52.850> you're<00:02:53.150> trying<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.450> make<00:02:53.600> a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
okay now as you're trying to make a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.740 
okay now as you're trying to make a
decision<00:02:54.140> for<00:02:55.100> what<00:02:55.670> decreases<00:02:56.330> you're<00:02:56.510> going

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
decision for what decreases you're going

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.170 
decision for what decreases you're going
to<00:02:56.870> use<00:02:57.170> we'll<00:02:57.500> take<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.710> look<00:02:57.950> at<00:02:58.070> these<00:02:58.250> the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
to use we'll take a look at these the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.600 
to use we'll take a look at these the
first<00:02:59.420> one<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.720> did<00:02:59.930> here<00:03:00.380> was<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:01.040> knit<00:03:01.400> two

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
first one that I did here was a knit two

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.700 
first one that I did here was a knit two
together<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.300> if<00:03:02.510> we<00:03:02.570> isolate<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:03.410> stitch

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
together and if we isolate this stitch

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.490 
together and if we isolate this stitch
you'll<00:03:04.010> see<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.520> is<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.850> right-leaning<00:03:05.630> single

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
you'll see it is a right-leaning single

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.740 
you'll see it is a right-leaning single
decrease<00:03:07.180> definitely<00:03:08.180> leans<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.660> right

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
decrease definitely leans to the right

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.890 
decrease definitely leans to the right
and<00:03:09.230> as<00:03:09.950> we<00:03:10.130> move<00:03:10.310> over<00:03:10.400> here<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:11.300> SSK

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
and as we move over here to the SSK

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.300 
and as we move over here to the SSK
you'll<00:03:12.230> see<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:12.860> left-leaning

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
you'll see that it's a left-leaning

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.270 
you'll see that it's a left-leaning
decrease<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.600> that's<00:03:15.110> why<00:03:15.350> these<00:03:15.410> two<00:03:15.710> look

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
decrease and that's why these two look

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.430 
decrease and that's why these two look
really<00:03:16.310> good<00:03:16.760> mirrored<00:03:17.300> together<00:03:17.690> if<00:03:17.990> you're

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
really good mirrored together if you're

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.650 
really good mirrored together if you're
if<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.460> need<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> double<00:03:20.000> decrease<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.600> you

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
if you need a double decrease and you

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.570 
if you need a double decrease and you
have<00:03:20.840> like<00:03:21.020> a<00:03:21.050> center<00:03:21.380> marker<00:03:21.800> what<00:03:22.310> I've<00:03:22.400> done

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
have like a center marker what I've done

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.900 
have like a center marker what I've done
here<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.120> knit<00:03:23.510> two<00:03:23.660> together<00:03:23.780> knit<00:03:24.320> two<00:03:24.980> ssk

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
here is knit two together knit two ssk

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.760 
here is knit two together knit two ssk
and<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.300> gave<00:03:26.450> me<00:03:26.630> kind<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:26.840> this<00:03:26.959> wide<00:03:27.230> column

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
and it gave me kind of this wide column

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.540 
and it gave me kind of this wide column
of<00:03:28.510> mirrored<00:03:29.510> mirrored<00:03:30.410> decreases<00:03:31.310> which

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
of mirrored mirrored decreases which

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.340 
of mirrored mirrored decreases which
ends<00:03:31.820> up<00:03:31.910> looking<00:03:32.030> pretty<00:03:32.209> good<00:03:32.660> these<00:03:33.290> are

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
ends up looking pretty good these are

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.290 
ends up looking pretty good these are
probably<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.550> most<00:03:34.730> inconspicuous

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
probably the most inconspicuous

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.260 
probably the most inconspicuous
decreases<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.410> can<00:03:36.620> you<00:03:37.160> can<00:03:37.370> make<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.790> SSK

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
decreases you can you can make the SSK

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.900 
decreases you can you can make the SSK
add<00:03:38.450> knit<00:03:38.720> two<00:03:38.840> together<00:03:38.930> an<00:03:39.200> SSK<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.980> then<00:03:40.790> we

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
add knit two together an SSK and then we

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.140 
add knit two together an SSK and then we
move<00:03:41.090> over<00:03:41.330> here<00:03:42.010> there<00:03:43.010> are<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.220> lot<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.760> older

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
move over here there are a lot of older

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.470 
move over here there are a lot of older
patterns<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:45.440> think<00:03:46.280> SSK<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:46.970> something<00:03:47.300> that's

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
patterns I think SSK is something that's

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.900 
patterns I think SSK is something that's
come<00:03:47.780> more<00:03:48.410> into<00:03:48.800> use<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.310> past<00:03:49.520> twenty

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
come more into use in the past twenty

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.120 
come more into use in the past twenty
years<00:03:49.940> or<00:03:50.270> so<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:51.170> lot<00:03:51.350> of<00:03:51.470> older<00:03:51.770> patterns

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
years or so and a lot of older patterns

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.390 
years or so and a lot of older patterns
will<00:03:52.280> have<00:03:52.520> you<00:03:52.730> do<00:03:52.940> psso<00:03:54.340> instead<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.459> SSK<00:03:56.090> and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
will have you do psso instead of SSK and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.470 
will have you do psso instead of SSK and
depending<00:03:58.400> on<00:03:58.489> how<00:03:58.640> you<00:03:58.700> want<00:03:58.820> your<00:03:59.090> work<00:03:59.269> to

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
depending on how you want your work to

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.600 
depending on how you want your work to
look<00:03:59.630> you<00:03:59.810> may<00:04:00.050> want<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.320> substitute<00:04:00.680> SSK<00:04:01.430> when

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
look you may want to substitute SSK when

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.729 
look you may want to substitute SSK when
it<00:04:01.700> calls<00:04:01.910> for<00:04:02.000> psso<00:04:02.690> because<00:04:03.350> this<00:04:03.530> is<00:04:03.709> a

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
it calls for psso because this is a

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.500 
it calls for psso because this is a
left-leaning<00:04:04.190> decrease<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.120> has<00:04:05.300> a

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
left-leaning decrease and it has a

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.290 
left-leaning decrease and it has a
really<00:04:06.019> strong<00:04:06.470> line<00:04:07.250> leaning<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.209> left

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
really strong line leaning to the left

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.810 
really strong line leaning to the left
in<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:08.989> can<00:04:09.140> see<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.800> is<00:04:10.220> almost<00:04:10.610> a

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
in it you can see it is almost a

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.259 
in it you can see it is almost a
decorative<00:04:11.890> decorative<00:04:12.890> decrease<00:04:13.550> it<00:04:13.940> used

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
decorative decorative decrease it used

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.440 
decorative decorative decrease it used
to<00:04:14.420> be<00:04:15.130> in<00:04:16.130> my<00:04:16.340> experience<00:04:16.820> in<00:04:16.970> older<00:04:17.299> patterns

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
to be in my experience in older patterns

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.909 
to be in my experience in older patterns
they'll<00:04:17.810> have<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.169> paired<00:04:18.380> with<00:04:18.590> knit<00:04:18.769> two

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
they'll have it paired with knit two

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.039 
they'll have it paired with knit two
together<00:04:19.040> for<00:04:19.549> mirrored<00:04:19.940> decreases<00:04:20.510> but<00:04:20.959> you

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
together for mirrored decreases but you

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.990 
together for mirrored decreases but you
can<00:04:21.229> see<00:04:21.410> SSK<00:04:22.040> and<00:04:22.220> knit<00:04:22.340> two<00:04:22.460> together<00:04:22.580> look

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
can see SSK and knit two together look

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.450 
can see SSK and knit two together look
far<00:04:23.270> better<00:04:23.479> and<00:04:23.840> closer<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.620> each<00:04:24.650> other<00:04:24.890> than

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
far better and closer to each other than

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.960 
far better and closer to each other than
psso<00:04:26.240> but<00:04:26.750> it's<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:26.930> pretty<00:04:27.169> decrease<00:04:27.650> and

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
psso but it's a pretty decrease and

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.130 
psso but it's a pretty decrease and
certainly<00:04:28.970> can<00:04:29.150> look<00:04:29.270> good<00:04:29.419> like<00:04:29.630> if<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.930> are

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
certainly can look good like if you are

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.909 
certainly can look good like if you are
doing<00:04:31.240> doing<00:04:32.240> line<00:04:32.510> two<00:04:32.840> lined<00:04:33.200> up<00:04:33.350> decreases

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919

in a hat or something it's definitely a

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
pretty strong statement and this piece

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.640 
pretty strong statement and this piece
this<00:04:41.120> crazy<00:04:41.390> piece<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.930> no<00:04:42.080> one's<00:04:42.229> ever<00:04:42.380> going

this crazy piece and no one's ever going
to<00:04:42.710> want<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:42.979> copy<00:04:43.190> what<00:04:43.400> I've<00:04:43.490> done<00:04:43.640> here<00:04:43.880> but

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
to want to copy what I've done here but

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.570 
to want to copy what I've done here but
I<00:04:44.300> did<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.990> decreases<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:46.130> wrong<00:04:46.310> side

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
I did the decreases and the wrong side

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.550 
I did the decreases and the wrong side
of<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:46.760> work<00:04:46.940> is<00:04:47.180> just<00:04:47.990> knitting<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.440> knits

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
of the work is just knitting the knits

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.490 
of the work is just knitting the knits
and<00:04:48.740> purling<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.190> pearls<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.790> then<00:04:50.660> every

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
and purling the pearls and then every

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.280 
and purling the pearls and then every
right<00:04:51.650> side<00:04:51.680> row<00:04:51.919> was<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.400> decreases<00:04:52.970> so<00:04:53.479> this

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
right side row was the decreases so this

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.159 
right side row was the decreases so this
is<00:04:54.440> every<00:04:54.770> other<00:04:55.000> row<00:04:56.000> decrease<00:04:56.510> every<00:04:57.050> other

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
is every other row decrease every other

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.080 
is every other row decrease every other
row<00:04:57.380> decrease<00:04:57.860> every<00:04:58.160> other<00:04:58.430> row<00:04:58.640> decrease

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
row decrease every other row decrease

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.719 
row decrease every other row decrease
that<00:05:00.080> might<00:05:00.200> help<00:05:00.380> you<00:05:00.530> make<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.680> decision<00:05:00.979> as
