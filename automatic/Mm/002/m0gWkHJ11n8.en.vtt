00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
it's tight and firm I'm making sure I'm

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.330 
it's tight and firm I'm making sure I'm
set<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:57.479> I'm<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.539> I'm<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.990> non<00:01:59.350> look<00:01:59.619> snapper<00:01:59.889> on

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
set and I'm a I'm a non look snapper on

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.999 
set and I'm a I'm a non look snapper on
punt<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.479> I'll<00:02:01.659> look<00:02:01.899> back<00:02:02.109> I'll<00:02:02.319> find<00:02:02.560> my<00:02:02.709> spot

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
punt so I'll look back I'll find my spot

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.569 
punt so I'll look back I'll find my spot
and<00:02:03.280> then<00:02:03.909> I'll<00:02:04.209> reach<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.899> Rays<00:02:05.350> up<00:02:05.649> and<00:02:05.679> look

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
and then I'll reach the Rays up and look

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.850 
and then I'll reach the Rays up and look
ahead<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:06.999> ball<00:02:07.149> just<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.749> I<00:02:07.780> can<00:02:07.929> get<00:02:08.800> my

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
ahead of the ball just so I can get my

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.010 
ahead of the ball just so I can get my
body<00:02:09.160> really<00:02:09.459> forcing<00:02:10.090> backwards<00:02:10.570> when<00:02:10.990> I

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
body really forcing backwards when I

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.440 
body really forcing backwards when I
whip<00:02:11.530> my<00:02:11.560> head<00:02:11.860> through

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
whip my head through

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.910 
whip my head through
and<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:13.050> creates<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.379> little<00:02:13.470> more<00:02:13.620> speed<00:02:13.860> and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and that creates a little more speed and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040 
and that creates a little more speed and
helps<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.000> ball<00:02:15.150> get<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> little<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.810> better

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
helps the ball get a little more better

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.300 
helps the ball get a little more better
spiral<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:17.870> go<00:02:18.870> ahead<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.349> snap<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.860> ball<00:02:20.010> I'm

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
spiral I go ahead and snap the ball I'm

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.280 
spiral I go ahead and snap the ball I'm
really<00:02:21.060> trying<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> keep<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.720> ball<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.019> low<00:02:22.230> as

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
really trying to keep the ball as low as

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.900 
really trying to keep the ball as low as
the<00:02:22.500> ground<00:02:22.709> as<00:02:22.800> possible<00:02:22.830> not<00:02:23.340> skimming<00:02:23.700> it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the ground as possible not skimming it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.740 
the ground as possible not skimming it
I'm<00:02:24.209> really<00:02:24.769> letting<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.890> ball<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:27.360> bait<00:02:27.569> is

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
I'm really letting the ball like bait is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.210 
I'm really letting the ball like bait is
basically<00:02:28.200> skin<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> ground<00:02:28.739> but<00:02:28.890> keeping<00:02:29.099> it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
basically skin the ground but keeping it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.370 
basically skin the ground but keeping it
off<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.730> little<00:02:29.760> bit<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.239> then<00:02:30.690> towards

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
off just a little bit and then towards

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.290 
off just a little bit and then towards
the<00:02:31.440> end<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.739> snap<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.220> really<00:02:32.550> flick<00:02:33.120> my

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
the end of the snap I really flick my

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.000 
the end of the snap I really flick my
flick<00:02:33.720> my<00:02:33.840> wrist<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.319> that<00:02:34.500> creates<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:34.830> nice

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
flick my wrist so that creates that nice

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.400 
flick my wrist so that creates that nice
little<00:02:35.130> tight<00:02:35.400> spiral<00:02:35.840> what<00:02:36.840> happens<00:02:37.080> after

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
little tight spiral what happens after

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.039 
little tight spiral what happens after
the<00:02:37.500> ball<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.739> punit<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.730> run<00:02:39.450> downfield<00:02:39.660> I

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
the ball is punit is a I run downfield I

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.750 
the ball is punit is a I run downfield I
try<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.290> if<00:02:40.620> somebody's<00:02:41.069> trying<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> block<00:02:41.549> me

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
try to if somebody's trying to block me

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.720 
try to if somebody's trying to block me
I<00:02:41.940> make<00:02:42.330> sure<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.690> use<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:44.190> techniques<00:02:44.610> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
I make sure to use the techniques that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.300 
I make sure to use the techniques that
the<00:02:45.330> coaching<00:02:45.630> staff<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.989> taught<00:02:46.530> me<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:47.130> get

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the coaching staff is taught me to get

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.020 
the coaching staff is taught me to get
off<00:02:47.430> blocks<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.150> get<00:02:48.390> down<00:02:48.480> field<00:02:48.780> and

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
off blocks in the get down field and

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.210 
off blocks in the get down field and
hopefully<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:52.140> putler<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.890> returner

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
hopefully if the putler the returner

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.690 
hopefully if the putler the returner
hasn't<00:02:54.200> fair<00:02:55.200> caught<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.590> ball<00:02:55.709> maybe<00:02:56.489> I'll

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
hasn't fair caught the ball maybe I'll

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.069 
hasn't fair caught the ball maybe I'll
be<00:02:56.910> I'll<00:02:57.090> take<00:02:57.390> an<00:02:57.480> opportunity<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.959> take<00:02:58.049> a

be I'll take an opportunity to take a

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:47.170 
be I'll take an opportunity to take a
shot<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.650> make<00:02:59.430> me<00:02:59.519> make<00:02:59.700> attack

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:04:19.860
