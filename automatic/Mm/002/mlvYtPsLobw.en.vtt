00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.909 

so<00:00:05.279> I'm<00:00:05.430> here<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.790> give<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.089> some<00:00:06.330> tips<00:00:06.600> on

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919 
so I'm here to give you some tips on

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.040 
so I'm here to give you some tips on
safely<00:00:07.919> changing<00:00:08.639> lanes<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.179> merging<00:00:09.809> and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
safely changing lanes and merging and

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.220 
safely changing lanes and merging and
from<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> subject<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.370> merging<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.230> basic

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
from the subject of merging the basic

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.860 
from the subject of merging the basic
rule<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.530> thumb<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> use<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.240> merging

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
rule of thumb is to use that merging

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.950 
rule of thumb is to use that merging
lane<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.650> build<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.250> our<00:00:17.400> speed<00:00:18.060> which<00:00:18.779> will

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
lane to build up our speed which will

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.529 
lane to build up our speed which will
make<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.410> lot<00:00:19.650> easier<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.580> merge<00:00:20.880> onto<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
make it a lot easier to merge onto the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
make it a lot easier to merge onto the
highway<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:22.650> don't<00:00:22.980> want<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.310> come<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> end

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
highway we don't want to come to the end

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.390 
highway we don't want to come to the end
of<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.330> merging<00:00:24.779> Lane<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.529> our<00:00:25.890> car

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
of that merging Lane and have our car

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
of that merging Lane and have our car
too<00:00:26.580> full<00:00:26.820> stop

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
too full stop

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.670 
too full stop
because<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.410> much

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
because then it's going to be much

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
because then it's going to be much
harder<00:00:28.949> getting<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> highway<00:00:29.849> because

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
harder getting on the highway because

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.450 
harder getting on the highway because
the<00:00:30.840> cars<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.320> are<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.470> there<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.920> traveling

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the cars that are on there are traveling

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.459 
the cars that are on there are traveling
at<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> greater<00:00:32.910> rate<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.210> speed<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.380> you

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
at a greater rate of speed so what you

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.049 
at a greater rate of speed so what you
want<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.190> want<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> build<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.910> your

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
want to do is you want to build up your

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.139 
want to do is you want to build up your
speed<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.350> merging<00:00:37.890> Lane<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.850> want<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
speed in that merging Lane you want to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.229 
speed in that merging Lane you want to
check<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.660> mirror<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.250> sure<00:00:42.000> that

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
check your mirror so that you sure that

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.150 
check your mirror so that you sure that
you<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> good<00:00:42.809> safe<00:00:43.170> gap<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.770> which<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you have a good safe gap in which to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.279 
you have a good safe gap in which to
merge<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:45.840> before<00:00:46.050> you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
merge on to and then right before you

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.709 
merge on to and then right before you
make<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.770> merge<00:00:47.070> onto<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> highway<00:00:47.719> turn

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
make that merge onto the highway turn

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.750 
make that merge onto the highway turn
your<00:00:48.930> head<00:00:49.110> over<00:00:49.140> your<00:00:49.469> shoulder<00:00:49.980> make<00:00:50.579> sure

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
your head over your shoulder make sure

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
your head over your shoulder make sure
you<00:00:50.940> take<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> blind<00:00:51.690> spot<00:00:52.050> out<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you take the blind spot out of it and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.770 
you take the blind spot out of it and
then<00:00:53.340> when<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.699> safe<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.480> enough

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
then when it's safe and you have enough

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
then when it's safe and you have enough
room<00:00:55.140> then<00:00:55.680> you're<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.250> your<00:00:56.460> car

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
room then you're going to get your car

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.880 
room then you're going to get your car
onto<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> highway<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.870> far<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.590> changing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
onto the highway as far as changing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.520 
onto the highway as far as changing
lanes<00:00:59.430> once<00:00:59.850> you're<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.510> highway<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
lanes once you're on the highway the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
lanes once you're on the highway the
first<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> want<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.820> indicate

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
first thing you want to do is indicate

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.870 
first thing you want to do is indicate
the<00:01:03.719> direction<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> change<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.760> you're

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the direction of the change so if you're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
the direction of the change so if you're
going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> change<00:01:06.390> lanes<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> left<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
going to change lanes to the left you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.830 
going to change lanes to the left you
have<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.310> put<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.640> signal<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> left

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
have to put your signal on to the left

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.109 
have to put your signal on to the left
giving<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> other<00:01:10.950> cars<00:01:11.280> around<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
giving the other cars around you the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.630 
giving the other cars around you the
idea<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> what<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> intend<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.740> once

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
idea of what you intend to do once

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.999 
idea of what you intend to do once
you've<00:01:14.850> done<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.020> next<00:01:16.049> thing<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
you've done that the next thing to do is

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.460 
you've done that the next thing to do is
to<00:01:17.159> make<00:01:17.369> sure<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.790> safe<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:19.200> make

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to make sure it's safe to actually make

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.920 
to make sure it's safe to actually make
the<00:01:19.650> lane<00:01:19.860> change<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> put<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:21.360> signal

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the lane change so you put your signal

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.200 
the lane change so you put your signal
on<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.650> start<00:01:22.950> checking<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.490> mirrors<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
on you start checking your mirrors to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
on you start checking your mirrors to
make<00:01:24.390> sure<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.080> enough<00:01:25.320> room<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
make sure that you have enough room and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.100 
make sure that you have enough room and
then<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.240> safe<00:01:27.330> again<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
then when you think it's safe again a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440 
then when you think it's safe again a
turn<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> head<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.310> definitely<00:01:30.240> good

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
turn of the head is definitely good

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
turn of the head is definitely good
advice<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.619> turn<00:01:31.860> over<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.310> left

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
advice you want to turn over your left

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.280 
advice you want to turn over your left
shoulder<00:01:32.720> look<00:01:33.720> back

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
shoulder look back

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
shoulder look back
make<00:01:34.710> sure<00:01:34.950> there's<00:01:35.250> sufficient<00:01:35.520> room<00:01:36.329> in

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
make sure there's sufficient room in

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.289 
make sure there's sufficient room in
order<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> make<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.680> safe<00:01:38.040> change<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.790> then

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
order to make that safe change and then

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.030 
order to make that safe change and then
move<00:01:39.600> your<00:01:39.810> car<00:01:40.049> into<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> lane<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.920> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
move your car into the lane that you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.670 
move your car into the lane that you
intend<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.700> into<00:01:42.090> when<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.049> come<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
intend to go into when you come back to
