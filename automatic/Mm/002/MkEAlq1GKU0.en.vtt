enough<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> talk<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.019> let's<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.590> ahead

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
enough to talk about and let's go ahead

enough to talk about and let's go ahead
since<00:00:29.970> i<00:00:30.119> live<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.330> holland<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.900> kick<00:00:31.109> off<00:00:31.140> with

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
since i live in holland we kick off with

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
since i live in holland we kick off with
a<00:00:31.619> picture<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.130> pair<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.640> cows<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.239> bright

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
a picture of pair of cows in bright

a picture of pair of cows in bright
sunlight<00:00:34.399> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> picture<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> s6

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
sunlight this is the picture of the s6

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.410 
sunlight this is the picture of the s6
and<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.440> produces<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.219> very<00:00:38.489> good<00:00:38.730> image<00:00:39.000> with

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and it produces a very good image with

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.979 
and it produces a very good image with
natural<00:00:40.110> colors<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.770> lots<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.219> detail<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.510> g4

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
natural colors and lots of detail the g4

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.560 
natural colors and lots of detail the g4
also<00:00:43.379> produces<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.190> good<00:00:44.399> image<00:00:44.670> colors

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
also produces a very good image colors

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.330 
also produces a very good image colors
pop<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.710> from<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> grass

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
pop more as you can see from the grass

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760 
pop more as you can see from the grass
which<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> greener<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.600> personally<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.559> this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
which is greener I personally like this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.630 
which is greener I personally like this
so<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.430> point<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> g4<00:00:52.219> let's<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so one point for the g4 let's just the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
so one point for the g4 let's just the
audio<00:00:54.030> quality<00:00:54.059> during<00:00:54.750> video<00:00:54.930> recording<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
audio quality during video recording and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
audio quality during video recording and
this<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.489> interesting<00:00:57.059> since<00:00:57.270> there's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
this one is interesting since there's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:08.450 
this one is interesting since there's
quite<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> big<00:00:58.289> difference

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.249 

definitely<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.490> win<00:01:09.820> for<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.210> galaxy<00:01:10.630> s6<00:01:10.930> here

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
definitely a win for the galaxy s6 here

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.580 
definitely a win for the galaxy s6 here
which<00:01:11.770> has<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.950> richer<00:01:12.369> sound<00:01:12.990> next<00:01:13.990> up<00:01:14.140> indoor

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
which has a richer sound next up indoor

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.370 
which has a richer sound next up indoor
low-light<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.549> s6<00:01:15.909> has<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.090> bright<00:01:16.570> 1.9

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
low-light the s6 has a bright 1.9

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.219 
low-light the s6 has a bright 1.9
aperture<00:01:17.860> lens<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.399> does<00:01:18.700> really<00:01:18.940> well<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
aperture lens and does really well the

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.230 
aperture lens and does really well the
g4<00:01:20.740> has<00:01:20.920> an<00:01:21.040> even<00:01:21.310> brighter<00:01:21.549> lens<00:01:21.970> and

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
g4 has an even brighter lens and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.230 
g4 has an even brighter lens and
produces<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.960> very<00:01:23.259> good<00:01:23.470> picture<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:24.130> draw<00:01:25.030> I'd

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
produces a very good picture a draw I'd

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.490 
produces a very good picture a draw I'd
say<00:01:26.100> next<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.369> flash<00:01:27.789> test<00:01:28.119> in<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.479> complete<00:01:29.049> dark

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
say next a flash test in a complete dark

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.789 
say next a flash test in a complete dark
room<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:31.210> must<00:01:31.420> say<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.840> s6<00:01:32.200> loses<00:01:32.649> this

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
room and I must say the s6 loses this

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.880 
room and I must say the s6 loses this
round<00:01:33.100> against<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.520> g4<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.899> g4<00:01:35.380> image<00:01:35.740> you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
round against the g4 in the g4 image you

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.529 
round against the g4 in the g4 image you
can<00:01:36.009> even<00:01:36.310> read<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.640> tiny<00:01:36.940> digital<00:01:37.569> clock<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
can even read the tiny digital clock and

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.450 
can even read the tiny digital clock and
shadows<00:01:40.539> outside<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.380> s6<00:01:41.740> does<00:01:41.920> really<00:01:42.190> well

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
shadows outside the s6 does really well

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.169 
shadows outside the s6 does really well
everything<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.509> clearly<00:01:43.840> visible<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.729> g4

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
everything is clearly visible but the g4

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.210 
everything is clearly visible but the g4
base<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.659> here<00:01:46.869> as<00:01:46.990> well<00:01:47.200> as<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.770> can<00:01:47.890> see<00:01:47.950> from

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
base it here as well as you can see from

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.609 
base it here as well as you can see from
the<00:01:48.399> cars<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.850> are<00:01:48.970> better<00:01:49.210> visible<00:01:52.500> next<00:01:53.500> up

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
the cars that are better visible next up

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.230 
the cars that are better visible next up
let's<00:01:53.770> take<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.039> look<00:01:54.280> at<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.550> optical<00:01:54.970> image

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
let's take a look at the optical image

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.240 
let's take a look at the optical image
stabilization<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:56.259> see<00:01:56.770> which<00:01:56.950> one<00:01:57.130> is

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
stabilization and see which one is

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
stabilization and see which one is
better<00:02:01.649> very<00:02:02.649> hard<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.039> tell<00:02:03.310> but<00:02:03.640> I'd<00:02:03.789> say<00:02:04.030> a

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
better very hard to tell but I'd say a

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.990 
better very hard to tell but I'd say a
narrow<00:02:04.539> win<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.200> s6<00:02:05.530> here<00:02:05.799> I'd<00:02:06.369> still

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
narrow win for the s6 here I'd still

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.940 
narrow win for the s6 here I'd still
take<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.420> iphone<00:02:07.750> 6<00:02:07.990> plus<00:02:08.080> if<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.560> want<00:02:08.830> to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
take the iphone 6 plus if you want to

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.499 
take the iphone 6 plus if you want to
eliminate<00:02:09.160> shakes<00:02:09.670> as<00:02:09.910> much<00:02:10.149> as<00:02:10.299> possible

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
eliminate shakes as much as possible

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.460 
eliminate shakes as much as possible
however<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.329> myself<00:02:16.540> don't<00:02:17.260> like

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
however if you like myself don't like

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.620 
however if you like myself don't like
blurry<00:02:17.799> shots<00:02:18.160> then<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.820> fast<00:02:19.150> shutter<00:02:19.360> is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
blurry shots then a fast shutter is

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.229 
blurry shots then a fast shutter is

more<00:02:51.579> noise<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> narrow<00:02:53.109> win<00:02:53.380> for<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.829> s6

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190

nicely<00:03:00.190> out<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.549> focus<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.180> took<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.930> shot<00:03:02.140> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
nicely out of focus I took the shot and

nicely out of focus I took the shot and
selective<00:03:02.799> focus<00:03:03.010> mode<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:04.090> couldn't

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
produce a similar image with the g4 so

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.000 
produce a similar image with the g4 so
I'd<00:03:07.420> say<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> clear<00:03:08.049> win<00:03:08.260> for<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.680> s6
