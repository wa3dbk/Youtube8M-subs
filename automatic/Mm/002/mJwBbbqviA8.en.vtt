here in Oklahoma in the summer it gets
blooming<00:02:27.820> hot<00:02:28.000> when<00:02:28.150> we<00:02:28.240> landed<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.630> August<00:02:29.020> it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170

was 40 degrees C 104 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.640 
was 40 degrees C 104 degrees Fahrenheit
which<00:02:33.430> was<00:02:33.610> just<00:02:33.730> too<00:02:33.910> much<00:02:34.090> but<00:02:34.390> now<00:02:34.570> it's<00:02:34.870> we

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
which was just too much but now it's we

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.040 
which was just too much but now it's we
have<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.800> lovely<00:02:36.010> form<00:02:36.400> apparently<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.840> fall

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
have a lovely form apparently the fall

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.010 
have a lovely form apparently the fall
lasts<00:02:38.590> until<00:02:38.880> sorry<00:02:39.880> warp<00:02:40.210> them<00:02:40.420> until<00:02:40.900> about

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
lasts until sorry warp them until about

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.770 
lasts until sorry warp them until about
mid<00:02:41.260> November<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.880> we<00:02:43.060> have<00:02:43.240> temperatures<00:02:43.540> at

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
mid November and we have temperatures at

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.920 
mid November and we have temperatures at
the<00:02:43.840> moment<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.350> mid<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.770> high<00:02:44.950> 80's<00:02:45.930> right

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
the moment in the mid to high 80's right

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.290 
the moment in the mid to high 80's right
now<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.260> 89<00:02:47.830> Fahrenheit<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.670> come<00:02:48.820> out

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
now is 89 Fahrenheit so you come out

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.960 
now is 89 Fahrenheit so you come out
with<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.570> little<00:02:49.780> calculators<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.850> think<00:02:51.850> it's

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
with you little calculators I think it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.170 
with you little calculators I think it's
31<00:02:52.330> degrees<00:02:52.480> c<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.730> winter<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.060> does

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
31 degrees c and in the winter it does

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.150 
31 degrees c and in the winter it does
get<00:02:55.330> cold<00:02:55.480> apparently<00:02:55.900> though<00:02:56.020> i<00:02:56.380> think<00:02:56.650> like

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
get cold apparently though i think like

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160 
get cold apparently though i think like

the overall average temperature but

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.080 
the overall average temperature but
