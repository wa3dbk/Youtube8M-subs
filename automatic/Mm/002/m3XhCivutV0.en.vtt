00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
fast-paced this overall it's a quick

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.840 
fast-paced this overall it's a quick
game<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.680> matches<00:02:48.069> are<00:02:48.100> quick<00:02:48.430> everyone's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
game the matches are quick everyone's

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.390 
game the matches are quick everyone's
running<00:02:49.090> around<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:50.410> they<00:02:50.560> basically<00:02:50.920> I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
running around but they basically I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.920 
running around but they basically I
don't<00:02:51.730> agree<00:02:52.000> with<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.360> fact<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.720> they're

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
don't agree with the fact that they're

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.420 
don't agree with the fact that they're
going<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.110> have<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.410> change<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:54.010> fast<00:02:54.310> paced

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
going to have to change this fast paced

as to up their interactivity of the maps
now<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.220> course<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.610> not<00:02:57.640> going<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:57.970> have

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
now the of course is not going to have

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.059 
now the of course is not going to have
the<00:02:58.180> maps<00:02:58.360> totally<00:02:58.690> decay<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.709> know<00:02:59.830> just

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
puts it somewhere online that'd be

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.890 
puts it somewhere online that'd be
perfect<00:04:54.700> but<00:04:55.270> when<00:04:55.420> they<00:04:55.540> said<00:04:55.720> they<00:04:55.840> can't

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
perfect but when they said they can't

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.810 
perfect but when they said they can't
combine<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.560> cod<00:04:56.770> caste<00:04:57.100> system<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.670> the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
combine the cod caste system and the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.060 
combine the cod caste system and the
live<00:04:58.000> stream<00:04:58.360> live<00:04:58.780> stream<00:04:59.050> capability<00:04:59.770> that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
live stream live stream capability that

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.260 
live stream live stream capability that
made<00:05:00.280> me<00:05:00.430> think<00:05:00.640> that<00:05:00.730> you're<00:05:00.910> not<00:05:01.060> going<00:05:01.210> to

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
made me think that you're not going to

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.660 
made me think that you're not going to
be<00:05:01.390> able<00:05:01.420> to<00:05:01.660> get<00:05:01.750> your<00:05:01.900> own<00:05:02.050> voice<00:05:02.440> now<00:05:03.130> that's

be able to get your own voice now that's

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.160 
be able to get your own voice now that's
the<00:05:03.820> main<00:05:04.030> drawback<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.810> live<00:05:04.930> stream

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
the main drawback to the live stream

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.480 
the main drawback to the live stream
that's<00:05:05.260> a<00:05:05.380> really<00:05:05.620> hard<00:05:05.650> thing<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:06.130> do<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.460> to

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
that's a really hard thing to do is to

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.030 
that's a really hard thing to do is to
get<00:05:06.730> console<00:05:07.300> game<00:05:07.540> play<00:05:07.840> mixed<00:05:08.650> in<00:05:08.770> with<00:05:08.860> your
