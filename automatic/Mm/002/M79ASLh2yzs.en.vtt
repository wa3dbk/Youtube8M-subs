each of these world areas has a big box
around<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.810> sort<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.230> renders<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
managed to escape the main bit of the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.530 
managed to escape the main bit of the
level<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:35.880> fly<00:00:36.149> through<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
level and I can actually fly through the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.240 
level and I can actually fly through the
big<00:00:36.780> box<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.350> runs<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.770> sky<00:00:38.600> box<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.620> like

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
big box that runs the sky box if I like

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.500 
big box that runs the sky box if I like
so<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.329> completely

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
so as you can see now I'm completely

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
so as you can see now I'm completely
free<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.020> any<00:00:43.170> second<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:43.620> yes<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> can

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
free of any second now yes as you can

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.279 
free of any second now yes as you can
see<00:00:44.520> I've<00:00:44.640> gone<00:00:44.850> through<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.780> edge<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
see I've gone through the edge of the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.779 
see I've gone through the edge of the
sky<00:00:46.469> box<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> pretty<00:00:47.160> cool<00:00:47.399> view<00:00:47.430> though

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
sky box it's a pretty cool view though

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
sky box it's a pretty cool view though
from<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.090> here<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> whole<00:00:49.320> idea

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
from out here you can see the whole idea

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.650 
from out here you can see the whole idea
of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> ship<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.789> guess<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> idea<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.449> this

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
of the ship I guess the idea is this

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
of the ship I guess the idea is this
sort<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.800> keep<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.460> to

sort of but here we keep going up to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.270 
sort of but here we keep going up to

first<00:01:23.250> person<00:01:23.640> view<00:01:23.790> mode<00:01:24.030> might<00:01:24.180> actually<00:01:24.360> be

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
first person view mode might actually be

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.219

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I don't know how that would work but

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.859 
I don't know how that would work but

and<00:01:45.329> where<00:01:45.450> they're<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.829> just

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and where they're going so I can just

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.920

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
this point of course to actually get to

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.130 
this point of course to actually get to
even<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> kiss<00:03:29.180> all<00:03:29.330> three<00:03:29.540> people<00:03:29.870> are<00:03:29.959> waiting

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
for me promptly a bit confused at what

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.690 
for me promptly a bit confused at what
the<00:03:32.900> hell<00:03:33.050> I'm<00:03:33.230> doing<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:34.250> then<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.459> flew<00:03:34.670> back

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
the hell I'm doing and then I flew back

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.170 
the hell I'm doing and then I flew back
out<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.890> cube<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.220> then<00:03:37.430> back<00:03:37.640> in<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.090> of

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
out of the cube and then back in and of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.400 
out of the cube and then back in and of
course<00:03:38.209> here<00:03:38.630> they<00:03:38.720> can<00:03:38.840> probably<00:03:39.080> see<00:03:39.170> me<00:03:39.260> and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410

getting<00:03:45.350> out<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.070> map<00:03:46.220> preventing<00:03:47.180> me

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
getting out of the map preventing me

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.670 
getting out of the map preventing me
from<00:03:47.299> getting<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:47.930> looks<00:03:48.110> like<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:48.530> then
