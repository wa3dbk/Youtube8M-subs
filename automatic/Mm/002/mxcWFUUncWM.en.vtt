00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.779 
I'm going to go down the other side now
the<00:01:41.899> actual<00:01:42.320> motor<00:01:42.500> itself<00:01:43.039> because<00:01:43.579> I'm

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
the actual motor itself because I'm

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.980 
the actual motor itself because I'm
doing<00:01:44.000> more<00:01:44.780> than<00:01:44.840> 15<00:01:45.350> mile<00:01:45.740> an<00:01:45.920> hour<00:01:46.869> most<00:01:47.869> of

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
doing more than 15 mile an hour most of

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.639 
doing more than 15 mile an hour most of
itself<00:01:48.320> was<00:01:48.560> cut<00:01:48.799> out<00:01:48.909> so<00:01:49.909> I'm<00:01:50.030> just<00:01:50.090> basically

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
itself was cut out so I'm just basically

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:58.959 
itself was cut out so I'm just basically
freewheeling<00:01:57.189> I've<00:01:58.189> had<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.520> bike<00:01:58.700> almost

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
freewheeling I've had the bike almost

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.569 
freewheeling I've had the bike almost
three<00:01:59.390> weeks<00:01:59.420> now<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.039> morning<00:02:01.490> I

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
three weeks now and this morning I

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.440 
three weeks now and this morning I
missed<00:02:01.789> my<00:02:01.909> train

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
missed my train

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.639 
missed my train
so<00:02:03.289> I<00:02:03.590> had<00:02:04.039> to<00:02:04.219> come<00:02:04.429> in<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:05.539> 14<00:02:05.990> mile<00:02:06.319> journey

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
so I had to come in the 14 mile journey

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.699 
so I had to come in the 14 mile journey
on<00:02:06.979> my<00:02:07.009> bike<00:02:07.310> itself<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.239> about<00:02:09.200> eight<00:02:09.530> or

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
on my bike itself and about eight or

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.490 
on my bike itself and about eight or
nine<00:02:09.739> miles<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.519> that<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.849> longer<00:02:11.290> busy<00:02:12.290> dual

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
nine miles of that is a longer busy dual

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.670 
nine miles of that is a longer busy dual
carriageway<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.640> don't<00:02:13.910> like<00:02:14.030> doing<00:02:14.209> it

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
carriageway so I don't like doing it

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.190 
carriageway so I don't like doing it
unless<00:02:15.680> it's<00:02:15.980> absolutely<00:02:16.099> necessary<00:02:17.200> but

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
unless it's absolutely necessary but

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.680 
unless it's absolutely necessary but
this<00:02:18.440> morning<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:20.000> made<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.480> quite
