00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
and go all concrete giving birth I think

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.410 
and go all concrete giving birth I think
is<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.360> it's<00:01:01.070> just<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:02.970> what<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
is that it's just I think what I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.980 
is that it's just I think what I
remember<00:01:03.960> most<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.890> cry<00:01:05.510> when<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.750> baby

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
remember most is the cry when the baby

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.710 
remember most is the cry when the baby
is<00:01:07.110> born<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.770> cry<00:01:08.130> penetrates<00:01:08.940> on<00:01:09.240> such<00:01:09.690> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is born the cry penetrates on such a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.680 
is born the cry penetrates on such a
deep<00:01:10.080> level<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.770> Keith<00:01:11.700> says<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.210> too<00:01:12.450> he

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
deep level and Keith says that too he

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.530 
deep level and Keith says that too he
goes<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.740> cry<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.330> actually

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
goes what about that cry and we actually

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
goes what about that cry and we actually
did<00:01:16.290> record<00:01:16.710> our<00:01:17.310> birth<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> when<00:01:19.530> we've<00:01:20.010> heard
