00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
some really nice building layouts and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.759 
some really nice building layouts and
I'm<00:00:30.630> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> make<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> little<00:00:31.470> serious

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
I'm going to make a little serious

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'm going to make a little serious
showing<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.279> lot<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> them<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.890> some<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> them

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
showing a lot of them and some of them

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
showing a lot of them and some of them
are<00:00:35.760> quite<00:00:35.850> advanced<00:00:36.450> therefore<00:00:37.350> I'll<00:00:37.530> try

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
are quite advanced therefore I'll try

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
are quite advanced therefore I'll try
and<00:00:37.920> make<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.070> more<00:00:38.280> easy<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.149> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and make it more easy for you to do it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.229 
and make it more easy for you to do it
the<00:00:39.420> first<00:00:39.600> time<00:00:39.809> than<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.500> me<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.239> by

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the first time than it was for me and by

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.990 
the first time than it was for me and by
showing<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> video<00:00:43.170> anyway<00:00:44.129> we'll<00:00:44.730> just

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
showing you on a video anyway we'll just

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.959 
showing you on a video anyway we'll just
up<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> most<00:00:45.840> simple<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.789> but<00:00:47.789> it's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
up one of the most simple one but it's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.020 
up one of the most simple one but it's
probably<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> most<00:00:48.570> effective<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.230> well<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
probably the most effective as well the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.119 
probably the most effective as well the
warehouse<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.809> small<00:00:52.140> market<00:00:52.410> balloon<00:00:52.800> or

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
warehouse or a small market balloon or

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
warehouse or a small market balloon or
whatever<00:00:53.610> they're<00:00:53.760> called<00:00:54.000> action<00:00:54.480> has<00:00:54.660> been

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
whatever they're called action has been

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.880 
whatever they're called action has been
disrupted<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> road<00:00:56.149> like<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
disrupted and make a road like this and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.240 
disrupted and make a road like this and
another<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.039> like<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:02.070> on

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
another one like that so one of one on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.410 
another one like that so one of one on
the<00:01:02.460> both<00:01:02.640> sides<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:05.180> depending<00:01:06.180> on

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the both sides and then depending on

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.630 
the both sides and then depending on
what<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.780> need<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.200> could<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.560> hemp<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:07.950> spices

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
what you need it could be hemp or spices

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.830 
what you need it could be hemp or spices
but<00:01:08.820> we're<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.390> cider<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:11.360> make<00:01:12.360> for

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but we're going for cider here make for

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.700 
but we're going for cider here make for
farms<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.500> one

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
farms like this and then it's just one

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.080 
farms like this and then it's just one
and<00:01:16.979> go<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.700> create<00:01:18.150> fields<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.880> do<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.970> like

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and go to create fields and do it like

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.460 
and go to create fields and do it like
this<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.960> rotate<00:01:22.439> them<00:01:23.630> oops

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
this now rotate them oops

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.640 
this now rotate them oops
like<00:01:26.950> that<00:01:27.160> and<00:01:28.140> that's<00:01:29.140> basically<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
like that and that's basically the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.170 
like that and that's basically the
pattern<00:01:29.890> you're<00:01:30.220> going<00:01:30.250> for<00:01:30.760> all<00:01:30.910> of<00:01:31.030> them

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
pattern you're going for all of them

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.830 
pattern you're going for all of them
it's<00:01:31.720> really<00:01:32.080> simple<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.560> really<00:01:32.800> effective

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it's really simple and really effective

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.720 
it's really simple and really effective
so<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.590> going<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:36.010> look<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.190> little<00:01:36.520> something

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
so it's going to look a little something

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.670 
so it's going to look a little something
like<00:01:36.940> this<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.990> is<00:01:38.050> how<00:01:38.170> it's<00:01:38.410> going<00:01:38.560> to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
like this so this is how it's going to

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.820 
like this so this is how it's going to
look<00:01:38.800> like<00:01:38.860> more<00:01:39.250> or<00:01:39.310> less<00:01:39.660> it<00:01:40.660> saves<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.650> lot<00:01:41.710> of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
look like more or less it saves a lot of

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.560 
look like more or less it saves a lot of
space<00:01:41.920> it's<00:01:42.340> really<00:01:42.640> efficient<00:01:43.030> all<00:01:43.240> working

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
space it's really efficient all working

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.400 
space it's really efficient all working
on<00:01:43.690> 100%<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.970> can<00:01:46.150> support<00:01:46.300> around<00:01:46.660> 570

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
on 100% and this can support around 570

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.480 
on 100% and this can support around 570
people<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.010> think<00:01:48.070> so<00:01:49.260> yes<00:01:50.260> I<00:01:50.560> hope<00:01:51.220> you'll<00:01:51.430> use

people I think so yes I hope you'll use

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.120
