that's my fairing on my bike key you saw

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.880 
that's my fairing on my bike key you saw
the<00:00:33.030> bike<00:00:33.300> key<00:00:33.540> last<00:00:33.780> time<00:00:36.350> front<00:00:37.350> wheel<00:00:37.530> where

the bike key last time front wheel where
this<00:00:38.219> has<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> Dynamo<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:40.200> here's<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
this has the Dynamo in it and here's the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.930 
this has the Dynamo in it and here's the
thing<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.980> decided<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.340> put<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:41.879> here

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
thing I decided to put it about here

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450 
thing I decided to put it about here
doesn't<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> way<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.620> needs<00:00:44.250> when

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
doesn't get in the way of my needs when

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.840 
doesn't get in the way of my needs when
I'm<00:00:44.550> pedaling<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> click<00:00:46.440> fit

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
I'm pedaling this is the click fit

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.580 
I'm pedaling this is the click fit
fitting<00:00:48.469> and<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.289> turns<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> be

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
fitting and this this is turns out to be

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.959 
fitting and this this is turns out to be
what<00:00:52.800> those<00:00:53.010> pieces<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.820> thin<00:00:55.100> steel<00:00:56.100> are<00:00:56.550> for

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
what those pieces of thin steel are for

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.900 
what those pieces of thin steel are for
their<00:00:57.570> parts<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> click<00:00:58.590> fit<00:00:58.800> fitting<00:00:59.160> you

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
their parts of the click fit fitting you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.529 
their parts of the click fit fitting you
squeeze<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.949> comes<00:01:01.949> off<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> can

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
squeeze that comes off and it can

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.070 
squeeze that comes off and it can
actually<00:01:03.660> go<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.739> either<00:01:05.460> way<00:01:05.960> which<00:01:06.960> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
actually go on either way which I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.609 
actually go on either way which I
suppose<00:01:07.260> could<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.530> useful<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.490> wanted<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
suppose could be useful if you wanted to

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.859 
suppose could be useful if you wanted to
keep<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:12.049> connectors<00:01:13.049> pointing<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
keep the connectors pointing down to

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
keep the connectors pointing down to
maybe<00:01:15.869> know<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.189> was<00:01:17.280> raining<00:01:17.490> or

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
maybe know if it was raining or

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.730 
maybe know if it was raining or
something<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.210> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.570> lucky<00:01:18.960> with<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
something I'm kind of lucky with this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.149 
something I'm kind of lucky with this
setup<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.880> fairing<00:01:21.710> will<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.950> set

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
setup because the fairing will it's set

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.230 
setup because the fairing will it's set
in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.369> worst<00:01:23.880> most<00:01:24.750> terrible<00:01:25.140> weather<00:01:25.380> will

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
in the worst most terrible weather will

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
in the worst most terrible weather will
will<00:01:27.240> keep<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:30.180> device<00:01:30.650> relatively<00:01:31.650> dry<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
will keep the device relatively dry and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.530 
will keep the device relatively dry and
certainly<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> few<00:01:33.240> words<00:01:33.509> turnouts<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.110> don't

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
certainly a few words turnouts I don't

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.620 
certainly a few words turnouts I don't
there's<00:01:36.540> no<00:01:36.750> way<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.079> water<00:01:37.259> could<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
there's no way that water could get in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
there's no way that water could get in
through<00:01:39.630> those<00:01:39.840> holes<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.490> not

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
through those holes the it's not

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.420 
through those holes the it's not
guaranteed<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.829> waterproof<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.130> that's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
guaranteed to be waterproof and that's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.289 
guaranteed to be waterproof and that's
that<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> manufacturer<00:01:46.680> says<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.060> so

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that the manufacturer says it's not so

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.350 
that the manufacturer says it's not so
let<00:01:48.450> me<00:01:48.540> show<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.720> how<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.869> wired<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:50.149> got<00:01:51.149> rid

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
let me show you how I wired it I got rid

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.480 
let me show you how I wired it I got rid
of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.689> old<00:01:53.030> connectors<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:56.070> old<00:01:56.189> wiring

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
of the old connectors and the old wiring

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
of the old connectors and the old wiring
because<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.450> wasn't<00:01:57.719> particularly<00:01:58.049> brilliant

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
because it wasn't particularly brilliant

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.639 
because it wasn't particularly brilliant
anyway<00:01:59.329> seen<00:02:00.329> better<00:02:00.479> day<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:00.840> these<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
anyway seen better day so these are the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.039 
anyway seen better day so these are the
push<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.009> connectors<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.479> ones<00:02:03.689> which<00:02:03.869> were

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
push on connectors the ones which were

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.869 
push on connectors the ones which were
supplied<00:02:04.439> by<00:02:04.680> Z<00:02:05.119> came<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.360> box

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 
supplied by Z came in the box

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.460 
supplied by Z came in the box
yes<00:02:08.879> apparently<00:02:09.360> they're<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.509> spades<00:02:10.020> that's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
yes apparently they're not spades that's

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.820 
yes apparently they're not spades that's
a<00:02:10.619> different<00:02:11.190> kind

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
a different kind

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.819 
a different kind
connector<00:02:13.569> these<00:02:14.569> are<00:02:14.810> what<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.590> might<00:02:15.769> call

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
connector these are what you might call

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.890 
connector these are what you might call
push<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.370> connectors<00:02:16.819> or<00:02:16.939> disconnects<00:02:17.540> some

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
push on connectors or disconnects some

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.619 
push on connectors or disconnects some
people<00:02:18.140> call<00:02:18.290> them<00:02:18.409> so<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.400> seems<00:02:19.640> they<00:02:19.849> coming

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
people call them so it seems they coming

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.039 
people call them so it seems they coming
to<00:02:20.750> suppliers<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.760> did<00:02:23.450> those<00:02:23.689> and<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.870> put

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
to suppliers so I did those and I put

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.520 
to suppliers so I did those and I put
the<00:02:24.110> heat<00:02:24.260> shrink<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.939> they<00:02:25.939> go<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.299> okay<00:02:26.659> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
the heat shrink on they go on okay the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.250 
the heat shrink on they go on okay the
cable<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.099> fresh<00:02:28.640> cable<00:02:29.060> which<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.540> think<00:02:29.900> came

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
cable is fresh cable which I think came

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.250 
cable is fresh cable which I think came
from<00:02:31.360> any<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.540> package<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:32.989> can't

because I do like to buy a good quality

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.710 
because I do like to buy a good quality
tool<00:03:35.870> possible<00:03:36.260> but<00:03:36.709> hey<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.400> did<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.669> job<00:03:37.720> so

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
tool possible but hey it did the job so

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.699 
tool possible but hey it did the job so
as<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.739> can<00:03:39.829> see<00:03:40.040> here<00:03:40.780> we've<00:03:41.780> got<00:03:41.810> I've<00:03:42.440> just

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
as you can see here we've got I've just

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.240 
as you can see here we've got I've just
wired<00:03:43.669> these<00:03:44.000> together<00:03:45.129> it's<00:03:46.129> AC<00:03:46.430> coming<00:03:47.060> out

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
wired these together it's AC coming out

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.330 
wired these together it's AC coming out
so<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.370> polarity<00:03:49.849> doesn't<00:03:50.980> isn't<00:03:51.980> an<00:03:52.220> issue

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
so the polarity doesn't isn't an issue

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.149 
so the polarity doesn't isn't an issue
and<00:03:53.329> so<00:03:53.510> I've<00:03:53.599> got<00:03:54.310> one<00:03:56.859> connection<00:03:57.859> coming

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
and so I've got one connection coming

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.229 
and so I've got one connection coming
off<00:03:58.400> into<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.449> took<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.959> opportunity<00:04:00.139> to<00:04:00.500> put

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
off into I took the opportunity to put

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.110 
off into I took the opportunity to put
lunatic<00:04:02.709> much<00:04:03.709> nicer<00:04:06.250> front<00:04:07.250> light<00:04:07.430> on<00:04:07.639> which

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
lunatic much nicer front light on which

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.099 
lunatic much nicer front light on which
I've<00:04:08.629> been<00:04:08.659> given<00:04:09.199> and<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:10.159> main<00:04:11.109> difference

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
I've been given and the main difference

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.300 
I've been given and the main difference
is<00:04:12.260> for<00:04:12.470> me<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:12.829> it<00:04:12.979> has<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:14.889> nice<00:04:15.889> switch

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
is for me is that it has a nice switch

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.189 
is for me is that it has a nice switch
so<00:04:16.609> I<00:04:16.639> can<00:04:16.880> isolate<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.419> can<00:04:17.690> switch<00:04:17.870> off<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
so I can isolate the can switch off the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.990 
so I can isolate the can switch off the
the<00:04:18.530> light<00:04:18.680> during<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.949> day<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.159> used<00:04:19.370> going

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
the light during the day I used going

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.670 
the light during the day I used going
around<00:04:20.209> with<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.389> lights<00:04:20.599> on<00:04:20.750> all<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.019> time

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
around with the lights on all the time

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.850 
around with the lights on all the time
which<00:04:22.889> is<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.100> bit<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.490> waste<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.560> listen

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
which is a bit of a waste and listen

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.879 
which is a bit of a waste and listen
even<00:04:26.100> got<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.580> light<00:04:27.210> sensor<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.050> can<00:04:28.229> put

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
even got a light sensor so you can put

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.550 
even got a light sensor so you can put
it<00:04:28.979> up<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:30.500> this<00:04:31.500> setting<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.190> this<00:04:32.280> little

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
it up to this setting and this little

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.770 
it up to this setting and this little
thing<00:04:34.560> here<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.639> light<00:04:36.090> sensor<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:36.630> it'll

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
thing here is a light sensor so it'll

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.270 
thing here is a light sensor so it'll
automatically<00:04:37.229> go<00:04:37.320> on<00:04:37.560> suppose<00:04:38.009> it's<00:04:38.100> very

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
automatically go on suppose it's very

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.770 
automatically go on suppose it's very
good<00:04:38.430> if<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.580> go<00:04:38.850> through<00:04:39.120> tunnels<00:04:39.419> and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
good if you go through tunnels and

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.950 
good if you go through tunnels and
things<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:41.550> then<00:04:41.669> that's<00:04:41.910> full<00:04:42.210> on<00:04:42.360> there<00:04:42.660> and

things but then that's full on there and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.730 
things but then that's full on there and
in<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.500> middle<00:04:43.590> it's<00:04:43.860> off<00:04:45.229> so<00:04:46.229> going<00:04:46.560> back

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
in the middle it's off so going back

there I could have made the cable a
little<00:05:14.250> bit<00:05:14.400> shorter<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.449> big<00:05:15.630> idea<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.139> was<00:05:16.789> a

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
little bit shorter the big idea I was a

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.430 
little bit shorter the big idea I was a
little<00:05:18.900> bit<00:05:19.940> conservative<00:05:20.940> about<00:05:21.780> it<00:05:22.229> but

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
little bit conservative about it but

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.210 
little bit conservative about it but
anyway<00:05:25.160> measure<00:05:26.160> twice<00:05:26.520> cut<00:05:26.880> once<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:28.220> yeah

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
anyway measure twice cut once and yeah

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.750 
anyway measure twice cut once and yeah
I've<00:05:30.030> been<00:05:30.570> running<00:05:30.840> this<00:05:30.990> now<00:05:31.349> for<00:05:31.760> several

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
I've been running this now for several

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.689 
I've been running this now for several
weeks<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.770> it's<00:05:34.770> been<00:05:34.919> it's<00:05:35.340> brilliant

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
to getting a nice mount that I could put

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.670 
to getting a nice mount that I could put
here<00:06:37.509> which<00:06:37.750> is<00:06:37.930> really<00:06:38.229> going<00:06:38.380> to<00:06:38.440> be<00:06:38.560> the

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
here which is really going to be the

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.469 
here which is really going to be the
place<00:06:38.919> for<00:06:39.160> it

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 
place for it

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:46.439 
place for it
so<00:06:41.199> I<00:06:41.229> can<00:06:41.560> run<00:06:41.860> you<00:06:42.069> know<00:06:42.509> GPS<00:06:44.520> back<00:06:45.520> mapping<00:06:46.240> I

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
so I can run you know GPS back mapping I

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.230 
so I can run you know GPS back mapping I
wish<00:06:46.930> there<00:06:47.139> were<00:06:47.340> several<00:06:48.340> nice<00:06:48.610> programs

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
wish there were several nice programs

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.219 
wish there were several nice programs
for<00:06:49.479> the<00:06:49.569> n900<00:06:50.280> best<00:06:51.280> one<00:06:51.490> at<00:06:51.610> the<00:06:51.669> moment<00:06:51.819> I

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
for the n900 best one at the moment I

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:57.450 
for the n900 best one at the moment I
can<00:06:53.229> find<00:06:53.470> his<00:06:53.590> map<00:06:53.830> arrow<00:06:55.169> but<00:06:56.169> the<00:06:56.889> GPS<00:06:57.069> is

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
can find his map arrow but the GPS is

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.159 
can find his map arrow but the GPS is
very<00:06:57.490> hungry<00:06:57.819> for<00:06:58.440> charge<00:06:59.440> but<00:06:59.889> yeah<00:07:01.169> the

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
very hungry for charge but yeah the

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.129 
very hungry for charge but yeah the
biggest<00:07:02.440> test<00:07:02.710> of<00:07:02.949> this<00:07:03.729> device<00:07:04.060> and<00:07:04.449> how<00:07:04.780> it

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:05.139 
biggest test of this device and how it

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:10.350 
biggest test of this device and how it
functioned<00:07:05.970> was<00:07:07.349> the<00:07:08.349> Danish<00:07:08.650> dynamo<00:07:09.360> which

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
functioned was the Danish dynamo which
