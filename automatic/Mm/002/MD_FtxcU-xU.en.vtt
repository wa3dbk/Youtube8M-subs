00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
gonna pull it out here these are let out

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.560 
gonna pull it out here these are let out
here<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.420> with

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
here like this and then you know with

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.870 
here like this and then you know with
the<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> pry<00:00:34.410> bar<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.920> may<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> end

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the with the pry bar I may have to end

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.729 
the with the pry bar I may have to end
up<00:00:36.030> cutting<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.020> drywall<00:00:37.290> back

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
up cutting some of this drywall back

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.090 
up cutting some of this drywall back
because<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:39.200> mounted<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.379> little<00:00:40.590> too<00:00:40.800> close

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
because I mounted it a little too close

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.610 
because I mounted it a little too close
I<00:00:41.640> still<00:00:42.300> may<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.629> cut<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.170> back<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I still may have to cut some back and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.790 
I still may have to cut some back and
then<00:00:44.030> figure<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> way<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.559> bring<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> back

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
then figure out a way to bring it back

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.700 
then figure out a way to bring it back
over<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.629> or<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.690> might<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.170> able<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.379> fit<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
over but or I might be able to fit the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.229 
over but or I might be able to fit the
window<00:00:49.860> inside<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.550> depends<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
window inside it just depends on the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.760 
window inside it just depends on the
size<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.840> fringe<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.289> we'll<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.590> how<00:00:52.739> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
size and the fringe so we'll see how it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.529 
size and the fringe so we'll see how it
all<00:00:52.980> goes

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
all goes

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
all goes
hopefully<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> will<00:00:55.379> need<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.370> do

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
hopefully this is all I will need to do

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.810 
hopefully this is all I will need to do
this<00:00:59.420> yeah<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.660> window<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.109> no<00:01:01.530> good<00:01:01.829> you

along<00:01:57.670> here<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.300> way<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.570> window<00:01:58.990> you<00:01:59.740> can

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
along here the way this window you can

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.610 
along here the way this window you can
either<00:02:00.010> cut<00:02:00.340> these<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.760> slide<00:02:00.940> them<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.620> or

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
either cut these and slide them in or

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.590 
either cut these and slide them in or
just<00:02:02.650> mount<00:02:03.130> them<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:05.530> up<00:02:05.680> against<00:02:06.130> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
just mount them like up against the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.770 
just mount them like up against the
exterior

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
exterior

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.240 
exterior
these<00:02:07.960> ones<00:02:08.170> are<00:02:08.260> matted<00:02:08.590> on<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.770> interior

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
these ones are matted on the interior

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.760 
these ones are matted on the interior
that<00:02:09.399> way<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.820> that's<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.330> little<00:02:10.510> weird<00:02:10.810> but<00:02:11.710> I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
that way and that's a little weird but I

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.550 
that way and that's a little weird but I
think<00:02:11.980> I'm<00:02:12.040> just<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.370> do<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.580> same<00:02:12.790> way

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
think I'm just and do it the same way
