the idea behind it is to dull it down
dull<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.990> down<00:04:27.199> and<00:04:27.469> it<00:04:27.770> collects<00:04:28.070> in<00:04:28.280> the

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
dull it down and it collects in the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.590 
dull it down and it collects in the
crevices<00:04:28.969> a<00:04:29.030> little<00:04:29.479> bit<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:30.139> know

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
crevices a little bit you know
