00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.150
 the crops just like most 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.760
 of the plants require a certain 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.360
 amount of sun hours for 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.060
 develop and complete its cycle 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.619
 vegetative within crops the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.150
 family of the Solanaceae among which 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.160
 tomatoes are peppers or 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.830
 Aubergines for example are from the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 families that require more hours of light 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.930
 but everything is that they require hours of light 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.700
 and direct sunlight does not mean that no 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.000
 suffer damage from this exposure 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.489
 prolonged together with high temperatures at 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230
 just as happens the people we go 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.570
 to focus on the tomato but all the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.070
 crops to a greater or lesser extent can 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.030
 get to suffer damage from heat stroke 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.239
 direct sunlight before an exhibition 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 direct and prolonged to the sun accompanied 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.650
 in addition to high temperatures and how 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.239
 consequence of having lost mass 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.659
 foliar in the area 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.040
 the tomato begins to show spots 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.530
 whitish 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.580
 pigmentation has been lost as you can 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 appreciate in this tomato 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.700
 it was going white in that area that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.050
 is more exposed to solar radiation 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 this is the opposite as you can 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.350
 observe has a color 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.090
 appropriate and corresponding to your factor 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.250
 of development and maturity 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.399
 these damages as I say are due to the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.310
 direct exposure to the sun and if they are very 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.729
 lasting and prolonged after 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.700
 transform or you can derive in these 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.549
 other damages as you can see here the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.950
 zone is less exposed in the area that 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.149
 is more exposed and also for more 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.039
 time this what is now taking place is 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.600
 that this area besides whitish 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:02:00.009
 present a rather well-padded touch 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.200
 and that in addition those damages are reflected in 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.710
 the internal part of the fruit with which 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.600
 go quality 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.190
 and it is not usable from the point of 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.190
 view of consumption 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.700
 as you can appreciate 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.489
 this area would be the least response to the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.030
 radiation 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.880
 Y 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.850
 the one that has been placed 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.500
 directly to the sun that is the one that has 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.100
 suffered damage as you can appreciate this 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.290
 part would have to be removed at the time of 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.060
 try to consume 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.430
 this fruit that could become 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.109
 usable in a small part 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.109
 of its entirety 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.890
 in some cases we can take advantage of 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.690
 fruit that we should throw it 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.390
 completely 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.180
 because it has been lost 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.569
 all its typical banal characteristics 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.740
 which are what make us consume them 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.000
 usually we will not have these 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.010
 problems as long as the plant 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.350
 have a good vegetative development already 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.170
 that with its branches and its leaves men at 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.900
 fruit thus preventing it 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.380
 receive the rays directly and that 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.750
 produce the damage that we just saw 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.790
 there are these fruits that you can see here 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.769
 it is shaded 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.219
 and as you can see they do not have 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.219
 insult me 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.860
 but if the plant loses foliar mass by 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.069
 some circumstances either a plague 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.020
 a disease with a physiopathy 3 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.540
 water for example 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.240
 and as I say it loses leaves in a 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.660
 certain area such as being 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.580
 here is fruit will be more exposed to 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.980
 solar radiation and they are going to produce 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.980
 the damage we are seeing 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.069
 tropical was more shaded 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.510
 more shaded indication does not have the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.630
 same damage because he was by 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.670
 down the solution to this problem as 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.349
 start with prevention trying 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.020
 that the plant has a good development 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.330
 vegetative so that naturally they are 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.819
 come to the fruits and these are not produced 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.249
 problems 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.840
 but if we have already been given a problem or 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.419
 any circumstance either plague 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.060
 disease or water stress physio that 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.609
 produce some physiopathies we can 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.139
 try to shade the fruits of shape 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.199
 artificial 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.419
 we can use straw for example or 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.440
 also even weeds like I have 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.660
 seen somewhere 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.800
 depositing on the weed crop 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.120
 so that on those points it is not damaged 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.280
 we can also use as 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.560
 I've also seen meshes somewhere 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.860
 of shading that yes using a factor 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.280
 of hat about the most 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.280
 high 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.820
 they also need sun to complete their 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.460
 cycle legislative 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.050
 and with the fruits we make with 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.030
 the fruits that are little damaged 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.420
 we can try to take advantage of them 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.370
 cutting or removing that damaged part a 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.830
 Once it begins to mature remember that 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.620
 in the case of the tomato we can 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.590
 collect when you find pintÃ³n 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.290
 who is looking at the color of green to 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.060
 reddish and will mature in our house 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.130
 once we have harvested 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.500
 we can let him mature at home and 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.570
 cut out that piece once we go to 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.150
 consume it and the fruits that are very 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.000
 damaged we will remove them from the plant 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.490
 to avoid rot and degenerate in 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.139
 problems of diseases or those 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.830
 same plants and on the rest of the 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.230
 fruit 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.420
 but that after seeing this video is better 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.030
 one of the physiopathies that most 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:46.480
 frequent in areas of much 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.790
 sunstroke as is mine and that you know 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.190
 from this video how to correct or 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.770
 try to prevent this problem that 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:57.540
 can get to produce a post there was a 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.540
 greeting this video
