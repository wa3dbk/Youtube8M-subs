00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 good night have all the users 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.029
 of the android community the followers 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.460
 of my profile on facebook tonight 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.130
 let's flash the samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.019
 let's see precisely what rom is 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.880
 Currently running on this samsung 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.880
 galaxy s3 let's adjust 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.109
 Phone information 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.900
 of the telephone 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.190
 as we can see it is in version 4 2 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.689
 2 2 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.989
 I live 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.240
 the kernel is the kernel chair this 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.950
 is here as we can see 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.600
 Y 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.230
 in the rumba specifically is the super 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.809
 nexus 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.780
 as we can see there because now we're going 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.809
 to restart the computer in mode 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.930
 recovery as is rubÃ©n cooked 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.710
 we are just going to restart 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.930
 the recovery option and is ready the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.490
 will restart the recovery directly but 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.020
 you can do it with the button 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.110
 turned off so it makes me up 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.750
 and he left all three at the same time 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.050
 phone will stand and nissan these 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.880
 three buttons now we're going to perform 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.570
 the phrasing has the phone you have to 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.570
 make three erasures the total erasure 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.330
 which is the factor and reset the cache's and 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.330
 the dalvik let's start with the data 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.909
 we give that if from the hatred they jump 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.090
 all user data are going to 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.090
 delete 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.230
 with white cache partition 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.770
 same we indicate that yes 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.950
 and finally we are going to see 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.390
 says white dalvik h 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 we indicate yes 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.890
 we look for the option the last go bad 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.810
 now we go on such if we already see already 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.140
 having done all three deletions 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.300
 let depending on where you are 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.910
 have saved the rom either in the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.690
 internal card of the equipment in its memory 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.680
 internal or on the sd card you can 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.140
 choose on the external one or on the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.450
 internal I have the external one 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:41.290
 the second option 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:45.099
 the file is called cmd 10.1 2013 03 03 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.099
 what is this that is here 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.480
 we say yes 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.970
 and start installing this installation is 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.330
 relatively fast lasts more or less 1 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.280
 minute after installing the rom as such 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.819
 you have to install the gaps it has to be 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.430
 a gas compatible with the rom version 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.799
 who are installing living with gaps 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.750
 for the living and so on ok 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.790
 remember to subscribe to the channel 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.190
 leave little hand up if you like the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.910
 video and visit my facebook profile 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.269
 ready already installed the rom let's 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.269
 proceed 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.650
 let's proceed to install the second 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.920
 File will see the external card 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.829
 and we look for this that is here the gaps 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.459
 precisely below 1610 that we just 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.109
 to install the apps the same 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.209
 procedure we tell them that if the 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.160
 we want to install this is a little more 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.330
 Quick 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.900
 as you can see there is already installing 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.370
 the process is quite fast 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.000
 it's almost ready ok it's ready 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.769
 remember to do the phrasing 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.860
 you must have a basic knowledge like 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.769
 you can see it's very easy but doing 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.200
 all right the flashing will be 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.720
 perfect for your team and we will 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.870
 restart 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.440
 and I hope the team starts the first 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.780
 start usually takes a little more than 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.880
 what it normally takes since it is 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.790
 loading all the apps obviously 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.040
 because they are new and it takes a little longer 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.380
 but it's pretty fast hard around 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.190
 one minute as you can see it is already 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.540
 loading the cyanogenmod logo and 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.090
 it's a matter of waiting a little bit 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.440
 to give its first start and show you 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.960
 how it looks 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.730
 the new rom that we are installing to me 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.610
 I particularly like rom 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.970
 cooked because there are no files of 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.320
 third parties in this case from samsung 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.040
 including its two websites and applications 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.770
 that for my personal use are 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.900
 unnecessary if I want to use them I look for 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.450
 an alternative application in the market 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.750
 but that they do not force me to have 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.600
 than having my computer with applications that 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.130
 for me in my case they are rubbish suddenly 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.400
 for other people they will serve but 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.270
 specifically for me they serve us or that 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.840
 we choose in Spanish 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.780
 skip this step omit anyway 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.190
 I do not have an account on Google I do not want 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.190
 integrate the following 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:39.139
 I can already use the equipment as you can see 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:42.050
 It is a living round very similar to 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.689
 the nexus family as you can see very 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.550
 minimalist enter the menu so you see 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:50.080
 fluency as you can see the team is 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:53.520
 Quite fluent is following fluency 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.210
 or you can see it's pretty quick look 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.210
 observe 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.710
 but now let's review what rum is 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.259
 running which was the rom that 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.500
 specifically we install in our 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.500
 team ok let's adjust 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.960
 a little bit of zoom 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.860
 best 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.889
 let's go to phone information 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:24.569
 as you can see in version 4 2 2 2 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.569
 the living as you can see 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:33.389
 the kernel is quite new is from 3 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:33.389
 March and March 3 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:39.889
 the version is the asean today at 10.1 as 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.799
 you can see we are already running the rice 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.709
 that we just installed with this already 

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:47.899
 we have a new rom installed 

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:50.329
 later I will show another rom that is the 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:53.029
 super nexus how to install it and in it 

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:55.759
 I will also show you how to perform 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:57.859
 better customization in the kernel 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:01.369
 chair as such that will be in the next 

00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:03.400
 video do not forget to leave your little finger up 

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:06.460
 in the video 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.620
 this visit my facebook profile and 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.880
 subscribe to the channel they have good 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.880
 Android nights until then
