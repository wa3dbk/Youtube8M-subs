00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the pepper is a climate plant 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.649
 tropical or subtropical and grows better 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.440
 in a warm environment with temperature 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.990
 above 21 degrees and with high humidity 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.809
 because it adapts well to the climate 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 with high temperature the fruit can 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.500
 a good development in calves 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.960
 agreste from Pernambuco 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 to start planting it is necessary to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.380
 take care of the beginning soil we put the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.269
 treated of pagadian makes the crossing 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.460
 I put a strong 1 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.050
 then come to you, you 're not even here. 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.110
 not a woman 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 is there any idea gap exists 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.070
 30 cm and pedro busted will make 30 or 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.960
 25 years depends on a person who is still 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.489
 depends on the time of the year for having 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.649
 warmer and closer or when the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 floating exchange and placing the plant 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.410
 He does not like the wind so much he made 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.399
 the leaves are thick 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.980
 impeding the absorption of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.129
 nutrients causing the plant not to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.829
 develop well to soften the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.830
 farmers grow corn and grass 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.600
 as a barrier so planting 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.360
 needs a good 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.030
 availability of water but should be 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.000
 avoided the drenching of the earth 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.909
 therefore in this site the irrigation was 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.400
 correctly thought the trot is the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.710
 testament you use the model of when 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.479
 let's this is the adult one uses 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.729
 properly cleaning things does not 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.829
 get a decent treatment if it fails to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.439
 You must have your own 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.820
 avoid pest attack and appearance 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.280
 of diseases 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.680
 the farmer seeking technical assistance to 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 plagues are different, and we use 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.340
 preventively make use of seven 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.130
 syllables the case to control the insects 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.710
 and fungicide to control the fungus 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.579
 some who come the jealous appear 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.329
 during the production stage of the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.090
 Pepper 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.549
 the chili needs well- trained soil 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.310
 fertile with good availability of 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.040
 nitrogen but not always the farmer 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.939
 know how to leave the use of the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.149
 product 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.239
 he knows full management but there are 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.830
 things like diseases with a part of 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.840
 nutrition 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.820
 part of the plant's nutritional deficiency 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.550
 that he does not understand then we are 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.800
 stuck trying to meet this need 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.110
 according to the technical guidelines is 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.220
 possible to make planting result in a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.220
 good harvest 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.620
 three months after implanting the fruit 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.630
 get ready for boxing put the pec 60 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.240
 money 65 days at the most you see that the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.040
 stream is getting a thick husk 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.700
 so great since football was concluded 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.440
 entertain the harvest by pulling 65 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.330
 year but it depends on the amount of cash 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.670
 Are you going to roll in Hindu god at the base? 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.920
 30 boxes you will regulate seven people 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.360
 at the beginning or afterwards it is decreasing but 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.270
 when I went that there will be no more people and 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.850
 Depends on the amount of the 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.400
 easy to find people were going to work 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.070
 You can do it but you can not do it. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.890
 production of 15,000 feet in check the network 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.500
 of 700 boxes that go to the hands of the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.030
 merchants initial production of 60 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.420
 box like hassan 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.880
 comes from there I sold for 3 to 2 that sees neither and 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.970
 25-kg box and round the price 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.970
 is from r 15 to 14 reais in the field
