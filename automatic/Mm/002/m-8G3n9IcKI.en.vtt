00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
imaging sheet from the stamp-a-ma-jig

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.100 
imaging sheet from the stamp-a-ma-jig
but<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.310> could<00:02:42.459> also<00:02:42.670> use<00:02:43.150> anything<00:02:43.569> that's

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
clear imaging sheet or a transparency

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.830 
clear imaging sheet or a transparency
and<00:02:53.560> I'm<00:02:54.430> going<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.850> take<00:02:55.030> some<00:02:55.269> crumb<00:02:55.540> cake

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
ink and I stopped the sponge dauber and

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.199 
ink and I stopped the sponge dauber and
I<00:03:00.010> am<00:03:00.310> going<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.030> line<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.980> up<00:03:03.340> top<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:04.060> bottom

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
I am going to line this up top to bottom

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.250 
I am going to line this up top to bottom
on<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.630> tag<00:03:05.730> think<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.690> I'm<00:03:08.049> going<00:03:08.230> to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.340 
make like a strike going down and it's
not<00:03:12.580> real<00:03:14.489> dark<00:03:15.489> okay<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:17.019> want<00:03:17.230> it

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
not real dark okay you just want it

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.650 
not real dark okay you just want it
barely<00:03:17.530> there<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.670> I'm<00:03:18.760> going<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:18.970> move<00:03:19.120> over

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
barely there and I'm going to move over

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.759 
barely there and I'm going to move over
I<00:03:20.910> don't<00:03:21.910> measure<00:03:22.209> on<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.900> because<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.590> does

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
I don't measure on this because it does

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.039 
I don't measure on this because it does
not<00:03:23.980> have<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.459> be<00:03:24.609> exact

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.050

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
then I'm going to come this way and do

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.370 
then I'm going to come this way and do
this<00:03:31.209> edge<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:34.570> is<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.079> to<00:03:35.140> give

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
this edge and this is just going to give

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.780 
this edge and this is just going to give
a<00:03:35.410> faint<00:03:36.299> background<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.019> tag<00:03:38.609> I'm<00:03:39.609> going

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
a faint background to the tag I'm going

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.720 
a faint background to the tag I'm going
to<00:03:39.880> turn<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.329> over<00:03:40.799> because<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:41.950> do<00:03:42.010> want<00:03:42.549> this

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
to turn this over because I do want this

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.410 
to turn this over because I do want this
edge<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.280> little<00:03:45.640> bit<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:46.000> stripe

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420
