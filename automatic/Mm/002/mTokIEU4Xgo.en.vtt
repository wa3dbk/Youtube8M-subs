B<00:00:55.530> battery<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.610> could<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.030> device

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
B battery and it could see this device

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
B battery and it could see this device
actually<00:00:57.449> supports<00:00:57.899> 3G<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.500> Speedy's

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
download speed is genuine and aps and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.889 
download speed is genuine and aps and
that<00:01:01.770> puts<00:01:01.980> B<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> five<00:01:02.520> point<00:01:02.730> seven<00:01:03.030> six<00:01:03.329> Mbps

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
that puts B is five point seven six Mbps

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.450 
that puts B is five point seven six Mbps
