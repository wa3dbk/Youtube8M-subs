00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello youtube friends today I bring you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 a new legend is now from the mini 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.649
 craft and it is the next 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.200
 recently exposed in a new world 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.450
 minecraft single player everything was 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.639
 normal at the beginning so I started to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.980
 cut trees and create items in my 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.439
 box to create items x the world 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.279
 games I realized that something was moving in 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.619
 the dense fog 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.840
 I have a very slow computer so 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.000
 I have to play with a small render 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.920
 distance while lower this option 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.560
 less you see around you 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.780
 more fog I thought it was a cow like that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.239
 who was chasing her hoping to take 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.000
 some leather for the armor was not 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.860
 a cow looking at me was another character 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.320
 with the missing skin but his eyes 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 they were empty I did not see pop-up with their 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.910
 name that is the name that goes up 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.920
 of one when you play online and double 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 check to make sure I was not in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.539
 the multiplayer mode he did not stay long 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.489
 time he looked at me and quickly ran 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.280
 towards the fog I pursued him 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.350
 curiosity but it was already gone continue 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.809
 with the game not sure what to think 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.080
 while I was expanding around the world I saw 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.840
 some things out of place for what 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.240
 no map random map the game creates you 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.700
 random maps in each game could 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.010
 tunneling 2 x 2 on the rocks 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.690
 perfect little pyramids made of 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.210
 sand in the ocean and groves of 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.280
 trees with all their leaves cut me 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.260
 I constantly thought I had seen 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.300
 the other player in the deep fog 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.030
 but I never had another good view of the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.400
 I tried to increase my render distance 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.010
 thinking that he could see but it was in vain 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.110
 save the map and I went to the forums to 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.080
 see if anyone else had found 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.390
 this pseudo player there was nobody I created 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.640
 my own subject counting on man 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.010
 and asking if someone had had 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.800
 a similar experience the post was 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.930
 erased before five minutes 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.450
 understand again and the subject was deleted 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.400
 even faster I received a bm of a 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.430
 user named hero blind that contained 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.640
 a word stop when I wanted to look 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.000
 the profile of hero brin page was 404 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.340
 typical error 404 page not found 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.860
 I received an e-mail from another user of the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.840
 forum he said moderators can 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.800
 read the messages of the users in the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.320
 forum like this 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.270
 we were safe using e-mail this 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.550
 user said that he had seen the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.620
 mysterious player too and had a 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.110
 small directory of other users that 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.210
 They said they had also seen their worlds 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.310
 They were full with mummies constructions 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.050
 made by men too and they described 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.750
 that the mysterious player did not have 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.700
 pupils about a month passed until 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.980
 I heard news from my informant too 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.470
 some players that have been found 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.390
 the mysterious man they took a look 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.760
 to the name of robe line and they found that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.010
 that name was used frequently by 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.680
 a Swedish player after collecting 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.660
 more information we discovered that it was that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.470
 the night brother the developer of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.570
 game 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.210
 I personally sent him an email last night and 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.400
 I asked him if he had a brother he took 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.010
 some time but he answered me back 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.710
 with a very short message I had but he 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.780
 He is no longer with us night I have not 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.880
 seen the mysterious man from our 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.620
 first encounter and I have not noticed another 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.350
 change in the world more than the ones that I have 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.480
 done I never found it again it was 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.670
 something that really scared me good 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.590

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.099
