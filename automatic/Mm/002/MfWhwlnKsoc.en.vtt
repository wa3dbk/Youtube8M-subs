bringing your cool toys mm-hmm all right
so<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> actually<00:00:21.480> got<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.900> look<00:00:22.109> at<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.560> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
so I actually got to look at one of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.890 
so I actually got to look at one of
these<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.859> little<00:00:23.369> bit<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.910> few<00:00:24.449> months<00:00:24.570> back

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
these a little bit a few months back

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.410 
these a little bit a few months back
when<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.590> demo<00:00:25.769> models<00:00:26.220> came<00:00:26.880> around<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.390> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
when the demo models came around but I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.140 
when the demo models came around but I
didn't<00:00:27.750> get<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.859> yet<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.150> tell

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
didn't get to use one just yet so tell

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.519 
didn't get to use one just yet so tell
me<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.480> bit<00:00:30.630> about<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.109> notice<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.500> has

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
me a little bit about it I notice it has

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
me a little bit about it I notice it has
a<00:00:31.650> nice<00:00:31.830> open<00:00:32.070> air<00:00:32.340> chassis<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:32.969> I'm<00:00:33.059> guessing

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
a nice open air chassis but I'm guessing

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.729 
a nice open air chassis but I'm guessing
that's<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> only<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.530> unique

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that's not the only really unique

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.250 
that's not the only really unique
feature<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.430> yeah<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.239> first<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.200> we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
feature here yeah so first of all we

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.630 
feature here yeah so first of all we
launched<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.860> we've<00:00:38.040> been<00:00:38.129> working<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
launched the we've been working on this

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
launched the we've been working on this
mouse<00:00:38.879> since<00:00:39.629> last<00:00:39.809> year<00:00:40.050> sometime<00:00:40.290> probably

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
mouse since last year sometime probably

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
mouse since last year sometime probably
well<00:00:41.010> over<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.280> year<00:00:41.340> okay<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.690> wanted<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> do

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
well over a year okay we wanted to do

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.510 
well over a year okay we wanted to do
something<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
something really different with the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.209 
something really different with the
mouse<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.260> two<00:00:46.410> versions<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:47.039> have

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
mouse so so we have two versions we have

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.590 
mouse so so we have two versions we have
the<00:00:47.399> torque<00:00:47.700> extent<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.360> torque

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the torque extent and we have torque

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
the torque extent and we have torque
extend<00:00:48.960> carbon<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> difference<00:00:49.890> between

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
extend carbon the difference between

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.580 
extend carbon the difference between
these<00:00:50.430> two<00:00:50.489> versions<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.719> really<00:00:52.320> cosmetic

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
these two versions is is really cosmetic

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860 
these two versions is is really cosmetic
the<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.180> has<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> carbon<00:00:54.660> fiber

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the this one here has a carbon fiber

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.260 
the this one here has a carbon fiber
surface<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.949> real<00:00:56.129> carbon<00:00:56.370> fiber<00:00:56.640> also<00:00:57.059> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
surface it's real carbon fiber also so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.299 
surface it's real carbon fiber also so
it<00:00:57.719> does<00:00:57.899> add<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.260> price<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> bit<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.100> like

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it does add to the price a bit and like

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
it does add to the price a bit and like
I<00:00:59.340> said<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.850> purely<00:01:00.090> cosmetic<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.750> some

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
I said it's it's purely cosmetic so some

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.240 
I said it's it's purely cosmetic so some
people<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.410> some<00:01:01.680> people<00:01:01.739> may<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.190> like

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
people like it some people may not like

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
people like it some people may not like
it<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.180> why<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.449> offer<00:01:03.480> both<00:01:03.960> versions

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it so that's why we offer both versions

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.859 
it so that's why we offer both versions
I<00:01:04.619> did<00:01:05.040> hear<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> handmade

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
I did hear that it is like a handmade

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770 
I did hear that it is like a handmade
like<00:01:07.470> hand-laid<00:01:08.010> carbon<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.790> yeah<00:01:09.090> that's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
like hand-laid carbon right yeah that's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.649 
like hand-laid carbon right yeah that's
that's<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.470> build<00:01:10.710> quality<00:01:10.950> yeah<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that's a build quality yeah and of

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.000 
that's a build quality yeah and of
course<00:01:12.689> adds<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> cost<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.650> that's<00:01:13.830> why<00:01:13.950> we

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
course adds to the cost so that's why we

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.010 
course adds to the cost so that's why we
wanted<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:14.520> sure<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.990> know

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
wanted to make sure that it's you know

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.870 
wanted to make sure that it's you know

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the premium version we have the premium

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.219 
the premium version we have the premium

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
version and we have a standard version

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.649 
version and we have a standard version
as<00:01:19.320> well<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.119> mean<00:01:21.420> when<00:01:21.540> you're

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
getting the quality it's one of those

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.109 
getting the quality it's one of those
things<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.670> getting<00:01:23.759> what<00:01:23.970> your

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
things like you're getting what your

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.370 
things like you're getting what your
paper<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.780> still<00:01:25.080> feel<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.259> you're

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
paper so you can still feel like you're

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
paper so you can still feel like you're
getting<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.799> good<00:01:25.979> value<00:01:26.250> out<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.330> mouse

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
getting a good value out of this mouse

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.410 
getting a good value out of this mouse
so<00:01:28.400> I'm<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.520> gonna<00:01:29.610> ramble<00:01:29.880> off<00:01:30.060> some<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
so I'm just gonna ramble off some of the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.280 
so I'm just gonna ramble off some of the
basic<00:01:30.720> specs<00:01:30.930> you've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> avago<00:01:33.290> 9880

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
basic specs you've got the avago 9880

settings so it's kind of good to see ya

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.710 
settings so it's kind of good to see ya
i<00:03:06.680> would<00:03:06.920> say<00:03:07.160> i'm<00:03:07.250> way<00:03:07.670> more<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.120> palm<00:03:08.360> gamer

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
i would say i'm way more of a palm gamer

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.660 
i would say i'm way more of a palm gamer
so<00:03:09.049> any<00:03:09.260> probably<00:03:09.739> have<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.099> on<00:03:10.310> maximum

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
so any probably have that on maximum

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.270 
so any probably have that on maximum
even<00:03:10.879> though<00:03:10.940> i've<00:03:11.030> got<00:03:11.150> these<00:03:11.379> tiny<00:03:12.379> hands<00:03:13.160> i

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
even though i've got these tiny hands i

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.479 
even though i've got these tiny hands i

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
still like to have like more grip on the

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.160 
still like to have like more grip on the
mouse<00:03:16.670> i<00:03:17.090> also<00:03:17.299> like<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.510> have<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> heavier

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
mouse i also like to have a heavier

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.479 
mouse i also like to have a heavier
mouse<00:03:18.350> but<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.650> guys<00:03:18.769> can<00:03:19.010> accommodate<00:03:19.459> that

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
mouse but you guys can accommodate that

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.099 
mouse but you guys can accommodate that
as<00:03:19.790> well<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.150> you're<00:03:20.239> showing<00:03:20.600> me<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:20.870> yeah

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
as well and you're showing me in yeah

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.550 
as well and you're showing me in yeah
i'll<00:03:21.950> let<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.569> so<00:03:23.569> you<00:03:24.049> can<00:03:24.200> also<00:03:24.319> adjust

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
i'll let you so so you can also adjust

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.830 
i'll let you so so you can also adjust
the<00:03:24.859> weight<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:25.400> basically<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.359> top<00:03:26.569> comes

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
the weight so basically the top comes

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.199 
the weight so basically the top comes
off<00:03:26.959> just<00:03:27.260> like<00:03:27.319> that<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.769> there's<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.670> small

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
off just like that and there's a small

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.539 
off just like that and there's a small
tray<00:03:29.510> in<00:03:29.660> here<00:03:29.900> this<00:03:30.620> tray<00:03:30.920> just<00:03:31.069> slides<00:03:31.370> out

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
tray in here this tray just slides out

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.479 
tray in here this tray just slides out
like<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:33.260> we<00:03:33.620> ship<00:03:33.769> with<00:03:34.010> with

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
like that and then we ship with with

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.830 
like that and then we ship with with
different<00:03:34.910> weights<00:03:35.060> this<00:03:35.299> is<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.540> heaviest

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
different weights this is the heaviest

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.900 
different weights this is the heaviest
weight<00:03:36.079> these<00:03:36.319> are<00:03:36.440> six<00:03:36.680> grams<00:03:36.920> each<00:03:37.160> okay<00:03:37.849> you

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
weight these are six grams each okay you

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.629 
weight these are six grams each okay you
just<00:03:38.030> slide<00:03:38.450> those<00:03:38.660> into<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.079> tray<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:40.370> tray

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
just slide those into the tray this tray

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.819 
just slide those into the tray this tray
goes<00:03:41.120> back<00:03:41.329> into<00:03:41.599> the<00:03:41.750> mouse<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.290> then<00:03:42.500> you

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
goes back into the mouse and then you

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.800 
goes back into the mouse and then you
put<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.069> top<00:03:43.280> piece<00:03:43.549> just<00:03:44.090> right<00:03:44.450> back<00:03:44.599> on

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
put the top piece just right back on

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.050 
put the top piece just right back on
just<00:03:44.989> like<00:03:45.200> that<00:03:45.410> mm-hmm<00:03:46.130> there<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.639> go<00:03:47.950> now

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
just like that mm-hmm there you go now

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.039 
just like that mm-hmm there you go now
I'm<00:03:50.060> assuming<00:03:50.239> this<00:03:50.569> is<00:03:50.720> an<00:03:50.810> ambidextrous

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
I'm assuming this is an ambidextrous

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.199 
I'm assuming this is an ambidextrous
Madison<00:03:51.919> yeah<00:03:52.069> thing<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.730> button

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
Madison yeah thing that the button

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.550 
Madison yeah thing that the button
configure<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.660> was<00:03:53.810> also<00:03:54.079> one<00:03:54.230> of<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.380> goals

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
configure that was also one of the goals

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.500 
configure that was also one of the goals
of<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.829> mouse<00:03:54.980> is<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.700> design<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.239> with<00:03:56.359> an

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
of the mouse is to design it with an

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.440 
of the mouse is to design it with an
ambidextrous<00:03:56.840> design<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:57.829> it<00:03:58.430> can<00:03:59.120> fit<00:03:59.150> both

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
ambidextrous design so it can fit both

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.849 
ambidextrous design so it can fit both
right<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.780> left<00:03:59.930> hand<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.319> gamers<00:04:00.650> and

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
right and left hand and gamers and

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.400 
right and left hand and gamers and
actually<00:04:01.220> we<00:04:01.340> have<00:04:01.690> we<00:04:02.690> have<00:04:02.810> some<00:04:03.049> settings

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
actually we have we have some settings

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.479 
actually we have we have some settings
in<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.590> software<00:04:03.919> that<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.190> can<00:04:04.220> select

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
in the software that you can select

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.940 
in the software that you can select
right<00:04:04.819> or<00:04:05.030> left<00:04:05.209> hand<00:04:05.450> mode<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:06.260> basically<00:04:06.799> the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
right or left hand mode so basically the

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.379 
right or left hand mode so basically the
only<00:04:07.010> thing<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.340> does<00:04:07.459> is<00:04:07.489> just<00:04:07.760> switch<00:04:07.940> switch

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
only thing it does is just switch switch

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.870 
only thing it does is just switch switch
the<00:04:08.540> buttons<00:04:08.780> around<00:04:08.930> oh<00:04:09.319> right<00:04:10.099> okay<00:04:10.430> i'm

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
the buttons around oh right okay i'm

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.970 
the buttons around oh right okay i'm
left<00:04:11.209> handed<00:04:11.359> but<00:04:11.660> i've<00:04:12.079> been<00:04:12.410> using<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.829> mouse

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
left handed but i've been using a mouse

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.550 
left handed but i've been using a mouse
my<00:04:13.220> with<00:04:13.489> my<00:04:13.639> right<00:04:13.819> hand<00:04:13.849> my<00:04:14.120> whole<00:04:14.269> life

my with my right hand my whole life
because<00:04:15.560> when<00:04:15.859> mice<00:04:16.370> were<00:04:16.609> first<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.090> thing

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
because when mice were first a thing

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.360 
because when mice were first a thing
they<00:04:17.479> weren't<00:04:17.750> really<00:04:18.010> ambitious<00:04:19.010> they

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
they weren't really ambitious they

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.529 
they weren't really ambitious they
couldn't<00:04:19.609> be<00:04:19.669> configured<00:04:20.090> one<00:04:20.269> way<00:04:20.389> or

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
couldn't be configured one way or

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.930 
couldn't be configured one way or
another<00:04:20.709> and<00:04:21.709> also<00:04:21.890> my<00:04:22.130> mom<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.460> right<00:04:22.610> handed

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
another and also my mom is right handed

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.660 
another and also my mom is right handed
and<00:04:23.030> kind<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.300> like<00:04:23.450> what<00:04:23.659> mom<00:04:23.840> says

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.580 

everybody<00:04:27.670> else<00:04:28.060> gets<00:04:28.330> right-handed<00:04:29.170> but

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
everybody else gets right-handed but

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.740 
everybody else gets right-handed but
anyway<00:04:30.100> um<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.910> there<00:04:31.060> anything<00:04:31.300> else<00:04:31.540> you'd

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
anyway um is there anything else you'd

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.140 
anyway um is there anything else you'd
like<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:31.930> point<00:04:32.350> out<00:04:32.560> um<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.460> think<00:04:33.639> one<00:04:34.000> of<00:04:34.030> the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
like to point out um I think one of the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.250 
like to point out um I think one of the
things<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.510> touched<00:04:34.720> on<00:04:34.840> earlier<00:04:34.900> is

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
things that you touched on earlier is

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.020 
things that you touched on earlier is
the<00:04:35.500> build<00:04:35.770> quality<00:04:35.980> of<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.400> mouse<00:04:36.550> we<00:04:36.820> really

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
the build quality of the mouse we really

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.420 
the build quality of the mouse we really
spent<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.330> lot<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.510> time<00:04:37.630> on<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.860> the

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
spent a lot of time on this so the the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.790 
spent a lot of time on this so the the
base<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.850> can<00:04:40.000> see<00:04:40.120> is<00:04:40.240> metal<00:04:40.930> base<00:04:41.110> obviously

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
base you can see is metal base obviously

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.950 
base you can see is metal base obviously
the<00:04:42.070> carbon<00:04:42.400> like<00:04:42.550> we<00:04:42.669> discussed<00:04:42.820> earlier<00:04:43.150> but

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
the carbon like we discussed earlier but

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.350 
the carbon like we discussed earlier but
even<00:04:44.080> as<00:04:44.350> far<00:04:45.190> as<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.460> internals<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.150> know<00:04:46.240> we

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
even as far as the internals you know we

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.360 
even as far as the internals you know we
use<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.630> highest<00:04:46.660> quality<00:04:47.190> switches<00:04:48.190> which

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
use the highest quality switches which

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.040 
use the highest quality switches which
are<00:04:48.520> called<00:04:48.669> home<00:04:48.940> run<00:04:49.150> switches<00:04:49.600> yeah

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
are called home run switches yeah

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.470 
are called home run switches yeah
they're<00:04:50.610> certified<00:04:51.610> for<00:04:51.880> up<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.060> 20<00:04:52.300> million

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
they're certified for up to 20 million

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.320 
they're certified for up to 20 million
clicks<00:04:52.780> which<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.110> their<00:04:53.260> highest<00:04:53.410> rated

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
clicks which is their highest rated

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.300 
clicks which is their highest rated
switch<00:04:55.500> but<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.650> know<00:04:56.740> not<00:04:56.919> only<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:57.250> we

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
switch but you know not only that we

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.460 
switch but you know not only that we
also<00:04:57.490> use<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.060> highest<00:04:58.300> grade<00:04:58.510> laser<00:04:59.050> sensor

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
also use the highest grade laser sensor

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.830 
also use the highest grade laser sensor
as<00:04:59.560> well<00:04:59.740> which<00:04:59.919> is<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.190> vago<00:05:00.760> 9800<00:05:01.360> that's

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
as well which is the a vago 9800 that's

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.290 
as well which is the a vago 9800 that's
awesome<00:05:02.350> so<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.070> really<00:05:03.580> are<00:05:03.760> getting<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.270> i

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
awesome so you really are getting a i

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.510 
awesome so you really are getting a i
think<00:05:04.750> a<00:05:05.080> really<00:05:05.260> good<00:05:05.470> piece<00:05:05.710> oh<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.460> i

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
think a really good piece oh and i

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.850 
think a really good piece oh and i
forgot<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.820> mention<00:05:07.230> mention<00:05:08.230> one<00:05:08.380> last<00:05:08.680> thing

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
forgot to mention mention one last thing

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.180 
forgot to mention mention one last thing
is<00:05:09.040> actually<00:05:09.430> in<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.760> wire<00:05:09.940> so<00:05:10.690> we<00:05:10.870> use<00:05:11.190> silver

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
is actually in the wire so we use silver

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.460 
is actually in the wire so we use silver
coated<00:05:12.490> wire<00:05:12.669> so<00:05:13.360> silver<00:05:13.840> coated<00:05:14.110> wire<00:05:14.260> is<00:05:14.440> a

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
coated wire so silver coated wire is a

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.780 
coated wire so silver coated wire is a
bit<00:05:14.680> more<00:05:14.830> expensive<00:05:15.130> but<00:05:15.340> it's<00:05:15.610> less

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
bit more expensive but it's less

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.420 
bit more expensive but it's less
resistive<00:05:16.270> than<00:05:16.900> then<00:05:17.470> copper<00:05:17.800> wire<00:05:17.979> well

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
resistive than then copper wire well

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.500 
resistive than then copper wire well
that's<00:05:18.580> good<00:05:18.729> so<00:05:18.850> you're<00:05:18.940> going<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.150> get<00:05:19.330> the

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
that's good so you're going to get the

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.270 
that's good so you're going to get the
better<00:05:19.900> transfer<00:05:20.350> rate<00:05:20.590> yeah<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.770> mean<00:05:21.040> if<00:05:21.190> you

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
better transfer rate yeah I mean if you

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.659 
better transfer rate yeah I mean if you
measured<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:22.169> from<00:05:23.169> a<00:05:23.410> electrical<00:05:24.220> standpoint

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
measured it from a electrical standpoint

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.940 
measured it from a electrical standpoint
it<00:05:24.790> is<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:24.910> superior<00:05:25.600> wire<00:05:25.930> all<00:05:26.500> right<00:05:26.710> Jacob

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
it is a superior wire all right Jacob

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.200 
it is a superior wire all right Jacob
thank<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.340> so<00:05:27.580> thank<00:05:27.700> you<00:05:27.880> very<00:05:28.090> much
