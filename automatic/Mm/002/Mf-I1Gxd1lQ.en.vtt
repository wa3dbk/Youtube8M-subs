00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.940 
view and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
select<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.840> top<00:03:04.110> face<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.680> I'm<00:03:04.800> gonna

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
select the top face and I'm gonna

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.100 
select the top face and I'm gonna
subdivide<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.030> multiple<00:03:06.930> times<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.900> we're

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
subdivide it multiple times and we're

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.290 
subdivide it multiple times and we're
going<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.380> add<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:13.550> displace<00:03:14.550> modifier<00:03:14.790> and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
going to add a displace modifier and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.900 
going to add a displace modifier and
just<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.620> texture<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.490> I'm<00:03:17.670> gonna

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
just like that texture and I'm gonna

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.350 
just like that texture and I'm gonna
select<00:03:19.250> will<00:03:20.250> go<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.430> space<00:03:20.730> trunk<00:03:21.060> clouds<00:03:23.360> and

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
select will go to space trunk clouds and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.360 
select will go to space trunk clouds and
I'm<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:24.840> gonna<00:03:24.990> lower<00:03:25.320> strength<00:03:28.370> some

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
I'm just gonna lower strength some

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.460 
I'm just gonna lower strength some
around<00:03:29.640> 0.3<00:03:30.630> now<00:03:30.990> I'm<00:03:31.080> going<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.320> add<00:03:31.440> a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
around 0.3 now I'm going to add a

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:42.729 
around 0.3 now I'm going to add a
decimate<00:03:32.070> modifier

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:52.610 

like<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.629> fact<00:03:51.870> we<00:03:52.079> could<00:03:52.260> change

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
like that and in fact we could change

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.800 
like that and in fact we could change
this<00:03:53.010> from<00:03:53.340> clouds<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.359> noise<00:03:54.739> not<00:03:55.739> plants

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
this from clouds to noise not plants

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.530 
this from clouds to noise not plants
better<00:03:57.810> effect<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:59.030> what<00:04:00.030> would<00:04:00.209> make<00:04:00.359> this

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
better effect and what would make this

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.490 
better effect and what would make this
even<00:04:00.599> better<00:04:00.900> if<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:01.469> cube<00:04:01.889> was<00:04:02.189> split<00:04:02.760> and

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
even better if this cube was split and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.080 
even better if this cube was split and
we<00:04:04.500> could<00:04:04.680> decimate<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> bit<00:04:05.760> more<00:04:05.939> on<00:04:06.060> top

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
we could decimate this a bit more on top

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.759 
we could decimate this a bit more on top
can<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:06.510> keep<00:04:06.689> the<00:04:06.900> materials<00:04:07.349> but<00:04:07.620> other

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
can you keep the materials but other

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.929 
can you keep the materials but other
than<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.219> looks<00:04:08.250> pretty<00:04:08.459> earnest

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
than that it looks pretty earnest

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:14.080 
than that it looks pretty earnest
compared<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.329> render<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:12.500> there<00:04:13.500> we<00:04:13.739> have<00:04:14.040> it

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
compared to render and there we have it

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.990 
compared to render and there we have it
low<00:04:15.090> poly<00:04:15.419> water<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.949> thank<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.400> very<00:04:17.430> much

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
low poly water so thank you very much

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.550 
low poly water so thank you very much
