00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
logging tape and that is looking at tape

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.750 
logging tape and that is looking at tape
that<00:01:21.140> we've<00:01:21.320> shot<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.190> story<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.670> then

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.030 
you need to write down what we call time
code<00:01:24.740> which<00:01:24.980> is<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.420> number<00:01:26.650> point<00:01:27.650> on<00:01:27.890> the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
code which is the number point on the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.840

tape where different sound bites are
starts<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:31.940> things<00:01:32.120> so<00:01:32.720> those<00:01:33.380> are<00:01:33.500> things

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
starts of things so those are things

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.410 
starts of things so those are things
that<00:01:33.740> have<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.040> go<00:01:34.160> in<00:01:34.280> scripts<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:35.060> lot<00:01:35.300> of
