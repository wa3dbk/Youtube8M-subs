00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
that are going on in their personal

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.159 
that are going on in their personal
lives<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:03.240> are<00:05:03.419> not<00:05:03.540> really<00:05:03.990> directly

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
lives that are not really directly

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.279 
lives that are not really directly
related<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.160> hockey<00:05:06.030> all<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.330> time<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:06.840> it's

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
related to hockey all the time and it's

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.279 
related to hockey all the time and it's
a<00:05:07.410> great<00:05:07.440> opportunity<00:05:08.340> for<00:05:08.850> them<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.539> get<00:05:10.140> to

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
a great opportunity for them to get to

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.110 
a great opportunity for them to get to
know<00:05:10.410> each<00:05:10.440> other<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.130> it's<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.669> great<00:05:11.850> thing

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.420 
know each other and it's a great thing
for<00:05:12.750> us<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.229> think<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.860> investment<00:05:14.370> has

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.820 
for us and I think the investment has
been<00:05:14.490> great<00:05:14.850> for<00:05:15.000> our<00:05:15.060> team<00:05:15.180> that<00:05:15.930> we<00:05:16.620> were

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
able to come together and that's one of

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.909 
able to come together and that's one of
the<00:05:18.479> strong<00:05:18.690> points<00:05:18.720> of<00:05:19.110> our<00:05:19.200> team<00:05:19.440> we<00:05:19.590> really
