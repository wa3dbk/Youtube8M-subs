00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.469
 Hi, I'm Laura, and we're going to make a 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.600
 Christmas wreath with materials 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.809
 recycled to do it we need 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.180
 old newspapers that we have rolls of 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.980
 toilet paper if you want too 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.869
 you can have white glue to gather the 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.760
 better but with this it would be enough 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.130
 to do the base and then we'll see that 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.949
 You can be decorated according ye then 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.080
 the way to do it is if you have staples 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.550
 in the newspaper you take them away as not 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.400
 I just have what I 'm going to do is 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.750
 open newspapers in half 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.630
 we will take the leaves and roll up we 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.690
 taken a thickness because I do not know how some 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.200
 ten sheets more or less something like that and 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.430
 You're rolling it up like this 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.110
 wrinkling them at the same time with the hand 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.430
 You can do them as small 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.790
 Folds to make them a little more 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.410
 flexible and more wrinkled all if 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.520
 you see that you are left like this is very 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.480
 caked so you can reopen 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.480
 separates them is a bit 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.060
 and roll up again and so we go 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.470
 making several curls that are going to be the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.360
 perimeter of our crown then 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.370
 you have to know what size you want to 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.440
 the crown because this is going to be the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.590
 crown structure I will do some 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.590
 plus 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.100
 playing 10 I go rolling then the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.680
 next step once we have our 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.500
 two curlers would catch paper tubes 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.590
 hygienic and Indians going on like that 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.120
 simple you take the tube and vice passing 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.130
 the paper through 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.260
 this is what is going to shape the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.380
 crown you are going to see that this is going to go 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.360
 bending to form a kind of 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.280
 circle that will be our crown more or 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.800
 minus you have to put three for each 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.340
 newspaper sheet of this long and now 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.380
 I'll put three more on this side in 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.880
 could actually expose less because what 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.400
 that we are going to occupy this is for the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.890
 joining points then with having two 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.510
 one for each end would be worth it but 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.550
 this is so that you stay more symmetrical 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.940
 and the structure is a bit more 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.770
 aesthetic then now that we have the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.190
 two that would make us go doing the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.710
 way then the way to join what you have 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.780
 that move the tube to have margin and 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.720
 you see that this 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.080
 it opens 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.110
 then you open one of the two and you put 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.360
 one of the newspapers inside the other 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.610
 that being the case , I would now be what 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.100
 we have to move is the closing let's say 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.010
 move the tube so that it is just in 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.050
 the union and do not look and let's put it together 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.250
 on the other end in the same way 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.250
 we open one side 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.310
 and we put the other newspaper for this 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.470
 side you get it right if we squeeze a little 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.239
 against you the other link will be less 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.220
 chances of it opening up and a 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.590
 Once you have this, you would have the crown 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.569
 watch them together and the rest 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.099
 you can go scattering and carefully 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.319
 you are giving a little bit of shape like this with the 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.900
 hands and this would be the structure of 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.670
 our Christmas wreath to decorate it 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.319
 You can also use things that you have in 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.300
 house like picking old corks that 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.769
 you have at home and with a rope the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.299
 you can also tie the ones you could 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.280
 stick with a little bit of white glue 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.260
 before you can go winding the rope 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.049
 also to create a more rustic effect 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.910
 if you want to put some detail 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.380
 You can put a roll of paper 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.000
 kitchen that is always a little bit more 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.190
 long and do it with rope what 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.590
 want more things you can do 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.510
 You can use string instead of tape 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.030
 It is more original colors 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.739
 you can paint the tubes or the newspaper 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.290
 before rolling it like that color 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.269
 you want red and green white and blue 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.370
 whatever you want and so you have to 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.370
 in color instead of the materials 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.379
 original 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.450
 and finally you could also with the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.489
 newspaper paper that you can over 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.400
 cut out shapes such as leaves 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.730
 and after using them to stick them in the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.830
 crown and make a detail for 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.080
 hang it you can use the tape that 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.140
 put in color 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.330
 you can make ties to decorate a 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.910
 knot to hang it like this directly and 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.910
 have it hanging on the door
