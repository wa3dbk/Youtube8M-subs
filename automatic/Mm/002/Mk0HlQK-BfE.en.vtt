headphones is that they break real
easily<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.979> because<00:01:28.979> they're<00:01:29.310> cheaply

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
easily from here because they're cheaply

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.460 
easily from here because they're cheaply
sealed<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.900> glue<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.650> into<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.600> mean

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
on them and they break but they do take

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.140 
on them and they break but they do take
a<00:01:39.630> quite<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> force<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.369> over<00:01:41.909> time

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
a quite a bit of force but over time

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
a quite a bit of force but over time
they<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.350> weaker<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.740> weaker<00:01:43.860> until

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
they just get weaker and weaker until

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.840
