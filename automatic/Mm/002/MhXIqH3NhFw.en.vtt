00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
just put it to the side and nobody will

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.860 
just put it to the side and nobody will
see<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.970> second<00:02:19.300> part<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.660> trick

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
on the table to push it back to the edge

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970 
on the table to push it back to the edge
of<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.240> table<00:02:34.480> works<00:02:35.170> just<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.800> you

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
of the table works just like that you

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.770 
of the table works just like that you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
every time you do do a circle move you

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.470 
every time you do do a circle move you
push<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.890> coin<00:02:42.160> back<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:43.060> little<00:02:43.090> bit

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
until it falls over the edge and you can

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.580 
until it falls over the edge and you can
pull<00:02:48.580> up<00:02:48.610> your<00:02:48.940> thumb<00:02:49.180> your<00:02:49.600> finger<00:02:49.989> just<00:02:50.380> like
