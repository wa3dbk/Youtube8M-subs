today<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:45.059> there's<00:00:45.360> no<00:00:45.510> innate<00:00:46.050> flavor<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
today now there's no innate flavor in

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.040 
today now there's no innate flavor in
the<00:00:47.039> brain<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.789> texture<00:00:48.270> thing<00:00:48.360> we

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the brain but it's a texture thing we

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.920 
the brain but it's a texture thing we
are<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> pan<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.399> fry<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.180> brain<00:00:51.449> so

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
are going to pan a and fry this brain so

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.029 
are going to pan a and fry this brain so
it's<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:52.500> deep-fried

we call them brain McNuggets I'm going

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.150 
we call them brain McNuggets I'm going
to<00:00:57.870> use<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.230> spoon<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.890> I'm<00:00:58.980> just

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to use this little spoon and I'm just

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
to use this little spoon and I'm just
going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> tease<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.090> brain<00:01:00.359> out<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
going to tease that brain out of the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.390 
going to tease that brain out of the
socket<00:01:02.600> just<00:01:03.739> get<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.890> behind<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:07.130> like<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
socket just get in behind it and like a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.590 
socket just get in behind it and like a
very<00:01:09.439> delicate<00:01:10.439> quinelle<00:01:12.290> pop<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:14.600> like

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
very delicate quinelle pop that out like

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.670 
very delicate quinelle pop that out like
that<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:17.100> I'll<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.750> sit<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.470> bowl

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that and I'll just sit it in that bowl

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.080 
that and I'll just sit it in that bowl
there<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.150> same<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> other<00:01:21.810> side

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
there and the same with the other side

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.600 
there and the same with the other side
it's<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.180> tiny<00:01:24.540> brain<00:01:25.020> considering<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.280> pigs

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it's a tiny brain considering that pigs

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.480 
it's a tiny brain considering that pigs
are<00:01:27.680> recognized<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.829> being<00:01:28.979> intelligent

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
are recognized as being intelligent

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.190 
are recognized as being intelligent
animals<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.090> don't<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.780> has<00:01:30.990> any

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
animals I don't think that has any

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
animals I don't think that has any
relation<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:32.189> bright<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.150> it's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
relation to how bright they are but it's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390 
relation to how bright they are but it's
not<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> feed<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.409> people<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
not going to feed a lot of people it's a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
not going to feed a lot of people it's a
nibble<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.570> paper<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.079> well

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
nibble it's a can of paper it's well

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.960 
nibble it's a can of paper it's well
worth<00:01:37.470> pursuing<00:01:37.829> now<00:01:38.430> we're<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
worth pursuing now we're just going to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.560 
worth pursuing now we're just going to
pop<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.390> into<00:01:39.890> some<00:01:40.890> warm<00:01:41.460> water<00:01:41.909> I'm

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
pop this into some warm water I'm

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.080 
pop this into some warm water I'm
poaching<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.130> ultimately<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.850> just

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
poaching it really but ultimately I just

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.580 
poaching it really but ultimately I just
want<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.420> firmer<00:01:46.170> there's<00:01:46.500> no

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
want it to be firmer there's no

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
want it to be firmer there's no
flavoring<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> water<00:01:47.540> whatsoever

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
flavoring in that water whatsoever

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.980 
flavoring in that water whatsoever
it<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.500> makes<00:01:49.710> our<00:01:50.009> brain<00:01:50.670> easier<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.810> move

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
it just makes our brain easier to move

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.850 
it just makes our brain easier to move
on<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> next<00:01:52.680> stage<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> our<00:01:55.229> process<00:01:55.409> very

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
on to the next stage so our process very

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
on to the next stage so our process very
simple<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.460> brain<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.000> about<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
simple the brain is all about the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330 
simple the brain is all about the
texture<00:01:57.810> there's<00:01:58.079> no<00:01:58.200> innate<00:01:58.500> flavor<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
texture there's no innate flavor in the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.280 
texture there's no innate flavor in the
brain<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.939> we're<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> flavor<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
brain so we're going to flavor it and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.170 
brain so we're going to flavor it and
what<00:02:01.409> I've<00:02:01.530> got<00:02:01.560> actually<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.030> bit

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
what I've got actually is a little bit

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.139 
what I've got actually is a little bit
of<00:02:03.509> smoked<00:02:03.780> paprika<00:02:03.990> some<00:02:04.740> five-spice<00:02:05.189> salt

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
of smoked paprika some five-spice salt

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.670 
of smoked paprika some five-spice salt
and<00:02:06.270> pepper<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:07.200> plain<00:02:07.500> flour

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.520 

whoo<00:02:14.170> crack<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.320> egg<00:02:17.110> make<00:02:18.110> sure<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.470> just

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
whoo crack that egg make sure it's just

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.670 
whoo crack that egg make sure it's just
the<00:02:18.770> white<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.250> yolk<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:19.730> there<00:02:19.910> no<00:02:20.720> sure

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.210 

okay<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.850> order<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.240> play<00:02:28.180> our<00:02:29.180> brains

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
okay so the order of play our brains

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.450 
okay so the order of play our brains
have<00:02:31.220> been<00:02:31.670> poaching<00:02:32.390> for<00:02:32.600> about<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> minute

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
have been poaching for about a minute

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.150 
have been poaching for about a minute
and<00:02:34.460> that<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.910> means<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.420> they<00:02:35.740> firmed<00:02:36.740> up

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
and that just means that they firmed up

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.370 
and that just means that they firmed up
a<00:02:37.670> little<00:02:38.000> bit<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:38.750> they're<00:02:38.960> easier<00:02:39.350> to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
a little bit and so they're easier to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.010 
a little bit and so they're easier to
handle<00:02:39.860> and<00:02:40.010> when<00:02:40.910> we're<00:02:41.060> panning<00:02:41.510> something

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
handle and when we're panning something

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.290 
handle and when we're panning something
there's<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.410> route<00:02:42.920> there's<00:02:43.220> an<00:02:43.340> order<00:02:43.790> it's

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
there's a route there's an order it's

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.110 
there's a route there's an order it's
flour<00:02:44.930> egg<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.830> then<00:02:46.100> breadcrumb<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
flour egg and then breadcrumb so the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.020 
flour egg and then breadcrumb so the
flour<00:02:47.390> sticks<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.650> brain<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.220> seasons<00:02:49.850> it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
flour sticks to the brain and seasons it

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.330 
flour sticks to the brain and seasons it
and<00:02:50.180> flavors<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.170> egg<00:02:51.380> then<00:02:51.770> allows<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and flavors it the egg then allows the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.100 
and flavors it the egg then allows the
bread<00:02:52.580> crumbs<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:53.030> coat<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.660> then<00:02:53.810> we<00:02:53.900> dip

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
bread crumbs to coat it and then we dip

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.320 
bread crumbs to coat it and then we dip
it<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.440> some<00:02:54.920> oil<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.400> cook<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.940> then<00:02:56.000> it's

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
it in some oil and cook it and then it's

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.710 
it in some oil and cook it and then it's
ready<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.630> go<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:57.880> gosh<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.420> goes<00:02:59.600> in<00:02:59.810> there

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
ready to go so gosh that goes in there

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.530 
ready to go so gosh that goes in there
the<00:03:02.720> brain<00:03:02.990> is<00:03:03.170> very<00:03:03.710> unusual<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.360> sense

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
the brain is very unusual in the sense

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.770 
the brain is very unusual in the sense
that<00:03:05.780> we<00:03:06.140> don't<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:06.650> eat<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:08.030> this

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
that we don't really eat it in this

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.130 
that we don't really eat it in this
country<00:03:09.680> I'm<00:03:10.070> just<00:03:10.370> going<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.520> toss<00:03:11.240> that<00:03:11.770> in

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
country I'm just going to toss that in

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.420 
country I'm just going to toss that in
there<00:03:15.140> which<00:03:15.920> now<00:03:16.250> gives<00:03:16.580> me<00:03:16.640> a<00:03:16.760> nice<00:03:17.230> sticky

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
there which now gives me a nice sticky

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.960 
there which now gives me a nice sticky
surface<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:20.920> pop<00:03:21.920> in<00:03:22.190> those<00:03:22.930> breadcrumbs<00:03:24.970> like

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
surface to pop in those breadcrumbs like

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.460 
surface to pop in those breadcrumbs like
that<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.780> get<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.560> sticking<00:03:27.920> on<00:03:28.730> my<00:03:29.360> fingers

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
that and get it sticking on my fingers

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.520 
that and get it sticking on my fingers
okay<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.400> nicely<00:03:32.180> evenly<00:03:32.600> coated<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.230> then

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
okay so nicely evenly coated and then

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.590 
okay so nicely evenly coated and then
we're<00:03:33.620> going<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.800> pop<00:03:33.980> these<00:03:34.190> in<00:03:34.490> some<00:03:35.120> oil<00:03:35.330> and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
we're going to pop these in some oil and

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.420 
we're going to pop these in some oil and
I've<00:03:35.720> chosen<00:03:35.930> vegetable<00:03:36.800> oil<00:03:37.010> although<00:03:37.220> it

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
I've chosen vegetable oil although it

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.640 
I've chosen vegetable oil although it
could<00:03:37.550> be<00:03:37.610> sunflower<00:03:38.180> if<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.420> like<00:03:38.600> just<00:03:39.560> be

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
could be sunflower if you like just be

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.820 
could be sunflower if you like just be
careful<00:03:40.040> with<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.660> spit<00:03:41.660> enos<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:42.440> goes<00:03:42.620> in

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
careful with the spit enos that goes in

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.920 
careful with the spit enos that goes in
there<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.880> what<00:03:44.060> we're<00:03:44.180> looking<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.510> do<00:03:44.750> is

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
there and what we're looking to do is

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.760 
there and what we're looking to do is
get<00:03:45.700> color<00:03:46.700> on<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.510> outside<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.380> it's<00:03:48.530> nice

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
get color on the outside so it's nice

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.130 
get color on the outside so it's nice
and<00:03:48.800> brown<00:03:49.280> but<00:03:50.000> we<00:03:50.120> want<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:50.420> retain<00:03:50.840> that

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
and brown but we want to retain that

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.090 
and brown but we want to retain that
nice<00:03:51.860> soft<00:03:52.400> center<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.420> probably<00:03:54.170> pieces<00:03:54.920> like

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
nice soft center so probably pieces like

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.350 
nice soft center so probably pieces like
that<00:03:55.130> will<00:03:55.550> take<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.790> couple<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.270> minutes

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
that will take a couple of minutes

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.570 
that will take a couple of minutes
either<00:03:56.780> side<00:03:57.140> but<00:03:57.680> we'll<00:03:57.830> just<00:03:57.860> watch<00:03:58.160> over<00:03:58.459> it

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
either side but we'll just watch over it

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.850 
either side but we'll just watch over it
make<00:03:58.700> sure<00:03:58.730> we<00:03:58.970> don't<00:03:59.090> over<00:03:59.390> do<00:03:59.510> it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.229 

so<00:04:03.860> we<00:04:03.950> get<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.100> nice<00:04:04.280> little<00:04:04.520> bit<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.880> color<00:04:05.120> on

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
so we get a nice little bit of color on

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.500 
so we get a nice little bit of color on
there<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.810> I'm<00:04:05.900> just<00:04:06.080> going<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.580> again<00:04:07.580> gentle

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
there and I'm just going to again gentle

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.820 
there and I'm just going to again gentle
operation

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
operation

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.460 
operation
tip<00:04:11.640> them<00:04:11.790> over<00:04:11.930> make<00:04:12.930> sure<00:04:13.110> that<00:04:13.230> both<00:04:13.410> sides

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
tip them over make sure that both sides

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:21.080 
tip them over make sure that both sides
are<00:04:13.970> cooked<00:04:14.970> through<00:04:19.580> about<00:04:20.580> another<00:04:20.790> minute

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
are cooked through about another minute

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.070 
are cooked through about another minute
they<00:04:21.180> should<00:04:21.360> be<00:04:21.420> done<00:04:26.420> out<00:04:27.420> with<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.690> oil<00:04:27.840> I

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
they should be done out with the oil I

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.020 
they should be done out with the oil I
think<00:04:28.890> these<00:04:29.100> are<00:04:29.160> great<00:04:29.310> on<00:04:29.550> their<00:04:29.700> own<00:04:29.730> I

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
think these are great on their own I

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.900 
think these are great on their own I
like<00:04:30.300> them<00:04:30.510> as<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:31.470> little<00:04:31.950> canopy<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> little

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
like them as a little canopy a little

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.600 
like them as a little canopy a little
starter<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:34.380> can<00:04:34.560> have<00:04:34.740> them<00:04:34.950> where<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.460> bit

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610
