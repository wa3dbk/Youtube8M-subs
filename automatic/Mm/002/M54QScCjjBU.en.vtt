00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
the parts that I need just a bit and

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.710 
the parts that I need just a bit and
yeah<00:05:47.740> that's<00:05:47.860> basically<00:05:47.979> my<00:05:48.430> all<00:05:49.330> the<00:05:49.479> pots

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
that I got some random gear and I guess

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.330 
that I got some random gear and I guess
it's<00:05:52.419> questing<00:05:53.080> sir<00:05:53.380> I<00:05:53.620> don't<00:05:53.860> really<00:05:54.100> know<00:05:54.310> I

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
it's questing sir I don't really know I

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.310 
it's questing sir I don't really know I
didn't<00:05:54.760> do<00:05:54.910> anything<00:05:55.180> with<00:05:55.450> this<00:05:55.570> step<00:05:55.840> so<00:05:56.050> far

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
didn't do anything with this step so far

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.640 
didn't do anything with this step so far
so<00:05:56.700> um<00:05:57.700> yeah<00:05:58.150> then<00:05:58.360> we<00:05:58.450> got<00:05:58.600> this<00:05:58.810> this<00:05:59.169> is<00:05:59.350> I

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
so um yeah then we got this this is I

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.130 
so um yeah then we got this this is I
know<00:06:00.130> from<00:06:00.340> scaring<00:06:00.729> that<00:06:01.210> I<00:06:01.240> used<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:01.930> do<00:06:02.110> I

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
know from scaring that I used to do I

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.630 
know from scaring that I used to do I
guess<00:06:02.550> some<00:06:03.550> other<00:06:03.880> crap<00:06:04.890> it's<00:06:05.890> into<00:06:06.250> my<00:06:06.400> bank

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
guess some other crap it's into my bank

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.630 
guess some other crap it's into my bank
is<00:06:06.850> just<00:06:07.240> basically<00:06:07.690> these<00:06:07.990> steps<00:06:08.410> when<00:06:09.280> the

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
is just basically these steps when the

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.060 
is just basically these steps when the
first<00:06:10.150> three<00:06:10.419> taps<00:06:10.720> it<00:06:10.900> is<00:06:10.990> that's<00:06:11.590> basically

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
first three taps it is that's basically

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.279 
first three taps it is that's basically
the<00:06:12.160> only<00:06:12.370> thing<00:06:12.910> like<00:06:13.180> I<00:06:13.390> got<00:06:13.690> to<00:06:13.840> fishing

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
the only thing like I got to fishing

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.320 
the only thing like I got to fishing
hurts<00:06:14.560> their<00:06:14.770> this<00:06:15.310> Cape<00:06:15.610> actually<00:06:16.060> belongs

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
hurts their this Cape actually belongs

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.600 
hurts their this Cape actually belongs
there<00:06:16.570> then<00:06:16.810> I<00:06:16.900> guess<00:06:17.110> but<00:06:17.320> yeah<00:06:18.280> this<00:06:18.460> is

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
there then I guess but yeah this is

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.510 
there then I guess but yeah this is
basically<00:06:19.120> my<00:06:19.240> bank<00:06:19.570> a<00:06:19.780> step<00:06:20.080> so<00:06:21.010> I<00:06:21.039> can<00:06:21.250> price

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
basically my bank a step so I can price

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.700 
basically my bank a step so I can price

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
still don't know anything about it so

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.500 
still don't know anything about it so
let's<00:06:35.140> just<00:06:35.380> take<00:06:35.680> all<00:06:35.890> this<00:06:36.010> crap<00:06:36.310> all<00:06:37.120> but

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
let's just take all this crap all but

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.590 
let's just take all this crap all but
one

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
one

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.080 
one
on<00:06:38.690> let's<00:06:39.560> just<00:06:39.710> take<00:06:40.010> all<00:06:40.190> this<00:06:40.370> it's<00:06:40.730> not

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
on let's just take all this it's not

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.190 
on let's just take all this it's not
much<00:06:41.360> but<00:06:41.690> might<00:06:42.650> as<00:06:42.800> well<00:06:42.920> just<00:06:43.130> take<00:06:43.280> it<00:06:44.200> my

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
much but might as well just take it my

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.010 
much but might as well just take it my
gosh<00:06:45.560> I<00:06:46.120> would<00:06:47.120> die<00:06:47.450> that<00:06:47.690> goes<00:06:47.810> in<00:06:47.960> that

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
gosh I would die that goes in that

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.570 
gosh I would die that goes in that
stupid<00:06:48.290> thing<00:06:48.440> a<00:06:48.740> lot<00:06:48.890> it<00:06:49.040> doesn't<00:06:49.070> make<00:06:49.400> any

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
stupid thing a lot it doesn't make any

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.490 
stupid thing a lot it doesn't make any
sense<00:06:50.080> um<00:06:51.700> let's<00:06:52.700> see<00:06:52.940> that<00:06:53.210> runes<00:06:53.480> those<00:06:54.260> are

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
sense um let's see that runes those are

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.950 
sense um let's see that runes those are
expensive<00:06:55.060> water<00:06:56.060> rooms<00:06:56.390> guess<00:06:56.660> those<00:06:56.840> are

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
expensive water rooms guess those are

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.090 
expensive water rooms guess those are
expensive<00:06:59.020> anything<00:07:00.020> else<00:07:00.170> so<00:07:00.530> I<00:07:00.650> guess<00:07:00.770> it's

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
expensive anything else so I guess it's

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.320 
expensive anything else so I guess it's
it<00:07:01.370> so<00:07:01.580> let's<00:07:01.760> just<00:07:02.080> let's<00:07:03.080> just<00:07:03.140> do<00:07:03.350> this<00:07:04.330> then

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
it so let's just let's just do this then

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.580 
it so let's just let's just do this then
it's<00:07:05.630> wow<00:07:06.050> it's<00:07:06.320> actually<00:07:06.440> a<00:07:06.650> lot<00:07:07.010> so<00:07:07.790> 40<00:07:08.180> mil

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
it's wow it's actually a lot so 40 mil

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.590 
it's wow it's actually a lot so 40 mil
40.6<00:07:09.590> so<00:07:09.830> that<00:07:09.950> means<00:07:10.160> 41<00:07:10.850> and<00:07:11.090> then<00:07:11.180> I<00:07:11.330> maybe

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:11.600 
40.6 so that means 41 and then I maybe

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.510 
40.6 so that means 41 and then I maybe
got<00:07:11.840> like<00:07:12.050> a<00:07:12.080> few<00:07:12.350> min<00:07:12.560> left<00:07:12.770> so<00:07:12.980> let's<00:07:13.100> make<00:07:13.490> it

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
got like a few min left so let's make it

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.550 
got like a few min left so let's make it
43<00:07:14.210> or<00:07:14.450> something<00:07:14.780> like<00:07:14.900> that<00:07:14.960> maybe<00:07:15.290> it's

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
43 or something like that maybe it's

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.160 
43 or something like that maybe it's
more<00:07:15.860> or<00:07:16.160> I<00:07:16.190> don't<00:07:16.490> know<00:07:16.640> so<00:07:17.330> let's<00:07:17.600> say<00:07:17.810> okay

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
more or I don't know so let's say okay

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.560 
more or I don't know so let's say okay
