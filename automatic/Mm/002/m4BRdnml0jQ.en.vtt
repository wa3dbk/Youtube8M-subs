is a highly polished case and that's you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.130 
is a highly polished case and that's you
know<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.460> way<00:01:47.610> they<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.540> 77

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
know that's the way they like it the 77

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.060 
know that's the way they like it the 77
51<00:01:49.790> is<00:01:50.790> built<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> 77<00:01:51.990> 50<00:01:52.350> chronograph<00:01:52.860> so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
51 is built on the 77 50 chronograph so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.100 
51 is built on the 77 50 chronograph so
it<00:01:53.159> isn't<00:01:53.430> automatic<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.930> funny

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it isn't automatic and it's funny

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.359 
it isn't automatic and it's funny
because<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.250> know

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
because you can see there that you know

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.039 
because you can see there that you know
the<00:01:56.579> size<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> movement<00:01:57.450> compares<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the size of the movement compares to the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.700 
the size of the movement compares to the
case<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.390> movement<00:02:00.689> has<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> 12<00:02:01.590> hour

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
case so the movement has a 12 hour

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.240 
case so the movement has a 12 hour
chronograph<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> has<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.469> moon<00:02:05.009> phase

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
chronograph and then it has a moon phase

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.850 
chronograph and then it has a moon phase
indicator<00:02:06.020> then<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.439> has<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
indicator then here it has a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.600 
indicator then here it has a
synchronized<00:02:08.640> 24-hour<00:02:09.270> hand<00:02:10.129> along<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
synchronized 24-hour hand along with the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.230 
synchronized 24-hour hand along with the
subsidiary<00:02:12.209> second<00:02:12.629> style<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
subsidiary second style and

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.080 
subsidiary second style and
that's<00:02:13.360> basically<00:02:13.990> an<00:02:14.170> ampm<00:02:14.410> indicator<00:02:15.100> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
that's basically an ampm indicator and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.790 
that's basically an ampm indicator and
then<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:16.300> have<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.690> day<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.380> week<00:02:17.410> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
then you have a day of the week and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.010 
then you have a day of the week and
month<00:02:18.340> indicator<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.150> then<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.870> has<00:02:19.990> a

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
month indicator and then it has a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.800 
month indicator and then it has a
peripheral<00:02:20.560> date<00:02:21.220> indicator<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.390> problem

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
peripheral date indicator the problem

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.750 
peripheral date indicator the problem
with<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.990> 77051<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.160> point<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.550> past

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
with the 77051 is that point on the past

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.550 
with the 77051 is that point on the past
is<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.830> it's<00:02:26.830> very<00:02:27.040> very<00:02:27.250> hard<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.580> balance

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
is that it's very very hard to balance

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.200 
is that it's very very hard to balance
the<00:02:29.560> dial<00:02:29.830> because<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.580> all<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.940> stuff

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
the dial because you have all this stuff

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.090 
the dial because you have all this stuff

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
kind of to the left and then there's a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.490 
kind of to the left and then there's a
big<00:02:33.280> empty<00:02:33.610> space<00:02:33.790> right<00:02:34.270> here<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.960> what<00:02:35.380> earng

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
big empty space right here so what earng

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.170

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.670 
see that this is a this wears a little
bit<00:03:48.160> larger<00:03:48.610> not<00:03:49.450> just<00:03:49.690> because<00:03:49.990> it's<00:03:50.140> 47

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
bit larger not just because it's 47

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.110 
bit larger not just because it's 47
millimeters<00:03:50.890> wide<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:51.490> also<00:03:51.610> because<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
millimeters wide but also because the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.830 
millimeters wide but also because the
lugs<00:03:52.360> stick<00:03:52.960> out<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.170> little<00:03:53.320> bit<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:55.510> may<00:03:55.810> be

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
lugs stick out a little bit so it may be

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.960 
lugs stick out a little bit so it may be
a<00:03:56.020> little<00:03:56.350> bit<00:03:56.470> too<00:03:56.650> large<00:03:56.860> for<00:03:57.220> my<00:03:57.370> wrist<00:03:57.670> or

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
a little bit too large for my wrist or

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.070 
a little bit too large for my wrist or
maybe<00:03:58.000> it's<00:03:58.420> fine

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
maybe it's fine

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.200 
maybe it's fine
I<00:03:59.110> think<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.740> if<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.890> lugs<00:04:00.130> sloped<00:04:00.910> down<00:04:01.180> a

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
I think that if the lugs sloped down a

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.550 
I think that if the lugs sloped down a
little<00:04:01.450> bit<00:04:01.570> more<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:01.900> look<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.170> little<00:04:02.380> bit

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
little bit more and look a little bit

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.080 
little bit more and look a little bit
better<00:04:02.680> on<00:04:02.920> my<00:04:03.070> wrist<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.460> do<00:04:03.520> have<00:04:03.790> smaller

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
better on my wrist I do have smaller

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.910 
better on my wrist I do have smaller
wrists<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:04.600> if<00:04:05.020> you<00:04:05.110> are<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.260> bigger<00:04:05.440> guy<00:04:05.650> you're

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
wrists so if you are a bigger guy you're

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.310 
wrists so if you are a bigger guy you're
