form factor and the others still

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.469 
form factor and the others still

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.289 
speculate that there will be two
variants<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.350> phone<00:01:27.560> which<00:01:28.159> is<00:01:28.369> why<00:01:29.029> they

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
variants of the phone which is why they

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.870 
variants of the phone which is why they
might<00:01:29.479> be<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.959> actually<00:01:30.409> release<00:01:31.219> days<00:01:31.579> that

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
might be to actually release days that

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.989 
might be to actually release days that
LG<00:01:32.179> is<00:01:32.240> having<00:01:32.599> on<00:01:32.749> me<00:01:32.929> 27<00:01:33.859> and<00:01:34.039> 28<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.789> maybe

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
LG is having on me 27 and 28 so maybe

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.879 
LG is having on me 27 and 28 so maybe
one<00:01:35.599> will<00:01:35.689> come<00:01:35.869> out<00:01:36.020> on<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.259> twenty-seventh

some have been calling it the iphone air
and<00:01:53.419> unlike<00:01:53.779> the<00:01:53.810> g3<00:01:54.469> rumors<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.310> concepts

have<00:01:56.029> been<00:01:56.209> like<00:01:56.450> floating<00:01:56.959> around<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
have been like floating around the

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.309 
have been like floating around the
entire<00:01:57.799> internet<00:01:58.399> filled<00:01:59.090> with<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.509> iphone<00:01:59.929> 6

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
or the iphone air and i think it's

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.139 
or the iphone air and i think it's
pretty<00:02:03.529> idea<00:02:03.950> but<00:02:04.130> say<00:02:04.279> that<00:02:04.489> the<00:02:04.579> iphone<00:02:04.939> 6

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
pretty idea but say that the iphone 6

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.080 
pretty idea but say that the iphone 6
will<00:02:05.359> come<00:02:05.539> in<00:02:05.659> two<00:02:05.869> variants<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.789> 4.7<00:02:07.789> inch

their<00:02:15.750> new<00:02:15.870> flagship<00:02:16.440> phone<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.670> assume

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
their new flagship phone so I assume

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.060 
their new flagship phone so I assume
that<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.570> new<00:02:18.690> flagship<00:02:19.140> will<00:02:19.320> be<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.680> lot

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
that the new flagship will be a lot

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.640 
that the new flagship will be a lot
thinner<00:02:20.400> than<00:02:21.060> their<00:02:21.540> lives<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.050> generation

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
thinner than their lives of generation

thinner than their lives of generation

an<00:02:28.140> iphone<00:02:28.350> as<00:02:28.950> my<00:02:29.280> primary<00:02:29.490> device<00:02:30.120> but

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
an iphone as my primary device but

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.240 
an iphone as my primary device but
considering<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.500> iphone<00:02:31.860> 6<00:02:32.070> is

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
considering that the iphone 6 is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.800 
considering that the iphone 6 is
actually<00:02:32.670> increasing<00:02:32.940> their<00:02:33.240> screen<00:02:33.570> size

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
actually increasing their screen size

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.610 
actually increasing their screen size
and<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.380> love<00:02:34.770> pixels<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.940> really<00:02:36.720> love<00:02:36.900> pixels<00:02:37.380> I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.800 
and I love pixels I really love pixels I
think<00:02:38.310> actually<00:02:38.490> might<00:02:38.850> consider<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.450> iphone

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
think actually might consider the iphone

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.230 
think actually might consider the iphone
6<00:02:40.080> at<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.560> time<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.060> new

6 at this time just because of the new
screen<00:02:42.750> size<00:02:42.990> it's<00:02:43.320> definitely<00:02:43.860> something<00:02:44.100> to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
screen size it's definitely something to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.210

but i'm frankly fine with that i will

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.010 
but i'm frankly fine with that i will
say<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.250> does<00:02:59.430> look<00:02:59.610> like<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.880> Oppo<00:03:00.210> 57<00:03:00.840> a

Google's<00:03:54.000> Project<00:03:54.330> are<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.590> do<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.890> to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
Google's Project are and I do have to

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.199 
Google's Project are and I do have to
set<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.310> record<00:03:56.430> straight<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:56.880> it's

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
set the record straight that it's

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.180 
set the record straight that it's
actually<00:03:57.510> not<00:03:57.959> going<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.410> be<00:03:58.530> released<00:03:58.860> this

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
actually not going to be released this

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.449 
actually not going to be released this
year<00:03:59.250> but<00:03:59.670> actually<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.300> in<00:04:00.450> January<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.459> 2015

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
year but actually in in January of 2015

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.970 
year but actually in in January of 2015
but<00:04:03.239> it's<00:04:03.450> been<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:04.050> lot<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.290> production<00:04:04.860> and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
but it's been in a lot of production and

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.100 
but it's been in a lot of production and
publicity<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:06.180> year<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.630> think<00:04:06.750> it's<00:04:06.989> only

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
publicity this year so I think it's only

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.380 
publicity this year so I think it's only
fair<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.440> include<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.980> into<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.580> list<00:04:09.000> and

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
fair to include it into this list and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.150 
fair to include it into this list and
for<00:04:09.989> those<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.380> don't<00:04:10.560> know<00:04:10.620> what<00:04:10.769> project
