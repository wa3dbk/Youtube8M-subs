00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
shots and to simulate certain lenses I

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.710 
shots and to simulate certain lenses I
was<00:02:18.620> really<00:02:18.950> hoping<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.519> we<00:02:20.299> could<00:02:20.480> go<00:02:20.659> to

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
was really hoping that we could go to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.899 
was really hoping that we could go to
all<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.680> locations<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.400> Highlander

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
all of the locations in Highlander

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.780 
all of the locations in Highlander
including<00:02:23.900> Rome<00:02:24.110> but<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:25.010> visit<00:02:25.310> all<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.459> them

including Rome but to visit all of them

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.750 
including Rome but to visit all of them
would<00:02:26.390> honestly<00:02:26.599> have<00:02:27.019> taken<00:02:27.379> years<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.950> think

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
would honestly have taken years I think

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.369
