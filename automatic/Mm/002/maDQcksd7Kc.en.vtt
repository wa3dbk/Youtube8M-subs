00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.810
 yes, I am at the company crown 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.029
 in spelle and next to me is benedikt 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.349
 shepherd 2 benedict welcome 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.700
 I'm allowed to broich a bit today 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.279
 I have the audience 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.989
 just said it will be big and which 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.640
 Today , everything works 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.920
 especially in view of themselves were 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.540
 Feldberg from the company crown me 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.600
 now in performance classes 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.180
 between 480 and 1100 ps 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.559
 making it the strongest land machine in the world 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.940
 world can say what hexel tx everything 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.680
 So first and foremost, of course 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 around grass and corn 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.900
 So I speak feed for the cows 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.610
 or for the bullmast and 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.379
 which is now more and more come to it 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.309
 clear 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.930
 tell me something in the field 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.519
 Renewable energies are therefore only starting 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.190
 Plant whole green space like once 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.680
 Of course, one knows here in the region 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.200
 and of course everything else 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.420
 Water supply here very risky 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.100
 So I'd say the special fruits 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.299
 to take but a first line goes 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 first around grass and corn 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.450
 okay we are here before the second 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.950
 training and want us now as 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.509
 next time the production of samples 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.509
 I also like everything clear 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.509
 apparently the holy production halls 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.740
 here so here comes the whole 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.810
 together here is the bix 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.109
 assembled yes what span 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.729
 actually have them after that? 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:02.110
 working widths of corn bitten lie in the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.209
 moment between 450 and she does not because 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.319
 then at the same time every fifth 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.229
 but went to make four 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.450
 who are actually the main buyers? 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.239
 the largest haxter markets worldwide 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.620
 Actually , the usa is in first place 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.739
 afterwards from germany france 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.739
 England is a very big market and 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.180
 not to forget russia and now in 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.280
 The last few years are growing more and more 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.840
 Chinese market for us as well 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.860
 the one with note and alone but 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.160
 actually for all Western European 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.709
 manufacturer is because this catchword 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.940
 this is still a concept made in germany 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.500
 nowadays half of it 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.780
 year in the usa has one 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.519
 Pre- clock made and the name made in 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.260
 germany pulls that is already something 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.000
 you also see a lot 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.470
 German technology reason was not only 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.319
 in the field of agricultural technology but also because 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.319
 in cars in the field of plant construction and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.120
 So to speak that is so normal son 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.720
 really look at the near 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.720
 for maria 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.630
 which but damn motor 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.630
 from Herne is the heart of the machine 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.750
 this is the engine of the company we build 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.490
 v8 engines twelve years ago 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.110
 and then depending on the model depending on the model 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.390
 from 600 to 1100 hp v12 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.820
 1100 of it in the cargo area is the am 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.830
 visit the farm monthly how much corn 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.990
 Can I be in a witch like voice 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.940
 So get it now I have 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.030
 talking about his 1100 there are customer at 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.840
 on average we manage 330 tons 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.430
 in the hour 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.530
 so if the hackers finish here 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.420
 is mounted then that's all right 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.490
 the end then goes to the hall between 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.230
 Between all is an end of line 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.750
 test bench now mounted we have 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.580
 now a process of violence and thus the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.560
 machine quasi on the increasing checks 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.400
 I 'm assuming that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.400
 I do not pass the test 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.360
 here are now in the control room 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.250
 from our test bench already understood 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.290
 thought here test is virtually all 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.850
 functions of the machine once off when 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.770
 now about the individual wheel hub motors 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.750
 can simulate different driving modes 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.940
 speak whether the machine goes uphill ob 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.050
 she endangers her if she sleeps speak 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.520
 the tires turn differently 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.220
 fast 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.200
 and yes the whole test lasts 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.269
 about four hours so like the machine 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.460
 here on heart and kidney creatively with 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.770
 Full throttle and full braking is just that 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.600
 all subjects tested and gentleman there 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.760
 said four hours of 200 individual tests 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.410
 make and then the machine can then 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.760
 After passing the exam can be social 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.130
 machines and be loaded 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.970
 to the entrepreneur in Germany and the 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.320
 usa in france or otherwise like that 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.880
 Do you make the test I mean 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.270
 it is clear safety is going on and that 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.770
 thing to work for but but it works 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.000
 is just only a special machine that 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.590
 means we have very limited end 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.520
 period of worth must always 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.160
 can rely on that the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.680
 Machine runs in very short time 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.360
 that's why we're doing the tests and now 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.090
 almost simulate eleven with it 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.410
 kilometers of roads and five hectares 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.850
 suitable surface that is an extra 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.310
 thinks he already has five hectares of corn 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.900
 chopped up and we can do so very much 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.410
 to rule out many mistakes in advance 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.890
 the country seemed entrepreneur then 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.180
 ready for action and above all 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.880
 working reliably 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.120
 function 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.300
 you are a fan I could do that 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.980
 Foil exceptionally no problem we 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.420
 drive to the training center if 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.490
 one from earlier as promised that is 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.230
 now very biggs 480 he has got said 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.360
 yellow test ride so if you want 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.070
 have strong one off you go so 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.420
 just so yes that was so is completely 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.190
 simply I 'm definitely with 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.330
 shown that how that works and 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.700
 then it starts 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.420
 Trust is nothing like 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.420
 will be going on 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.520
 very easy what a pitty 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.110
 I have fun myself 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.610
 thank you very much today 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.840
 could not breathe in here 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.350
 problem you see yourself again 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.330
 and then it goes to the bix 1100 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.810
 example taken for example and thus 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.810
 back
