00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
bathroom so we're gonna look at three

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.959 
bathroom so we're gonna look at three
different<00:00:10.920> options<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.519> first<00:00:11.730> one<00:00:11.880> is

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
different options and the first one is

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.280 
different options and the first one is
one<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.360> really<00:00:12.540> like<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
one that we really like and it's the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.660 
one that we really like and it's the
most<00:00:13.469> elaborate<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.160> when<00:00:14.339> you've<00:00:14.490> actually

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
most elaborate it's when you've actually

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.220 
most elaborate it's when you've actually
got<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> separate<00:00:15.389> tub<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> separate<00:00:16.170> shower

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:18.239 
you've got a tub deck and what we

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.540 
you've got a tub deck and what we
recommend<00:00:18.989> is<00:00:19.110> just<00:00:19.169> extend<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.160> tub<00:00:20.399> deck

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
recommend is just extend that tub deck

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.479 
recommend is just extend that tub deck
an<00:00:20.700> extra<00:00:21.029> 15<00:00:21.570> 16<00:00:22.079> inches<00:00:22.410> out<00:00:22.919> like<00:00:23.279> that

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:23.489 
an extra 15 16 inches out like that

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.030 
an extra 15 16 inches out like that
bring<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:24.090> top<00:00:24.329> the<00:00:24.540> glass<00:00:24.809> in<00:00:25.140> there<00:00:25.770> and

bring the top the glass in there and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.220 
bring the top the glass in there and
what<00:00:26.430> you've<00:00:26.610> done<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.759> enclose<00:00:27.329> that<00:00:27.360> portion

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
what you've done is enclose that portion

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.720 
what you've done is enclose that portion
of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> tub<00:00:28.649> deck<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.040> it<00:00:29.130> forms<00:00:29.399> a<00:00:29.489> great

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
of the tub deck and it forms a great

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.120 
of the tub deck and it forms a great
bench<00:00:30.239> yeah<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.169> very<00:00:31.380> sort<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.710> seamless

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
bench yeah it's a very sort of seamless

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.800 
bench yeah it's a very sort of seamless
detail<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.300> creates<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> lot

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
detail because it really creates a lot

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.480 
detail because it really creates a lot
of<00:00:33.900> transparency<00:00:34.290> between<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.890> shower<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
of transparency between the shower and

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.160 
of transparency between the shower and
the<00:00:35.880> bathtub<00:00:36.060> itself<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.870> one

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the bathtub itself there is one

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.260 
the bathtub itself there is one
important<00:00:37.710> construction<00:00:38.190> detail<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.150> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
important construction detail that you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
important construction detail that you
do<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.930> aware<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
do have to be aware of and that is that

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.680 
do have to be aware of and that is that
the<00:00:41.070> bench<00:00:41.340> portion<00:00:42.030> within<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.450> shower

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the bench portion within the shower

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.870 
the bench portion within the shower
needs<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.470> have<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.650> slight<00:00:44.070> slope<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
needs to have a slight slope to it so

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.400 
needs to have a slight slope to it so
you<00:00:44.970> don't<00:00:45.060> have<00:00:45.270> water<00:00:45.630> sitting<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.200> top<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
you don't have water sitting on top of

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
you don't have water sitting on top of
your<00:00:46.590> tile<00:00:46.890> which<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.490> a<00:00:47.520> good<00:00:47.790> idea<00:00:47.820> now

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
your tile which is not a good idea now

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.980 
your tile which is not a good idea now
if<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:48.960> possible<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:50.780> slightly<00:00:51.780> less

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
if that's not possible or slightly less

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.690

commit to the idea of a bench in their
shower<00:01:08.370> because<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.240> doesn't<00:01:09.659> take<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
shower because it doesn't take up that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
shower because it doesn't take up that
space<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.740> lot<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> shower<00:01:11.250> stalls

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
space and I know a lot of shower stalls

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.980 
space and I know a lot of shower stalls
people<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:12.000> tight<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.240> space<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.840> gives

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
people are tight on space so it gives

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.450 
people are tight on space so it gives
you<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.200> option<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:13.830> flexibility

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you're going to sit down on this thing

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.180 
you're going to sit down on this thing
and<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> give<00:01:25.830> way<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.070> you're

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
and it's going to give way and you're

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.160 
and it's going to give way and you're
gonna<00:01:26.280> end<00:01:26.370> up<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.909> bottom<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.870> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
gonna end up on the bottom of the of the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.880 
gonna end up on the bottom of the of the
shower<00:01:28.409> pads

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
shower pads

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
shower pads
yes<00:01:29.060> isolationist<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
yes isolationist you get the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.149 
yes isolationist you get the
installation<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.409> yeah<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.799> key<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
installation right yeah it's key and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
installation right yeah it's key and
then<00:01:32.250> finally<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.510> lowest<00:01:33.960> risk

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
then finally this is the the lowest risk

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.920 
then finally this is the the lowest risk
sort<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.770> option<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> bench<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> by

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
sort of option for a bench this is by

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
sort of option for a bench this is by
Atlanta<00:01:37.590> teak<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.430> also<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.700> teak<00:01:38.970> bench

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
Atlanta teak and it's also a teak bench

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.820 
Atlanta teak and it's also a teak bench
but<00:01:39.330> it's<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.540> free-standing<00:01:39.900> version<00:01:40.710> they're

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
but it's a free-standing version they're

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.500 
but it's a free-standing version they're
very<00:01:41.040> nicely<00:01:41.280> crafted<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.180> fit<00:01:42.360> into

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
very nicely crafted they just fit into

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.060 
very nicely crafted they just fit into
the<00:01:42.659> corner<00:01:42.960> either<00:01:43.110> square<00:01:43.409> or<00:01:43.590> rectangular

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the corner either square or rectangular

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
the corner either square or rectangular
and<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.760> that's<00:01:44.939> an<00:01:45.119> idea<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.600> somebody<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and so that's an idea for somebody that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
and so that's an idea for somebody that
wants<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> flexibility<00:01:46.890> oh<00:01:47.010> your<00:01:47.189> finger<00:01:47.540> but

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
wants the flexibility oh your finger but

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.539 
wants the flexibility oh your finger but
but<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.650> is<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> good<00:01:49.950> example<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
but here and this is a good example you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.100 
but here and this is a good example you
want<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.880> make<00:01:51.030> sure<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.570> shower<00:01:51.810> is

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
want to make sure that your shower is

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
want to make sure that your shower is
actually<00:01:52.530> large<00:01:52.860> enough<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.400> accommodate<00:01:53.700> one

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
actually large enough to accommodate one

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850 
actually large enough to accommodate one
of<00:01:54.540> these<00:01:54.689> things<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.799> would

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
of these things if it's not and I would

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.890 
of these things if it's not and I would
say<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.700> getting<00:01:57.000> right<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> edge<00:01:57.720> of

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
say this is getting right on the edge of

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.270 
say this is getting right on the edge of
where<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.229> actually<00:01:58.530> becoming<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
where it's actually becoming a bit of a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.429 
where it's actually becoming a bit of a
dangerous<00:01:59.729> hazard<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.750> something<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
dangerous hazard to have something of

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.800 
dangerous hazard to have something of
that<00:02:01.619> size<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.640> smaller<00:02:03.000> shower<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.659> can

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that size in that smaller shower it can

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.179 
that size in that smaller shower it can
just<00:02:03.960> get<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.259> little<00:02:04.409> dangerous<00:02:04.619> right<00:02:05.009> so

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
just get a little dangerous right so

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.649 
just get a little dangerous right so
remember<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.580> shower<00:02:05.790> bench<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.180> great<00:02:06.479> way

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
remember a shower bench is a great way

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.539 
remember a shower bench is a great way
to<00:02:06.720> increase<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> efficiency<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:08.129> function

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
to increase the efficiency and function

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.529 
to increase the efficiency and function
of<00:02:08.670> your<00:02:08.789> shower<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> need<00:02:09.329> to<00:02:09.389> make<00:02:09.509> sure

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
of your shower but you need to make sure

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.029 
of your shower but you need to make sure
you<00:02:09.749> have<00:02:09.899> enough<00:02:10.079> space<00:02:10.409> and<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.829> they're

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
you have enough space and that they're

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:20.140 
you have enough space and that they're
installed<00:02:11.609> properly<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.569> next<00:02:12.749> time

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150
