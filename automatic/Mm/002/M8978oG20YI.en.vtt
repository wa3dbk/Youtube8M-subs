00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.370 
break the next match you said 620 or 18
20<00:00:28.460> depending<00:00:29.210> where<00:00:29.630> exactly<00:00:29.900> you<00:00:30.140> live<00:00:30.259> in

the<00:00:30.439> world<00:00:30.669> Eve<00:00:31.669> time<00:00:31.939> but<00:00:32.630> before<00:00:32.840> we<00:00:33.079> go<00:00:33.850> that

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
the world Eve time but before we go that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.460 
the world Eve time but before we go that
was<00:00:34.970> a<00:00:35.000> pretty<00:00:35.360> good<00:00:35.480> Vincent<00:00:35.930> went<00:00:36.050> for<00:00:36.230> hydro

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
was a pretty good Vincent went for hydro

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.530 
was a pretty good Vincent went for hydro
Arthur<00:00:36.739> I<00:00:36.950> think<00:00:37.670> this<00:00:37.820> is<00:00:37.970> actually<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.360> good

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
Arthur I think this is actually a good

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.690 
Arthur I think this is actually a good
example<00:00:39.140> of<00:00:39.290> we<00:00:39.739> were<00:00:39.860> talking<00:00:40.250> about<00:00:40.340> the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
example of we were talking about the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700 
example of we were talking about the
electronic<00:00:41.210> attack<00:00:41.329> frigates<00:00:42.020> just<00:00:42.350> before

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
electronic attack frigates just before

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.100 
electronic attack frigates just before
this<00:00:42.860> match<00:00:43.190> here<00:00:43.880> we<00:00:44.030> saw<00:00:44.210> two<00:00:44.450> teams<00:00:44.780> both

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
this match here we saw two teams both

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.840 
this match here we saw two teams both
with<00:00:45.410> demps<00:00:45.830> those<00:00:46.040> strikes<00:00:46.370> were<00:00:46.610> probably

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
with demps those strikes were probably

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.610 
with demps those strikes were probably
damn<00:00:47.270> fit<00:00:47.510> on<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:47.780> unaffiliated<00:00:48.140> theme

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
damn fit on the unaffiliated theme

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.740 
damn fit on the unaffiliated theme
however<00:00:49.040> since<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.000> electronic<00:00:50.630> attack

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
however since the electronic attack

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.810 
however since the electronic attack
frigates<00:00:51.380> lock<00:00:51.620> faster<00:00:51.980> they<00:00:52.340> were<00:00:52.400> able<00:00:52.610> to

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
frigates lock faster they were able to

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.120 
frigates lock faster they were able to
damp<00:00:53.600> those<00:00:53.870> out<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.350> competition<00:00:54.650> and

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
damp those out of the competition and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.430 
damp those out of the competition and
therefore<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:56.390> was<00:00:56.540> smooth<00:00:56.930> sailing<00:00:56.960> from

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
therefore it was smooth sailing from

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.120 
therefore it was smooth sailing from
there<00:00:57.530> running<00:00:57.980> yeah<00:00:58.700> it<00:00:59.000> pretty<00:00:59.240> much<00:00:59.360> was<00:01:00.130> so

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
there running yeah it pretty much was so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.770 
there running yeah it pretty much was so
we<00:01:01.310> had<00:01:02.080> we<00:01:03.080> had<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.260> few<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:05.180> wasn't<00:01:05.600> really

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
we had we had a few it wasn't really

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.440 
we had we had a few it wasn't really
close<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.320> was<00:01:06.439> pretty<00:01:06.590> much<00:01:06.740> just<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.790> full<00:01:08.330> out

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
close it was pretty much just a full out

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.020 
close it was pretty much just a full out
route<00:01:08.750> was<00:01:09.259> it<00:01:09.409> just<00:01:09.439> a<00:01:09.770> rush<00:01:10.280> set<00:01:10.729> up<00:01:10.850> on

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
route was it just a rush set up on

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.490 
route was it just a rush set up on
behalf<00:01:11.329> of<00:01:11.479> Hydra<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.990> just<00:01:12.200> worked

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
behalf of Hydra that just worked

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.039 
behalf of Hydra that just worked
entirely<00:01:13.009> well<00:01:13.310> without<00:01:13.820> no<00:01:14.030> counter<00:01:14.329> it

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
entirely well without no counter it

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.929 
entirely well without no counter it
wasn't<00:01:15.320> really<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.590> rush<00:01:15.890> setup<00:01:16.340> bad<00:01:16.610> because

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
wasn't really a rush setup bad because

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.760 
wasn't really a rush setup bad because
they<00:01:17.119> had<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.450> damping<00:01:18.080> frigates<00:01:18.440> who<00:01:18.620> of

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
they had the damping frigates who of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.500 
they had the damping frigates who of
course<00:01:18.980> will<00:01:19.310> be<00:01:19.340> running<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.909> opposite<00:01:20.300> way

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
course will be running the opposite way

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.180 
course will be running the opposite way
of<00:01:20.780> anything<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:21.440> can<00:01:21.620> do<00:01:21.740> any<00:01:21.920> damage

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
of anything that can do any damage

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.430 
of anything that can do any damage
whatsoever<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:24.140> would<00:01:24.320> have<00:01:24.409> been

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
whatsoever it would have been

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.110 
whatsoever it would have been
interesting<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:25.100> see<00:01:25.250> how<00:01:25.430> those<00:01:25.610> slip<00:01:25.880> nears

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
interesting to see how those slip nears

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.790 
interesting to see how those slip nears
were<00:01:26.300> set<00:01:26.540> up<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.900> it<00:01:27.050> sound<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.409> little<00:01:27.590> bit

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
were set up that it sound a little bit

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.590 
were set up that it sound a little bit
like<00:01:27.950> artillery's<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.760> don't<00:01:28.940> I<00:01:29.120> didn't<00:01:29.450> see

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
like artillery's I don't I didn't see

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.070 
like artillery's I don't I didn't see
the<00:01:29.810> field<00:01:30.200> there<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:30.950> those<00:01:31.310> were<00:01:31.610> perhaps

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
the field there so those were perhaps

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.690 
the field there so those were perhaps
autocannon<00:01:33.080> fed<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.770> more<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.370> a<00:01:34.490> typical

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
autocannon fed and more of a typical

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.990 
autocannon fed and more of a typical
rush<00:01:35.650> in<00:01:36.650> unaffiliated<00:01:37.010> really<00:01:37.580> seem<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.880> have

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
rush in unaffiliated really seem to have

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.790 
rush in unaffiliated really seem to have
any<00:01:38.150> tackling<00:01:38.960> or<00:01:39.110> anything<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.470> was<00:01:39.680> going

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
any tackling or anything that was going

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.800 
any tackling or anything that was going
to<00:01:39.950> really<00:01:40.250> control<00:01:40.790> range<00:01:41.060> on<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.330> field<00:01:41.540> so

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
to really control range on the field so

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.570 
to really control range on the field so
hydrated<00:01:42.530> disco<00:01:42.740> where<00:01:42.890> was<00:01:43.340> most

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
hydrated disco where was most

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.600 
hydrated disco where was most
comfortable<00:01:44.000> for<00:01:44.060> them<00:01:45.010> mr.<00:01:46.010> seemed<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.460> me

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
comfortable for them mr. seemed to me

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.280 
comfortable for them mr. seemed to me
that<00:01:46.820> they<00:01:47.180> were<00:01:47.240> just<00:01:47.540> like<00:01:47.690> running<00:01:48.080> around

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
that they were just like running around

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.460 
that they were just like running around
in<00:01:48.440> confusion<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:49.430> panicking<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.320> really

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
in confusion is panicking this is really

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.110 
in confusion is panicking this is really
disappointing<00:01:51.710> for<00:01:52.190> me<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.670> sounds<00:01:53.090> like

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
disappointing for me it sounds like

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.530 
disappointing for me it sounds like
looking<00:01:53.690> for<00:01:53.810> them<00:01:53.930> yeah<00:01:54.560> alright<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:55.790> we've

looking for them yeah alright so we've

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.120 
looking for them yeah alright so we've
had<00:01:56.750> two<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.229> really<00:01:57.409> really<00:01:57.650> hard<00:01:57.890> core

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
had two of the really really hard core

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.130 
had two of the really really hard core
groups<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:59.479> ended<00:01:59.750> up<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.900> little<00:02:00.049> bit
