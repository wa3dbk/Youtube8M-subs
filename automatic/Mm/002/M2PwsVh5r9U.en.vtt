00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and all across the tower straight from

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.819 
and all across the tower straight from
here<00:00:51.090> straight<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> top<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.649> have

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
here straight up to the top we have

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.240 
here straight up to the top we have
invisible<00:00:53.489> blocks<00:00:54.079> steel<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.739> girders

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
invisible blocks steel or the girders

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.160 
invisible blocks steel or the girders
they<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:57.059> still<00:00:57.300> show<00:00:57.510> through<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.050> for

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
they they still show through but for

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.860 
they they still show through but for
some<00:00:58.350> reason<00:00:58.739> any<00:00:58.949> wood<00:00:59.789> based<00:01:00.210> block<00:01:00.539> is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
some reason any wood based block is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
some reason any wood based block is
invisible<00:01:01.260> stone<00:01:01.890> does<00:01:02.370> work<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.820> capped<00:01:03.059> off

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
invisible stone does work we capped off

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.719 
invisible stone does work we capped off
the<00:01:03.300> top<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:03.899> stone<00:01:04.220> but<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.519> little

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the top of some stone but it's a little

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.420 
the top of some stone but it's a little
bit<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.210> unusual<00:01:06.420> phenomenon<00:01:07.130> yeah<00:01:08.130> then

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
bit of an unusual phenomenon yeah then

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.240 
bit of an unusual phenomenon yeah then
you<00:01:08.820> put<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> down<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:10.010> my<00:01:11.010> deep

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you put it down to is just my deep

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.330 
you put it down to is just my deep
graphical<00:01:11.820> change<00:01:12.119> order<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:13.280> lobster<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
graphical change order to a lobster the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.910 
graphical change order to a lobster the
regular<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.970> side<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.650> would

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
regular one side that's not all we would

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
regular one side that's not all we would
enough<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:18.119> broke<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> game<00:01:18.830> pretty<00:01:19.830> much

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
enough we broke the game pretty much

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.490 
enough we broke the game pretty much
which<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.180> quite<00:01:21.420> happy<00:01:21.509> about<00:01:21.720> well<00:01:22.350> there

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
which I'm quite happy about well there

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.890 
which I'm quite happy about well there
was<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> intention<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> break<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> game's

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.859 

infinity<00:01:28.759> how<00:01:29.759> kind<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.060> looks<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.450> weird<00:01:30.659> from

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
infinity how kind of looks so weird from

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.780 
infinity how kind of looks so weird from
down<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:32.509> that's<00:01:33.509> pretty<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.259> good

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
down here that's pretty pretty good

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.240 
down here that's pretty pretty good
alright<00:01:35.850> head<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.360> up

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.490 

it's<00:01:41.250> got<00:01:42.439> 27<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.590> functional<00:01:44.430> floors<00:01:44.820> um<00:01:45.659> -

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it's got 27 on functional floors um -

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.920 
it's got 27 on functional floors um -
like<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.490> couple<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.909> interior<00:01:48.299> floors<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> all

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
like a couple of interior floors and all

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.230 
like a couple of interior floors and all
Lobby<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> supplied<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.820> as<00:01:50.970> big<00:01:51.119> as

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
Lobby and supplied so it's not as big as

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.850 
Lobby and supplied so it's not as big as
I'd<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.110> pretty<00:01:52.350> impressive

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I'd like but it's pretty impressive

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.580 
I'd like but it's pretty impressive
so<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.610> let's<00:01:54.600> head<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> service<00:01:55.290> area

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
so I let's head up the service area

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.179 
so I let's head up the service area
first

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
first

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.600 
first
I<00:01:56.689> think<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.020> floor<00:01:58.729> yeah

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
I think it's on this floor yeah

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.910 
I think it's on this floor yeah
so<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.420> obviously<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:02.020> graphical<00:02:02.470> tear

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
so this is obviously a graphical tear

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.160 
so this is obviously a graphical tear
still<00:02:03.250> it<00:02:03.460> goes<00:02:03.640> all<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.880> way<00:02:03.970> through<00:02:10.170> found

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
still it goes all the way through found

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.280 
still it goes all the way through found
it<00:02:14.850> but<00:02:15.850> there<00:02:16.000> are<00:02:16.120> bare<00:02:16.450> floors<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.080> there's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
it but there are bare floors but there's

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.040 
it but there are bare floors but there's
also<00:02:17.440> people's<00:02:18.430> own<00:02:18.670> customized<00:02:19.330> floors<00:02:19.720> so

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
also people's own customized floors so

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.610 
also people's own customized floors so
that<00:02:20.410> there's<00:02:20.680> wide<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.460> lot<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.910> stuff<00:02:22.090> over

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
that there's wide a lot of stuff over

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.450 
that there's wide a lot of stuff over

to<00:03:39.410> try<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.040> complete<00:03:40.730> whole<00:03:41.030> complex<00:03:41.420> might

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
to try and complete whole complex might

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.780 
to try and complete whole complex might
be<00:03:42.440> easier<00:03:42.739> once<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:43.010> World<00:03:43.160> Editor<00:03:43.340> comes

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
be easier once the World Editor comes

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:54.280 
be easier once the World Editor comes

could bungee while making a base jump

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.230 
could bungee while making a base jump
off<00:07:28.320> the<00:07:28.470> side<00:07:28.620> of<00:07:28.680> this<00:07:28.830> thing
