HD ROM likes on the all GGT model so my

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.120 
HD ROM likes on the all GGT model so my
phone<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.769> d800<00:00:13.769> MT<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.400> course<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.619> partes<00:00:16.619> HD

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
phone is d800 MT of course and partes HD

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.269 
phone is d800 MT of course and partes HD
it's<00:00:17.460> only<00:00:18.119> available<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.560> model<00:00:19.619> I

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
it's only available for this model I

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.779 
it's only available for this model I
think<00:00:20.449> so<00:00:22.369> first<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:24.240> see<00:00:24.720> there<00:00:25.789> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
think so first that I can see there this

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.560 
think so first that I can see there this
room<00:00:27.119> has<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> knock<00:00:28.640> support<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.300> means

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
room has a knock support so that means

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.190 
room has a knock support so that means
you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.230> add<00:00:31.590> your<00:00:32.130> knock<00:00:32.460> code<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
you can add your knock code like on the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.090 
you can add your knock code like on the
newest<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:35.460> cheese<00:00:35.969> films<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:38.450> first<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.920> can

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
newest all cheese films so first you can

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.950 
newest all cheese films so first you can
see<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> there<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.540> notification<00:00:43.469> bar

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
see that there is a notification bar

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.529 
see that there is a notification bar
notification<00:00:45.960> bar<00:00:46.200> looks<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.700> LG<00:00:48.300> g3

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
notification bar looks like on the LG g3

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.779 
notification bar looks like on the LG g3
and<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.640> real<00:00:51.030> nice<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.800> has<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.430> flat

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and it is real nice so it has some flat

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
and it is real nice so it has some flat
look<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.360> design<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.890> well<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.230> it's<00:00:58.230> pretty

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
look and design is well so it's pretty

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.090 
look and design is well so it's pretty
useful<00:00:59.690> they<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.260> crease<00:01:01.829> light

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
useful they have this crease light

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.299 
useful they have this crease light
applications<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> stock<00:01:03.809> rom<00:01:04.309> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
applications like on the stock rom and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.929 
applications like on the stock rom and
others<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.130> look<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
others so you can see the look or the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.590 
others so you can see the look or the
notification<00:01:09.869> bar<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.460> not<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.700> same<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.330> on

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
notification bar is not the same like on

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.390 
notification bar is not the same like on
this<00:01:12.780> stock

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
this stock

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.780

LG's<00:01:15.360> run<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:17.100> ROM<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> based<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.960> UK

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
LG's run this ROM is based on the UK

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.660 
LG's run this ROM is based on the UK
open<00:01:20.790> base<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.610> means<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.600> be

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
open base so that means that you will be

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.649 
open base so that means that you will be
able<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.939> flash<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.810> any<00:01:28.259> carrier<00:01:28.979> firmware

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
able to flash it on any carrier firmware

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
able to flash it on any carrier firmware
expect<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.020> are<00:01:31.259> locked<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:32.040> someone's<00:01:32.820> fear

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
expect you are locked on someone's fear

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.460 
expect you are locked on someone's fear
on<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.680> t-mobile<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.290> very<00:01:37.290> easy

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
on there like on t-mobile and very easy

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.270 
on there like on t-mobile and very easy
on<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> other<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:40.340> after<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:43.070> can<00:01:44.070> see

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
on and other so after this you can see

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.139 
on and other so after this you can see
that<00:01:44.310> ROM<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.869> fast<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:47.399> course<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that ROM is really fast and of course it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.639 
that ROM is really fast and of course it
is<00:01:48.390> stable<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:50.540> something<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.720> mention<00:01:51.960> they

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
is stable so something to mention they

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
is stable so something to mention they
there<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.450> use<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.950> g2<00:01:56.939> settings<00:01:57.479> there

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
there you can use this g2 settings there

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.100 
there you can use this g2 settings there
and<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.640> see<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> lot<00:02:04.079> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and you can see there are a lot of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.190 
and you can see there are a lot of
effects<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.670> add<00:02:05.880> there<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.979> course

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
effects you can add there so of course

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
effects you can add there so of course
it<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.129> nice<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.700> see

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
it is really nice to see

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.459 
it is really nice to see
the<00:02:12.569> ROM<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:14.400> add<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.200> frequency<00:02:16.200> to

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
the ROM you can add the frequency to

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.190 
the ROM you can add the frequency to
your<00:02:16.620> processor<00:02:17.189> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:18.030> two<00:02:18.390> thousand<00:02:18.959> and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
your processor to be on two thousand and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.270 
your processor to be on two thousand and
eight<00:02:19.530> hundred<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.629> think

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
eight hundred so it is here I think

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.899 
eight hundred so it is here I think
aspects<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:28.579> you<00:02:29.579> know<00:02:29.730> there<00:02:30.090> are<00:02:30.299> a<00:02:30.569> lot<00:02:30.989> of

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
aspects and you know there are a lot of

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.610 
aspects and you know there are a lot of
things<00:02:32.909> you<00:02:33.269> can<00:02:33.599> do<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.519> to<00:02:36.469> make<00:02:37.469> your

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
things you can do there to make your

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.970 
things you can do there to make your
processor<00:02:38.310> faster<00:02:39.299> in<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.920> know<00:02:41.069> here<00:02:41.969> is

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
processor faster in the you know here is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.119 
processor faster in the you know here is
CPU<00:02:43.980> max<00:02:44.310> kit<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.739> there<00:02:46.739> are<00:02:46.889> some

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
CPU max kit and there are some

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.259 
CPU max kit and there are some
governor's<00:02:47.790> another<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.230> there<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.799> max<00:02:50.310> CPU

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
governor's another so there is max CPU

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.289 
governor's another so there is max CPU
frequency<00:02:53.329> minimum<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:55.290> maximum<00:02:55.950> okay<00:02:56.879> when

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
frequency minimum and maximum okay when

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.429 
frequency minimum and maximum okay when
I<00:02:57.329> go<00:02:58.019> there<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:59.579> choose<00:03:00.030> three<00:03:00.750> hundred

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
I go there I can choose three hundred

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.759 
I go there I can choose three hundred
and<00:03:01.709> two<00:03:02.669> thousand<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.419> eight<00:03:03.659> hundred<00:03:04.079> CPU

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
and two thousand and eight hundred CPU

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.539 
and two thousand and eight hundred CPU
frequency<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:07.500> really<00:03:07.980> cool

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
frequency so that is really cool

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.039 
frequency so that is really cool
in<00:03:08.609> this<00:03:09.030> room<00:03:09.629> so<00:03:10.079> this<00:03:10.560> ROM<00:03:10.859> is<00:03:11.810> deducted<00:03:12.810> and
