this<00:01:21.720> device<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> readyboost<00:01:22.590> what's<00:01:23.520> that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
this device to readyboost what's that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.620 
this device to readyboost what's that
gonna<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.820> transfer<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.090> of

gonna do it's going to transfer all of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.550 
gonna do it's going to transfer all of
its<00:01:28.250> cachet<00:01:29.250> into<00:01:29.759> our<00:01:29.960> computer<00:01:30.960> which<00:01:31.290> will

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.920 
its cachet into our computer which will
increase<00:01:31.979> its<00:01:32.159> performance<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.790> select<00:01:33.750> that

increase its performance so select that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.859 
increase its performance so select that
little<00:01:34.200> dot<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.689> this<00:01:36.689> should
