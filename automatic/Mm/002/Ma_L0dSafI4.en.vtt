 because I will be sick I say is sick 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.829
 today I am here to explain how 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.199
 create graffiti mods with tx's 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:15.539
 workshop before starting, I told you that 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.369
 we will have to use photoshop but 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.519
 I leave a link in the information of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.669
 good video let's start the programs that 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:28.070
 We will need workshop tx img 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.070
 tool 2.0 and photoshop cs3 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.680
 once we have all the programs 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.110
 necessary we have to have what 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.180
 next on the desk an access 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.150
 direct from photoshop a folder 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.129
 call tags an access to img tool and the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.070
 drawing we want to be graffiti 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.050
 in the tax folder we must have the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.629
 files of the graffiti to modify 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.660
 to know what they are watch the video of 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.820
 create graffiti mods with gtx of me 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.480
 I have a graffiti file what there is 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.760
 what to do is open it with workshop tx 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.120
 As you can see there are two files inside one 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.460
 called front yard and another called grove 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.220
 let's modify the one that says grove 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.770
 now there is the one who says I am the milk x of 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.570
 well the next thing is to edit the image 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.900
 that we want graffiti to be for 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.660
 that has transparency which is this 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.940
 as you will see the background of the image is 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.380
 we will edit it so that the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.170
 background be transparent 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.539
 the next step is to open the photoshop 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.200
 since we need it to be transparent 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.200
 the picture 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.469
 once you have fully charged 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.259
 let's open file and select 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.229
 our image something important is that the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:58.189
 image must have a resolution of 128 x 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:58.189
 128 256 by 256 and 512 by 512 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.680
 then we have to select in the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.899
 tool palette 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.330
 the draft tool that is the one 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.580
 is shaped like an eraser we give 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.580
 right click here and we will see draft 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.390
 background eraser and magic eraser 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.120
 for now we will select draft 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.550
 if we erase a bit we'll see what it gets 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.610
 white just like the bottom that does not 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.590
 will serve so we will do this 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.290
 we click right here and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.900
 we will select with berto smart object 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.270
 then we will right click again 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.390
 and now we select raster raise layer 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.460
 Once this is done, we will erase 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.650
 a little bit and now we will see that where 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.600
 erases a background of gray squares and 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.600
 whites this means that it is 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.250
 transparency now you have to erase everything 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.459
 what we do not want to come out in the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.470
 graffiti like this will acquire transparency 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.450
 this should only be used when 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.880
 we want an image that is surrounded by 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.610
 many colors but if it is surrounded by 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.250
 a single color as is this case there is a 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.680
 easiest way to erase the background if 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.170
 we erase so you have to adjust the brush 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.360
 here you have to move here to adjust the 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.020
 Larger brush size or more 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.020
 small 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.410
 now to erase a single background color 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.330
 easily go to the tool 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.510
 draft we right click and 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.640
 we select magic eraser we give a 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.590
 Click on the part to be deleted and erase it 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.080
 all without affecting the image that 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.990
 we want 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.690
 the next thing with the ready image is 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.780
 save the file let's save as 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.790
 we select the png extension and as a 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.790
 file name we will write grove 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.920
 here we click on ok and our ready 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.920
 graffiti image is ready 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.500
 here is yes we open it with preview 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.350
 transparency will not be noticed 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.609
 the next thing is to import it into the tx of 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.350
 workshop to modify graffiti 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.570
 we select the first file after 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.199
 we click on import and look for the 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.910
 image that we keep called grow 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.460
 then we will see that the image is added 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.080
 and in the thumbnail the background turns black 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.539
 this is that the image has 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.520
 transparency 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.800
 we come in knows that x's and mode already 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.320
 will be ready the only thing that is missing is 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.320
 add it to the game and we can use it 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.580
 we open the img tool then we go to file 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.310
 open and we select the file that 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.880
 teatres img that is in the directory 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.970
 models where the game was installed 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.510
 we press f2 and in the window that appears 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.510
 we write tax 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.910
 we'll see that the tax file was selected 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.460
 two 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.730
 xd to that file we give right click and 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.890
 we select re class after we search 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.020
 the file that we modified and what 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.020
 we select also has the same 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.780
 name once it is replaced 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.910
 we go to command rewind file we give 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.780
 click and we will see that below the window 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.780
 says wilding network 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.040
 let's wait until he says file will 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.290
 This means that xx team has finished 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.460
 reconstruct the file we can already 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.410
 close it and we can open san andreas 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.360
 then we open the game and let's see 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.000
