lately is there room for a third
category<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.500> device<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> middle

category of device in the middle
something<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.710> between<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.189> laptop<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
smartphone and of course we've pondered

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.779 
smartphone and of course we've pondered
this<00:00:23.699> question<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:24.390> years<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.810> well<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.550> bar

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this question for years as well the bar

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.599 
this question for years as well the bar
is<00:00:26.820> pretty<00:00:27.150> high<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.830> order<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.220> create

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
is pretty high in order to really create

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
is pretty high in order to really create
a<00:00:29.730> new<00:00:29.939> category<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.510> devices<00:00:31.050> those<00:00:31.800> devices

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
a new category of devices those devices

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.190 
a new category of devices those devices
are<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> be<00:00:33.059> far<00:00:33.480> better<00:00:33.840> at

it's going to have to be better at these
kinds<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.290> tasks<00:01:22.530> than<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.580> laptop<00:01:23.880> or<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

kinds of tasks than a laptop or a
smartphone<00:01:24.750> otherwise<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.710> has<00:01:25.770> no<00:01:25.890> reason

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
smartphone otherwise it has no reason

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.940 
smartphone otherwise it has no reason
for<00:01:26.580> being<00:01:27.290> now<00:01:28.670> some<00:01:29.670> people<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.240> thought

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
for being now some people have thought

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.450 
for being now some people have thought
that<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> netbook<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.650> problem<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that that's a netbook the problem is

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.810 
that that's a netbook the problem is
netbooks<00:01:36.240> aren't<00:01:36.509> better<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:37.020> anything<00:01:39.140> they

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.870 

they're<00:01:43.450> slow<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:45.100> have<00:01:45.280> low<00:01:45.520> quality

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
they're slow they have low quality

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.360 
they're slow they have low quality
displays<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.870> they<00:01:47.290> run<00:01:47.500> clunky<00:01:47.920> old<00:01:47.950> pc

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
displays and they run clunky old pc

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.690 
displays and they run clunky old pc
software<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.920> they're<00:01:50.920> not<00:01:51.040> better<00:01:51.400> than<00:01:51.640> a

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
software so they're not better than a

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.760 
software so they're not better than a
laptop<00:01:52.060> at<00:01:52.510> anything<00:01:52.780> they're<00:01:53.080> just<00:01:53.110> cheaper

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
laptop at anything they're just cheaper

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.150 
laptop at anything they're just cheaper
they're<00:01:54.280> just<00:01:54.550> cheap<00:01:54.910> laptops<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.080> we<00:01:57.010> don't

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
they're just cheap laptops and we don't

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.920 
they're just cheap laptops and we don't
think<00:01:57.550> if<00:01:58.240> they're<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.479> third<00:01:58.750> category<00:01:59.020> device

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
think if they're a third category device

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.080 
think if they're a third category device
but<00:02:01.930> we<00:02:02.020> think<00:02:02.229> we've<00:02:02.470> got<00:02:02.710> something<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.850> is

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
but we think we've got something that is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.320 
but we think we've got something that is
and<00:02:04.560> we'd<00:02:05.560> like<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:06.100> show<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.180> today

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330

for the first time and we call it the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:20.490 
for the first time and we call it the
