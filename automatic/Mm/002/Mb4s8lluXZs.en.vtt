00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.280
 well here we have seen in the video 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.580
 previous all the initial part 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.699
 of the arpeggio riff of challenge but the mother 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.350
 let's see now the refrain is the 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:24.779
 variation then refrain moves up 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.279
 these power chords of king of doc and di 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.150
 soul 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.919
 so I invite you first to get you 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.040
 a smattering of what power is 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:35.340
 chords that said quickly are one 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.790
 sort of partial version of agreements 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.940
 chords bars in itself i have this barrÃ¨ 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.130
 form of la merica the form of la 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 carried on instead of playing everything 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.540
 the agreement I take only the lower part 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.520
 remember this thing more seriously 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.500
 is called power chords and comes 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 used a lot in rock 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.700
 ok this power chords we'll be playing with 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.000
 index and go on strength and on 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.830
 ray rope so 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.230
 but we'll go further back than a button on the 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.940
 key 3 with the index on the key 3 uses 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.400
 always the index as a reference for 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.600
 define which key is fine then 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.479
 this is key 5 key terms on one 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 carries on the terms on a string la 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.080
 itself the inter already tour has always on 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.340
 key 3 issue soul agreement 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.930
 in practice they are the same three agreements 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.310
 which we used in the introduction three 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.369
 money nights here is the peculiarity of 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.960
 this part is that we should have one 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.210
 variation then little finger 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.320
 this is a party translated into terms 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.550
 harmonic music and is widely used 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 within rock and roll 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.890
 ok this kind of stuff here comes 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.890
 played that way 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.100
 ok so just power chords 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.929
 little finger that alternates on the rope areas 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.430
 puts this variation view to play 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:18.330
 one note at a minimum the same figure 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.860
 here the rhythm changes slightly but a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.269
 fingering level always the same 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.269
 and for this tina sentence 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.200
 in similar to the sentence delegates of the riff 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.700
 initial rope at the 2 key watch 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.980
 this 2 nov 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.470
 look at the button 3 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.180
 okay that should be placed in the middle of the part 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:58.650
 accompanying power chords 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:03:01.010
 so everything is so ok here too then re 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.030
 train yourself to connect this part 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.090
 at the beginning of the verse pin after you have 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.090
 done 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.260
 to start again with the main king 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.480
 now we see the other part of 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.630
 that very nice variation it makes 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.630
 so 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.880
 ok then I should ideally start up 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.670
 this position key 7 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.760
 the index crushes the strings si soul r 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.530
 making mini finger note too 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.420
 this is always a king a king agreement 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.320
 greater we are simple on the same three 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.450
 agreements 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.220
 however, every time you turn with a little shapes 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.990
 different then turned slightly 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.640
 different is fine so this is always 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.960
 actually this agreement 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.830
 sanremo has taken this form 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.570
 partial 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.360
 okay i should start with a legato 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.900
 on the rope the of this type tied 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.900
 chromatic 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.510
 in one stroke three notes 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.379
 then it sounds like your direct tuning 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.739
 then it will slide back two keys and 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.690
 instead of making all three notes of the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.080
 chromatic scale we will think only of two 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.080
 last two 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.949
 in row pm 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.720
 ok then you will go first 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.360
 position and I will have a legacy on the other hand 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.900
 rope always but starting from 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.900
 empty form 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:45.930
 the station is born key 2 poto alone 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.240
 photo and then the bass note 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.350
 note that this last sentence goes to 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.350
 dial one major 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.860
 I am not only greater people there 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.860
 let's review this part slowly 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.470
 he pretends to say that then he can come back, I could 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.470
 reconnected to the beginning 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.140
 she therefore done all this work 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.270
 you will work on the connection between the three 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.510
 parts without dead ends playing all 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.100
 together because this is a hello song 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.540
 have fun with this exceptional 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.540
 and the rock piece is legendary
