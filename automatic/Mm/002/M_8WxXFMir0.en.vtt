going<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.459> mix<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.910> with<00:03:35.940> my<00:03:36.150> little<00:03:36.359> ashes

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
going to mix it with my little ashes

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.110 
going to mix it with my little ashes
from<00:03:37.200> Mecca<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.950> what<00:03:38.519> that's<00:03:38.730> going<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.970> do

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
from Mecca and what that's going to do

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.460 
from Mecca and what that's going to do
is<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.269> going<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.510> share<00:03:39.900> down<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
is it's going to share down the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.710 
is it's going to share down the
intensity<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.340> red<00:03:41.579> give<00:03:42.150> me<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.329> beautiful

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
intensity of the red give me a beautiful

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.140 
intensity of the red give me a beautiful
glossy<00:03:43.230> finish<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.220> it's<00:03:44.669> also<00:03:44.790> going<00:03:45.060> to

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
glossy finish and it's also going to

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.390 
glossy finish and it's also going to
stop<00:03:45.450> any<00:03:45.660> really<00:03:45.959> harsh<00:03:46.260> edges<00:03:46.590> or<00:03:47.099> lines

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
stop any really harsh edges or lines

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.800 
stop any really harsh edges or lines
around<00:03:47.609> my<00:03:47.910> lips<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.450> looks<00:03:48.630> really

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
around my lips so it looks really

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.159 
around my lips so it looks really
natural<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:50.790> find<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.239> best<00:03:51.419> way<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.720> apply

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
natural and I find the best way to apply

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.319 
natural and I find the best way to apply
it<00:03:52.319> or<00:03:52.620> blend<00:03:52.919> it<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.489> definitely<00:03:53.910> with

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
it or blend it in is definitely with

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.660 
it or blend it in is definitely with
your<00:03:54.510> fingers
