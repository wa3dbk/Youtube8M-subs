come over onto the edge steel as well so

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.209 
come over onto the edge steel as well so
out<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:02.959> the<00:02:03.139> box<00:02:03.289> sharpness<00:02:03.590> wasn't<00:02:04.130> too

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
out of the box sharpness wasn't too

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.399 
out of the box sharpness wasn't too
impressive<00:02:04.759> on<00:02:04.909> these<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:05.959> I<00:02:05.990> would<00:02:06.259> recommend

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
impressive on these so I would recommend

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.260 
impressive on these so I would recommend
giving<00:02:06.979> them<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> quick<00:02:07.459> sharpening<00:02:07.999> and<00:02:08.179> get

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
giving them a quick sharpening and get

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.760 
giving them a quick sharpening and get
that<00:02:08.420> lacquer<00:02:08.750> off<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.259> there<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.590> kind<00:02:09.740> of

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
that lacquer off of there and kind of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.080 
that lacquer off of there and kind of
put<00:02:10.220> your<00:02:10.369> own<00:02:10.459> edge<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.850> they'll<00:02:10.970> get

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
put your own edge on and they'll get

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.970 
put your own edge on and they'll get
real<00:02:11.420> sharp<00:02:11.810> real<00:02:12.110> fast<00:02:12.379> with<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.739> coarse

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
real sharp real fast with the coarse

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.649 
real sharp real fast with the coarse
deal<00:02:13.250> they<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:13.489> on<00:02:13.640> there<00:02:13.819> they<00:02:14.180> sharpen<00:02:14.540> up

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
deal they have on there they sharpen up

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.330 
deal they have on there they sharpen up
very<00:02:14.840> very<00:02:14.900> nicely<00:02:15.519> but<00:02:16.519> if<00:02:16.790> they're<00:02:16.939> not

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
very very nicely but if they're not

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.589 
very very nicely but if they're not
sharp<00:02:17.580> out<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.910> box<00:02:18.090> that's<00:02:18.330> because

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
sharp out of the box that's because

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.720 
sharp out of the box that's because
you've<00:02:18.720> got<00:02:18.900> some<00:02:19.110> lacquer<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.739> edge<00:02:19.830> the

you've got some lacquer on the edge the
fit<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:21.390> finish<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.660> very<00:02:21.989> good<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.230> the

blades the blade roads are ground really

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.650 
blades the blade roads are ground really
nice<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:25.739> these<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.310> they've<00:02:27.120> got<00:02:27.390> good

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
nice on these and they've got good

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.009 
nice on these and they've got good
relief<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.800> toil<00:02:29.450> amol<00:02:30.450> toe<00:02:30.599> or<00:02:30.780> neck<00:02:30.989> area

relief on the toil amol toe or neck area

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.259 
relief on the toil amol toe or neck area
and<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.530> spine<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.160> comfort<00:02:32.879> wise<00:02:33.030> they're

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
and the spine so comfort wise they're

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.640 
and the spine so comfort wise they're
just<00:02:33.420> ready<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.720> rock<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:33.959> roll<00:02:34.140> right<00:02:34.470> out<00:02:34.620> of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
just ready to rock and roll right out of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.979 
just ready to rock and roll right out of
the<00:02:34.769> box<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:36.769> they<00:02:37.769> have<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:39.120> fairly<00:02:39.599> thin

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
the box and they have a fairly thin

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.960 
the box and they have a fairly thin
grind<00:02:40.379> at<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> edge<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.129> they've<00:02:41.730> got<00:02:41.940> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
grind at the edge so they've got a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.289 
grind at the edge so they've got a
pretty<00:02:42.180> good<00:02:42.390> combination<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.200> performance

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
pretty good combination of performance

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.289 
pretty good combination of performance
with<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.330> little<00:02:45.690> bit<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.900> convex<00:02:46.319> in<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.769> some

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
with a little bit of convex in for some

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.289 
with a little bit of convex in for some
reduced<00:02:48.299> sticking<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:49.230> product<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.299> let's

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
reduced sticking on product and let's

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.580 
reduced sticking on product and let's
take<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.540> look<00:02:51.780> at<00:02:51.900> what<00:02:52.079> they're<00:02:52.230> gonna<00:02:52.349> look

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
take a look at what they're gonna look

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.309 
take a look at what they're gonna look
like<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:53.040> our<00:02:53.569> cutting<00:02:54.569> board<00:02:54.690> here<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
like on our cutting board here and the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.860 
like on our cutting board here and the
edge<00:02:55.470> profile<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:59.549> here's<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> edge<00:03:00.060> profile

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
edge profile so here's the edge profile

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.920 
edge profile so here's the edge profile
in<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> long<00:03:01.410> view<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:03.269> one<00:03:03.480> has<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.660> bit

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
in the long view and this one has a bit

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.110 
in the long view and this one has a bit
of<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.140> flat<00:03:04.379> area<00:03:04.680> towards<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.160> heel<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
of a flat area towards the heel and a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.390 
of a flat area towards the heel and a
little<00:03:06.360> bit<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.599> belly<00:03:06.810> towards<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.560> tip<00:03:07.799> so

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
little bit of belly towards the tip so

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.640 
little bit of belly towards the tip so
kind<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:08.940> versatile<00:03:09.390> profile<00:03:09.900> let's<00:03:10.440> look

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
kind of a versatile profile let's look

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.240 
kind of a versatile profile let's look
at<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.890> on<00:03:10.980> our<00:03:11.099> board<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:15.690> flows<00:03:16.049> into<00:03:16.349> it's

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
at it on our board so it flows into it's

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.069 
at it on our board so it flows into it's
got<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> little<00:03:17.760> bit<00:03:17.879> of<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.090> back<00:03:18.269> belly<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.900> it

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
got a little bit of a back belly to it

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.080 
got a little bit of a back belly to it
back<00:03:19.560> right<00:03:19.860> at<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.099> heel<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.849> doesn't

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
back right at the heel so it doesn't

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.509 
back right at the heel so it doesn't
have<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> huge<00:03:21.510> long<00:03:21.750> flat<00:03:22.170> spot<00:03:22.500> if<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:23.310> did<00:03:23.489> a

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
have a huge long flat spot if you did a

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.890 
have a huge long flat spot if you did a
little<00:03:23.760> bit<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.090> your<00:03:24.239> own<00:03:24.269> work<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.660> knives

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
little bit of your own work on knives

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.420 
little bit of your own work on knives
you<00:03:25.079> could<00:03:25.200> tweak<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.829> just<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.069> little<00:03:26.190> bit

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
you could tweak that just a little bit

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.979 
you could tweak that just a little bit
and<00:03:26.579> give<00:03:26.670> yourself<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.090> longer<00:03:27.420> flat<00:03:27.660> spot<00:03:27.900> at

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
and give yourself a longer flat spot at

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.960 
and give yourself a longer flat spot at
the<00:03:28.079> heel<00:03:28.319> without<00:03:28.500> too<00:03:29.340> much<00:03:29.489> trouble<00:03:29.730> I

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
the heel without too much trouble I

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.940 
the heel without too much trouble I
think<00:03:30.209> on<00:03:30.329> this<00:03:30.510> one<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.380> got<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.560> fairly

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
think on this one it's got a fairly

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.699 
think on this one it's got a fairly
generous<00:03:32.400> belly<00:03:32.910> towards<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.480> tip<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:34.200> you

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
generous belly towards the tip so you

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.039 
generous belly towards the tip so you
can<00:03:34.829> get<00:03:34.950> fairly<00:03:35.310> high<00:03:35.519> on<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:35.910> I'm<00:03:36.150> not<00:03:36.359> I'm

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
can get fairly high on this I'm not I'm

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.720 
can get fairly high on this I'm not I'm
not<00:03:37.109> really<00:03:37.410> digging<00:03:37.799> in<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:37.980> board<00:03:38.220> yet<00:03:38.519> and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
not really digging in the board yet and

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.599 
not really digging in the board yet and
I'm<00:03:39.000> pretty<00:03:39.239> high<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:41.400> got<00:03:41.579> a

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
I'm pretty high on that so it's got a

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.589 
I'm pretty high on that so it's got a
nice<00:03:41.819> flow<00:03:42.329> into<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.910> heel<00:03:44.910> area<00:03:45.299> for<00:03:45.510> this

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
nice flow into that heel area for this
