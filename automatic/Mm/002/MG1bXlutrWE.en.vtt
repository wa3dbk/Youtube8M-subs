00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the glass starts to break I want to say

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.650 
the glass starts to break I want to say
that<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.399> recommend<00:00:35.760> anyone<00:00:36.270> repeat

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that I do not recommend anyone repeat

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.440 
that I do not recommend anyone repeat
this<00:00:36.809> who<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.110> not<00:00:37.910> specifically<00:00:38.910> trained<00:00:39.300> in

this who is not specifically trained in
handling<00:00:39.719> high<00:00:40.050> explosives<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.890> very

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
handling high explosives it is very

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.950 
handling high explosives it is very
dangerous<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.940> will<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.600> showing<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
dangerous I will not be showing the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.660 
dangerous I will not be showing the
synthesis<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> any<00:00:43.710> explosives<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.520> this

synthesis of any explosives in this
video<00:00:44.940> I'm<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:45.870> talking<00:00:46.289> about<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.910> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
video I'm just talking about how this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.119 
video I'm just talking about how this
project<00:00:48.059> works<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.500> camera<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
project works so here you see a camera a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.270 
project works so here you see a camera a
flash<00:00:50.460> behind<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> plexi<00:00:51.570> shield<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.100> box

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
flash behind a plexi shield in the box

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400 
flash behind a plexi shield in the box
and<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> black<00:00:54.750> spray<00:00:55.050> painted

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and we have a black spray painted

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.790 
and we have a black spray painted
section<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.879> happens<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
section and what happens is the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.099 
section and what happens is the
explosive<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.550> hooked<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> an<00:01:00.809> igniter

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
explosive is hooked up to an igniter

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
explosive is hooked up to an igniter
just<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.770> those<00:01:01.829> model<00:01:02.129> rocket<00:01:02.399> igniters

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
just one of those model rocket igniters

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
just one of those model rocket igniters
you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.660> Clips<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.140> there

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
you can see the two Clips right there

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.149 
you can see the two Clips right there
and<00:01:05.900> we<00:01:06.900> open<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> shutter<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> camera

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and we open the shutter of the camera

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.310 
and we open the shutter of the camera
and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> microphone<00:01:09.479> over<00:01:10.020> here

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and then we have a microphone over here

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.340 
and then we have a microphone over here
that<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> triggered<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.720> explosion

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that is triggered when the explosion

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.100 
that is triggered when the explosion
happens<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.390> shoots<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> flash<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.990> then

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
happens and that shoots a flash and then

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.020 
happens and that shoots a flash and then
we<00:01:16.170> capture<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> moment<00:01:17.040> we're

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
we capture the moment we're

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.609 
we capture the moment we're
experimenting<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.630> delays<00:01:18.990> right<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:19.350> but

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
experimenting with delays right now but

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.190 
experimenting with delays right now but
about<00:01:20.369> eight<00:01:20.909> milliseconds<00:01:21.390> after<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
about eight milliseconds after the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
about eight milliseconds after the
explosion<00:01:22.650> happens<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.189> all<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.240> stuff<00:01:24.360> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
explosion happens and all this stuff is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
explosion happens and all this stuff is
controlled<00:01:24.900> by<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> little<00:01:25.350> computer<00:01:26.100> back

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
controlled by a little computer back

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.510 
controlled by a little computer back
there<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.820> wires<00:01:27.000> running<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> box<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
there the wires running in the box so in

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.420 
there the wires running in the box so in
a<00:01:29.640> bit<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:30.030> will<00:01:30.270> show<00:01:30.540> how<00:01:30.840> i'm<00:01:31.259> attaching<00:01:31.979> the

okay<00:01:40.020> here's<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> glass<00:01:40.829> cup<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.520> be

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
okay here's the glass cup to be

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.450 
okay here's the glass cup to be
destroyed<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.439> some<00:01:43.680> freshly

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
destroyed and here I have some freshly

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880 
destroyed and here I have some freshly
dried<00:01:44.700> silver<00:01:45.119> satellite<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:46.380> was<00:01:46.530> stored

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
dried silver satellite it was stored

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.870 
dried silver satellite it was stored
under<00:01:47.399> acetone<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.930> keep<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.500> from<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.250> know

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
under acetone to keep it from you know

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.450 
under acetone to keep it from you know
being<00:01:50.909> sensitive<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.799> dry<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.100> amount

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
being sensitive so I just dry the amount

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.770 
being sensitive so I just dry the amount
that<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.610> want<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> use<00:01:54.090> right<00:01:54.360> before<00:01:54.659> use<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
that I want to use right before use I
