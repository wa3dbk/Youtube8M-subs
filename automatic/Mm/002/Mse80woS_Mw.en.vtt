00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
the skin is gray one of the fastest ways

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.199 
the skin is gray one of the fastest ways
to<00:02:43.930> make<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.620> skin<00:02:45.040> gray<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.630> go<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.900> image

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
to make the skin gray is to go to image

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.460 
to make the skin gray is to go to image
mode<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.959> change<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.220> grayscale<00:02:53.430> click<00:02:54.430> OK

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
mode and change it to grayscale click OK

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.039 
mode and change it to grayscale click OK
then<00:02:56.470> everything<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:57.040> all<00:02:57.220> gray<00:02:57.930> but<00:02:58.930> I

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
then everything is all gray but I

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.740 
then everything is all gray but I
suggest<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.769> only<00:02:59.980> make<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.970> skin<00:03:01.239> gray<00:03:01.540> this

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
suggest you only make the skin gray this

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.979 
suggest you only make the skin gray this
way<00:03:02.049> if<00:03:02.380> you're<00:03:02.980> willing<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.580> color

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
way if you're willing to color

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.770 
way if you're willing to color
everything<00:03:04.989> else

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.410 

so<00:03:10.500> yeah<00:03:10.770> that's<00:03:11.160> typically<00:03:11.819> how<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.090> make

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
so yeah that's typically how you make

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.050 
so yeah that's typically how you make
gray<00:03:12.720> skin
