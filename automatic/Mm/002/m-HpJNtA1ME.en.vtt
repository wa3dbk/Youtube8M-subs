00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Equatorial Coordinate Measures

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
How can we measure the position of a body in the globe?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What in heaven?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Before studying the systems used in astronomy to
fix the position of the objects on the celestial sphere ...

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It is necessary to remember how to do this on the map
and three-dimensional space

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Objects of various sizes surround us everywhere
occupying different positions in space

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We know intuitively what is the closest to us

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But how can we know mathematically what purpose
is closer or farther from a point?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Or, What is the biggest? ...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
To do this we use the comparison 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But what do we compare? Two objects? ... If we superimpose two
 objects, we obtain a finding...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Some are bigger than others ... but also that some
are closer than others.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The comparison can be done with many objects,
but it is better to do it with an object that is taken as
reference for all measures: the rule.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The rule is a measuring instrument which includes a
graduated scale divided into units of length

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
eg cm or inches

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Its divisions are based on the pattern length

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The rule is based on what is known as a real line

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What is the geometric representation of all
real numbers

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It has its origin at zero and extends to the right
to infinity

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And left the negative range, also
to infinity

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
To put a point in a plane we use the so-called
"Cartesian diagram"

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Since it was invented by French mathematician Rene Descartes

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Consisting of two real straight lines perpendicular to each other
and intersecting at one point.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The horizontal axis is called x-axis (abscissa)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The vertical axis is the y-axis (ordinate)

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The point where they intersect is the "origin of coordinates"

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
To find the coordinates of a point, we place it between
axes and projected it on these

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The place where it intersect will show us its coordinates

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Each point has two coordinates

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The first is "x" and the second "y"

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Point 1 is located at (3,4), for example ...

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
How can we measure the position of a point on the sphere?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
What must we take references?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
To start, it is neccesary to give some definitions

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
If we cut a sphere into two equal hemispheres, we obtain
a great circle

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The great circle will be called "EQUATOR"

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The line perpendicular to this plane, which passes through the center
of the sphere, is the LINE OF POLES

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Poles are the points of the sphere cut by this line.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The line of the poles is called the "axis of the world"

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And the Earth revolves around it

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
There are also other smaller circles, parallels to Equator
that we calls "parallels" 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And there are other greats circles: THE MERIDIANS

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
They are all the circles that pass through the line of poles
and cut perpendicularly the Equator.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The ecliptic is the line which the sun appears to move
over the year, same the planets

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The Ecliptic down a level that is inclined 23° 27'
respect the Equator.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Both planes intersect at one point: the VERNAL POINT

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
VERNAL POINT is the position of the Sun when
it crosses the Equator (when its declination is 0°)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And this change from - to + or from + to -

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This occurs on March 21th (Spring)
and September 21th (Fall)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
To put a point on the celestial sphere we need
TWO PLANES OF REFERENCE

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
From which the distances are measured

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We also need a starting point to start counting.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The plans depend on the system we used

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The coordinates measured from EQUATOR are called
"Equatorial Coordinates"

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The foreground is the EQUATOR and the starting point is the
VERNAL POINT

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The second level is the meridian of the place we want to measure

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
How can we measure the absolute equatorial coordinates of a
P dot located on the celestial sphere?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We do it through two arcs

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
One of them is called Right Ascension (R.A.)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And it is the arc that starts in the Vernal point and ending point 
on the meridian of P

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Measured in the forward direction (counter clockwise)

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Gives us the distance from the Vernal point. Can be measured
both in degrees and in hours, minutes and seconds.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Before it was called "AR" and today is represented by "A"

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The other is called DECLINATION: it is the arc from the
Equator to the point P.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It gives us the height from Equator

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It is measured in degrees and minutes and is represented by "d"

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
If the decline is measured in the southern hemisphere, "d" will
be negative.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Thus, the equatorial coordinates are defined in
following intervals:

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000
"AR" varies between 0º and 360º (or between 0h and 24h)

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
"D" ranges from -90º to +90º

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
To know the equatorial coordinates of a star

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We will measure the arches of the AR and the declination 
of the same

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
To measure the position of an object on the surface
of Earth, we take two levels of reference:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Equator and the Greenwich Meridian

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This meridian is used as 0 Meridian

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Based on it for measuring lengths

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
LONGITUDE is measured on the Equator and at the most can be 360º

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Latitude is measured on the meridian and may be 
+90° (North) or -90° (South)

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
LATITUDE (globe) is equivalent to declination (celestial sphere)

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Another set of coordinates are the ecliptic coordinates.
The difference in the equatorial is used to measure
the plane of the ecliptic

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It is also used the Vernal Point as the origin point and
the same forward direction

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
But this is the subject of another documentary ...
