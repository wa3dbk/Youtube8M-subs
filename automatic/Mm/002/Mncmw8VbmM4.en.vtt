00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.820
 site 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.100
 I created but because there is a background 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.289
 normal change can be inserted 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.260
 the picture can be just one color to change 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.080
 that is white to change the color we 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.060

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.930
 six zeros for example save 0 and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.829
 tab 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.969
 see we have a black background 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.449
 try to insert a picture I already 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.559
 of course I don't remember how it can now 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.559
 remember duty 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.540
 I will suspend sisley now I remembered 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:10.340
 and I show you a vine like I 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.110
 I remembered this combination of writing 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.110
 Now we have these files manager 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.409
 picture 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.060
 schA look 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.119
 so okay , I download 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:40.850
 just for example gots shop greta and 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.850
 here he is 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.960
 for example, there it is more 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.000
 save 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.690
 So 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:06.479
 Now we go to the file manager review so 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.479
 here we open we load the file 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.790
 first link ok close we go in 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.680
 control panel - leave the shelves here 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:21.010
 we keep it 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.010
 I have a tab so this is what we have 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.290
 So why not change 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.659
 here 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.250
 we changed the background on the picture see well 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.840
 Of course it is better to make another combination 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.269
 You see flowers because I have 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.180
 materials are ideally described almost and 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.359
 it is clear that in this lesson we have learned 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.450

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.659
