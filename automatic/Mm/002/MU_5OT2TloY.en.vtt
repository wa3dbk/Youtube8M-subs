going to use a slotted spoon you'll

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.610 
going to use a slotted spoon you'll
notice<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.090> some<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.780> white<00:02:21.200> fleshy

parts and some of the skin has floated

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.340 
parts and some of the skin has floated
up<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> top<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.690> bowl<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.050> you're<00:02:27.200> just

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
up to the top of the bowl so you're just

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.710 
up to the top of the bowl so you're just
going<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.650> use<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.860> slotted<00:02:28.280> spoon<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.970> remove

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.860 
those fleshy parts to another bowl and
you<00:02:33.590> can<00:02:33.800> discard<00:02:34.220> those<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.240> may<00:02:35.420> even<00:02:35.450> have

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
you can discard those you may even have

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.160 
you can discard those you may even have
a<00:02:36.200> few<00:02:36.710> pieces<00:02:36.980> floating<00:02:37.670> at<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.060> bottom<00:02:39.050> or

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
a few pieces floating at the bottom or

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.720 
a few pieces floating at the bottom or
lying<00:02:39.530> down<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.070> bottom<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.460> it's<00:02:40.580> easy

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
lying down on the bottom and it's easy

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.650 
lying down on the bottom and it's easy
enough<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.060> lift<00:02:41.360> those<00:02:41.600> up<00:02:41.810> as<00:02:41.960> well

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.500

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
so once you've removed all of the white

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.660 
so once you've removed all of the white
membrane<00:02:51.959> you're<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.740> going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.160> strain

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
membrane you're just going to strain

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.750 
membrane you're just going to strain
these<00:02:54.030> seeds<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.840> excess<00:02:55.590> liquid<00:02:56.069> over<00:02:56.730> a

bits<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.130> white<00:03:02.310> membrane<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.090> also

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
bits of white membrane you can also

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
bits of white membrane you can also
remove<00:03:03.750> those<00:03:05.060> once<00:03:06.060> you've<00:03:06.270> strained<00:03:06.690> all<00:03:07.080> of

remove those once you've strained all of

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.890 
remove those once you've strained all of
the<00:03:07.470> arils<00:03:08.280> then<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.940> can<00:03:09.150> transfer<00:03:09.690> them<00:03:09.870> to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the arils then you can transfer them to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
the arils then you can transfer them to
a<00:03:10.080> bowl<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.510> they're<00:03:12.510> ready<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.640> enjoy
