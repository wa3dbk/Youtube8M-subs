Swedish clock I mean not I almost bought
this<00:00:05.240> kind<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.299> clock<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.810> Amsterdam<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.440> just

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
this kind of clock in Amsterdam I just

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.169 
this kind of clock in Amsterdam I just
saw<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.220> window<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.550> terms<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:08.940> that

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
saw it in the window in terms of that

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.150 
saw it in the window in terms of that
it's<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.480> style<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.500> making<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.889> clock<00:00:11.130> that's

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
it's a style of making a clock that's

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.870 
it's a style of making a clock that's
really<00:00:11.700> typical<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:13.190> like<00:00:14.190> deep<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.580> guess

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
really typical of like deep I guess

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.109 
really typical of like deep I guess
being<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> 19th<00:00:15.660> or<00:00:15.780> 18th<00:00:16.020> century<00:00:16.350> Swedish

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
being the 19th or 18th century Swedish

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.330 
being the 19th or 18th century Swedish
craft<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.930> they<00:00:19.380> usually<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:20.010> paint<00:00:20.189> them

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
craft but they usually do paint them

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.040 
craft but they usually do paint them
blue<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.510> they<00:00:21.600> look<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:21.869> their

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
blue like that and they look like their

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.480 
blue like that and they look like their
time<00:00:22.289> machines<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.949> like<00:00:23.070> different<00:00:23.369> like

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
time machines are like different like

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.880 
time machines are like different like
Alice<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.789> Wonderland<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:27.619> was<00:00:28.619> going<00:00:28.830> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
buy it then I remember that i had this

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.959 
buy it then I remember that i had this
clock<00:00:30.560> stopped<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.769> pendulum<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
clock stopped the pendulum because the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.400 
clock stopped the pendulum because the
ticking<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.630> apartment<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.200> drives

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
ticking in this apartment is like drives

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
ticking in this apartment is like drives
me<00:00:34.530> crazy<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> maybe<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.809> better<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.140> just

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
me crazy so maybe it's better to just

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.400 
me crazy so maybe it's better to just
like<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.760> paper<00:00:39.030> mache<00:00:39.450> not

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
like have it be like paper mache not

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.529 
like have it be like paper mache not
tick<00:00:41.809> this<00:00:42.809> sum<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.579> almost<00:00:44.579> done<00:00:44.850> it's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
tick this sum is almost done it's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.729 
tick this sum is almost done it's
supposed<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> canopic<00:00:46.350> jar<00:00:47.210> as<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:49.530> like

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
supposed to be a canopic jar as in like

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.560 
supposed to be a canopic jar as in like
the<00:00:49.890> ancient<00:00:50.070> Egyptian<00:00:50.760> jar<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.390> used

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the ancient Egyptian jar that they used

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.389 
the ancient Egyptian jar that they used
to<00:00:51.690> put<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:53.120> organs<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.989> tomb<00:00:55.230> um<00:00:55.800> this

to put the organs in in the tomb um this

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
to put the organs in in the tomb um this
is<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> prototype<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.840> which<00:00:58.620> is

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
is like the prototype for it which is

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.450 
is like the prototype for it which is
smaller<00:01:00.500> cuter<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> draw<00:01:05.430> some

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
smaller cuter and I'm going to draw some

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
smaller cuter and I'm going to draw some
hieroglyphics<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.619> this<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
hieroglyphics on there this was the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
hieroglyphics on there this was the
first<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.250> did<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> plaster<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.390> really

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
first one did and plaster it's really

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.219 
first one did and plaster it's really
heavy<00:01:09.780> actually<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:11.659> had<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:12.930> heads

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
them onto plywood um yeah I didn't

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
them onto plywood um yeah I didn't
really<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:22.740> doing<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.130> made

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
really know what I was doing when I made

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.660 
really know what I was doing when I made
this<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:24.170> if<00:01:25.170> i<00:01:25.740> knew<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.130> i<00:01:26.159> would<00:01:26.340> make<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
this one if i knew now i would make it a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.950 
this one if i knew now i would make it a
paper<00:01:26.850> mache<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.420> would<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.689> light

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
paper mache and it would be really light

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800 
paper mache and it would be really light
but<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.640> i<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> feeling

but it's as it is now i have a feeling

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.999 
but it's as it is now i have a feeling
when<00:01:31.079> someone<00:01:31.320> picks<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> gonna

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
when someone picks it up is gonna

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.289 
when someone picks it up is gonna
totally<00:01:32.970> break<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:36.119> all<00:01:36.210> i've
