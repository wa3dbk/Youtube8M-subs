00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.819 
don't get it so it hasn't made up it's
been<00:01:38.579> um<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.720> say<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.200> been<00:01:40.380> available<00:01:40.590> for

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
been um they say it's been available for

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.319 
been um they say it's been available for
about<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> week<00:01:41.369> or<00:01:41.579> two<00:01:41.700> weeks<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
about a week or two weeks just like that

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.910 
about a week or two weeks just like that
but<00:01:42.570> technically<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.560> actually

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
but technically it's not actually

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.590 
but technically it's not actually
available<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:45.000> where<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> problem

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
available so that's where the problem

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
available so that's where the problem
comes<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.320> haven't<00:01:46.649> seen<00:01:46.770> something

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
comes in now I haven't seen something

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.800 
comes in now I haven't seen something
like<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.729> while<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
like this in a while and I know a lot of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.590 
like this in a while and I know a lot of
people<00:01:49.020> were<00:01:49.110> saying<00:01:49.369> how<00:01:50.369> Club<00:01:51.210> Penguin<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
people were saying how Club Penguin is

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
people were saying how Club Penguin is
normally<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:51.990> top<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.290> these<00:01:52.380> things<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.189> they

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
normally on top of these things and they

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.740 
normally on top of these things and they
don't<00:01:53.490> really<00:01:53.729> know<00:01:53.850> why<00:01:54.000> they're<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.270> fixing

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
don't really know why they're not fixing

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.020 
don't really know why they're not fixing
it<00:01:55.009> but<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> guess<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
it but I guess this is just one of the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.719 
it but I guess this is just one of the
things<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.570> maybe<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.200> need<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.439> bring<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
things that maybe we need to bring up to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.950 
things that maybe we need to bring up to
Club<00:01:59.969> Penguin<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.719> kind<00:02:00.899> of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
Club Penguin but I think it's kind of

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.600 
Club Penguin but I think it's kind of
cool<00:02:01.170> only<00:02:01.409> because<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.340> don't<00:02:02.490> get

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
cool only because you know you don't get

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.030 
cool only because you know you don't get
like<00:02:02.790> glitches<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.420> all<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.170> time

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
like glitches like this all the time

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.830 
like glitches like this all the time
and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.340> don't<00:02:05.580> know<00:02:05.730> I<00:02:05.940> I<00:02:06.150> kind<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:06.570> find<00:02:06.780> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and I don't know I I kind of find it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.510 
and I don't know I I kind of find it
cool<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.230> hope<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.830> they<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.009> fix<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
cool but I hope that they do fix it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.609 
cool but I hope that they do fix it
before<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:09.210> background<00:02:09.479> goes<00:02:09.899> away<00:02:10.170> because

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
before this background goes away because

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.520 
before this background goes away because
I<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.910> would<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.390> back<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:13.020> um

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I really would like that back on but um

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.200 
I really would like that back on but um
that's<00:02:13.920> pretty<00:02:14.220> much<00:02:14.490> there's<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.000> background

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
that's pretty much there's a background

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.300
