00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.540 
so that is pretty much how the game on
it<00:02:32.240> we<00:02:32.780> draw<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:32.990> game<00:02:33.200> 2-2<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:34.070> as<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.430> can

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
it we draw the game 2-2 and as you can

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.830 
it we draw the game 2-2 and as you can
see<00:02:34.580> from<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> stats<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.420> game<00:02:35.570> was<00:02:35.720> pretty

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
see from the stats the game was pretty

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.780 
see from the stats the game was pretty
even<00:02:36.230> even<00:02:36.980> though<00:02:37.070> my<00:02:37.250> opponent<00:02:37.670> had<00:02:37.760> a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
even even though my opponent had a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.250 
even even though my opponent had a
couple<00:02:38.030> more<00:02:38.210> shots<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.660> target<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:39.020> still

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
couple more shots on target I still

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.660 
couple more shots on target I still
think<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.650> game<00:02:39.800> was<00:02:39.890> even<00:02:40.190> because<00:02:40.430> we<00:02:40.550> had<00:02:40.640> a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
think the game was even because we had a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.670 
think the game was even because we had a
huge<00:02:41.030> chance<00:02:41.390> there<00:02:41.630> with<00:02:41.810> woloson<00:02:42.380> where<00:02:42.590> we

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
huge chance there with woloson where we

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.260 
huge chance there with woloson where we
unfortunately<00:02:42.980> hit<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.640> post<00:02:43.820> probably

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
the stats as well the game was pretty

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.810 
the stats as well the game was pretty
even<00:05:09.530> so<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:09.770> could<00:05:09.980> have<00:05:10.010> gone<00:05:10.280> either<00:05:10.460> way

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
even so it could have gone either way

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.730 
even so it could have gone either way
but<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.300> look<00:05:11.570> in<00:05:11.690> this<00:05:11.810> game<00:05:12.050> was<00:05:12.200> definitely

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
but the look in this game was definitely

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.990 
but the look in this game was definitely
on<00:05:12.890> his<00:05:13.010> side<00:05:13.220> if<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.430> look<00:05:13.550> at<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:13.790> goals

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
on his side if you look at the goals

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.120 
on his side if you look at the goals
that<00:05:14.360> he<00:05:14.690> squirt<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:15.620> anyway<00:05:15.890> we're<00:05:16.040> gonna

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
that he squirt but anyway we're gonna

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.340

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
already from the seven that we have to

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.150 
already from the seven that we have to
score<00:06:20.300> and<00:06:20.750> we<00:06:20.840> also<00:06:20.960> scored<00:06:21.320> one<00:06:21.440> chip<00:06:21.950> goes
