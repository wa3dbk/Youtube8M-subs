has<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.100> lot<00:03:40.340> of<00:03:40.370> times<00:03:40.550> they<00:03:40.670> have<00:03:40.700> like<00:03:40.970> a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
has a lot of times they have like a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.770 
has a lot of times they have like a
compressor<00:03:42.560> for<00:03:42.880> inflating<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:44.000> flat<00:03:44.540> tire

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
compressor for inflating a flat tire

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.670 
compressor for inflating a flat tire
they<00:03:45.470> have<00:03:45.650> all<00:03:46.100> kinds<00:03:46.460> of<00:03:46.610> AC<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.690> DC<00:03:47.960> outlets

they have all kinds of AC and DC outlets

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.320 
they have all kinds of AC and DC outlets
to<00:03:49.040> plug<00:03:49.250> stuff<00:03:49.370> in<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:49.880> charge<00:03:50.090> stuff

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
to plug stuff in and charge stuff

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.630 
to plug stuff in and charge stuff
someone<00:03:50.660> would<00:03:50.780> even<00:03:50.870> have<00:03:51.110> USB<00:03:51.440> stuff<00:03:51.920> so

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
someone would even have USB stuff so

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.910 
someone would even have USB stuff so
it's<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.060> good<00:03:53.300> prep<00:03:53.600> I<00:03:53.780> think<00:03:53.990> it<00:03:54.110> it's<00:03:54.560> kind<00:03:54.830> of

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
it's a good prep I think it it's kind of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.140 
it's a good prep I think it it's kind of
redundant<00:03:55.370> for<00:03:55.520> a<00:03:55.550> lot<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:55.940> other<00:03:56.090> stuff

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
redundant for a lot of this other stuff

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.180 
redundant for a lot of this other stuff
that<00:03:56.360> we<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.690> here<00:03:56.960> but<00:03:57.230> that's<00:03:57.800> sort<00:03:58.070> of<00:03:58.100> the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
that we have here but that's sort of the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.680 
that we have here but that's sort of the
name<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.520> game<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.180> think<00:03:59.240> when<00:03:59.540> you're

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
name of the game and I think when you're

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.140 
name of the game and I think when you're
alone<00:04:00.170> in<00:04:00.320> your<00:04:00.350> car<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:01.010> something<00:04:01.700> happens

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
alone in your car and something happens

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.430 
alone in your car and something happens
and<00:04:02.270> goes<00:04:02.330> wrong<00:04:02.660> it's<00:04:02.990> better<00:04:03.170> to<00:04:03.290> have<00:04:03.350> a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
and goes wrong it's better to have a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.680 
and goes wrong it's better to have a
little<00:04:03.740> bit<00:04:03.800> more<00:04:04.040> than<00:04:04.280> not<00:04:04.460> I<00:04:05.150> really<00:04:05.540> like

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
little bit more than not I really like

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.790 
little bit more than not I really like
those<00:04:05.870> things<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:06.380> want<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.560> have<00:04:06.680> one

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
those things so I just want to have one

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.410 
those things so I just want to have one
