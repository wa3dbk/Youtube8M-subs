start<00:00:52.900> with<00:00:52.990> your<00:00:53.260> fingering<00:00:53.800> position<00:00:54.160> we

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
start with your fingering position we

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.770 
start with your fingering position we
start<00:00:54.579> is<00:00:54.790> a<00:00:55.329> G<00:00:55.690> power<00:00:55.930> chord<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:58.300> what<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:58.600> do

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
start is a G power chord but what you do

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.220 
start is a G power chord but what you do
is<00:00:58.810> you<00:00:59.200> hammer<00:01:00.160> on<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.880> F<00:01:01.270> sharp<00:01:01.300> here<00:01:01.960> and

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
is you hammer on to the F sharp here and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.140 
is you hammer on to the F sharp here and
then<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.500> G<00:01:02.710> in<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.160> beginning<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:03.760> it<00:01:03.850> sounds

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
then the G in the beginning so it sounds

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.880 
then the G in the beginning so it sounds
like<00:01:04.210> when<00:01:04.839> you<00:01:04.930> hit<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.229> opie<00:01:05.470> hit<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.770> open

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
like when you hit the opie hit the open

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.639 
like when you hit the opie hit the open
F<00:01:06.399> sharp<00:01:06.670> in<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.820> G<00:01:07.000> so<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:08.110> take<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.409> power

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
F sharp in the G so you take the power

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.609 
F sharp in the G so you take the power
chord<00:01:08.950> bass<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.520> you<00:01:10.420> leave<00:01:10.630> your<00:01:11.320> next

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
chord bass and you leave your next

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.620 
chord bass and you leave your next
finger<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.250> open<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.820> then<00:01:13.390> you're<00:01:13.540> going

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
finger on the open and then you're going

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.749 
finger on the open and then you're going
to<00:01:13.689> hammer<00:01:13.869> on<00:01:14.079> and<00:01:14.290> you<00:01:14.530> know<00:01:14.649> so<00:01:15.159> what<00:01:15.670> we

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
to hammer on and you know so what we

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.370 
to hammer on and you know so what we
have<00:01:15.909> is

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.719 

so<00:01:19.380> that's<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:19.770> simple<00:01:20.250> there<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.610> can

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
so that's pretty simple there you can

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.330 
so that's pretty simple there you can
just<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:22.290> when<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
just do that and then when you do that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.630 
just do that and then when you do that
after<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.119> hit<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:25.229> kind<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.619> hit<00:01:26.460> like

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
after that you hit you kind of hit like

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.300 
after that you hit you kind of hit like
a<00:01:26.670> muted<00:01:27.149> string<00:01:27.539> muted<00:01:27.869> strings<00:01:28.289> so<00:01:28.799> sound

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
a muted string muted strings so sound

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:40.149 
a muted string muted strings so sound
like<00:01:29.689> that<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.039> do<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.689> have

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.100 

after<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:42.119> will<00:01:42.299> walk<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:43.470> C<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.130> D

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
after that it will walk up from C to D

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
after that it will walk up from C to D
using<00:01:46.110> these<00:01:46.380> three<00:01:46.649> notes<00:01:46.860> C

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
using these three notes C

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.209 
using these three notes C
so<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.429> have<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.880> far<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.950> after<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> pizza<00:01:55.219> so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
so we have so far as after a pizza so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.330 
so we have so far as after a pizza so
when<00:01:56.789> we<00:01:56.880> combine<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.310> other

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
when we combine that with the other

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.550 
when we combine that with the other
thing<00:01:59.789> with

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
thing with

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.600 
thing with
and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.880 

so<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.270> far<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:06.960> then

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
so that's what we have so far and then

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.749 
so that's what we have so far and then
what<00:02:08.070> you're<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.580> hit

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
what you're going to do is you can hit

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.450 
what you're going to do is you can hit
it<00:02:08.820> open<00:02:09.330> again<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.020> string<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.710> then

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
it open again with the a string and then

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:21.070 
it open again with the a string and then
hit<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> B<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.870> C<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:30.980 

little<00:02:22.080> mute<00:02:22.350> there<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.060> far<00:02:24.210> we<00:02:24.330> have

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.050 

and<00:02:31.990> then<00:02:32.530> next<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:33.460> just<00:02:33.700> hit<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:35.310> b-flat<00:02:36.310> but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
and then next you just hit a b-flat but

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.110 
and then next you just hit a b-flat but
you're<00:02:37.330> barring<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> whole<00:02:37.870> string<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:39.580> then

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
you're barring the whole string and then

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:49.830 
you're barring the whole string and then
back<00:02:40.300> into<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.630> G<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.880> then<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.270> have<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
back into a G so then we have for the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.280 
back into a G so then we have for the
whole<00:02:49.930> intro<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.920> whole<00:02:51.250> intro

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:09.050 

and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.680
