00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.600
 first congratulations for a second 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.250
 season where he has not had anything that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.570
 see with the first one that always tends 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.070
 to compare where there has been 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570
 different personalities and after these 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.900
 how one more year is achieved 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 recite good success evidently has 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.989
 been different from the previous one because 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.970
 people who do it are different in 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.489
 the basis of our program are always 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.730
 the aspirants are the most important 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.620
 then obviously 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.110
 people make things be 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.600
 different recipe for success I think 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.840
 that there is a very good production behind 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.110
 very good ideas very good chefs and 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.760
 I do not think there's another recipe in the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.379
 illustration assembly effectively 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.239
 taste to life as it says this at the end 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.949
 always to life there are people who have said 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.369
 that the second season has more rhythm 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.960
 has as perhaps more mischief as more 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.610
 more inclusion with the viewer all the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 final assembly because shooting hours 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.030
 they are very long you have noticed that 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 precisely this improvement in the pace 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.320
 do not believe you, I have not noticed much 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.580
 I do not know if because I live it so 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.009
 different to the best and I can not give you that 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.470
 vision because for me the rhythm is 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.479
 frantic always because like us 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.580
 it took us so long to record it and when 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.940
 mounts it condenses a week of 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.350
 recording in almost two hours then 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.409
 for me the frantic pace I see it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.970
 super fast all necessary I would not know 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 say good now to finish welcome 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.590
 chef where they see the van changes the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 life of the protagonists if you had 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.100
 to put someone in that van and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.369
 go to a place in the world where you would go 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.320
 where would I go good if I go in a 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.149
 van is because I'm going to go a lot 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 I would not stay in a place to myself 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.950
 I love to travel and I love to eat 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.729
 that is not bad is not bad option is bad 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.590
 idea 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.619
 good to finish you know the game of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.420

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.780

 and it says well there's a room with a pitcher 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.150
 full that is later weighs less than 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.890
 that was before it was full the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.120
 pitcher 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.550
