00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
 rudi 12 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.349
 I am happy about one percent of the SIMs 4 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.719
 and which give you more insight into creating and simple 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.880
 we have totally renewed our technology so that quirin sentence however 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.880
 beret is intuitive and much more powerful 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.830
 I'm going to be the Quran and Christian of the church or make two of the most favorite 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.509
 movies of all time 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.699
 we have them in the history of sims in different stages of life 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.630
 but let's see how they look like four in the sims 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.690
 in this example I will quickly respect the face of cot 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.720
 to then adjust to physique 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.090
 ancora has been active since good shape make it also has female forms 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.580
 I can just mold into a model by pulling in somewhere between pushing 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.010
 in the sims 3 I could miss many cynics, but before that 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 I had to work through a series of menus 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.360
 in the sims here you can get sims direct model what a lot 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.290
 faster and easier 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.600
 creating meaning is an even more powerful but by i am sims from head to toe shape 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420
 can give 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 there's just a lot more you can play with 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.520
 okay back to cora 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.400
 for the very first time I can since with your own authentic ethnicity 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.570
 to create 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 all external characteristics are designed with the characteristic 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.230
 underlying bone structure 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.180
 cora it looks good 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 and with a few clicks i can create her husband christian 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.840
 but I still want to work in prison 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.240
 all three parts of the body would be marked as I had 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.500
 can see exactly what I can change 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.640
 I can really determine the appearance of sing-alongs down to the smallest detail 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.500
 with so much control, I can really bring a character to life 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.980
 christian is a bit older 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.730
 he can use a lot of streamers 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.080
 and cora needs a radiant smile on her face 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.440
 now let's play with a couple 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.759
 I can choose the choir as haircut 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.759
 select clothing afterwards 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.699
 It is possible to make accessories 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.379
 and even that there is basic to choose 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.379
 sorry christian the seems to me not the type for tattoos 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:29.699
 we have added the feature featured looks then you will soon be a nice how 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.659
 can find 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.530
 ladies and gentlemen get to know christian and cora van de kerkhof 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.029
 in the sims 4 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:42.189
 for me money is the magic frankie their way in the possibilities to my friends 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.189
 and to turn people from real life goodbye 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:47.349
 this is a picture of myself 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.829
 and this is what i'm doing 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.189
 What do you think of it is finally possible to get extreme detainees since 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.379
 to make in the sims 4 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.379
 just look at the other person from our studio 8 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.629
 hr 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.319
 9 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.969
 after 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.699
 but that all started but the sims here do not only work here 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.199
 to the appearance 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.499
 here I can also determine how my since sound 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.179
 9 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.619
 and behave 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.099
 I can choose a walk 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.319
 you suddenly have to see there 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.769
 what did he have access to 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.769
 I choose your vote 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.209
 I give myself since character traits 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.149
 christian it is a genius he is creative and a bit of a booker i am going to 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:46.629
 to give christian a goal i want him in vienna sancy a plate so that he 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.629
 fleeing can learn and develop his skills faster 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.540
 cora something romantic the spontaneous and active 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:55.339
 its purpose 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.289
 I want her to become a world friend 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.589
 therefore the character traits are pleasantly unlocked 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.419
 she will develop friendship sooner 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.929

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:07.939

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:13.119
 they are clinic m they have real character 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:17.019
 I have my sentence withdrawn with a number of friends from the studio 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.019
 I'm going home for a build 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.969
