00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.190 

you

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.890 

all<00:00:11.200> right<00:00:11.320> so<00:00:12.030> we're<00:00:13.030> pretty<00:00:13.210> sure<00:00:13.330> the<00:00:13.660> motor

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
all right so we're pretty sure the motor

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.290 
all right so we're pretty sure the motor
at<00:00:14.200> 72<00:00:14.830> volts<00:00:15.280> will<00:00:15.460> spin<00:00:15.790> at<00:00:15.940> about<00:00:16.180> 2,000<00:00:17.020> rpm

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
at 72 volts will spin at about 2,000 rpm

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.840 
at 72 volts will spin at about 2,000 rpm
under<00:00:19.300> load<00:00:19.480> under<00:00:20.290> load<00:00:20.610> it<00:00:21.610> would<00:00:21.730> actually

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
under load under load it would actually

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.000 
under load under load it would actually
keep<00:00:22.119> going<00:00:22.450> faster<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:23.110> faster<00:00:23.290> and<00:00:23.800> fat

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
keep going faster and faster and fat

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.410 
keep going faster and faster and fat
that's<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.460> fun<00:00:24.610> thing<00:00:24.640> with<00:00:24.880> series<00:00:25.119> motors

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
that's the fun thing with series motors

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.080 
that's the fun thing with series motors
if<00:00:25.780> you<00:00:26.110> if<00:00:26.980> you<00:00:27.100> apply<00:00:27.340> a<00:00:27.369> voltage<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.940> them

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
if you if you apply a voltage to them

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.270 
if you if you apply a voltage to them
and<00:00:28.240> there's<00:00:28.750> no<00:00:28.900> load<00:00:29.170> they<00:00:29.710> will<00:00:29.860> actually

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
and there's no load they will actually

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.549 
and there's no load they will actually
what's<00:00:30.910> called<00:00:31.119> running<00:00:31.780> away<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.379> they'll

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
what's called running away and they'll

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.170 
what's called running away and they'll
just<00:00:32.619> continue<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.129> accelerate<00:00:33.460> until<00:00:33.850> they

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
just continue to accelerate until they

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.770 
just continue to accelerate until they
explode<00:00:35.100> which<00:00:36.100> sounds<00:00:36.400> pretty<00:00:36.640> fun<00:00:36.940> but<00:00:37.720> we

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
explode which sounds pretty fun but we

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.000 
explode which sounds pretty fun but we
only<00:00:37.930> have<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.170> one<00:00:38.260> motor<00:00:38.590> so<00:00:38.800> we<00:00:38.830> don't

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
only have the one motor so we don't

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.470 
only have the one motor so we don't
really<00:00:39.070> want<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.370> want<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.180> do<00:00:40.270> that

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
really want to want to do that

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.350 
really want to want to do that
unfortunately<00:00:41.410> hey<00:00:41.890> guys<00:00:42.040> so<00:00:42.460> we<00:00:42.820> have<00:00:42.909> 2,000

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
unfortunately hey guys so we have 2,000

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.420 
unfortunately hey guys so we have 2,000
rpm<00:00:43.720> and<00:00:43.989> we<00:00:44.199> have<00:00:44.350> all<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.559> gear<00:00:44.739> ratios<00:00:45.190> and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
rpm and we have all the gear ratios and

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.799 
rpm and we have all the gear ratios and
the<00:00:45.519> size<00:00:45.729> of<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:45.940> tire<00:00:46.120> so<00:00:46.150> we<00:00:46.479> can<00:00:46.570> do<00:00:46.659> some

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
the size of the tire so we can do some

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.600 
the size of the tire so we can do some
quick<00:00:46.930> calculations<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.769> find<00:00:48.010> out<00:00:48.129> how<00:00:48.280> fast

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
quick calculations and find out how fast

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.060 
quick calculations and find out how fast
this<00:00:48.790> guy<00:00:49.000> could<00:00:49.180> go

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:05.620 

111<00:00:55.070> polish<00:00:55.910> prayer<00:01:00.790> that's<00:01:01.790> pretty<00:01:02.000> fast<00:01:04.630> 31

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
111 polish prayer that's pretty fast 31

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.219 
111 polish prayer that's pretty fast 31
meters<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.990> second<00:01:10.450> all<00:01:11.450> right<00:01:11.630> time<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.080> buy

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
meters a second all right time to buy

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:28.640 
meters a second all right time to buy
some<00:01:12.440> parts

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:39.980 

you

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.660 

so<00:01:40.990> we'd<00:01:41.140> well<00:01:41.320> this<00:01:41.799> adapter<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.429> in<00:01:42.579> this

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
so we'd well this adapter on in this

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.749 
so we'd well this adapter on in this
bracket<00:01:43.679> this<00:01:44.679> would<00:01:44.920> attach<00:01:45.189> to<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.549> motor

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
bracket this would attach to the motor

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.959 
bracket this would attach to the motor
and<00:01:46.060> it'll<00:01:46.270> be<00:01:46.359> welded<00:01:46.659> in<00:01:46.719> place<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.649> then<00:01:48.549> we

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
and it'll be welded in place and then we

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.270 
and it'll be welded in place and then we
would<00:01:49.090> drill<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.600> tap<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:50.170> bolt<00:01:50.799> pattern<00:01:51.159> onto

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
would drill and tap a bolt pattern onto

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.370 
would drill and tap a bolt pattern onto
here<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:51.909> then<00:01:52.509> we<00:01:52.630> could<00:01:52.780> buy<00:01:52.929> different

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
here and then we could buy different

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:06.569 
here and then we could buy different
sized<00:01:53.709> sprockets<00:02:00.450> Oh<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:02.229> 6<00:02:02.530> bucks<00:02:05.039> yeah<00:02:06.039> that's

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
sized sprockets Oh a 6 bucks yeah that's

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.529 
sized sprockets Oh a 6 bucks yeah that's
probably<00:02:06.729> easy<00:02:07.030> way<00:02:07.179> to<00:02:07.240> do<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:08.220> yeah<00:02:09.220> we

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
probably easy way to do it so yeah we

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.820 
probably easy way to do it so yeah we
dis<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.690> firmly<00:02:10.989> attached<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.410> motor<00:02:11.590> and

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
dis is firmly attached to the motor and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.619 
dis is firmly attached to the motor and
then<00:02:14.610> these<00:02:15.610> Billick<00:02:15.970> rear<00:02:16.120> sprocket<00:02:16.480> that

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
then these Billick rear sprocket that

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.330 
then these Billick rear sprocket that
they'll<00:02:16.930> always<00:02:17.049> be<00:02:17.349> centered<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.250> you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
they'll always be centered to so you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.620 
they'll always be centered to so you
don't<00:02:18.489> have<00:02:18.610> any

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.860

some well the both hinges these are
going<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.170> be<00:03:28.260> used<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:29.000> mount<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.210> motor<00:03:30.450> so

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
going to be used to mount the motor so

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.150 
going to be used to mount the motor so
we<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:30.960> have<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.080> tensioning<00:03:31.470> system<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:38.130> a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
we can have a tensioning system so a

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.100 
we can have a tensioning system so a
half<00:03:38.520> inch<00:03:38.760> threaded<00:03:39.060> rod<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:39.630> if<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.840> sort<00:03:40.050> of

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
half inch threaded rod so if the sort of

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.960 
half inch threaded rod so if the sort of
nuts<00:03:40.410> also<00:03:41.070> going<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.370> be<00:03:41.460> used<00:03:41.640> for<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
nuts also going to be used for the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.920 
nuts also going to be used for the
tensioning

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.770 

alright<00:03:45.930> let's<00:03:46.500> do<00:03:46.620> this
