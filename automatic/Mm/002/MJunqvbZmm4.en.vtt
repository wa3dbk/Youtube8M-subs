producers and DJs doing live on base
deafness<00:00:43.900> have<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:44.740> look<00:00:44.950> at<00:00:45.100> it

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.980 

okay<00:00:49.040> so<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.280> first<00:00:49.310> step<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.030> load<00:00:50.540> up<00:00:50.750> the

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
okay so the first step is to load up the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.130 
okay so the first step is to load up the
simpler<00:00:51.620> in<00:00:51.980> Ableton<00:00:52.480> which<00:00:53.480> done<00:00:53.720> here<00:00:53.930> and

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
simpler in Ableton which done here and

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.890 
simpler in Ableton which done here and
just<00:00:54.380> put<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.650> a<00:00:54.800> basic<00:00:55.400> square<00:00:55.730> wave<00:00:56.030> which<00:00:56.720> if

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
just put in a basic square wave which if

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.210 
just put in a basic square wave which if
you<00:00:56.990> play<00:00:57.200> it<00:00:57.230> just<00:00:57.530> straight<00:00:57.800> on<00:00:57.920> its<00:00:58.070> own

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
you play it just straight on its own

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.689 
you play it just straight on its own
will<00:00:58.640> sound<00:00:58.820> like<00:00:58.940> this<00:01:03.250> definitely<00:01:04.250> not<00:01:04.460> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
will sound like this definitely not the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.250 
will sound like this definitely not the
dubstep<00:01:05.270> sounds<00:01:05.750> that<00:01:05.870> we're<00:01:05.990> trying<00:01:06.050> to

Ableton<00:01:12.890> there's<00:01:13.100> plenty<00:01:13.370> reviews<00:01:13.790> about

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
Ableton there's plenty reviews about

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.880 
Ableton there's plenty reviews about
that<00:01:14.150> look<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.690> up<00:01:14.720> on<00:01:14.870> youtube<00:01:14.900> you'll<00:01:15.680> find

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
that look it up on youtube you'll find

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.840 
that look it up on youtube you'll find
it<00:01:16.030> but<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.090> basic<00:01:17.450> gist<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:17.900> is<00:01:18.760> this<00:01:19.760> to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
it but the basic gist of it is this to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.550 
it but the basic gist of it is this to
go<00:01:19.940> bandpass<00:01:20.330> filter<00:01:23.110> just<00:01:24.110> knocks<00:01:24.350> out<00:01:24.530> all

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
go bandpass filter just knocks out all

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.040 
go bandpass filter just knocks out all
the<00:01:24.800> high<00:01:24.950> ends<00:01:25.280> makes<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.670> bit<00:01:25.880> chubbier<00:01:29.050> over

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
the high ends makes a bit chubbier over

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
the high ends makes a bit chubbier over
here<00:01:30.350> change<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.430> glides<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.930> floyd<00:01:35.979> give<00:01:36.979> it

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
here change the glides to floyd give it

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.700 
here change the glides to floyd give it
a<00:01:37.160> smoother<00:01:37.520> transitions<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:39.290> finally

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
a smoother transitions and then finally

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.359 
a smoother transitions and then finally
the<00:01:39.830> main<00:01:40.009> bit<00:01:40.220> which<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.030> turned<00:01:41.479> on<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> LFO

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
the main bit which is turned on the LFO

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.969 
the main bit which is turned on the LFO
I've<00:01:43.369> already<00:01:43.670> programmed<00:01:44.270> in<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:45.229> type<00:01:45.950> of

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
I've already programmed in the type of

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.920 
I've already programmed in the type of
waveform<00:01:46.460> at<00:01:46.610> war<00:01:46.700> for<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.910> LFO<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.540> the

waveform at war for the LFO and the
speed<00:01:48.910> if<00:01:49.910> we<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.210> listen<00:01:50.570> now

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.030 

much<00:01:59.119> more<00:01:59.420> I<00:01:59.690> got<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.260> Welcome<00:02:00.680> much<00:02:00.830> more

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
much more I got the Welcome much more

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.859 
much more I got the Welcome much more
that<00:02:01.130> dubstep<00:02:01.540> sounds<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:02.690> we're<00:02:02.810> looking

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
that dubstep sounds that we're looking

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.930 
that dubstep sounds that we're looking
for<00:02:04.330> alright<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.509> next<00:02:05.630> step<00:02:05.930> of<00:02:06.140> them<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:07.700> to

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
for alright the next step of them is to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.430 
for alright the next step of them is to
pre-program<00:02:09.610> some<00:02:10.610> automation<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.410> is

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
pre-program some automation so this is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.979 
pre-program some automation so this is
our<00:02:12.740> baseline<00:02:13.310> here<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.120> look<00:02:14.390> square<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.959> 1

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
our baseline here and look square a 1

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.260 
our baseline here and look square a 1
and<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:16.100> sell<00:02:16.280> programmed<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.850> four

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and you sell programmed in four

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.690 
and you sell programmed in four
different<00:02:17.480> effects<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.580> first

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
different effects so the first

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.160 
different effects so the first
modulation<00:02:20.209> about<00:02:20.480> here<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.810> for<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
modulation about here is for the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.000 
modulation about here is for the
frequency<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:23.060> you'll<00:02:23.209> notice<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.319> first

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
frequency so you'll notice for the first

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.949 
frequency so you'll notice for the first
bar<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.610> I'm<00:02:25.670> going<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.880> play<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.090> it'll

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
bar that I'm going to play you it'll

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.400 
bar that I'm going to play you it'll
just<00:02:26.989> be<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:28.360> fixed<00:02:29.360> frequency<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:30.170> be<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
just be a fixed frequency that be the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.610 
just be a fixed frequency that be the
sub<00:02:30.620> base<00:02:30.830> then<00:02:31.730> when<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.030> breaks<00:02:32.300> into<00:02:32.660> kind

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
sub base then when it breaks into kind

up<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.600> down<00:02:38.769> giving<00:02:39.769> much<00:02:39.980> more<00:02:40.010> movement<00:02:40.630> or

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
up and down giving much more movement or

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
so on two sections of the song I've

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.180 
so on two sections of the song I've

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220

the<00:02:49.300> type<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.380> waveform<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.530> going<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.769> change

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
the type of waveform is going to change

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.190 
the type of waveform is going to change
from<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.640> square<00:02:52.970> wave<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.360> triangle<00:02:53.870> wave

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.420 

aside<00:02:57.200> from<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.440> sine<00:02:57.650> wave<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:58.040> angle<00:02:58.400> way<00:02:59.200> and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
aside from a sine wave to angle way and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.060 
aside from a sine wave to angle way and
finally<00:03:01.430> I've<00:03:01.640> also<00:03:01.820> changed<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.900> sink<00:03:03.829> rate

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
finally I've also changed the sink rate

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.850 
finally I've also changed the sink rate
for<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.640> LFO<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.079> won't<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.290> be<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.590> same

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
for the LFO so it won't just be the same

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.860 
for the LFO so it won't just be the same
boring<00:03:07.340> speed<00:03:07.790> wobble<00:03:08.150> all<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.420> time<00:03:08.630> it's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
boring speed wobble all the time it's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.770 
boring speed wobble all the time it's
going<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.049> really<00:03:09.260> give<00:03:09.530> us<00:03:09.650> some<00:03:09.799> movement<00:03:10.780> so

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
going to really give us some movement so

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.449 
going to really give us some movement so
all<00:03:11.989> we<00:03:12.019> have<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.290> do<00:03:12.530> when<00:03:12.920> as<00:03:13.220> you're<00:03:13.400> playing

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
all we have to do when as you're playing

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.860 
all we have to do when as you're playing
the<00:03:13.670> bass<00:03:13.820> is<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.180> make<00:03:14.299> sure<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.540> hit<00:03:14.690> in<00:03:14.780> the

software and the pretty programming that
we've<00:03:19.910> already<00:03:20.120> done<00:03:20.450> we'll<00:03:21.230> do<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.010> hard

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
we've already done we'll do the hard

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.830 
we've already done we'll do the hard
work<00:03:22.280> for<00:03:22.459> us<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:23.000> will<00:03:23.060> give<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.299> a<00:03:23.360> movement

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
work for us it will give it a movement

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.430 
work for us it will give it a movement
and<00:03:24.049> a<00:03:24.110> variety<00:03:25.299> ok<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:26.359> let's<00:03:27.019> have<00:03:27.109> listened

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
and a variety ok so let's have listened

00:03:27.440 --> 00:04:30.960 
and a variety ok so let's have listened
to<00:03:27.500> see<00:03:27.590> how<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.829> sounds

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.400 

okay<00:04:31.970> so<00:04:32.030> hopefully<00:04:32.540> from<00:04:32.660> my<00:04:32.780> demo<00:04:33.110> you'll<00:04:33.290> be

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
okay so hopefully from my demo you'll be

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.910 
okay so hopefully from my demo you'll be
able<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.620> see<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:35.660> variety<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:36.320> sounds<00:04:36.590> you

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
able to see the variety of sounds you

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.750 
able to see the variety of sounds you
can<00:04:37.040> create<00:04:37.400> using<00:04:37.700> them<00:04:38.030> yourself<00:04:38.540> like<00:04:38.840> this

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
can create using them yourself like this

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.480
