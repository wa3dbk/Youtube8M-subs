00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 I'm posting the video again 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.730
 about the tablet daemon nbc to 05 da 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.580
 because there were many doubts 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.950
 in relation to the battery g2 inside and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.820
 I connected a keyboard on it shows that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.560
 works that house in that case there will already 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.680
 starting with the most frequent questions of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.480
 The only serious question is , who has to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.510
 set one thing up 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.199
 now enter the setup move one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.269
 thing 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.669
 simple answer in the ANP is doing 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.610
 absolutely nothing 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.320
 just put tg immediately to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.899
 being on the toll mouse or keyboard 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.469
 professional staff are immediately 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.750
 calculated originated front EPO 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:51.180
 connector gave another big problem 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:55.610
 But I bought a 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 cable and my tablet did not recognize 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.840
 did not detect anything is the same thing 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 had nothing left idle is one thing 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.860
 all 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.720
 the following happens this car has the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.939
 same censor function of an extra case 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 fia two here're getting so that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:21.240
 fcm style here teaching occurs that 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.790
 these two cables are mere tensioners 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.700
 you not only with request 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.090
 another interesting case is pursued 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.420
 serve but requires more friendly endesa 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.640
 receiving this beginning was 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.079
 less does not yield 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.009
 this one here for example two inputs 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.649
 sbcm other cold 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.950
 summarizing only here for me 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.020
 I flee from them that I bought these cables 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.560
 here special that the Russian team then 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.439
 dump a trying cable and tries 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.399
 got the right now but one with a 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.200
 cable or tg 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.810
 this is the case until we're there only ever look 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.179
 begins to have the size of its size in 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.560
 smaller size is much smaller in relation to 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:17.739
 two professionals showing defending themselves 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.069
 and maxixe thus but copci points 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.689
 difference that brings two here is 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.030
 different from those two that only 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.360
 extension mode 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.360
 this one here active so I thought of 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.790
 take that chance mode purple hawks that this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.030
 mode enables you to 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.280
 connect a pen drives on it's keyboard 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.140
 mouse and then what happens it enables 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.190
 actually recognize the tablet 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.769
 devices 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.560
 that's the big difference and active 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.560
 modules under different ordinances that do not 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.260
 do nothing then advise again 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.359
 Escape from this group I went to the tv me 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.739
 ralei this is the car that meets yes it is 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.319
 again not only asked how it is 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.840
 get to stay where you got this one 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.639
 For a lot of music, a lot of suffering. 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.909
 in the city â€‹â€‹that by the way was 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.409
 hard to achieve but I managed but it has 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.560
 one- third of a staff that even scored 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.180
 I believe it works but not for 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.660
 people to trial and error investigation 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.760
 of these 16 queue there but from what I saw 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.650
 having recommended that they seem to add 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.169
 here I am little being made here 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.680
 worth a try us out talked a 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.680
 hug
