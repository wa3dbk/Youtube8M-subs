00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:05.960 

now<00:00:04.259> we're<00:00:04.380> gonna<00:00:04.470> talk<00:00:04.710> about<00:00:04.850> serving<00:00:05.850> and

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
now we're gonna talk about serving and

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.340 
now we're gonna talk about serving and
receiving<00:00:06.330> over<00:00:06.450> distance<00:00:06.990> there<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.230> a

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
receiving over distance there is a

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.110 
receiving over distance there is a
fundamental<00:00:08.099> level<00:00:08.280> for<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.030> what

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
fundamental level for this and what

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.169 
fundamental level for this and what
we're<00:00:09.240> gonna<00:00:09.300> try<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.570> teach<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.849> giving<00:00:11.849> every

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
we're gonna try to teach is giving every

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.390 
we're gonna try to teach is giving every
player<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.809> aptitude<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.590> serve<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> flighted

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
player the aptitude to serve a flighted

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.010 
player the aptitude to serve a flighted
ball<00:00:14.610> over<00:00:14.880> distance<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.480> reason<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.900> a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
ball over distance the reason this is a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.410 
ball over distance the reason this is a
bit<00:00:16.230> more<00:00:16.410> fundamental<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.640> flighted<00:00:18.240> ball

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
bit more fundamental is a flighted ball

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.620 
bit more fundamental is a flighted ball
is<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> user<00:00:18.990> friendly<00:00:19.820> attacking<00:00:20.820> service<00:00:21.359> so

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
is a user friendly attacking service so

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.259 
is a user friendly attacking service so
with<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:21.990> user<00:00:22.230> friendly<00:00:22.800> ball<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.279> hangs<00:00:24.029> up

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
with this user friendly ball it hangs up

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.000 
with this user friendly ball it hangs up
in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.420> air<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.660> bit<00:00:24.869> longer<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.470> easier<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
in the air a bit longer it's easier to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.710 
in the air a bit longer it's easier to
control<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.580> we'll<00:00:26.670> start<00:00:26.910> out<00:00:27.029> fundamentally

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
control so we'll start out fundamentally

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.710 
control so we'll start out fundamentally
with<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.410> flighted<00:00:28.800> ball<00:00:29.449> now<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.630> we're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
with the flighted ball now what we're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.080 
with the flighted ball now what we're
gonna<00:00:30.779> look<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.529> Laurie<00:00:31.980> fair<00:00:32.430> pinging<00:00:32.850> a

gonna look at is Laurie fair pinging a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.700 
gonna look at is Laurie fair pinging a
flighted<00:00:33.450> ball<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:33.930> she's<00:00:34.079> gonna<00:00:34.170> try<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.440> do

flighted ball what she's gonna try to do

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.150 
flighted ball what she's gonna try to do
is<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.640> flatten<00:00:36.120> her<00:00:36.300> foot<00:00:36.660> point<00:00:37.559> her<00:00:37.680> toe<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
is to flatten her foot point her toe and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.970 
is to flatten her foot point her toe and
get<00:00:38.730> her<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.360> stepped<00:00:39.780> underneath<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.649> center

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
underneath the center of the ball it's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
underneath the center of the ball it's
gonna<00:00:44.700> impart<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.239> spin<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.899> backspin<00:00:46.500> that's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
gonna impart a spin with backspin that's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
gonna impart a spin with backspin that's
gonna<00:00:46.800> float<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.969> Laurie<00:00:48.180> calumny<00:00:48.690> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
what Laurie's challenge is is to site

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.120 
what Laurie's challenge is is to site
Kalani's<00:01:11.700> ball<00:01:11.970> early<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> control<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.860> here

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
Kalani's ball early and control it here

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.980 
Kalani's ball early and control it here
we<00:01:14.220> go

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
we go

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
we go
so<00:01:15.990> she<00:01:16.049> moves<00:01:16.320> her<00:01:16.409> feet<00:01:16.680> she<00:01:17.040> gets<00:01:17.220> ready<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so she moves her feet she gets ready and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
so she moves her feet she gets ready and
then<00:01:18.030> gives<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.509> her<00:01:18.600> foot<00:01:18.900> perfect<00:01:19.470> touch

then gives with her foot perfect touch

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320 
then gives with her foot perfect touch
here<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.430> play<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.670> off<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.060> next

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
here to play it off with the next

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.429 
here to play it off with the next
service<00:01:25.759> we<00:01:26.759> talked<00:01:27.000> earlier<00:01:27.360> about

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
service we talked earlier about

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.630 
service we talked earlier about
developing<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> technique<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.159> serving<00:01:29.520> a

user<00:01:29.909> friendly<00:01:30.479> flighted<00:01:30.930> ball<00:01:31.140> there's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
user friendly flighted ball there's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
user friendly flighted ball there's
certain<00:01:31.740> contexts<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> game<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:33.000> that's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
certain contexts in the game when that's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.929 
certain contexts in the game when that's
an<00:01:33.299> invaluable<00:01:33.710> technique<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> select<00:01:35.310> you're

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
an invaluable technique to select you're

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.370 
an invaluable technique to select you're
playing<00:01:36.210> against<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> flat<00:01:36.720> defense<00:01:37.170> you're

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
playing against the flat defense you're

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.539 
playing against the flat defense you're
trying<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> figure<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.950> way<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> ball

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549

player running on to it one of the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.389 
player running on to it one of the
problems<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.259> don't<00:01:43.470> flight<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
problems is if you don't flight it the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.770 
problems is if you don't flight it the
ball<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.939> driven<00:01:45.149> goes<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
ball if it's driven goes right out of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.090 
ball if it's driven goes right out of
bounce<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> flighted<00:01:46.740> ball<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
bounce so a flighted ball in that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.190 
bounce so a flighted ball in that
context<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> first<00:01:48.210> choice<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.899> if

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
context is the first choice but if

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.840 
context is the first choice but if
you're<00:01:49.799> changing<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.399> point<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> attack

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you're changing the point of the attack

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.060 
you're changing the point of the attack
like<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.630> left<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.259> has<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> ball

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
like your left back has the ball

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
like your left back has the ball
the<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:53.610> midfielder<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.270> open<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.720> don't

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the right midfielder is open you don't

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.359 
the right midfielder is open you don't
want<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> serve<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> flighted<00:01:55.740> ball<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.070> spends

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
want to serve a flighted ball it spends

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.280 
want to serve a flighted ball it spends
so<00:01:56.490> much<00:01:56.549> time<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.149> air<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.869> other<00:01:58.020> teams

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
so much time in the air the other teams

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.889 
so much time in the air the other teams
defense<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:58.860> shift<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> basically<00:02:00.210> cut<00:02:00.689> that

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
defense can shift and basically cut that

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.230 
defense can shift and basically cut that
ball<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.680> need<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> driven<00:02:02.219> ball<00:02:02.549> so

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
ball out so you need a driven ball so

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.580 
ball out so you need a driven ball so
what<00:02:03.420> Laurie<00:02:03.869> fares<00:02:04.140> gonna<00:02:04.320> demonstrate

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
what Laurie fares gonna demonstrate

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.010 
what Laurie fares gonna demonstrate
right<00:02:05.070> now<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.000> driven<00:02:06.240> ball<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> spends

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
right now is the driven ball it spends

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.309 
right now is the driven ball it spends
less<00:02:07.229> time<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.770> air<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.489> gets<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.090> its

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
less time in the air it gets to its

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.400 
less time in the air it gets to its
object<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.709> its<00:02:11.459> target<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> lot<00:02:12.090> faster

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
object and its target a lot faster

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.840 
object and its target a lot faster
it's<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> different<00:02:13.920> technique<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:14.640> let's

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
it's a different technique so let's

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's a different technique so let's
envision<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:16.260> lorry<00:02:16.890> fare<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.460> pinging<00:02:17.820> this

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
envision that lorry fare is pinging this

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.580 
envision that lorry fare is pinging this
over<00:02:18.390> distance<00:02:18.840> she<00:02:18.990> doesn't<00:02:19.290> want<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> lot<00:02:19.530> of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
over distance she doesn't want a lot of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.740 
over distance she doesn't want a lot of
hang<00:02:19.860> time<00:02:20.190> she<00:02:20.730> wants<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.330> there

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
hang time she wants to get it there

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.850 
hang time she wants to get it there
so<00:02:22.380> she<00:02:22.440> selected<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.100> driven<00:02:23.460> ball<00:02:24.860> doesn't

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
so she selected a driven ball doesn't

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800 
so she selected a driven ball doesn't
come<00:02:26.010> underneath<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.550> center<00:02:26.880> drive<00:02:27.510> through

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
come underneath the center drive through

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.380 
come underneath the center drive through
it<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> shot<00:02:28.490> now<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.670> doesn't<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.210> any

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it like a shot now it doesn't have any

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.660 
it like a shot now it doesn't have any
backspin<00:02:30.960> and<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.620> gets<00:02:31.830> there<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.220> quickly

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
backspin and it gets there as quickly

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.120 
backspin and it gets there as quickly
and<00:02:33.030> efficiently<00:02:33.630> as<00:02:34.260> possible

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
and efficiently as possible

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.230 
and efficiently as possible
Lori<00:02:35.520> well<00:02:35.730> done<00:02:40.550> now<00:02:41.550> what<00:02:41.760> we're<00:02:41.910> gonna<00:02:41.970> do

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
Lori well done now what we're gonna do

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.210 
Lori well done now what we're gonna do
is<00:02:42.360> we're<00:02:42.480> gonna<00:02:42.540> test<00:02:42.990> their<00:02:43.740> ability<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
is we're gonna test their ability to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.920 
is we're gonna test their ability to
serve<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.610> receive<00:02:44.880> over<00:02:45.120> distance<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.750> this

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
serve and receive over distance and this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.570 
serve and receive over distance and this
is<00:02:46.140> one<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.530> few<00:02:46.740> tests<00:02:47.160> that's<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.460> only

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
is one of the few tests that's not only

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.760 
is one of the few tests that's not only
good<00:02:47.790> as<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> test<00:02:48.330> but<00:02:48.990> it's<00:02:49.140> excellent<00:02:49.470> for

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
good as a test but it's excellent for

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.140 
good as a test but it's excellent for
training<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.220> try<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.700> once<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.120> week

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
training we try to do this once a week

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.790 
training we try to do this once a week
at<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> University<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> North<00:02:52.140> Carolina<00:02:52.200> it

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
at the University of North Carolina it

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.650 
at the University of North Carolina it
helps<00:02:53.400> our<00:02:53.520> girls<00:02:53.790> immensely<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.450> what<00:02:54.570> we're

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
minute we're gonna see how many balls

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.690 
minute we're gonna see how many balls
they<00:03:00.870> can<00:03:01.050> serve<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.590> receive<00:03:01.920> successfully

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
they can serve and receive successfully

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.820 
they can serve and receive successfully
over<00:03:03.300> 25<00:03:03.810> yards<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.440> there's<00:03:04.530> gonna<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.740> a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
over 25 yards and there's gonna be a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.100 
over 25 yards and there's gonna be a
short<00:03:05.010> break<00:03:05.340> we're<00:03:05.940> gonna<00:03:06.030> back<00:03:06.300> them<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.600> ten

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
short break we're gonna back them up ten

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.250 
short break we're gonna back them up ten
yards<00:03:07.530> same<00:03:08.070> thing<00:03:08.280> over<00:03:08.400> 35<00:03:09.090> for<00:03:09.810> one<00:03:09.930> minute

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
yards same thing over 35 for one minute

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.870 
yards same thing over 35 for one minute
then<00:03:10.530> another<00:03:10.740> break<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.190> back<00:03:11.460> them<00:03:11.640> up<00:03:11.760> to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
then another break and back them up to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.880 
then another break and back them up to
45<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.690> all<00:03:13.110> we're<00:03:13.260> doing<00:03:13.470> right<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:13.650> is

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
45 and all we're doing right now is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.560 
45 and all we're doing right now is
counting<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.580> correct<00:03:15.210> number<00:03:15.540> of

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
counting the correct number of

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.670 
counting the correct number of
receptions<00:03:16.410> over<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.160> course<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.640> 25<00:03:18.360> 35<00:03:18.990> 45

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
receptions over the course of 25 35 45

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.820 
receptions over the course of 25 35 45
yards<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.340> let's<00:03:20.490> watch<00:03:20.640> them<00:03:20.820> work<00:03:21.830> high

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
yards so let's watch them work high

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.410 
yards so let's watch them work high
that's<00:03:23.010> one<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:24.050> they're<00:03:25.050> alternating<00:03:25.380> feet

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
that's one and they're alternating feet

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.110 
that's one and they're alternating feet
that's<00:03:27.420> two<00:03:28.220> now<00:03:29.220> it's<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.520> less<00:03:29.730> well

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
that's two now it's the less well

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.340 
that's two now it's the less well
prepared<00:03:30.150> note<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.110> play<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.320> in
