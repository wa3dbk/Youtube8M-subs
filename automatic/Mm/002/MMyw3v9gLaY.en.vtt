00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.960
 hello day we will see how 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.809
 deposit of headlight bulb on a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.850
 peugeot 106 so there is no need 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.519
 of specific tools just immobilize 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:27.570
 the car and open the hood then in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.429
 a first step so we position ourselves at 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.790
 level of the lighthouse for which we want 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.920
 change the year break we just have to unscrew 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.710
 the small plastic cover that covers 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.950
 bulbs or chestnut all there all the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 network and rich gold that's in the sense 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.770
 counterclockwise a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:52.649
 con me davis this little hood once 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.280
 that we have this so the ideal is the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.440
 unplug directly 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.350
 I have already done so suddenly we shoot 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 the plug for to unplug the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.290
 bulbs and after we have a little one 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.750
 small metal guppy as is 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.200
 must first pushed and then rotate 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:18.659
 clockwise it is after seven 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 so bad tips so after can switch to 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.259
 the back and released the year hen this is my 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.979
 small bouquet that rocks in the arena 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.979
 and in pool that can come out 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.640
 so that was how to drop a light bulb 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.000
 of lighthouse on a Peugeot 106 with 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.000
 carbon
