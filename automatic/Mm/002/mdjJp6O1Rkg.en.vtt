00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
button to be a hard click see between

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
button to be a hard click see between
those<00:01:05.700> two<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.479> face<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> middle

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
those two because if face in the middle

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.770 
those two because if face in the middle
of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> lights<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.430> ballast<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:09.000> fry<00:01:09.240> okay

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of the lights the ballast will fry okay

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
of the lights the ballast will fry okay
if<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> gets<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> anything<00:01:10.770> other<00:01:11.040> than<00:01:11.220> zero

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
if it gets to anything other than zero

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
if it gets to anything other than zero
enough<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> four<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> put<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.260> bracer

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
enough and four so I put a little bracer

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.590 
enough and four so I put a little bracer
in<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> prevent<00:01:14.369> somebody<00:01:14.700> from<00:01:14.880> even

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
in here to prevent somebody from even

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
in here to prevent somebody from even
doing<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.990> okay<00:01:16.350> cool<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.070> gonna<00:01:17.159> take

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.350 
doing that okay cool but I'm gonna take
that<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.729> well<00:01:19.250> obviously<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.820> functionality

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that as well obviously the functionality

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
that as well obviously the functionality
is<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.479> similar<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.350> pulled<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.130> Ali<00:01:23.280> set

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
is very similar I pulled out the Ali set

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.780 
is very similar I pulled out the Ali set
for<00:01:23.909> instance<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.710> established<00:01:26.250> the

for instance I have not established the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.460 
for instance I have not established the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
don't get the context of all of them you

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
don't get the context of all of them you
just<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.329> happens<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.780> in

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
just get that one that happens to be in

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.270 
just get that one that happens to be in
the<00:01:58.020> shot<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.439> then<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.950> blinky

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the shot and then it's just a blinky

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.300 
the shot and then it's just a blinky
light<00:02:00.079> looks<00:02:01.079> great<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.530> wide<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.130> that's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
light looks great on a wide but that's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.640 
light looks great on a wide but that's
about<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.090 

as<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.770> can<00:02:11.860> see<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.460> ham<00:02:13.020> /<00:02:14.020> know-how<00:02:14.440> set<00:02:14.830> I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
as you can see the ham / know-how set I

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.770 
as you can see the ham / know-how set I
finally<00:02:15.610> pulled<00:02:15.850> out<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.240> key<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.630> fill

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
finally pulled out the key to fill

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.410 
finally pulled out the key to fill
they're<00:02:16.930> all<00:02:17.050> isolated<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:18.430> very<00:02:19.120> close

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
they're all isolated so it's very close

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.920 
they're all isolated so it's very close
but<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.750> do

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
but I do

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.290 
but I do
I<00:02:20.350> definitely<00:02:20.620> isolated<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.490> fill<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
I definitely isolated the fill and the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.840 
I definitely isolated the fill and the
back<00:02:22.810> lights<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.410> all<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.650> sets<00:02:24.040> because<00:02:24.580> I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
back lights on all the sets because I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.780 
space for expansion down here these have
no<00:02:31.180> function<00:02:31.720> they're<00:02:31.840> not<00:02:31.930> programmed<00:02:32.140> and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
blah blah blah the monitor access to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.080 
blah blah blah the monitor access to
actually<00:03:08.410> view<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:09.100> board's<00:03:09.730> interface<00:03:10.180> is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
actually view the board's interface is

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.960 
actually view the board's interface is
not<00:03:13.090> yeah<00:03:13.420> not<00:03:14.260> yet<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.709> will<00:03:15.070> cause<00:03:15.580> of<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.850> end

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
not yeah not yet I will cause of the end

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.630 
not yeah not yet I will cause of the end
of<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.330> lake<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.380> here's<00:03:17.830> here's<00:03:18.310> all<00:03:18.520> the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
of the lake so here's here's all the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.550 
of the lake so here's here's all the
channels<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.270> 1<00:03:19.420> 2<00:03:19.540> 3<00:03:19.600> 4<00:03:19.840> plastics<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.470> you

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
channels like 1 2 3 4 plastics so you

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.729 
channels like 1 2 3 4 plastics so you
can<00:03:20.709> see<00:03:20.890> all<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.310> them<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.000> their<00:03:22.090> values<00:03:22.739> and

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
can see all of them and their values and

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.850 
can see all of them and their values and
then<00:03:23.920> if<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.370> actually<00:03:24.850> have<00:03:25.150> more<00:03:25.390> than<00:03:25.600> this

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
then if I actually have more than this

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.949 
then if I actually have more than this
programmed<00:03:26.860> in<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.610> can<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.480> hit<00:03:28.660> page

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
programmed in so you can you hit page

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.260 
programmed in so you can you hit page
Wow<00:03:32.130> but<00:03:33.130> anyway<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.820> interface<00:03:34.209> for

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
Wow but anyway this is the interface for

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.970 
Wow but anyway this is the interface for
all<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:35.080> if<00:03:35.350> there's<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.680> catastrophic

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
all that so if there's a catastrophic

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.760 
all that so if there's a catastrophic
failure<00:03:36.520> I<00:03:36.850> can<00:03:37.150> walk<00:03:37.390> somebody<00:03:37.840> right<00:03:38.530> walk

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
failure I can walk somebody right walk

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.410 
failure I can walk somebody right walk
somebody<00:03:39.040> through<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:40.390> know<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:43.120> isn't

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
somebody through it you know this isn't

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.460 
somebody through it you know this isn't
that<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.540> isn't<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:44.020> screen<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.320> will

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that this isn't a screen that will

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.330 
that this isn't a screen that will
likely<00:03:44.800> need<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.190> go<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.459> very<00:03:45.850> often<00:03:46.239> at<00:03:46.360> all

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
likely need to go to very often at all

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.040 
likely need to go to very often at all
there's<00:03:48.340> literally<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:48.940> thing<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.330> somehow

there's literally this thing is somehow
broken<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.860> slipped<00:03:51.130> across<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.640> keys<00:03:51.880> and

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
broken and slipped across the keys and

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:04.190 
broken and slipped across the keys and
all<00:03:52.870> these<00:03:53.050> but<00:03:53.470> only<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.890> thing<00:03:55.860> I<00:04:02.670> got<00:04:03.670> you

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.140 
is it the purpose for this was to give
dual<00:04:11.440> function<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.130> want<00:04:12.489> something<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.910> cover

so anyway the the last piece is this
label<00:04:50.980> but<00:04:51.550> if<00:04:52.120> for<00:04:52.420> whatever<00:04:52.600> reason<00:04:52.780> this<00:04:53.080> is

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
label but if for whatever reason this is

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.530 
label but if for whatever reason this is
missing<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:53.980> you<00:04:54.550> want<00:04:54.850> to<00:04:54.910> check<00:04:55.150> out<00:04:55.330> what's

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
missing and you want to check out what's

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.930 
missing and you want to check out what's
going<00:04:55.780> wrong<00:04:55.930> with<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.170> board<00:04:56.440> this<00:04:57.310> has<00:04:57.760> to

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
going wrong with the board this has to

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.990 
going wrong with the board this has to
be<00:04:58.060> lit<00:04:58.380> it's<00:04:59.380> not<00:04:59.620> if<00:05:00.010> it's<00:05:00.310> another<00:05:00.490> in

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
be lit it's not if it's another in

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.850 
be lit it's not if it's another in
another<00:05:01.300> mode<00:05:01.630> so<00:05:02.020> you're<00:05:02.170> not<00:05:02.380> like<00:05:02.710> the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
another mode so you're not like the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.620 
another mode so you're not like the
board's<00:05:03.160> not<00:05:03.310> doing<00:05:03.580> proper<00:05:03.910> interfacing<00:05:04.510> I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
see this basically tells it operate as

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.230 
see this basically tells it operate as
that's<00:05:08.080> it's<00:05:08.440> live<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.740> mode<00:05:09.280> okay<00:05:09.700> like<00:05:09.940> live

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
