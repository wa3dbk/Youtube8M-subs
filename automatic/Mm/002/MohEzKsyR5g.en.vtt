00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.520
 sites that minecraft de france is a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 example as I found it not that I 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.410
 wanted here so you can see a 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.850
 little that in fact it's a pack like the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.309
 others finally one that looks like 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.710
 defects but besides working you 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.360

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.220
 so here come you go all in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.350

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 in me I do canceled since the already 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.360
 sure here is that there is a small 1 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.280
 so that's it if you have google chrome 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.159
 it arrives at the bottom if not to support you there 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.640

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.680

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.540
 after you put it on your desk 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.290
 like here 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.600

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.840
 do not already do a tutorial you 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.580
 Just look at it so Corsican and you 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.080
 can close 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.500
 you take your kraft pulp makes you 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.790
 accepted at the beginning he goes a little bit rowed 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.380
 that's normal he may be doing 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.690
 minecraft does not answer me it's me 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.570
 not done it's very well accepted or 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.780
 does solo finally you do what you 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.810
 want after I just show one because 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.440
 that it gives so here I have my little 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.630
 sword to do that here you can see that 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.340
 it does not change anyway and that's 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.459
 prettier 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.260
 I find it then by cons if you 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.850
 andy have a train that I do 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.220
 do not recommend taking this pack 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.660
 that it could make you row finally 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.560
 to take any texture pack 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.980
 Moreover, since it can make you 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.660
 moaning here I hope this tutorial you
