00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.300 
was easier to kill then the blue one
that's<00:04:30.550> up<00:04:30.790> close<00:04:31.060> but<00:04:31.930> they're<00:04:32.890> not<00:04:33.010> too<00:04:33.160> hard

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
that's up close but they're not too hard

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.830 
that's up close but they're not too hard
to<00:04:33.430> kill<00:04:33.610> if<00:04:33.730> you<00:04:33.820> just<00:04:34.030> stick<00:04:34.540> them<00:04:34.660> with

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
to kill if you just stick them with

to kill if you just stick them with
enough<00:04:35.110> grenades<00:04:38.100> takes<00:04:39.150> three<00:04:40.150> or<00:04:40.270> four

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
enough grenades takes three or four
