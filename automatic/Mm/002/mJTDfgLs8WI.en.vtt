00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
size to create enough rotation of them

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.969 
size to create enough rotation of them
so<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.460> you've<00:01:04.699> got<00:01:04.729> constant<00:01:05.449> crop<00:01:05.979> I've

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
like over that's what I normally do is

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.450 
like over that's what I normally do is
overfill<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:04.100> drag<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.130> back<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
little bit into into the bowl so it's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.500 
little bit into into the bowl so it's
damp<00:02:09.270> got<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> nice<00:02:10.400> flat<00:02:11.400> service<00:02:11.880> there<00:02:12.150> for

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the windowsill with whiblick rests so I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.970 
the windowsill with whiblick rests so I
should<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:45.810> keep<00:02:46.020> doing<00:02:46.320> our<00:02:46.470> boys<00:02:46.800> are

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
should just keep doing our boys are

meant to be doing so just give it a fair
helping<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.459> seeds<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.030> top<00:02:54.330> there

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
helping the seeds on the top there

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.370 
helping the seeds on the top there
obviously<00:02:55.430> if<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.580> want<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.820> fairly<00:02:57.380> well

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
covered I run out of seeds on that first

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.710 
covered I run out of seeds on that first
one<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:00.750> why<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.019> looks<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.320> sparsely

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
one that's why it looks so sparsely

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.490 
one that's why it looks so sparsely
populated<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:04.440> there<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:06.830> similar

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.340 

so<00:03:11.500> yep<00:03:11.830> that's<00:03:11.860> about<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.780> fair<00:03:13.780> help<00:03:14.050> in<00:03:14.230> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
so yep that's about a fair help in the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.580 
so yep that's about a fair help in the
seeds<00:03:14.650> cover<00:03:15.100> in<00:03:15.280> there<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.760> then<00:03:16.590> get

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
seeds cover in there and then get

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.520 
seeds cover in there and then get
yourself<00:03:17.710> a<00:03:18.010> napkin<00:03:18.660> let's<00:03:19.660> hear<00:03:19.930> this<00:03:20.110> one<00:03:20.380> in

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
yourself a napkin let's hear this one in

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.910 
yourself a napkin let's hear this one in
too<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:23.680> dip<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.160> some<00:03:24.190> water<00:03:25.920> you

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
moist and just lay that over the top of

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.090 
moist and just lay that over the top of
it<00:03:33.730> just<00:03:34.330> until<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.780> starts<00:03:35.080> sprouting<00:03:35.200> once

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
it just until it starts sprouting once

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.120 
it just until it starts sprouting once
you<00:03:36.760> see<00:03:36.940> your<00:03:36.970> seeds<00:03:37.390> a<00:03:37.860> sprouted<00:03:38.860> and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
you see your seeds a sprouted and

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.970 
you see your seeds a sprouted and
growing<00:03:39.550> then<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.790> can<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.180> remove<00:03:40.480> this

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
growing then you can just remove this

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.120 
growing then you can just remove this
just<00:03:41.980> keeps<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.340> bit<00:03:42.490> more<00:03:42.700> moisture<00:03:43.300> in<00:03:43.450> and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
just keeps a bit more moisture in and
