world
a<00:01:47.070> little<00:01:47.550> bit<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.450> bit<00:01:48.570> of

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
a little bit of that and a little bit of

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.210 
a little bit of that and a little bit of
mud<00:01:48.840> made<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.200> perfect<00:01:49.620> definitely<00:01:50.160> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
mud made it perfect definitely a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.910 
mud made it perfect definitely a
different<00:01:50.520> feel<00:01:50.760> really<00:01:51.570> sweet<00:01:52.170> steep

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
different feel really sweet steep

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010 
different feel really sweet steep
nosebleed<00:01:53.670> bleachers<00:01:54.150> up<00:01:54.330> there<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.810> feel

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
nosebleed bleachers up there you feel

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
nosebleed bleachers up there you feel
like<00:01:55.170> hanging<00:01:55.410> off<00:01:55.620> a<00:01:55.650> cliff<00:01:55.800> I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.310> we

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
like hanging off a cliff I think we

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.460 
like hanging off a cliff I think we
needed<00:01:56.940> more<00:01:57.150> stairs<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.870> more<00:01:58.050> fur<00:01:58.260> feet

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
needed more stairs and more fur feet

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.350 
needed more stairs and more fur feet
that's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.860> recommendation

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:22.700 

Oh

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.770 

you
