have<00:00:40.609> the<00:00:40.820> commercial<00:00:41.420> type<00:00:41.690> signal<00:00:42.320> output

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
have the commercial type signal output

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.759 
have the commercial type signal output
of<00:00:43.039> 70<00:00:43.489> volts<00:00:43.910> some<00:00:44.690> people<00:00:44.960> ask<00:00:45.140> well<00:00:45.440> why

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
of 70 volts some people ask well why

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.790 
of 70 volts some people ask well why
don't<00:00:45.829> they<00:00:46.039> just<00:00:46.129> use<00:00:46.629> one<00:00:47.629> type<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.260> signal

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
don't they just use one type of signal

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.119 
don't they just use one type of signal
like<00:00:49.010> home<00:00:49.339> audios<00:00:50.239> with<00:00:51.050> 8<00:00:51.320> ohms<00:00:51.530> coming<00:00:52.010> out

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
like home audios with 8 ohms coming out

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.639 
like home audios with 8 ohms coming out
to<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.399> speakers<00:00:52.820> well<00:00:53.749> when<00:00:54.050> you<00:00:54.170> buy<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.350> home

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
to the speakers well when you buy a home

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.669 
to the speakers well when you buy a home
audio<00:00:55.039> system<00:00:55.179> it's<00:00:56.179> all<00:00:56.449> pre<00:00:56.839> designed<00:00:57.230> and

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
audio system it's all pre designed and

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.649 
audio system it's all pre designed and
the<00:00:57.769> impedance<00:00:58.249> and<00:00:58.670> all<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:58.940> mathematics

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
the impedance and all that mathematics

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.689 
the impedance and all that mathematics
is<00:00:59.780> all<00:01:00.019> you<00:01:00.649> know<00:01:00.800> figured<00:01:01.159> out<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.640> don't

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
is all you know figured out so you don't

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.430 
is all you know figured out so you don't
have<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:01.969> worry<00:01:02.179> about<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.570> but<00:01:03.170> when<00:01:03.320> you're

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
have to worry about it but when you're

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.620 
have to worry about it but when you're
designing<00:01:03.589> a<00:01:03.980> commercial<00:01:04.880> public<00:01:05.330> address

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
designing a commercial public address

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.970 
designing a commercial public address
system<00:01:05.660> then<00:01:06.230> you<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.590> don't<00:01:06.740> know<00:01:06.800> how<00:01:06.860> many

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
system then you you don't know how many

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.530 
system then you you don't know how many
speakers<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.580> might<00:01:07.730> be<00:01:07.850> putting<00:01:08.120> on<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.330> amp

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
speakers you might be putting on the amp

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.110 
speakers you might be putting on the amp
and<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.560> what<00:01:09.830> we<00:01:09.980> found<00:01:10.340> all<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.610> electronics

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
and so what we found all the electronics

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.660 
and so what we found all the electronics
industry<00:01:11.300> found<00:01:11.870> is<00:01:12.230> if<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:12.620> use<00:01:12.800> 70<00:01:13.310> volts

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
industry found is if you use 70 volts

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.300 
industry found is if you use 70 volts
signalling<00:01:14.240> all<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.230> mathematics<00:01:15.920> is

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
signalling all of the mathematics is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.370 
signalling all of the mathematics is
very<00:01:16.340> simple<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.180> don't<00:01:17.810> have<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.020> worry<00:01:18.290> a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
very simple you don't have to worry a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.860 
very simple you don't have to worry a
lot<00:01:18.590> about<00:01:19.030> overloading<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.120> amp<00:01:20.330> as<00:01:20.600> long<00:01:20.750> as

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
lot about overloading the amp as long as

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.020 
lot about overloading the amp as long as
you<00:01:20.960> use<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.260> 70<00:01:21.650> volts<00:01:21.920> signal<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:22.730> let<00:01:22.940> me

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
you use the 70 volts signal so let me

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.550 
you use the 70 volts signal so let me
get<00:01:23.150> started<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.630> show<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:23.840> on<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.200> back<00:01:24.380> of

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
get started to show you on the back of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.810 
get started to show you on the back of
this<00:01:24.650> amp<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.130> we'll<00:01:25.220> try<00:01:25.370> to<00:01:25.430> get<00:01:25.580> up<00:01:25.670> here

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
this amp and we'll try to get up here

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.570 
this amp and we'll try to get up here
close<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.270> hopefully<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.720> can<00:01:26.870> see<00:01:27.080> this

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
close and hopefully you can see this

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.360 
close and hopefully you can see this
this<00:01:28.580> is<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.910> speaker<00:01:29.270> output<00:01:29.570> lines<00:01:30.370> okay

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
this is the speaker output lines okay

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.810 
this is the speaker output lines okay
and<00:01:31.760> if<00:01:32.750> you'll<00:01:32.870> notice<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.320> says<00:01:33.550> coem<00:01:34.550> that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
and if you'll notice it says coem that

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.780 
and if you'll notice it says coem that
means<00:01:35.000> common<00:01:35.440> so<00:01:36.440> one<00:01:36.740> wire<00:01:37.010> will<00:01:37.370> always

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
means common so one wire will always

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.680 
means common so one wire will always
hook<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.480> common<00:01:39.080> log<00:01:39.380> okay<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:40.730> then

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
hook to this common log okay and then

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.600 
hook to this common log okay and then
you<00:01:41.870> have<00:01:42.140> here<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:42.830> case<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.130> have<00:01:43.400> a

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
you have here in this case you have a

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.130 
you have here in this case you have a
tone<00:01:43.850> 70<00:01:44.660> volt<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.410> 100<00:01:45.980> volt<00:01:46.220> in<00:01:46.780> most<00:01:47.780> cases

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
tone 70 volt and 100 volt in most cases

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.640 
our speakers utilize 70 volt
transformers<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:52.880> would<00:01:53.150> tap<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.140> 70

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
transformers so you would tap the 70

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.400 
transformers so you would tap the 70
volt<00:01:54.860> line<00:01:55.100> okay<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.840> only<00:01:56.990> got<00:01:57.260> two

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
volt line okay so you only got two

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.400 
volt line okay so you only got two
conductors<00:01:57.920> again<00:01:58.220> this<00:01:58.610> common<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.360> 70<00:02:00.170> volt

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
conductors again this common and 70 volt

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.440 
conductors again this common and 70 volt
and<00:02:00.650> these<00:02:01.070> two<00:02:01.370> conductors<00:02:01.850> would<00:02:02.000> go<00:02:02.210> right

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
and these two conductors would go right

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.500 
and these two conductors would go right
on<00:02:02.600> out<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.110> first<00:02:03.350> speaker<00:02:04.210> another<00:02:05.210> good

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
on out to the first speaker another good

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.820 
on out to the first speaker another good
news<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:06.320> with<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:07.340> 70<00:02:08.000> volt<00:02:08.210> signal<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:09.649> don't

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
news is with a 70 volt signal you don't

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.400 
news is with a 70 volt signal you don't
have<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.250> worry<00:02:10.490> about<00:02:10.640> coming

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
have to worry about coming

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.860 
have to worry about coming
to<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.800> amplifier<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.730> every<00:02:13.390> one<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.720> the

to the amplifier with every one of the
speaker<00:02:14.740> wires<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.820> can<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.150> daisy<00:02:16.420> chain

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
speaker wires you can just daisy chain

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.410 
speaker wires you can just daisy chain
right<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.440> old<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:18.070> all<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.520> speakers<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
right on old to all the speakers and the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.390 
right on old to all the speakers and the

last speaker in the line is the end of
the<00:02:21.520> line<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.120> don't<00:02:22.480> have<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.750> come<00:02:22.960> back<00:02:23.140> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
the line you don't have to come back to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.190 
the line you don't have to come back to
the<00:02:23.470> ham<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.940> really<00:02:25.360> does<00:02:25.540> simplify<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
the ham that really does simplify the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.940 
the ham that really does simplify the
wiring<00:02:26.800> process<00:02:27.310> as<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.760> imagine<00:02:28.950> okay

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
wiring process as you can imagine okay

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.650 
wiring process as you can imagine okay
now<00:02:30.510> what's<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.570> little<00:02:31.720> scary<00:02:33.420> when<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.510> buy

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
now what's a little scary when you buy

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.920 
now what's a little scary when you buy
indoor<00:02:35.730> commercial<00:02:36.730> speakers<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.630> say

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
indoor commercial speakers but like say

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.590 
indoor commercial speakers but like say
a<00:02:37.960> ceiling<00:02:40.860> when<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.010> see<00:02:42.310> all<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.910> wires<00:02:43.240> on

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
a ceiling when you see all the wires on

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.560 
a ceiling when you see all the wires on
the<00:02:43.630> back<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.760> when<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.850> receive<00:02:46.210> this<00:02:46.420> in

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
the back of it when you receive this in

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.840 
the back of it when you receive this in
the<00:02:46.660> mail<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:47.110> mean<00:02:47.560> in<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.400> shipment

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
the mail I mean in the shipment

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.510 
the mail I mean in the shipment
it<00:02:49.210> looks<00:02:49.360> pretty<00:02:49.980> pretty<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.190> see<00:02:51.370> these

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
it looks pretty pretty you see these

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.040 
it looks pretty pretty you see these
everywhere<00:02:51.820> but<00:02:52.300> more<00:02:52.510> look<00:02:52.690> at<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.840> back

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
everywhere but more look at the back

wires<00:03:01.210> that's<00:03:02.140> what<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.350> want<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.590> try<00:03:02.680> to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
wires that's what I want to try to

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.620 
wires that's what I want to try to
explain<00:03:03.160> today<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.640> really<00:03:03.880> very<00:03:04.030> simple

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
explain today it's really very simple

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.630 
explain today it's really very simple
when<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.780> explain<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.490> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
when I explain to you this is the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.520 
when I explain to you this is the
transformer<00:03:07.390> called<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.630> 70<00:03:08.020> volt<00:03:08.200> transformer

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
transformer called a 70 volt transformer

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.160 
transformer called a 70 volt transformer
and<00:03:09.070> there's<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.640> diagram<00:03:09.940> right<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.600> top<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:11.080> it

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
and there's a diagram right on top of it

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.830 
and there's a diagram right on top of it
it<00:03:11.290> tells<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.740> which<00:03:11.950> wire<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:13.060> hook<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.300> for

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
it tells you which wire to hook to for

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.230 
it tells you which wire to hook to for
what<00:03:14.020> wattage<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:14.860> forth<00:03:15.100> what<00:03:15.850> I've<00:03:15.970> done

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
what wattage and so forth what I've done

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.110 
what wattage and so forth what I've done
is<00:03:16.780> made<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.440> chart<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.340> blow-up<00:03:21.700> of

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
is made a chart this is a blow-up of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.570 
is made a chart this is a blow-up of
that<00:03:22.660> chart<00:03:23.050> that's<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.530> there<00:03:23.770> transformer

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
that chart that's on there transformer

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.020 
that chart that's on there transformer
hopefully<00:03:25.270> you<00:03:25.360> can<00:03:25.480> see<00:03:25.720> this<00:03:25.900> now<00:03:27.030> that

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
hopefully you can see this now that

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.750 
hopefully you can see this now that
transformer<00:03:28.690> will<00:03:28.870> utilize<00:03:29.230> either<00:03:29.500> 74<00:03:30.100> or<00:03:30.310> 25

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
transformer will utilize either 74 or 25

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.840 
transformer will utilize either 74 or 25
volt<00:03:31.030> amplifier<00:03:31.840> in<00:03:32.080> most<00:03:32.800> all<00:03:33.070> cases<00:03:33.100> our

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
volt amplifier in most all cases our

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.270 
volt amplifier in most all cases our
amplifiers<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.660> 70<00:03:35.200> volt<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.890> can<00:03:36.070> just

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
amplifiers a 70 volt so you can just

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.040 
amplifiers a 70 volt so you can just
discount<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.000> line<00:03:37.210> you<00:03:37.540> don't<00:03:37.690> even<00:03:37.870> use

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
discount this line you don't even use

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.400 
discount this line you don't even use
this<00:03:38.320> line<00:03:38.560> at<00:03:38.770> all<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:40.200> simplifies<00:03:41.200> it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
this line at all and that simplifies it

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.810 
this line at all and that simplifies it
right<00:03:41.560> there<00:03:41.800> so<00:03:41.950> we're<00:03:42.130> only<00:03:42.250> dealing<00:03:42.580> with

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
right there so we're only dealing with

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.330 
right there so we're only dealing with
the<00:03:42.970> center<00:03:43.540> column<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.770> chart<00:03:45.130> okay<00:03:45.959> now

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
the center column of this chart okay now

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.120 
the center column of this chart okay now
in<00:03:48.340> all<00:03:49.060> cases<00:03:49.510> you've<00:03:50.110> got<00:03:50.320> two<00:03:50.530> conductors

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
in all cases you've got two conductors

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.460 
in all cases you've got two conductors
coming<00:03:51.490> into<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.910> transformer<00:03:52.540> one

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
coming into the transformer one

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.350 
coming into the transformer one
conductor<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.130> going<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.310> always<00:03:54.790> hook<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.240> the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
conductor is going to always hook to the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.620 
conductor is going to always hook to the
common<00:03:55.900> or<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.050> black<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.770> see<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:58.360> that

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
common or the black you see so that

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.990 
common or the black you see so that
really<00:03:59.290> simplifies<00:03:59.740> so<00:04:00.010> just<00:04:00.310> remember<00:04:00.550> one

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
really simplifies so just remember one

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.480 
really simplifies so just remember one
wire<00:04:01.270> coming<00:04:01.840> from<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.080> amplifier<00:04:02.680> will<00:04:03.280> hook

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
wire coming from the amplifier will hook

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.360 
wire coming from the amplifier will hook
to<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.790> black<00:04:04.030> on<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.630> transformer<00:04:05.220> then<00:04:06.220> you

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
to the black on the transformer then you

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.790 
to the black on the transformer then you
just<00:04:06.520> got<00:04:06.700> one<00:04:06.730> more<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.360> decide<00:04:07.720> in<00:04:08.110> most

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
just got one more to decide in most

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.640 
just got one more to decide in most
cases<00:04:09.160> what<00:04:09.640> we<00:04:09.760> do<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.270> when<00:04:10.990> we<00:04:11.020> first<00:04:11.350> wire<00:04:11.620> a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
cases what we do is when we first wire a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.280 
cases what we do is when we first wire a
big<00:04:12.040> commercial<00:04:12.310> system<00:04:13.060> in<00:04:13.570> a<00:04:13.900> building

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
big commercial system in a building

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.390 
big commercial system in a building
we'll<00:04:14.740> just<00:04:14.980> tap<00:04:15.280> on<00:04:15.760> black<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.600> yellow<00:04:17.400> the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
we'll just tap on black and yellow the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.370 
we'll just tap on black and yellow the
yellow<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.150> highest<00:04:19.600> wattage<00:04:19.840> in<00:04:20.320> this

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
yellow is the highest wattage in this

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.640 
yellow is the highest wattage in this
case<00:04:20.890> which<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.160> 10<00:04:21.489> watts<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.930> every

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
case which is 10 watts and so every

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.409 
case which is 10 watts and so every
would<00:04:24.009> have<00:04:24.190> pretty<00:04:24.460> much<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.699> consistent

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
would have pretty much a consistent

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.870 
would have pretty much a consistent
volume<00:04:25.830> let's<00:04:26.830> say<00:04:27.040> that<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.310> walk<00:04:27.580> into<00:04:27.790> a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
volume let's say that you walk into a

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.719 
volume let's say that you walk into a
room<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.570> it's<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.199> a<00:04:29.259> little<00:04:29.410> too<00:04:29.560> loud<00:04:29.740> you

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
room and it's just a little too loud you

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.310 
room and it's just a little too loud you
want<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.000> quiet<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.479> room<00:04:31.720> down<00:04:31.960> then<00:04:32.229> you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
want to quiet that room down then you

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.590 
want to quiet that room down then you
could<00:04:32.470> go<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.949> speaker<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.580> pull<00:04:34.449> the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
could go to the speaker and pull the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.020 
could go to the speaker and pull the
wire<00:04:34.840> off<00:04:35.229> of<00:04:35.259> the<00:04:35.500> yellow<00:04:36.039> coming<00:04:36.699> from<00:04:36.880> the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
wire off of the yellow coming from the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.540 
wire off of the yellow coming from the
amplifier<00:04:37.449> and<00:04:37.720> move<00:04:37.870> down<00:04:38.199> to<00:04:38.530> purple<00:04:39.310> for

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
amplifier and move down to purple for

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.219 
amplifier and move down to purple for
instance<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.389> would<00:04:40.930> make<00:04:41.080> that

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
instance and that would make that

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.740 
instance and that would make that
speaker<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.680> lot<00:04:41.860> quieter

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
speaker a lot quieter

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.379 
speaker a lot quieter
okay<00:04:43.949> so<00:04:44.949> again<00:04:45.310> you're<00:04:45.580> really<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:46.000> dealing

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
okay so again you're really just dealing

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.969 
okay so again you're really just dealing
with<00:04:46.539> two<00:04:46.750> wires<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.440> one<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.770> them<00:04:47.860> always

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
with two wires and one of them always

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.900 
with two wires and one of them always
hooks<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.759> black<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:50.080> in<00:04:50.530> most<00:04:51.190> cases<00:04:51.460> if<00:04:51.789> you

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
hooks to black so in most cases if you

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.610 
hooks to black so in most cases if you
just<00:04:52.060> hook<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.509> this<00:04:52.750> case<00:04:52.990> if<00:04:53.199> you<00:04:53.289> just<00:04:53.440> hook

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
just hook in this case if you just hook

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.320 
just hook in this case if you just hook
to<00:04:53.800> black<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.310> yellow<00:04:54.460> with<00:04:54.880> every<00:04:55.120> wire

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
to black and yellow with every wire

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.000 
to black and yellow with every wire
that's<00:04:55.900> all<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.260> have<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.500> worry<00:04:56.650> about<00:04:56.770> you

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
that's all you have to worry about you

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.710 
that's all you have to worry about you
can<00:04:57.130> just<00:04:57.310> take<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.550> rest<00:04:57.789> of<00:04:57.940> them<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.210> kind

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
can just take the rest of them and kind

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.540 
can just take the rest of them and kind
of<00:04:58.840> coral<00:04:59.229> them<00:04:59.320> up<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.650> might<00:04:59.800> take<00:05:00.039> wire

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
of coral them up you might take wire

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.010 
of coral them up you might take wire
cutters<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.060> cut<00:05:01.240> them<00:05:01.419> off<00:05:01.510> so<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:01.810> they

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
cutters and cut them off so that they

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.040 
cutters and cut them off so that they
won't<00:05:02.199> shoot<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:03.750> put<00:05:04.750> maybe<00:05:04.930> some

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
won't shoot and put maybe some

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.680 
won't shoot and put maybe some
electrical<00:05:05.590> tape<00:05:05.620> one<00:05:06.300> forget<00:05:07.300> about<00:05:07.419> the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
electrical tape one forget about the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.890 
electrical tape one forget about the
other<00:05:07.840> let<00:05:08.139> me<00:05:08.229> show<00:05:08.440> you<00:05:08.500> again<00:05:09.539> on<00:05:10.539> the

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
other let me show you again on the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.860 
other let me show you again on the
speaker<00:05:12.389> here<00:05:13.470> we<00:05:14.470> would<00:05:14.680> take<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:16.720> got

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
speaker here we would take and you got

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.839 
speaker here we would take and you got
to<00:05:16.960> really<00:05:17.110> watch<00:05:17.199> because<00:05:17.860> purple<00:05:18.220> and<00:05:18.580> black

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
to really watch because purple and black

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.390 
to really watch because purple and black
are<00:05:19.180> pretty<00:05:19.449> hard<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.930> distinguish<00:05:20.530> on<00:05:21.070> this

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
are pretty hard to distinguish on this

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.379 
are pretty hard to distinguish on this
transformer<00:05:22.229> this<00:05:23.229> is<00:05:23.940> let's<00:05:24.940> see<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.270> is

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
transformer this is let's see this is

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.080 
transformer this is let's see this is
purple<00:05:25.780> down<00:05:25.900> here<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:27.550> you<00:05:27.639> have<00:05:27.789> to<00:05:27.910> watch

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
purple down here so you have to watch

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.900 
purple down here so you have to watch
for<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.510> don't<00:05:29.050> hook<00:05:29.199> to<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.500> purple<00:05:29.910> push

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
for that don't hook to the purple push

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.250 
for that don't hook to the purple push
them<00:05:31.150> off<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.419> side<00:05:31.599> this<00:05:31.780> is<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.960> black

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
them off to the side this is the black

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.010 
them off to the side this is the black
one<00:05:32.530> you<00:05:32.740> would<00:05:32.979> hook<00:05:33.099> to<00:05:33.250> black<00:05:33.520> and<00:05:34.020> you

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
one you would hook to black and you

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.200 
one you would hook to black and you
would<00:05:35.169> hook<00:05:35.349> to<00:05:35.560> yellow<00:05:35.889> and<00:05:36.220> just<00:05:36.880> take<00:05:37.090> the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
would hook to yellow and just take the

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.839 
would hook to yellow and just take the
rest<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:37.870> just<00:05:38.530> simply<00:05:38.800> ignore<00:05:39.310> them<00:05:39.460> it's

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
rest and just simply ignore them it's

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:40.620 
rest and just simply ignore them it's
that<00:05:39.970> simple

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
that simple

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.990 
that simple
okay<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.830> could<00:05:42.010> again<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.460> could<00:05:42.610> cut<00:05:42.880> them

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
okay you could again you could cut them

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.730 
okay you could again you could cut them
off<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.510> maybe<00:05:43.659> put<00:05:43.930> some<00:05:44.080> black<00:05:44.260> tape<00:05:44.530> on

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
off and maybe put some black tape on

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.200 
off and maybe put some black tape on
them<00:05:44.949> all<00:05:45.580> right<00:05:45.849> so<00:05:47.250> let's<00:05:48.250> say<00:05:48.550> that<00:05:48.940> the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
them all right so let's say that the

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.719 
them all right so let's say that the
wire<00:05:49.479> coming<00:05:49.870> from<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.260> amplifier<00:05:53.280> is<00:05:54.280> here

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
wire coming from the amplifier is here

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.500 
wire coming from the amplifier is here
okay<00:05:55.389> you<00:05:55.810> only<00:05:55.900> got<00:05:56.050> two<00:05:56.229> conductors<00:05:57.510> this

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
okay you only got two conductors this

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.040 
okay you only got two conductors this
comes<00:05:58.750> right<00:05:58.930> off<00:05:58.960> the<00:05:59.169> amp<00:06:00.090> simply<00:06:01.090> hook<00:06:01.360> gosh

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
comes right off the amp simply hook gosh

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.159 
comes right off the amp simply hook gosh
it's<00:06:02.289> hard<00:06:02.440> to<00:06:02.590> do<00:06:05.669> let's<00:06:06.669> take<00:06:06.880> black<00:06:07.180> hope

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
it's hard to do let's take black hope

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:14.040 
it's hard to do let's take black hope
you<00:06:08.349> can<00:06:08.500> see<00:06:08.770> this<00:06:10.409> black<00:06:11.409> and<00:06:12.449> twist<00:06:13.449> it<00:06:13.659> onto

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
you can see this black and twist it onto

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.279 
you can see this black and twist it onto
one<00:06:14.289> of<00:06:14.320> the<00:06:14.470> wires<00:06:14.650> and<00:06:15.479> yellow<00:06:16.479> and<00:06:16.780> twist<00:06:17.139> it

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
one of the wires and yellow and twist it

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.540 
one of the wires and yellow and twist it
on<00:06:17.409> the<00:06:17.590> other<00:06:17.740> wire<00:06:19.169> now<00:06:20.190> what<00:06:21.190> about<00:06:21.280> the

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
on the other wire now what about the

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.969 
on the other wire now what about the
next<00:06:21.940> speaker<00:06:22.270> in<00:06:22.389> the<00:06:22.510> line<00:06:22.680> then<00:06:23.680> let's

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
next speaker in the line then let's

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.890 
next speaker in the line then let's
pretend<00:06:24.400> that<00:06:24.580> this<00:06:24.820> is<00:06:25.030> the<00:06:25.180> wire<00:06:25.419> going<00:06:25.780> to

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
pretend that this is the wire going to

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.140 
pretend that this is the wire going to
the<00:06:26.050> next<00:06:26.380> bigger<00:06:26.740> take<00:06:27.639> these<00:06:27.880> two

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
the next bigger take these two

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.430 
the next bigger take these two
conductors<00:06:28.750> and<00:06:28.930> twist<00:06:29.650> them<00:06:29.860> right<00:06:30.130> on

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
conductors and twist them right on

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.330 
conductors and twist them right on
the<00:06:30.560> same<00:06:30.830> two<00:06:31.540> black<00:06:32.540> and<00:06:32.780> yellow<00:06:33.280> like<00:06:34.280> this

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
the same two black and yellow like this

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.130 
the same two black and yellow like this
you<00:06:37.340> put<00:06:37.520> a<00:06:37.550> wire<00:06:37.760> nut<00:06:37.940> on<00:06:38.150> it<00:06:40.870> and<00:06:41.870> then<00:06:42.020> you

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
you put a wire nut on it and then you

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.590 
you put a wire nut on it and then you
have<00:06:42.350> black<00:06:43.250> on<00:06:43.430> this<00:06:43.580> side<00:06:45.850> I'm<00:06:46.850> not<00:06:47.060> sure<00:06:47.330> I'm

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
have black on this side I'm not sure I'm

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.730 
have black on this side I'm not sure I'm
in<00:06:47.720> the<00:06:47.840> camera<00:06:48.230> view<00:06:48.290> I<00:06:48.590> hope<00:06:48.800> I<00:06:49.010> am<00:06:50.500> barn<00:06:51.500> up

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
in the camera view I hope I am barn up

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.900 
in the camera view I hope I am barn up
that<00:06:52.360> and<00:06:53.360> so<00:06:53.750> what<00:06:53.990> you<00:06:54.170> end<00:06:54.410> up<00:06:54.590> with<00:06:54.890> is<00:06:55.220> this

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
that and so what you end up with is this

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.180 
that and so what you end up with is this
and<00:06:56.750> again<00:06:56.990> we<00:06:57.110> just<00:06:57.140> ignore<00:06:57.650> all<00:06:57.680> these

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
and again we just ignore all these

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.940 
and again we just ignore all these
others<00:06:58.550> you<00:06:59.030> just<00:06:59.300> chop<00:07:00.110> them<00:07:00.230> off<00:07:00.440> and<00:07:00.740> tape

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
others you just chop them off and tape

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.070 
others you just chop them off and tape
them<00:07:01.100> up<00:07:01.220> and<00:07:01.880> this<00:07:02.330> is<00:07:02.510> what<00:07:02.660> you<00:07:02.810> would<00:07:02.960> end

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
them up and this is what you would end

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.120 
them up and this is what you would end
up<00:07:03.260> with<00:07:03.500> okay<00:07:04.480> one<00:07:05.480> wire<00:07:05.720> going<00:07:05.750> out<00:07:06.680> to<00:07:07.010> the

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130 
up with okay one wire going out to the

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.870 
up with okay one wire going out to the
next<00:07:07.340> speaker<00:07:08.410> this<00:07:09.410> wire<00:07:09.770> here<00:07:10.310> comes<00:07:10.670> from

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
next speaker this wire here comes from

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.480 
next speaker this wire here comes from
the<00:07:11.030> amplifier<00:07:11.630> and<00:07:11.990> then<00:07:12.980> of<00:07:13.130> course<00:07:13.160> the

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
the amplifier and then of course the

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.250 
the amplifier and then of course the
black<00:07:13.700> and<00:07:13.940> yellow<00:07:14.060> to<00:07:14.360> the<00:07:14.480> speaker<00:07:14.810> taps

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
black and yellow to the speaker taps

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.380 
black and yellow to the speaker taps
into<00:07:15.500> that<00:07:15.740> line<00:07:15.980> okay<00:07:16.310> we<00:07:17.000> call<00:07:17.210> it<00:07:17.360> a

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.390 
into that line okay we call it a

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.390 
into that line okay we call it a
railroad<00:07:17.960> track<00:07:18.290> you<00:07:18.530> just<00:07:18.710> tapping<00:07:19.040> in<00:07:19.310> the

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
railroad track you just tapping in the

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.800 
railroad track you just tapping in the
railroad<00:07:19.730> track<00:07:20.000> and<00:07:20.030> go<00:07:20.270> right<00:07:20.480> to<00:07:20.660> the<00:07:20.780> next

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
railroad track and go right to the next

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.350 
railroad track and go right to the next
figure<00:07:21.290> it's<00:07:22.190> that<00:07:22.430> simple<00:07:22.700> and<00:07:22.970> you<00:07:23.090> do<00:07:23.240> not

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 
figure it's that simple and you do not

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.320 
figure it's that simple and you do not
have<00:07:23.600> to<00:07:23.720> come<00:07:23.930> back<00:07:24.200> to<00:07:24.440> the<00:07:24.560> amplifier<00:07:25.330> just

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
have to come back to the amplifier just

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.480 
have to come back to the amplifier just
the<00:07:26.750> last<00:07:26.990> speaker<00:07:27.440> in<00:07:27.560> the<00:07:27.650> line<00:07:27.830> is<00:07:28.160> the<00:07:28.280> end

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.490 
the last speaker in the line is the end

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.780 
the last speaker in the line is the end
of<00:07:28.610> the<00:07:28.670> line<00:07:28.960> okay<00:07:29.960> I<00:07:30.370> hope<00:07:31.370> this<00:07:31.580> has<00:07:31.760> been
