the rubidium here it is is that it well
it<00:01:09.300> might<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.600> look<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:09.899> much<00:01:10.140> Richard<00:01:10.770> but

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it might not look like much Richard but

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
it might not look like much Richard but
it's<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> highly<00:01:11.490> reactive<00:01:11.640> metal<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.479> sealed

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
right so what's going to happen when you

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.100 
right so what's going to happen when you
drop<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> water<00:01:18.240> well<00:01:18.659> imagine<00:01:18.869> if

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
drop that in the water well imagine if

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.690 
drop that in the water well imagine if
you<00:01:19.200> will<00:01:19.350> letting<00:01:19.770> off<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.950> hand<00:01:20.159> grenade<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.640> a

you will letting off a hand grenade in a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.540 
you will letting off a hand grenade in a
bathtub<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:21.690> up<00:01:21.899> I'm<00:01:22.110> off<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.679> that<00:01:22.920> okay

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
bathtub right up I'm off have that okay

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.040 
bathtub right up I'm off have that okay
good<00:01:23.850> luck<00:01:28.100> okay<00:01:29.100> tickle<00:01:29.539> drop<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.690> rubidium

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
good luck okay tickle drop the rubidium

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.400 
good luck okay tickle drop the rubidium

gasps that is more like it only on

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.649 
gasps that is more like it only on
Brainiac<00:02:03.470> do<00:02:03.620> you<00:02:03.710> get<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:03.979> kind<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.659> science

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
Brainiac do you get that kind of science

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.570 
Brainiac do you get that kind of science
but<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.080> believe<00:02:06.380> we<00:02:06.440> can<00:02:06.680> go<00:02:06.920> one<00:02:07.130> better<00:02:07.370> there

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
but I believe we can go one better there

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.609 
but I believe we can go one better there
is<00:02:07.670> one<00:02:07.880> more<00:02:08.060> alkali<00:02:08.509> metal<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:08.959> can<00:02:09.140> legally

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
is one more alkali metal we can legally

yeah<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.420> already<00:02:17.690> now<00:02:18.050> what's<00:02:18.260> that

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
yeah I like it already now what's that

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.440 
yeah I like it already now what's that
going<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.770> do<00:02:18.920> when<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.640> hits<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.910> water<00:02:19.940> it

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450
