three<00:00:22.289> range<00:00:22.830> anxiety<00:00:23.039> will<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.789> bigger

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
issue and I think this is going to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.560 
issue and I think this is going to
address<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> couple<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.400> those<00:00:26.550> issues<00:00:27.090> for

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
address a couple of those issues for

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.140 
address a couple of those issues for
them<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.199> that's<00:00:29.010> many<00:00:29.220> years<00:00:29.519> away<00:00:29.820> yes

the<00:01:50.430> model<00:01:50.790> 3<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.299> actually<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> shoot

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the model 3 is actually going to shoot

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.730 
the model 3 is actually going to shoot
for<00:01:53.270> longer<00:01:54.270> range<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
for longer range that that it's going to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.920 
for longer range that that it's going to
try<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> get<00:01:56.280> into<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.479> 250<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:59.570> 300<00:02:00.570> mile<00:02:00.689> real

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
try to get into the 250 to 300 mile real

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.590 
try to get into the 250 to 300 mile real
but<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> peculiar<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.700> model<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
but the peculiar the model is the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.719 
but the peculiar the model is the
cheaper<00:02:04.380> version<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> model<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
cheaper version of the model that's the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.119 
cheaper version of the model that's the
one<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.210> starts<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.630> 70<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.200> change<00:02:07.469> has<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
one that starts at 70 and change has a

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.600 
one that starts at 70 and change has a
200<00:02:08.550> mile<00:02:08.640> range<00:02:08.849> or

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
200 mile range or

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.250 
200 mile range or
according<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.030> Tesla<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.539> more<00:02:10.960> expensive

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
according to Tesla the more expensive

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.220 
according to Tesla the more expensive
version<00:02:11.830> has<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> range<00:02:12.640> that's<00:02:13.120> closer<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.690> 80

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
version has a range that's closer to 80

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.880 
version has a range that's closer to 80
I<00:02:14.380> guess<00:02:14.680> they<00:02:15.040> say<00:02:15.810> yeah<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.680> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
I guess they say yeah and and and and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.370 
I guess they say yeah and and and and
also<00:02:18.280> he<00:02:18.430> went<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.850> say<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.960> even

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
also he went on to say that it that even

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.800 
also he went on to say that it that even
if<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:21.130> have<00:02:21.430> 200<00:02:22.000> miles<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.600> get

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
if you do have 200 miles and you get

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.470 
if you do have 200 miles and you get
that<00:02:22.960> passing<00:02:23.440> grade<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:24.220> has<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.610> be<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.940> real

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
that passing grade it has to be a real

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.340 
that passing grade it has to be a real
200<00:02:26.080> miles<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.620> can't<00:02:26.860> be<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
200 miles it can't be that you have the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.660 
200 miles it can't be that you have the
electrician<00:02:29.350> enough<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:30.220> you're<00:02:30.370> crawling

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
electrician enough that you're crawling

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.550 
electrician enough that you're crawling
along<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.360> 40<00:02:31.660> miles<00:02:31.810> an<00:02:32.020> hour<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
along at 40 miles an hour that the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.760 
along at 40 miles an hour that the
weather<00:02:32.860> is<00:02:32.980> perfect<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.120> has<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.570> real

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
weather is perfect it has to be real

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.800 
weather is perfect it has to be real
driving<00:02:35.770> conditions<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:37.090> got<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
driving conditions so I I got the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.500 
driving conditions so I I got the
impression<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.320> he<00:02:38.530> was<00:02:38.560> setting<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.250> bar

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
impression that he was setting the bar

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.930 
impression that he was setting the bar
differently<00:02:40.510> from<00:02:41.110> how<00:02:41.350> we<00:02:42.070> until<00:02:42.520> now<00:02:42.700> have

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
differently from how we until now have

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.330 
differently from how we until now have
been<00:02:42.970> looking<00:02:43.450> at<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.720> race<00:02:44.020> among<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.130> car

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
been looking at that race among the car

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.360 
been looking at that race among the car
makers<00:02:45.790> for<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.600> for<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.230> car<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.920> 200

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
makers for that for that car the 200

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.350 
makers for that for that car the 200
mile<00:02:48.489> car<00:02:48.760> in<00:02:49.440> 2017<00:02:50.440> 2018<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:51.310> think<00:02:51.940> he's<00:02:52.090> he's

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
mile car in 2017 2018 I think he's he's

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.729 
mile car in 2017 2018 I think he's he's
saying<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.840> at<00:02:52.989> least<00:02:53.020> there's<00:02:53.470> going<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.709> be

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
saying that at least there's going to be

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.370 
saying that at least there's going to be
the<00:02:53.890> option<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.720> go<00:02:55.840> further<00:02:56.080> than<00:02:56.230> that

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
the option to it to go further than that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.729 
the option to it to go further than that
it's<00:02:57.370> interesting<00:02:57.690> Theodore<00:02:58.690> O'Neil<00:02:58.959> you

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
it's interesting Theodore O'Neil you

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.650 
it's interesting Theodore O'Neil you
know<00:02:59.860> he's<00:03:00.130> Elon<00:03:00.760> Musk<00:03:00.940> often<00:03:01.300> sets<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.630> high

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
know he's Elon Musk often sets a high

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.570 
know he's Elon Musk often sets a high
bar<00:03:01.989> for<00:03:02.380> example<00:03:02.830> last<00:03:02.980> quarter<00:03:03.340> they<00:03:03.430> said

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
bar for example last quarter they said

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.610 
bar for example last quarter they said
there<00:03:03.700> was<00:03:03.790> sell<00:03:03.940> over<00:03:04.180> 11,000<00:03:04.840> cars<00:03:05.020> they

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
there was sell over 11,000 cars they

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.729 
there was sell over 11,000 cars they
sold<00:03:05.860> 9800<00:03:06.670> when<00:03:07.300> he<00:03:07.480> sets<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.900> high<00:03:07.930> bar<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:08.620> we

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
sold 9800 when he sets a high bar so we

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.740 
sold 9800 when he sets a high bar so we
think<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.250> as<00:03:09.400> his<00:03:09.550> own<00:03:09.730> aspirations<00:03:10.090> or

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
think of that as his own aspirations or

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.580 
think of that as his own aspirations or
the<00:03:11.410> promise<00:03:11.800> from<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.980> public<00:03:12.280> company<00:03:12.550> CEO<00:03:12.970> oh

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
the promise from a public company CEO oh

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.140 
the promise from a public company CEO oh
I<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.769> think<00:03:15.280> he<00:03:15.370> knows<00:03:15.489> exactly<00:03:15.670> what<00:03:15.970> he's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
I I think he knows exactly what he's

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.479 
I I think he knows exactly what he's
doing<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.630> if<00:03:16.989> they<00:03:17.140> can<00:03:17.290> get<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.620> gen<00:03:18.070> 3<00:03:18.310> to

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
doing and if they can get the gen 3 to

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.570 
doing and if they can get the gen 3 to
get<00:03:18.610> 250<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.480> 300<00:03:19.870> miles<00:03:20.080> I'm<00:03:21.040> not<00:03:21.310> sure<00:03:21.370> where

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
get 250 to 300 miles I'm not sure where

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.650 
get 250 to 300 miles I'm not sure where
they're<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.880> shoehorn<00:03:22.060> all<00:03:22.480> those

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
they're going to shoehorn all those

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.090 
they're going to shoehorn all those
batteries<00:03:23.049> in<00:03:23.200> but<00:03:23.410> if<00:03:23.560> they<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.890> do<00:03:23.980> that

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
batteries in but if they can do that

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.850 
batteries in but if they can do that
that'll<00:03:24.400> be<00:03:24.489> great<00:03:24.640> that'll<00:03:25.030> be<00:03:25.750> super<00:03:26.290> but

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
that'll be great that'll be super but

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.650 
that'll be great that'll be super but
