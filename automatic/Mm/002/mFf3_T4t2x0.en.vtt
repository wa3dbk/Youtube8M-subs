00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.299 
have I think four or five people in our
group<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.469> pretty<00:01:01.770> much<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.010> full

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
group so we have pretty much a full

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.679 
group so we have pretty much a full
group<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.559> host<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.430> game

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
group we do not have host in this game

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.760 
group we do not have host in this game

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
unfortunately usually when you're in a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.830 
unfortunately usually when you're in a
group<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> bound<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
group you can you could be a bound to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.950 
group you can you could be a bound to
get<00:01:09.960> host<00:01:10.430> especially<00:01:11.430> during<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> full<00:01:11.850> moon

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
get host especially during a full moon

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
get host especially during a full moon
sometime<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.290> listen<00:01:13.650> doesn't<00:01:14.159> work<00:01:14.250> out

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
sometime like listen doesn't work out

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.890 
sometime like listen doesn't work out
that<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> thought<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.479> want<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.810> you
