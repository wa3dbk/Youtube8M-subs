00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
people that soak the rumbling fissures

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.740 
people that soak the rumbling fissures
first<00:01:08.710> get<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.070> debuff<00:01:09.460> so<00:01:09.729> they<00:01:10.000> cannot<00:01:10.420> soak

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750

in<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.090> previous<00:01:43.420> round<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.619> they're<00:01:45.069> all

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
in the previous round so they're all

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.059

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
from the same side when you get when you

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.580 
from the same side when you get when you
transport<00:01:48.640> into<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.299> other<00:01:49.420> realm<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:50.319> send

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
transport into the other realm you send

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.499 
transport into the other realm you send
these<00:01:50.710> scales<00:01:51.039> waves<00:01:51.369> out<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.909> if<00:01:52.149> they<00:01:52.179> reach

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
these scales waves out and if they reach

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.529 
these scales waves out and if they reach
the<00:01:52.690> crystals<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:54.250> do<00:01:54.640> high<00:01:55.000> amount<00:01:55.360> of

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
the crystals they do high amount of

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.199 
the crystals they do high amount of
great<00:01:56.229> white<00:01:56.470> damage<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.220> they're<00:01:58.030> probably

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
great white damage and they're probably

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.820 
great white damage and they're probably
going<00:01:58.509> to<00:01:58.600> wipe<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.929> rate<00:01:59.110> so<00:01:59.380> just<00:01:59.619> make<00:01:59.799> sure

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
going to wipe the rate so just make sure

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.639 
going to wipe the rate so just make sure
you<00:02:00.700> assign<00:02:01.030> some<00:02:01.299> people<00:02:01.659> for<00:02:01.899> soaking<00:02:02.439> these

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
you assign some people for soaking these

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.870 
you assign some people for soaking these
waves<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:05.619> he's<00:02:05.860> disarmed<00:02:06.250> which<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.700> right

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
waves when he's disarmed which is right

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.969 
waves when he's disarmed which is right
now<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.119> need<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.659> thanks<00:02:08.410> you<00:02:08.679> need<00:02:08.829> to

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
more externals on that stank that's

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.610 
more externals on that stank that's
tanking<00:03:45.240> so<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.690> ensure<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.590> will
