00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.310
 Hello 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.599
 Well, I bring you the video of the 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.609
 care for my hair that I have 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.050
 asked so many of you so 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.210
 well let's start and I hope that you 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.449
 like first my hair 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.039
 Over two out of every two or three days 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.480
 maximum 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.339
 Of course, there is always the sudden 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.050
 eventuality or the activity you perform 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.420
 that forces me to alarm my hair daily 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.940
 next even if you have not washed it 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.530
 previous day I do not know if I understand but 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.220
 I usually wash it every two and three 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.489
 days and the hair stays softly not 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.409
 It smells bad to me, nor does it look like greasy 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.030
 my house and I think that that is also 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.979
 thing to accustom your hair to that because 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.420
 I used to wash it every day and one day 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.720
 what number the rod and hair had 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.339
 but it is that disgusting and little by little I was 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.379
 accustoming accustoming and now I 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.210
 She lasts up to three days completely 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.100
 he does not want text with all my being 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.549
 spain a month or hair is lost 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.020
 I really do not like it I was anti final 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.000
 I was lucky I passed the brush a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.910
 once a week 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.890
 but now these last two months I have 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.740
 been every day seeing hair in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 morning and night always suddenly 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.670
 If I am in the house and I spend it in the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.950
 in the afternoon and it has served me immensely 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.920
 to control a little more the fall of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.090
 my hair since I did not comb it and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.630
 end does not serve you 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.650
 ajn to oxygenate them to clean it for 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.750
 develop it and so on 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.430
 and then all the hair that falls out 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.040
 during the day during the night I do them 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.290
 with the brush and not on the street when 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.510
 I pass my hair so it stays with my hand 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.280
 like with 80,000 hair 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.630
 then it has served me immensely 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.880
 told a lot of that really is that 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.610
 it was like super annoying suddenly doing 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.560
 and to go walking in the street to make me like that and 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.020
 that the hand came out full of weights and the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.700
 Brushes it all out 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.470
 obviously it really falls out 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.960
 but it's not as much as before when 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.020
 I did not use it 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.850
 it's normal it 's normal to lose between 40 and 60 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.590
 hairs a day so girls do not know and 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.870
 guys do not get scared if they lose a lot 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.220
 hair unless you want to count them and come 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.880
 they lose 100 there's a lot of worry 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.360
 the dermatologist knows but it's like a 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.480
 approach so girls and guys if 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.790
 Do not be penn or brush that start it 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.080
 use because it stimulates the follicle apart 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.640
 hairy when doing as masahito and help 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 to your circulation and can even 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.530
 help a little gas to prevent campus 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.510
 I use this one that is garnier and 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.090
 really this is like the fourth bottle 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.920
 that he bought because I think it 's a shampoo 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.320
 wonderful is not expensive I think it costs 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.900
 two thousand pesos four dollars 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.000
 approximately and it fascinates me is 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.290
 for oily hair although I do not 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.060
 I have it so fatty 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.340
 but I understand that he cleans my hair in 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.630
 depth and apart from it smells like 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.030
 some milestones and it's like refreshingly rich 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.400
 and really what 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.490
 I love it very much I have spoken other 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.319
 I 'm not using this polio either 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.770
 nutrition shampoo and conditioner 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.570
 and honestly I did not like anything 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.970
 I did not feel that my hair was too 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.410
 clean nor very soft and less without frizz 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.580
 which assumes that one of the things that you 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.590
 promise so I always go back to this and 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.550
 this bottle lasts me a lot 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.800
 makes some 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.660
 three months 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.240
 two months not to see 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.140
 titin like two and a half months and the 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.030
 shampoo here a towel I have like to 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.000
 23 more courses and it's because the vall 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.940
 hair every two and three days then no 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.550
 many expenses that or conditioner 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.180
 faithful to my ballerina and is that I 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.240
 they love 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.280
 this is the yogurt and honey 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.830
 and it's too rich the smell of me 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.720
 love for example my little sister to 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.900
 garlic is loaded you accommodate it converted 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.480
 I find so rich 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.340
 and I feel that it leaves my hair soft and 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.340
 Like all conditioners that 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.140
 I tried ballerina that yes I think that a 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.329
 conditioner leave me soft hair 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.079
 I have to leave at least 3 minutes in 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.180
 the hair and applied me a lot leave a lot 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.020
 a lot has conditioned a lot of face mask 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.080
 but much and always in the ear 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.490
 down because if it destroys it it's going 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.430
 to oil the hair faster is going to 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.570
 associate with higher speed as well as 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.669
 boil the city and well my shampoos and 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.280
 ballerina conditioners enter pus 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.620
 I also like them but the garnier me 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.160
 Leaves hair much cleaner than these 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.229
 but conditioners I tried almost 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.479
 everyone and everything really I love how 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.180
 masks I have these two this is the 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.280
 tit 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.700
 besides creating ladies 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.920
 and he 's in glory 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.770
 this is malnutrition with royal jelly 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.270
 etcetera both I like a lot 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.300
 although now last I liked more 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.390
 this time the lip I like more the smell 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.030
 I think the smell of age is already like 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.770
 collapsing like that soap the shampoos 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.840
 and everything smells the same and really that I 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.390
 It is as it is 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.070
 really collapsing but I'm going to finish 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.410
 it's there I do not think I'll buy it again 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.260
 not because it's bad but because the smell 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.150
 It's not nice for me, it 's the 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.470
 smell without m'agrada 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.470
 and it's yellow 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.680
 these things he applied once to the 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.919
 week and he turned them over or be a week use 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.360
 this and the other week use is in a few 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.850
 words like the hair wash by 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.060
 medium and how she washed her hair for 2 to 3 days 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.580
 I use it once a week 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.530
 and there is the mirror like 10 minutes in my 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.270
 hair and generally when applied 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.860
 masks like in which tub baths 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.530
 then he tied my hair and I'm staying 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.080
 relaxed about 10 minutes I clean myself 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.139
 etcetera and then the stakes and not 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.410
 I use conditions when I use these 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.820
 masks 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:14.850
 so I use these two and I've tried 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.150
 many tested herbal masks 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.160
 essences the shpe garnier and those of 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.860
 change are also pretty good for 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.300
 seal the hair or the head or repair a 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.620
 little that really in repair does not 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.169
 has much used this serum d with 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.120
 soap 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.430
 that I believe that many people already 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.080
 they know is like super famous and I 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.490
 I like it because if I followed the tips 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.070
 but that lasted until obviously I 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.540
 the hair 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:45.790
 and I really want to buy the lip 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.250
 oil nutrition 7 returned not according as 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:51.040
 it's called but it's wonderful really 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.740
 I find it incredible but if I buy it 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.950
 I know that I'm not going to use it so I'm going 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.810
 to spend this first and still I think that 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.440
 it works super well even as 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.440
 heat protector 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.449
 but I use it more than anything for 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:09.460
 tiptoes and it is not always like going to 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:12.550
 goal my new discovery is this 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:15.160
 macadamia heat protector costs 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:19.229
 five thousand pesos in tuba and really I 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.229
 love is like milky 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.560
 today 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.870
 It's like a milk date but it does not let you 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.490
 heavy hair for nothing and I can 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.920
 use before the dryer with the hair 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.440
 wet or with dry hair when you 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.880
 irons I only use it when 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.980
 I dry my hair but usually 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.480
 used when I planted my hair and I 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:46.190
 leaves the wonderful sad hair of 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.750
 really super super soft as handy 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.360
 I leave it like hair fresh from 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:56.860
 hairdresser I really like a lot 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.629
 part of the smell is quite nice and 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.819
 I liked a lot and good guys and girls 

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:02.169

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:03.939

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:05.590

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.409
 it really has saved their hair 

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.629
