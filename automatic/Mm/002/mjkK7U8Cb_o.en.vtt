and that is absolutely fantastic

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.710 
and that is absolutely fantastic
admittedly<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.190> took<00:03:12.220> me<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.730> couple<00:03:12.910> tries<00:03:13.510> to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
admittedly it took me a couple tries to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.270

actually<00:03:13.990> make<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> gun<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.410> shot<00:03:14.920> and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
actually make a gun that shot and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.980 
actually make a gun that shot and
actually<00:03:15.820> would<00:03:15.970> kill<00:03:16.150> people<00:03:16.450> because<00:03:16.780> I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
actually would kill people because I

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.450 
actually would kill people because I

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
tried to make it a laundry lunch and the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.910 
tried to make it a laundry lunch and the
launchers<00:03:19.210> like<00:03:20.080> rocket<00:03:20.530> wouldn't<00:03:20.800> go

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
launchers like rocket wouldn't go

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.160

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
anywhere and I had a gun that ended up

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.840 
anywhere and I had a gun that ended up
making<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.590> shotgun<00:03:24.010> with<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.250> scope<00:03:24.520> because

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
making a shotgun with the scope because

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.820 
making a shotgun with the scope because

unlocked at first it gets kind of

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.390 
unlocked at first it gets kind of
confusing<00:03:28.630> but<00:03:29.500> once<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:29.920> figure<00:03:30.160> out<00:03:30.220> what

it is a lot of fun I have one that I

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.400 
it is a lot of fun I have one that I
call<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.740> blue<00:03:38.950> Charizard<00:03:39.550> that<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.810> sniper

basically<00:03:47.290> electric<00:03:47.770> shock<00:03:48.010> power<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.700> it's<00:03:48.850> a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
basically electric shock power so it's a

I want on a game that's only going to be
for<00:05:24.080> multiplayer<00:05:24.740> shooter<00:05:25.040> because<00:05:25.970> this<00:05:26.180> is

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
for multiplayer shooter because this is

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.630 
for multiplayer shooter because this is
a<00:05:26.390> preview<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.200> not<00:05:27.350> a<00:05:27.380> formal<00:05:27.950> review<00:05:28.220> there

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
a preview and not a formal review there

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.850 
a preview and not a formal review there

today<00:05:31.220> because<00:05:32.060> that<00:05:32.690> would<00:05:32.870> not<00:05:33.020> be<00:05:33.050> fair<00:05:33.320> for

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
today because that would not be fair for
