mean they going up to 20 pound today so

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.730 
mean they going up to 20 pound today so
the<00:00:29.800> way<00:00:29.980> I<00:00:30.010> do<00:00:30.370> it<00:00:30.670> is<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:31.570> feed<00:00:31.840> away<00:00:32.380> from<00:00:32.619> the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:32.740 
the way I do it is to feed away from the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.890 
the way I do it is to feed away from the
bank<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.190> then<00:00:33.520> pull<00:00:33.730> my<00:00:33.880> rigging<00:00:34.210> tie<00:00:34.390> into

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
bank and then pull my rigging tie into

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.870 
bank and then pull my rigging tie into
the<00:00:34.990> bank<00:00:35.200> those<00:00:35.680> fish<00:00:35.920> will<00:00:36.040> come<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.700> whack

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
the bank those fish will come and whack

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.900 
the bank those fish will come and whack
their<00:00:37.120> heads<00:00:37.270> in<00:00:37.450> anyway<00:00:37.840> so<00:00:38.580> that's<00:00:39.580> my

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
their heads in anyway so that's my

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.640 
their heads in anyway so that's my
theory<00:00:40.270> seems<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:40.900> be<00:00:40.990> working<00:00:41.350> really<00:00:41.500> well

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
theory seems to be working really well

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.710 
theory seems to be working really well
to<00:00:41.890> have<00:00:41.920> not<00:00:42.250> fair<00:00:42.520> logs<00:00:42.700> a<00:00:42.820> single<00:00:43.120> fish<00:00:43.300> so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
to have not fair logs a single fish so

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.400 
to have not fair logs a single fish so
far<00:00:44.310> so<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.780> feeding<00:00:46.990> a<00:00:47.320> bit<00:00:48.070> of<00:00:48.190> meat<00:00:48.370> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
far so just feeding a bit of meat a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.700 
far so just feeding a bit of meat a
little<00:00:50.410> bit<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.710> ground<00:00:50.860> bait<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:53.350> enough

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
little bit of ground bait that's enough

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.650 
little bit of ground bait that's enough
for<00:00:53.860> one<00:00:54.010> fish<00:00:56.130> that's<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.340> and<00:00:57.910> then<00:00:58.329> I<00:00:58.450> just

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
for one fish that's the and then I just

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.069 
for one fish that's the and then I just
I<00:00:59.130> feed<00:01:00.130> a<00:01:00.160> couple<00:01:00.520> of<00:01:00.760> feet<00:01:00.940> away<00:01:01.210> from<00:01:01.960> the

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
I feed a couple of feet away from the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.229 
I feed a couple of feet away from the
bank

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
bank

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.990 
bank
no<00:01:04.239> any<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:05.500> not<00:01:05.979> on<00:01:06.190> where<00:01:06.640> I'm<00:01:06.790> actually

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
no any or not on where I'm actually

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.790 
no any or not on where I'm actually
fishing<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.750> then<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.750> plan<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.470> pull<00:01:11.680> my

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
fishing and then the plan is to pull my

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.410 
fishing and then the plan is to pull my
hook<00:01:11.920> bait<00:01:12.159> right<00:01:12.820> into<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.360> bank<00:01:13.590> I've<00:01:14.590> got<00:01:14.830> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
hook bait right into the bank I've got a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.620 
hook bait right into the bank I've got a
great<00:01:16.420> big<00:01:16.600> focal<00:01:17.049> up<00:01:17.140> bait<00:01:17.940> ten<00:01:18.940> mil<00:01:19.180> cube<00:01:19.479> of

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
great big focal up bait ten mil cube of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.580 
great big focal up bait ten mil cube of
meat<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:21.060> don't<00:01:22.060> fish<00:01:22.600> ten<00:01:22.840> mil<00:01:23.020> cubes<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.409> lot

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
meat I don't fish ten mil cubes a lot

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.740 
meat I don't fish ten mil cubes a lot
but<00:01:23.920> here<00:01:24.280> it<00:01:24.520> definitely<00:01:25.090> seems<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.720> be

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
but here it definitely seems to be

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.000 
but here it definitely seems to be
working<00:01:26.229> just<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.659> simple<00:01:29.049> ball<00:01:29.260> code<00:01:29.590> 20

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010

take-no-prisoners<00:01:39.700> gear<00:01:40.390> this<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:42.610> by

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
take-no-prisoners gear this I think by

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.590 
take-no-prisoners gear this I think by
feeding<00:01:43.060> away<00:01:43.630> from<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.020> bank<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:46.210> keeping

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
feeding away from the bank you keeping

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.570 
feeding away from the bank you keeping
all<00:01:46.750> those<00:01:46.930> heads<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.500> tails<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:48.040> way<00:01:48.310> and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
all those heads and tails that way and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.399 
all those heads and tails that way and
hopefully<00:01:48.820> they're<00:01:49.090> going<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.299> face<00:01:49.510> into<00:01:50.320> the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
hopefully they're going to face into the

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:58.920 
hopefully they're going to face into the
bank<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.890> find<00:01:51.700> my<00:01:51.850> whole<00:01:52.030> bait
