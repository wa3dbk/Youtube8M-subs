taping it on this is a bit different
though<00:01:52.490> because<00:01:52.670> this<00:01:53.000> time<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.479> slip<00:01:53.960> the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.380 

so<00:02:05.710> now<00:02:05.860> for<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.070> makeup<00:02:06.400> look<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:06.730> ouch<00:02:07.030> I

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
so now for the makeup look and ouch I

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.969 
so now for the makeup look and ouch I
usually<00:02:07.930> start<00:02:08.110> by<00:02:08.200> getting<00:02:08.530> my<00:02:08.650> hair<00:02:08.830> out<00:02:08.860> of

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
usually start by getting my hair out of

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.859 
usually start by getting my hair out of
my<00:02:09.100> face<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.790> repeat<00:02:10.150> I<00:02:10.300> rarely<00:02:10.660> wear

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
my face and to repeat I rarely wear

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.600 
my face and to repeat I rarely wear
makeup<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.560> might<00:02:11.830> be<00:02:11.860> like<00:02:12.130> horribly

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
makeup so this might be like horribly

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.730 
makeup so this might be like horribly
bad<00:02:13.000> application<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.230> ignore<00:02:14.560> that

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
bad application but you just ignore that

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.230 
bad application but you just ignore that
and<00:02:14.800> just<00:02:15.010> focus<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.430> what<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> actual<00:02:16.030> look

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
and just focus on what the actual look

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.760 
and just focus on what the actual look
because<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.660> originally<00:02:16.990> was<00:02:17.290> going<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.620> add

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
because I originally was going to add

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.380 
because I originally was going to add
this<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.190> at<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.340> part<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.790> pretty<00:02:19.000> Basin

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
this so at this part of pretty Basin

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.000 
this so at this part of pretty Basin
just<00:02:19.570> do<00:02:19.720> your<00:02:19.840> average<00:02:20.350> makeup<00:02:20.830> foundation

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
just do your average makeup foundation

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.530 
just do your average makeup foundation
and<00:02:21.610> then<00:02:21.700> i'm<00:02:21.790> using<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:22.120> lighter<00:02:22.300> concealer

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
and then i'm using a lighter concealer

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.240 
and then i'm using a lighter concealer
i'm<00:02:22.960> putting<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.200> around<00:02:23.560> my<00:02:23.740> eyes<00:02:23.920> that

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
they're brighter it's lighter so the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.410 
they're brighter it's lighter so the
