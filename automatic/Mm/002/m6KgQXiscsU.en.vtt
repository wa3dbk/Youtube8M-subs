 at the computer can 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.630
 that has become a new video to that 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.860
 is once again time so that months 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.080
 for a child 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.149
 I do not have many of the books yet 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 started at this time even if 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.119
 her the video herself honest her 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.189
 have started and will become you then 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.110
 somewhere down here 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.260
 They show where I am currently 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.140
 I have a fit for that, on the one hand 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.570
 ebook started this is whisper summer 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.700
 from tanja bosom i think she will be with 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 spoken out 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.640
 Amelie always tries that for me 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.350
 but I do not get it that way 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.120
 Well, I think it will be fusion 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 pronounced because I always 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.810
 bosom but tanja say it really difficult 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.490
 to pronounce your name 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.590
 that's this gorgeous cover 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.780
 I think that fits perfectly in the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 This season and yes I am pleased 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.549
 that animal is not so 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 more precise idea what it's about because tanjas 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.630
 books are probably just all 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.240
 great after emily lives loud li and see 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.740
 Yesterday I was both of her 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.630
 I've already read, I'm just there 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 blind and trust her 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.560
 and buy every book from her that is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.659
 so far I have been really great 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.060
 now seven percent so one 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 good piece of progress and yes me 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.240
 I just like it awesome 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.680
 a loose easy love story 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 I think a summery 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.729
 love story design couple bites 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.650
 conceal secrets and tanja has indeed 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.030
 also on it a totally stark plot 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.380
 Get on with nobody counting 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.290
 that's why I'm already 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.580
 really excited the next book 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.110
 which i read is love hurt by 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.880
 rebecca donovan 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.580
 that can be with the love came 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.439
 together and yes we are here 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.970
 as or I have here for us 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.830
 so marks made us so 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.990
 even know how far we read about 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.250
 to which chapter you see I am 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.459
 currently on 180 ha and actually 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.939
 I would have long been on page 2 188 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.379
 his 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.970
 I have not done yesterday 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.870
 read that means I have to correct today 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.220
 to give gas 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.620
 I 'm not sure if I'm that 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.370
 I'll make it to the first 180 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.049
 I can side 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.900
 Definitely say it's a fantastic one 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.940
 history touching her very emotionally 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.920
 and she's gonna get me right 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.170
 I recently had a few like that 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.790
 Characters excited about this book 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.280
 because that's not emotionally so 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.989
 has and it is an amazing 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.299
 history easy to read easily 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.500
 especially lets think to the first one 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.510
 moment over a god is that small 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.430
 written but you do not notice that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.440
 you just fly through the pages and 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.489
 it's just really great and right 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.260
 all are not yet 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.280
 definitely should have married 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.920
 I would like to access these books 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.970
 start on the 15th 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.030
 to be precise, harmless hell 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.620
 yes I do not know what to expect here 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.450
 but I hope that I am the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.099
 fifteenth begins and on the 15th 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.319
 but at the same time read out because that 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:12.690
 has only 200 170 pages so that is 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.579
 a close a little bit for 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.609
 in between a thriller should be that 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.500
 and I'm very curious like that 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.819
 Whole will shape if you give 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.049
 there are three other bands but me 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.829
 I do not think they all really hang out 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.870
 together 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.829
 Moreover, I look forward insanely 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.750
 that tenants love everyone and the 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.190
 love cargo together harry potter and 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.540
 the chamber of fright 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.250
 I have not started there yet 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.650
 where I read 100 pages yesterday 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.209
 would have to ash on my main but it 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.910
 have three other books in between 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.079
 pushed that had priority and thus 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.609
 I have not started that yet but 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.680
 I already know the story 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.419
 that's why it 's not that bad 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.650
 I was just in between today 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.030
 push and look forward to it too 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.160
 very very doll 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.410
 I'm curious I think I'll 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.030
 Here is no reading to make emotions video 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.590
 unless you really have interest 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.180
 tuned 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.010
 otherwise I think everyone knows that 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.579
 story and the harry potter is 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.489
 simply an absolute must and too good 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:12.060
 Last , I read or hear as 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.129
 audiobook of no new ashes and phoenix 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.470
 That's how I started yesterday 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.449
 So I'm still in the beginning, I think 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.180
 what lies to me 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.590
 yes at the very top of page 25 at the tour 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.599
 But you need a very long book 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.440
 The audiobook has ten hours and one 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.090
 I am very curious about that 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.590
 What can I expect I will have me 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.509
 now decided to do it all 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.090
 now booked to hear especially we 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.560
 go camping for a day and then 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.669
 I thought in the evening when we all then 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.690
 I can live in the tents 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.430
 take headphones and then another 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.960
 listen in there because I will not 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.430
 to read on the days but to create 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.900
 I can hear that, that's it 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.150
 no problem or if we have a lot 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.349
 lie and you almost a dead moment 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.630
 I can then stop in the audiobook 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.979
 Listen and that was why I was 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.930
 I chose this year with ten 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.159
 hours I have something there so I have 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.509
 a little bit more than me 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.550
 only one thing would have taken six 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.960
 lasts for hours or so yes and I am 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.080
 really curious he has such a 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.750
 I think that's a bit of a crime 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.400
 this is about a young girl 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.259
 which with a hollywood there anyway 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.000
 I do not know and I do not know 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.620
 very curious and so far it has me 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.300
 Really liked listening to the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.130
 spokesman very very pleasant 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.720
 I think the basic idea is just great and 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.870
 I'm curious no meyer has yes 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.599
 also so stunning scenario and 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.830
 Ideas and no idea and that's why 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:31.039
 I believe that to me 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.599
 this is crazy and yes 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.210
 they were already my five books 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.770
 I currently hear or read and you 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.900
 can I like the comments already 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.789
 what books you are currently reading reads 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.650
 or whatever I am already very much 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.590
 Curious , the one or the other smile 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.610
 Other readers recommendation not to do so 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:51.009
 otherwise I wish you only now 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.009
 a wonderful day with my dear ones 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.090
