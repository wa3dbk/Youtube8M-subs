them in two or three handle tub or
shower<00:03:46.600> valves<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.620> also<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.970> neat<00:03:49.299> thing

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
shower valves and also the neat thing

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.979 
shower valves and also the neat thing
about<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:50.110> positive<00:03:50.860> valve<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.989> when

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
about a positive valve is that when

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.199 
about a positive valve is that when
someone<00:03:53.440> goes<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.739> flush<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.250> toilet<00:03:54.340> it

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
someone goes to flush the toilet it

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.240 
someone goes to flush the toilet it
would<00:03:55.450> bounce<00:03:56.049> off<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.560> pressure<00:03:56.799> to<00:03:57.100> where

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
would bounce off the pressure to where

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.100 
would bounce off the pressure to where
you<00:03:57.459> would<00:03:57.610> not<00:03:57.760> get<00:03:57.940> too<00:03:58.120> much<00:03:58.269> hot<00:03:58.540> water<00:03:58.570> or

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
you would not get too much hot water or

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.949 
you would not get too much hot water or
too<00:03:59.380> much<00:03:59.530> cold<00:03:59.829> water<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:01.420> will<00:04:01.750> be<00:04:01.930> a

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
too much cold water so that will be a

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.570 
too much cold water so that will be a
thing<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.320> past<00:04:02.530> eventually

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.060 

and<00:04:08.330> here<00:04:08.720> we're<00:04:08.930> going<00:04:08.960> to<00:04:09.230> remove<00:04:09.800> the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
and here we're going to remove the

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.150 
and here we're going to remove the
protective<00:04:10.720> cover<00:04:11.720> plate<00:04:12.080> which<00:04:12.710> keeps<00:04:12.950> it

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
protective cover plate which keeps it

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.090 
protective cover plate which keeps it
protected<00:04:13.930> during<00:04:15.370> packaging<00:04:16.780> or<00:04:17.780> whatever
