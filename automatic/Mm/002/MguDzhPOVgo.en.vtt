for this food prep session because I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.849 
for this food prep session because I

divided the mayonnaise between 6 boxes
and<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.609> really<00:03:20.850> made<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.209> freaka<00:03:21.630> taste

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
and it really made the freaka taste

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.809

amazing<00:03:22.500> plus<00:03:22.829> everything<00:03:23.220> else<00:03:23.489> in<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
amazing plus everything else in the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.069 
I don't really see the mayonnaise as
being<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.269> problem<00:03:27.480> for<00:03:27.660> me

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079
