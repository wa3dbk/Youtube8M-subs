00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.290
 it's actually one of the first 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.049
 scientific studies differ from 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.470
 fundamentally on empirical with the whole 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.420
 in which we dealt 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.039
 especially the situation of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.560
 have examined remote drivers 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.750
 working conditions of remote drivers though 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 just the whole have embedded the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.109
 ask how traffic is developing 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.130
 will affect the future 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.180
 society as a whole, however 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.230
 especially on the driver 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.270
 It is important to us that ours 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.950
 technology arrives at people 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.430
 we wanted to get some momentum in the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.440
 business 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.120
 about the study the necessary 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 to gain knowledge what moves 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.170
 people what leads people into 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.170
 what kind of technology do you need? 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.260
 we were able to document which 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.239
 Issues on the driver in the first place 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.220
 line to come it is the time problem 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.040
 the time management for the for the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.840
 remote drivers it's traffic 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.540
 Traffic load for the driver 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.270
 but it is also the payment and just 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.640
 especially the bad image like that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.490
 is struggling pastor of today 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.250
 Freight transport is booming in itself 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.740
 economy which prevails associated 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.790
 competitive pressure also in the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.950
 social conditions for that 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.930
 driving staff precipitates in front of everyone 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.840
 What we very much regret that 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.280
 the driver wages be performance-friendly 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.229
 if there could be one 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.600
 functioning competition and none 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.580
 Dumping competition over the social and 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.990
 pay conditions in european 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.540
 traffic 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.259
 the average company in 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.380
 Germany has ten employees there 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.259
 one lives on a very low turnover 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.300
 margin half a percent to 1 percent 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.770
 Sales are well managed 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.810
 You can win 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.119
 calculate which margins here 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 are present in total on the social 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.880
 Situation of the pay situation 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.880
 driver to change something 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.480
 That's what all the experts actually thought 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.480
 uniform as the largest 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.640
 the most important influence 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.430
 was identified is the theme 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.330
 demographic change and thus 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.550
 coherent also the topic 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.700
 Experts in our case 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.010
 especially the subject of drivers 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.020
 Generally available numbers are known 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.540
 that you will spend the next few years in the 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.000
 next decade in about 40 years 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.800
 percent of the now active 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.330
 professional drivers retire 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.380
 become 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.590
 that's about 250,000 in pay 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.570
 professional motorists 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.280
 aggravating comes just that 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.840
 it is expected that traffic will grow 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.570
 So who actually more drivers 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:59.769
 would need 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:03.190
 as less we expect one another 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.019
 Get in touch with the club 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.050
 we expect that 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.940
 you look at the increasing with the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.260
 increasing age of the remote driver 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.489
 and we want 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.530
 of course also the profession more attractive 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.480
 do and want that with ours 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.480
 support technology positively
