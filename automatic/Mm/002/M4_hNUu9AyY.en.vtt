in which we have obnoxiously chicken
yellow<00:00:39.680> bar<00:00:40.680> tape<00:00:40.890> which<00:00:41.460> matches<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> colors

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
yellow bar tape which matches the colors

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.950 
yellow bar tape which matches the colors
over<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> frame<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.399> over<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
over here with a frame and over here and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.400 
over here with a frame and over here and
so<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.539> tires<00:00:48.539> they're<00:00:48.809> also<00:00:48.899> match<00:00:49.140> kind

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so are the tires they're also match kind

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.100 
so are the tires they're also match kind
of<00:00:50.210> also<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:52.070> velocity<00:00:53.070> V<00:00:53.670> 43<00:00:54.270> super<00:00:54.960> deep

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
of also we have velocity V 43 super deep

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.959 
of also we have velocity V 43 super deep
V<00:00:55.489> rims<00:00:57.079> there's<00:00:58.079> no<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:59.250> are<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.699> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
have a fixie but this is not a fixie

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.399 
have a fixie but this is not a fixie
it's<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.090> dropped<00:01:09.479> pixies<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.250> because

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
it's what I dropped pixies on because

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.570 
it's what I dropped pixies on because
with<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:14.700> mini<00:01:14.970> speeds<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> bike<00:01:17.340> has

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
with this mini speeds this bike has

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
with this mini speeds this bike has
unparalleled<00:01:18.299> maneuverability<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.259> also<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
unparalleled maneuverability it's also a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.820 
unparalleled maneuverability it's also a
very<00:01:19.680> small<00:01:19.979> bike<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.460> 53<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.650> have<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
very small bike it's a 53 I have to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.810 
very small bike it's a 53 I have to
mention<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.280> stock<00:01:23.729> headset<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:25.820> this

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
mention the stock headset here it's this

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.410 
mention the stock headset here it's this
is<00:01:27.000> not<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.210> stock<00:01:27.479> headset<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.409> uh<00:01:29.270> see<00:01:30.270> it's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
is not a stock headset it's uh see it's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.210 
is not a stock headset it's uh see it's
one<00:01:30.720> piece<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.079> metal<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> original<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:31.979> more

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
one piece of metal the original was more

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.039 
one piece of metal the original was more
than<00:01:32.310> -<00:01:32.490> pizza<00:01:32.850> metal<00:01:33.119> welded<00:01:33.570> together<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
than - pizza metal welded together and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.690 
than - pizza metal welded together and
it<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.350> broke<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it actually broke there in one of the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.399 
it actually broke there in one of the
funny<00:01:35.880> hops<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:36.869> these<00:01:37.049> wheels<00:01:37.290> are

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
funny hops and now these wheels are

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.990 
funny hops and now these wheels are
definitely<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> best<00:01:38.310> buy<00:01:38.549> hot<00:01:38.790> wheels

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
definitely not the best buy hot wheels

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
definitely not the best buy hot wheels
because<00:01:39.299> they're<00:01:39.450> heavy<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> really

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
because they're heavy this is a really

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.700 
because they're heavy this is a really
actually<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.250> say<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> pretty<00:01:41.820> heavy<00:01:42.030> bike

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
actually I say it's a pretty heavy bike

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.300 
actually I say it's a pretty heavy bike
really<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.290> best<00:01:46.290> bunnyhop<00:01:46.740> machine<00:01:47.159> out

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
really not the best bunnyhop machine out

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.670 
really not the best bunnyhop machine out
there<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> definitely<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.500> some

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
there but I definitely can do some

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.389 
there but I definitely can do some
damage<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.780> once<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> spin<00:01:52.229> them<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.530> they

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
damage it once you spin them out they

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.130 
damage it once you spin them out they
gain<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.000> wheels<00:01:54.180> gain<00:01:54.420> momentum<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.049> they

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
gain the wheels gain momentum and they

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
gain the wheels gain momentum and they
go<00:01:55.320> pretty<00:01:55.560> fast<00:01:55.799> now<00:01:56.159> obviously<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.850> don't

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
go pretty fast now obviously I don't

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.770 
go pretty fast now obviously I don't
really<00:01:57.840> need<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:59.130> ball<00:01:59.310> stem<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.939> extender

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
really need the ball stem here extender

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.870 
really need the ball stem here extender
but<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.460> put<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.640> anyways<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
but I put it on anyways and this is the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.139 
but I put it on anyways and this is the
wheels<00:02:06.060> they're<00:02:06.719> custom<00:02:07.079> built<00:02:07.910> pretty<00:02:08.910> much

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
wheels they're custom built pretty much

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.790 
wheels they're custom built pretty much
you<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.420> take<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.929> wolsey<00:02:10.289> lay<00:02:10.470> some<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you know take the wolsey lay some of the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.190 
you know take the wolsey lay some of the
hub

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
hub

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.660 
hub
do<00:02:12.560> what<00:02:12.680> he<00:02:12.800> would<00:02:12.950> normally<00:02:13.069> do<00:02:13.430> when<00:02:13.580> you

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
do what he would normally do when you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
do what he would normally do when you
build<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.940> wheel<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:16.370> well<00:02:17.180> that's<00:02:17.480> about<00:02:17.630> it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
build a wheel and well that's about it

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.490 
build a wheel and well that's about it
it's<00:02:17.959> uh<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.680> pretty<00:02:18.770> fast<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:20.260> think<00:02:21.260> that's

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
it's uh it's pretty fast I think that's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's uh it's pretty fast I think that's
pretty<00:02:21.950> heavy<00:02:22.190> but<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.670> pretty<00:02:23.030> fast<00:02:23.240> for

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
pretty heavy but it's a pretty fast for

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.250 
pretty heavy but it's a pretty fast for
a<00:02:23.510> pretty<00:02:23.690> heavy<00:02:23.840> bike<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:24.980> about<00:02:25.100> it
