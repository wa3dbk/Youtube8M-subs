00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.770
 I have a camera does not go two exits 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.290
 or the entrance is red it is obvious and food 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:16.350
 plus minus yellow is a long cord for 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.980
 video meaning it connects to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.609
 tape recorder 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:26.000
 it seems again to the power reverse 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.640
 behind 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 this is a signal wire 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 as I understand it, we connect 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 receiver signal wire we 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.680
 we connect to the plus plus also 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.879
 This is how I understand, too, we connect 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.530
 red clover sous plus 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.510
 if I understand correctly and this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.860
 plug the ground she has a camera here 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.520
 stool stand 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.240
 shows stop i.e. zone see 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.660
 we have a stool 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.710
 that is, literally a centimeter in 30 cameras 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.930
 bumper located here on top 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.159
 and shows us the most truthful 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.159
 picture when to be ashamed 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.820
 laid the cabin 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.439
 everything is fine well, what else to show here 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.670
 looks like this is stuck here 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:30.380
 a clamp so that it doesn't move anywhere 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:33.950
 locks as you see 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:45.640
 slam shut sticks out well sticks out a little bit well 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:50.840
 what does it all mean here with us 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.470
 then here it is under the plastic 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.030
 overlay 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.840
 everything in the corrugation here goes down the lantern to 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.770
 it connects the wire from the most 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.640
 recorders 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:10.789
 goes on the floor here here and there further 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.030
 that is, on top and nothing threw them into 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.920
 cord stock principle 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.900
 just enough upstairs we may 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:25.970
 not enough so that's how we will now 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.870
