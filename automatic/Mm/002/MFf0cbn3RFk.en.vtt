00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.799
 here we are guys back days 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.390
 biased and this I saw I am 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.970
 legend makes it fall here we are with a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.040
 more video here on gta 5 questions we are 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.080
 here with the first absolute game plan on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.719
 so online it really is one thing 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.520
 very fine it was really a lot of time e 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 try to witch something but what 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.240
 as long as you need them they were packed 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.160
 from the American agent who does nothing else 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 than eating sandwiches in front of gta 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.840
 today I only had the chance 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 now why they are unlocked serves to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 to be able to record something without it 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.719
 burglary reiterated today as we 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.820
 we find precisely in the multiplayer then 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.980
 he pressed the fact that I will do a series 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.390
 of pretty nice videos and this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.250
 there will be a video for how long 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.020
 concerns the first impression in the sense 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.120
 which I am now say we had the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.610
 chance to try what it is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.039
 one of the many ways present in the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.320
 game or just that of deatmatch 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.350
 really a very cool thing in which 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.420
 precisely the goal is to grow 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.969
 more and more level is to increase 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.340
 more and more reputation based 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.070
 emissions is so much more then in the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.780
 case now that I show some 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.600
 showing me the map of what it is 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.549
 precisely this gta online very well like 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 as well to see for those who do not know 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.040
 these are precisely the dots players 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.170
 white and while these blue things are 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.320
 precisely the various activities that can be done 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.390
 do then start from the races 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.080
 until you get to the various 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.210
 missions that's me there's so much more 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.460
 so there really is a lot of things to do 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 there is also a possibility to do 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 then customize the vehicle 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.759
 obviously all that is possible 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.159
 doing in history is also present in the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.079
 online have introduced the fact that there is 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.329
 the possibility of making robberies then 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.860
 really a very nice thing and 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.130
 so now let's see if 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.399
 we can get someone to do 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.680
 maybe enter someone here in ours 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.750
 out let's see if we can do it 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.600
 something in that case I also saw that 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.640
 there is the possibility of practically being able to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.920
 play with headphones so if maybe 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 there is a lobby where the game is not 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.789
 there are nothing but Italian players 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.470
 really a very nice thing 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.590
 so this one doesn't want to 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.890
 enter the car or harass only the task 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.810
 this without thinking about it fuck me killed 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.140
 we hope there are no lobbyists 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.959
 usual french because really 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.879
 risk not playing the page anymore 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:31.290
 however, if someone decides to enter 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.739
 they want strong manners therefore bad 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.230
 we are a bit of someone then in that case 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.420
 I also wanted to tell you the fact that the fact 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.760
 I also told you about the headphones 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.980
 also the possibility of creating 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.680
 a curve so really if maybe 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.650
 manage to register on the website at 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.900
 rock sta that allows you precisely to 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.690
 enlist the various people in your own 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.150
 club really curves a nice thing 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.970
 another extra activity you can do 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.750
 here on gta online however we take stands 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.060
 fucking bikes are without ammunition 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.510
 perfect what we have to go to 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.720
 supply a little something else 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.670
 fuck those but i zilio horse that 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.100
 fuck away he escapes from then we go 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.430
 to do some ammunition 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.959
 let's see if we hate it here 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.849
 are also the various activities 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.310
 if I wanted to go see with that the 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:34.349
 perfect theater seemed strange to me like 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.709
 emblem therefore obviously making massacres 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.709
 killing people by sowing the police 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.480
 the various sayings are earned 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.480
 experience points that allow you 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.880
 just to increase as a reputation 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.530
 so obviously case but because they are 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.590
 without a wheel I hadn't even noticed it 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.930
 fuck then go up a level then 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:02.000
 obviously very nice guys like 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:04.739
 what dick really sorry to die for 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.150
 perhaps it was the type of la bulÃ© e 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.010
 I didn't even notice a showman 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.000
 we hope that now reborn with the 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.380
 munitions 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.530
 otherwise I'm screwed ok it's done 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.750
 Imperfect 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.010
 We have some money then elections 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.389
 we go there to spend so much of 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.770
 earned we also have the store here 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.580
 of weapons nearby 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.150
 in this case pressing analogs ago 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.419
 this kind of action that obviously is 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.700
 skillful meanwhile more properly I look at the 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.260
 my character is more bursts out laughing 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.060
 in this case, however, this video I had to 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.669
 do it also web that loves the cause of 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.650
 fact that I have cooled more than one 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.169
 Eskimo living at the north pole indeed 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.669
 if I show you like the mountain of 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.380
 handkerchiefs he has here on the bedside table 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.430
 really from this absurd anyway 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.830
 no more bullshit 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.780
 no no no no I kill myself now 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.300
 always with the gun 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.320
 we buy some stuff 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.380
 Excuse me perfect and a gun can 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.410
 buy 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:12.340
 we take the standard charger is from 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.620
 this fucking camouflage breaks this 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.010
 pink slutty guys 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.780
 we do work of my mom 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.060
 they wait it seems so much that they don't have it 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.250
 done because he was stuck if I 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.310
 I want to kill and I ca n't do it 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.390
 I wanted to take your weapon 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.400
 run away, so here we have the 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.460
 death meanwhile we will see if 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.419
 we can get someone in 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.490
 our car 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.979
 I wanted to try also the fact that there is the 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.260
 possibility to call the type number 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.020
 insurance that should be 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.820
 this in fact that should tell me where it is 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.470
 the car I had customized 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.870
 at the beginning so it makes me appear 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.180
 front and I don't even know how it works 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.440
 so now let's see guys boh ok 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.130
 great refuse me the call like 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.750
 we always go to the map for a moment 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:05.340
 however players do not even know how much 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.630
 it is the limit that allows precisely of 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.610
 players on the map at the se 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.310
 I 'm not wrong I was told that the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.250
 limit was type 60 the stuff of the kind 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:19.690
 so we'll see we'll see 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:21.700
 but if maybe the various modes ok 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.919
 later however there will be 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.750
 other more specific videos but how it is 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.699
 noticed this we are a bit here with a 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.139
 video 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:32.289
 the one on the helicopter is a video of 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:33.759
 we are for the first impression making me 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.919
 see exactly what it is 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:38.440
 because maybe he doesn't have it yet 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.650
 possibility of being able to play then it is 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.570
 really very nice and a duel 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.280
 with your case I do it immediately to 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.740
 this here practically has to accept 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.070
 the invitation so now let's see then it goes 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.410
 well 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:58.270
 falls faster then 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:05.110
 obviously the infinite loading as 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:07.060
 usual ok anyway guys we can 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.410
 conclude this video today with 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.210
 the first episode in this case 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.830
 then there will be more videos 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.570
 fun, of course, with cazzeggiano 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.610
 more total we will do just another 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.139
 episode so no kids hope that 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.430
 you enjoyed this video 30 by chance 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:20.500
