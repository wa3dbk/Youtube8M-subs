00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
is right before this I'm doing water

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.710 
is right before this I'm doing water
marble<00:03:28.710> and<00:03:28.860> short<00:03:29.130> nails<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.580> gather<00:03:30.330> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
marble and short nails I gather the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.340 
marble and short nails I gather the
design<00:03:31.140> much<00:03:31.740> closer<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:33.270> longer<00:03:33.630> nails<00:03:33.840> you

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
design much closer for longer nails you

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.550 
design much closer for longer nails you
can<00:03:34.680> spread<00:03:35.310> out<00:03:35.580> your<00:03:35.790> design<00:03:36.210> more<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.020> now

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
can spread out your design more so now

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.490 
can spread out your design more so now
