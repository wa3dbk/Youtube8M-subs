iron<00:00:55.489> method<00:00:55.879> now<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.329> can<00:00:56.480> see<00:00:56.510> why<00:00:56.930> I

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
iron method now so you can see why I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.810 
iron method now so you can see why I
prefer<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.530> wrap<00:00:58.250> your<00:00:58.399> hair<00:00:58.520> around<00:00:58.550> the

prefer it wrap your hair around the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.689 
prefer it wrap your hair around the
curling<00:00:58.910> iron<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.570> let<00:00:59.629> your<00:00:59.780> hair<00:00:59.930> get<00:01:00.110> hot

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
curling iron and let your hair get hot

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.459 
curling iron and let your hair get hot

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
next remove the curling iron and now see

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.020 
next remove the curling iron and now see
how<00:01:03.590> much<00:01:03.739> easier<00:01:04.160> it<00:01:04.250> is<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.520> hold<00:01:04.699> on<00:01:04.789> to<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
how much easier it is to hold on to the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.120 
how much easier it is to hold on to the
curl<00:01:05.239> pinning<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.200> curls<00:01:06.500> in<00:01:06.619> nice<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.070> tight

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
curl pinning the curls in nice and tight

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.240 
curl pinning the curls in nice and tight
is<00:01:07.399> much<00:01:07.670> easier<00:01:08.149> with<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.300> curling<00:01:08.630> iron<00:01:09.190> so<00:01:10.190> I

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
is much easier with a curling iron so I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.330 
is much easier with a curling iron so I
just<00:01:10.399> go<00:01:10.550> around<00:01:10.670> my<00:01:10.940> head<00:01:11.180> these<00:01:11.570> pieces<00:01:11.899> I<00:01:12.470> go

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
just go around my head these pieces I go

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.230 
just go around my head these pieces I go
vertical<00:01:14.979> so<00:01:15.979> they<00:01:16.100> kind<00:01:16.369> of<00:01:16.430> go<00:01:16.940> backwards

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
vertical so they kind of go backwards

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.300 
vertical so they kind of go backwards
like<00:01:17.570> this<00:01:17.690> with<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.110> curls<00:01:18.410> when<00:01:19.130> you're

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
like this with the curls when you're

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.460 
like this with the curls when you're
pinning<00:01:19.610> these<00:01:19.910> pieces<00:01:20.270> closer<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:21.080> your<00:01:21.229> head

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
pinning these pieces closer to your head

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.350 
pinning these pieces closer to your head
wrap<00:01:21.950> them<00:01:22.160> around<00:01:22.220> your<00:01:22.520> finger<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.090> stick

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
wrap them around your finger and stick

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.109 
wrap them around your finger and stick
it<00:01:23.509> close<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.649> your<00:01:24.740> head<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.250> close<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.030> your

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
it close to your head so close to your

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.390 
it close to your head so close to your
root<00:01:26.330> these<00:01:26.540> pieces<00:01:26.780> these<00:01:26.990> back<00:01:27.259> pieces

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
root these pieces these back pieces

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.830 
root these pieces these back pieces
they're<00:01:28.400> just<00:01:28.580> kind<00:01:28.759> of<00:01:28.850> hard<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.119> clip<00:01:29.659> that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
they're just kind of hard to clip that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.929 
they're just kind of hard to clip that
close<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:30.439> people<00:01:31.369> don't<00:01:31.430> really<00:01:31.549> see<00:01:31.820> them

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
close so people don't really see them

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.429 
close so people don't really see them
anyways<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:32.540> these<00:01:32.630> ones<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.960> can<00:01:33.110> just<00:01:33.259> kind

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
anyways so these ones you can just kind

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.789 
anyways so these ones you can just kind
of<00:01:33.470> curl<00:01:33.710> towards<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.159> ends

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
of curl towards the ends

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.830 
of curl towards the ends
so<00:01:36.579> this<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.000> what<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.210> will<00:01:37.270> look<00:01:37.329> like<00:01:37.509> once

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
so this is what it will look like once

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.410 
so this is what it will look like once
you<00:01:37.990> pin<00:01:38.229> curl<00:01:38.500> your<00:01:38.740> hair<00:01:39.009> now<00:01:39.729> you're<00:01:40.299> just

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
you pin curl your hair now you're just

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.959 
you pin curl your hair now you're just
going<00:01:40.539> to<00:01:40.600> wait<00:01:40.840> really<00:01:41.829> as<00:01:41.950> long<00:01:41.979> as<00:01:42.369> you<00:01:42.520> want

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.550 

alright<00:01:45.969> so<00:01:46.210> that<00:01:46.479> should<00:01:46.719> be<00:01:46.810> enough<00:01:47.049> time<00:01:47.320> it

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
alright so that should be enough time it

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.679 
alright so that should be enough time it
