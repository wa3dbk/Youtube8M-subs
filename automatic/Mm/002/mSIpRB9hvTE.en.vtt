00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:34.859
 that is, the people of the battle of that track 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.130
 then challenge your friends like that 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.099
 try not to do the same thing yet 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.279
 murid rhythms we have already seen better rappers 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.869
 you can listen to them here 

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:50.069
 recent music recordings are better 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.219
 I will show you one record 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.219
 it's really cool here 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.219

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:12.760
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I am Seriously Guys 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.920
 it's very cool right here maybe 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.100
 these dudes who are such tracks 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.390
 have written it down or have already read it 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.580
 either a hundred and fifty leagues 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.450
 bench marks or at least ascending 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.420
 stars 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.160
 damn but seriously it's cool not 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.580
 I do not know whether they read 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.310
 We wrote these tracks but damn it seriously 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.950
 super sounds just can't do 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.840
 this is awesome cool last records 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.150
 what users themselves do is 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.800
 lays out the usual entries here 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.709
 here in general, then I do coast 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.989
 seriously help here everything is in english 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.130
 language 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.790
 if you know english then super 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.480
 This app principle is a minus for 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.239
 I have this is that all the cons that is 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.380
 all bits are universal everything is in english 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.079
 language all topics 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:08.320
 well damn how to sleep it right in general 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.630
 all foreign rap artists that is 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.180
 Russian rappers are not that 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.140
 so if you want to read, let's say 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.690
 it's someone else's track but just read it yourself yes 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.780
 top like him need a good pronunciation 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.299
 English you at least then 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.329
 you might have something 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.660
 in general to become a worthy rapper I 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.239
 I think even though I'm not a rapper 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:39.549
 but at least you need to clearly pronounce 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.890
 text that is, you need to have a good article 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:46.140
 rational apparatus that is for this you 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.829
 I need as I think at least 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:54.700
 good to have to pronounce tongue twisters 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.799
 generally you need to start with patters 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.870
 I think so, but even if you donâ€™t 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.230
 get to be a rapper then at least 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:07.189
 you will have 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.239
 quality speech that is, you will 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.760
 well to say the words 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.700
 maybe you can be leading with him 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.919
 why not then there is this very useful 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.859
 thing so dare the tongue twisters 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.690
 it steers in general it's cool so what else 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.180
 parameters parameters parameters yes I already and 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.320
 showed very here I entered the account 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.610
 I can generally leave records 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.400
 here we go here in general 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.130
 the words of the battle can be seen here and here 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.010
 the worst in my opinion 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:45.630
 get track it 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:48.449
 the track has become long and dogs 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:54.080
 in general, like this shorter than the Korean type 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.080
 rapper yeah well let's listen but this 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.699
 listen, listen to the damn full sound 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.699
 made 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.290
 but 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:51.349
 before dinner, are we there? 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:03.569

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.419
