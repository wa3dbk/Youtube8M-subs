00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.110
 kiss and then we waited until the next 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.110
 video bay 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.610
 well as you can see here I already have the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.399
 pre-cooked octopus in a bowl 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.040
 which I have placed a liter of water and 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.100
 I'm going to boil it around 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.740
 30 minutes on the stove at normal heat and 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.440
 so that the octopus can taste 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.050
 put a coffee spoon of salt it 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.050
 I'm going to let you cook another little bit more to 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.580
 that is more tender then it is worth once 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.740
 that we have the octopus and on the stove 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.570
 let's start chopping what is the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.750
 vegetable I'm going to start with the tomato 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.300
 I try to make regular paintings not 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.820
 very small nor very big one 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.740
 Once I have chopped the tomato I am going to 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.810
 place in a container where I'm going to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.810
 prepare what will be the ceviche 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.799
 or not 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.250
 do not 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.250
 to my mom 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.360
 well once we finished chopping 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.930
 the tomato will now do the same 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.509
 procedure with the cilantro the most 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.790
 finely that you can once we have 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.590
 chopped the cilantro we will place it in the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.989
 same container where the tomato is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.700
 I remind you that cilantro I already have it 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.700
 previously washed and drained 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.099
 or not 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.730
 we go 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.390
 well now it's the turn of the onion 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.090
 let's try to chop it as much 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.370
 finely that you can especially because 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.680
 it's about the onion and sometimes it's a 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.170
 little uncomfortable eating very large pieces 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.940
 then as finely as you can and 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.270
 we will also place it in our 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.010
 container 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.010
 but not 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.010
 ah 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.980
 one Love 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.180
 good 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.180
 well once we have chopped the onion 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.580
 now it's the turn of the avocado this I leave 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.830
 at the end because it usually rusts once 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.879
 chopped we will also incorporate it into 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.879
 our container 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.330
 to me 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.330
 no no 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.790
 to 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.159
 well once we've bitten all the 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.799
 vegetables now the next step is 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.140
 cut the lemons in half once 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.500
 that we have the lemons parties we are going to 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.030
 extract what is the juice and we are going to 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.280
 do as follows as 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.250
 you are really seeing it with a 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.710
 hand juicer and juice we're going to 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.020
 reserve in a glass because this one 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.020
 will place at the end of the recipe 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.010
 well once we finish squeezing 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.289
 all the lemons will reserve the juice and 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.139
 we will pass to the following 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.719
 at this time we are going to pay the 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.389
 stove have already gone 30 minutes from 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.699
 that we left cooking the octopus is already 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.039
 more tender and already grabbed the taste of the 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.189
 come out once we turn it off we're going to 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.139
 let cool and then cold really 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:00.839
 we are going to remove the skin and if it is 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.660
 abode and let's rinse it a lot 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:04.790
 all right 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.010
 well, that's how our 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.670
 octopus as they come super tender 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.860
 Now let's chop either cubed or 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.840
 in slices as you most prefer 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.000
 once we finish we're going to 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.450
 incorporate it into the container of our 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.450
 vegetable 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.690
 how 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.690
 ah 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.310
 look 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.930
 well at this particular moment of 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.600
 chop what is the octopus incorporated it to 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.340
 my container where are the vegetables and 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.949
 Now it's time to add what is the 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.650
 lemon juice I do it with a colander 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.910
 so that no huesito Do not leave one 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.539
 Once already lemon juice let 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.240
 place the salt 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:22.530
 the salt is at your preference I start 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.150
 with two points I mix stir I try and 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.160
 If I see that he needs it, I'll go back to 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.550
 put a little more and I do the same 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.630
 process and we would almost be finishing what 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.630

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.900
 octopus ceviche I accompanied him with 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.650

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.260
 toast as you prefer, and 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.380
 spicy can be sauce valentina sauce 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.180
