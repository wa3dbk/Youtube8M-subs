00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello of the tv crew the channel of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.279
 youtube that seems in motion for you me 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.139
 they are michele and this is the review 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.410
 of the new htc rph max evo version 2014 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.109
 of the era of max ph cap made in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.940
 premium pim composite fiber integrated 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.609
 matrix then the composite three 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.279
 made by htc to make helmets 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.019
 very light very compact but very 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.250
 sure because despite being a 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.800
 material that gives extreme 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.750
 lightness the helmet keeps very high 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 the standards of quality and safety 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.800
 let's now start analyzing those that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.520
 are the innovations that have been made 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.079
 in the 2014 version of this helmet 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.850
 new top air intake first 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.620
 we had a little button now let's have one 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.680
 slide therefore a much more system 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.600
 easy to open and closed pesio 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.700
 much more silent we go of the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.789
 shots always contrasted but a lot 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.530
 silent we go to the top 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.590
 very quiet we go down a jump for 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.449
 once we close the visor yes 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.699
 then seal the security lock 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.129
 which perfectly seals the visor 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.140
 of water drafts or in any case I was 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.390
 excessive noise from the visor 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.250
 prepared to mount the max. pin lock 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.799
 vision then the pin lock the ad 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.360
 large size all the internal vision 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 can be equipped with the pilot 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.990
 class vision in order to have the field 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.409
 visual is always free even in the case of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.259
 rain or cold other innovation on the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.869
 model 2014 according to me is then the most 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.640
 successful and under quota below it wants a lot 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.829
 wide when we go to close the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.140
 helmet fits perfectly underneath 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.850
 at the chin and closes the part perfectly 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.990
 front of the helmet so nothing 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.990
 drafts minor noise of the helmet 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 latest innovation of the 2014 model i 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.290
 cheekbones have been 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.780
 reinforced that we have pillows 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.549
 that do not come off accidentally but 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 now don't stare very well 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.329
 I just add a feature that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.850
 it is not included in the features 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.649
 techniques but was implemented in 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.990
 version 2014 we have a layer of 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.149
 then extra transparent painting 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.549
 more sturdiness more color tightness 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.869
 certainly a case that will still be maintained 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.670
 more over time its qualities 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.080
 external aesthetics 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.740
 let's go back now but see the ones that 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.390
 are the characters 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.040
 these winners of the robbery h max 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.070
 definitely lightness 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.680
 this is a case that weighs 1450 g in the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.750
 measure m so very very light and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.210
 one of its points is very compact 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.950
 strength is aesthetics unlike many 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.080
 opening helmets this is a beautiful helmet 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.990
 to see when it's closed like like 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.720
 see to the lines of a sports helmet 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.060
 so these two are very beautiful 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.790
 scratches serve to embody in the best 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.470
 the rear deflector in the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.630
 back that takes the air out 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.460
 with drains then leading out 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.280
 the warm, moist air from faster 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.220
 case what is very important all 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.320
 This helmet 's hds vents are 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.110
 certainly made in an excellent way 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.090
 because they are very thwarted easy to 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.370
 identify with a couple of accounts 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.600
 first we close very easily but 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.610
 especially within the same 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.490
 we find this nature tigers 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.620
 slit that's what this thing is for 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.480
 in the upper part and me the lower part a 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.760
 breaking air flow a flow the area 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.250
 direct continuous very large and creates 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.080
 air vortices therefore this noise 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.850
 system breaks the air flow allows 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.220
 however a very large influx of air 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.260
 but the noise level drops drastically 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.670
 all the air is then channeled 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.840
 inside the internal polystyrene 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.900
 in ps with differentiated density system 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.640
 opening certainly only one winner 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.760
 so let's go to the chin button 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.840
 open the helmet the helmet opens a lot 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.640
 very well 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.680
 salt without any kind of pointing 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.020
 as you see the movement very fluid 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.670
 the chin rest comes in high and yes 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.490
 then block the chin guard definitely 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.830
 accidentally it cannot be closed 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.380
 we push jump the stop system goes 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.120
 in low part and closes as you see 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.630
 the system really works a lot 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.570
 very well but in high part it lowers e 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.330
 it closes we analyze now those that 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.070
 they are in terms of opening the first one 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.040
 something that catches the eye or clearly 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.900
 integrated visor will be integrated 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.550
 in chalices it is activated on this side 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.890
 then bringing the hand behind and 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.380
 bringing it forward very simple from 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.180
 operate a patented system 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.310
 adjustable to more heights and therefore to the base 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.810
 where we stop the cus now let's go to 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.850
 also stop the wink 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.980
 not all of us have 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.650
 that the same height this system there 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.360
 allows to place the wink 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.030
 perfectly where we want to 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.470
 unlock it by pressing then servo 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.690
 assisted 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:40.880
 the glasses return to the imposition on da 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.830
 now interior interiors are 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.780
 completely made in coolmax 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.050
 forever with surface treatment of the 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.820
 5 this treatment certainly gives 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.190
 a beautiful feeling the fabric 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.170
 therefore very pleasant on the skin a lot 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.790
 anti- sweat soft fabric 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.070
 lowers the perceived temperature of 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.750
 about 3 degrees so very much 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.640
 pleasant during the summer is 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.010
 completely washable completely 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.840
 removable covers we can remove all 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.820
 cheeks the burgundy neck at all the 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.580
 inner cap and also the covers of the 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.930
 strap so also the cin looks at 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.460
 padding that covers the strap 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.980
 can be eliminated to be 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.320
 washed strap micrometric closure 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.940
 very simple to identify we have 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.770
 this king course that helps us in the process of 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.000
 open to find it more quickly 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.830
 I will point you out as a closed helmet 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 The bordeaux neck was well made 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.860
 of the pillows 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.630
 we have these two literary lips that 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.980
 they serve to close again laterally 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.830
 more the chaste around the instrument 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.840
 therefore to decrease drafts the wind 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.850
 and therefore the noise then a kick 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.430
 comfortable at all speeds though 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.780
 really nice the chinstrap with this 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.180
 below that they are also exceeded 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.890
 chinstrap is removable two buttons 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.930
 automatics stop it near the 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.020
 myth is one of the most beautiful chinstrap that 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.950
 I've never seen it on an openable helmet 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.010
 safety reflective part 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.180
 rear and below further discharge 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.560
 air and therefore the air that comes 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.050
 channeled inside also comes ha 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.630
 brought to make the back of the 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.940
 shell as said three shell sizes 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.710
 external then a cap for the heads 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.140
 small one for medium heads one for 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.500
 the big heads available in the classics 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.690
 mono anthracite gray bianconero 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.670
 glossy black and let's try 2 colors a 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.860
 black and white then a high yellow black 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.650
 visibility therefore for those who want a helmet 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.960
 with high visibility of 6 inside 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.820
 of the profession we find the xmas pilot 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.870
 vision to be applied inside the 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.000
 lubricating visor replacement screws 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.710
 eventually 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.410
 for the mechanism of the wretched e 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.240
 by registering on the hg website yes we have 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.760
 5-year product warranty 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.420
 then five years of tranquility 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.230
 on the purchase of this beautiful 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.910
 football helmet with a sporty fit 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.130
 we do not have another important element 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.020
 just a venue that has sport but this 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.010
 helmet certainly reminds us of the fit 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.870
 of a full-face helmet 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.640
 many people who love full-face helmets 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.610
 stop before buying a 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.410
 openable helmet because the helmet can be opened 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.180
 often a too soft fit too 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.400
 soft we don't feel it on the right 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.130
 this helmet can be opened when it is closed e 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.130
 absolutely comparable to the fit 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.980
 of a sports full-face helmet you have 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.660
 seen last very important element 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.400
 paranaso that we can remove for 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.830
 summer to increase ours 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.690
 visibility all the seal is 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.880
 tubular and follows the entire perimeter 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.890
 of the visor so we guarantee that 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.810
 when the visit goes to the beat 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.360
 she absolutely stops and doesn't 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.210
 can find a journal infiltration of 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.600
 water the visor comes down and seals 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.890
 perfectly as I always remember you if 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.479
 you enjoyed the review there 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.220
 interested in product testing in 

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:46.229
 particular or simply want 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.250
