the light and it's warmer on the side

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.790 
the light and it's warmer on the side
then<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.670> starts<00:02:36.970> getting<00:02:37.150> cooler<00:02:37.599> on<00:02:38.590> this

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
then it starts getting cooler on this

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
to get this vegetation where is receding

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.990 
to get this vegetation where is receding
way<00:03:26.680> back<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.160> i<00:03:27.220> was<00:03:27.340> trying<00:03:27.370> not<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.760> add<00:03:27.880> too

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
way back so i was trying not to add too

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.910 
way back so i was trying not to add too
much<00:03:28.150> yellow<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.660> just<00:03:28.810> use<00:03:28.989> blues<00:03:29.650> and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
much yellow and just use blues and

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.420 
much yellow and just use blues and
greens<00:03:30.959> again<00:03:31.959> dark<00:03:32.260> light<00:03:32.560> dark<00:03:32.799> light<00:03:33.010> and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
greens again dark light dark light and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.470 
greens again dark light dark light and
then<00:03:34.150> really<00:03:34.420> trying<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.690> punch<00:03:34.959> up<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.459> grass

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
then really trying to punch up the grass

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.880 
then really trying to punch up the grass
so<00:03:37.480> if<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.660> squint<00:03:38.019> just<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.500> little<00:03:38.709> bit<00:03:38.799> you

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
so if you squint just a little bit you

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.410 
so if you squint just a little bit you
can<00:03:39.010> see<00:03:39.070> that<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.700> plane<00:03:40.000> here<00:03:40.269> the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
can see that this plane here the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.330 
can see that this plane here the
sky-plane<00:03:40.930> if<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.230> will<00:03:41.410> that's<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
sky-plane if you will that's the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.160 
sky-plane if you will that's the
lightest<00:03:43.829> as<00:03:44.829> far<00:03:45.070> as<00:03:45.220> value<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:46.000> then<00:03:46.239> the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
lightest as far as value and then the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.840 
lightest as far as value and then the
grass<00:03:47.410> would<00:03:47.709> be<00:03:47.890> second<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.640> course

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
grass would be second and of course

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.330 
grass would be second and of course
followed<00:03:49.299> by<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:50.200> uprights<00:03:50.680> which<00:03:50.980> are<00:03:51.190> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
followed by the uprights which are the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.150 
followed by the uprights which are the
trees<00:03:52.180> or<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:53.049> darkest<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:53.890> plane<00:03:54.130> so

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
trees or the darkest of the plane so

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.460 
trees or the darkest of the plane so
it's<00:03:54.459> really<00:03:54.700> like<00:03:54.940> three<00:03:55.180> planes<00:03:55.480> one<00:03:55.870> two

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's really like three planes one two

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.190 
it's really like three planes one two
and<00:03:56.769> three<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.730> it's<00:03:58.450> trying<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.780> show<00:03:58.810> some

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
and three and it's trying to show some

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.750 
and three and it's trying to show some
warmth<00:03:59.590> there<00:03:59.769> from<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.160> Sun<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:03.519> here's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
warmth there from the Sun and here's

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.199 
warmth there from the Sun and here's
another<00:04:03.850> one<00:04:04.980> still<00:04:05.980> working<00:04:06.340> on<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.489> with
