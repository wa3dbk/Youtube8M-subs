Jeff's tip of the week this week what
we're<00:00:59.770> going<00:00:59.860> to<00:00:59.950> be<00:01:00.010> talking<00:01:00.250> about<00:01:00.550> is<00:01:00.880> jazz

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
we're going to be talking about is jazz

we're going to be talking about is jazz
progressions<00:01:02.400> JS<00:01:03.400> progressions<00:01:04.059> are<00:01:04.710> kind<00:01:05.710> of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
progressions JS progressions are kind of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.280 
progressions JS progressions are kind of
like<00:01:05.920> blues<00:01:06.250> progressions<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.180> way<00:01:07.330> in<00:01:08.020> that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
like blues progressions in a way in that

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.260 
like blues progressions in a way in that
they're<00:01:08.560> kind<00:01:08.830> of<00:01:08.890> standardized<00:01:09.729> there's<00:01:10.210> a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
they're kind of standardized there's a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.020 
they're kind of standardized there's a
certain<00:01:10.870> progression<00:01:11.680> that<00:01:12.430> gets<00:01:12.700> followed

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
certain progression that gets followed

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.469 
certain progression that gets followed
in<00:01:13.540> order<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:14.260> create<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.800> jazz<00:01:15.040> style<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
in order to create the jazz style the

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.390 
in order to create the jazz style the
progression<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.110> called<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.500> 251<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:20.400> it's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
progression is called a 251 and it's

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.490 
progression is called a 251 and it's
simple<00:01:21.790> on<00:01:21.940> paper<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.690> let's<00:01:22.900> take<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.140> look<00:01:23.410> at

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
simple on paper so let's take a look at

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.700 
simple on paper so let's take a look at
that<00:01:23.560> first<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.240> here<00:01:28.540> we<00:01:28.750> have<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.350> key<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.680> C

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
that first so here we have the key of C

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.730 
that first so here we have the key of C
which<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.700> key<00:01:30.880> i<00:01:30.910> was<00:01:31.149> looking<00:01:31.540> at<00:01:31.780> and

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
which is the key i was looking at and

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.960 
which is the key i was looking at and
simply<00:01:33.550> put<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.820> jazz<00:01:34.479> progression<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.170> 251

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
simply put a jazz progression is a 251

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.600 
simply put a jazz progression is a 251
progression<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.590> what<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:38.800> means<00:01:39.160> is<00:01:39.369> you're

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
progression so what that means is you're

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.090 
progression so what that means is you're
playing<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.240> second<00:01:40.720> chord<00:01:40.960> of<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.200> key<00:01:41.440> so<00:01:42.009> in

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
playing the second chord of a key so in

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.590 
playing the second chord of a key so in
the<00:01:42.190> case<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.700> key<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.940> C<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.330> would<00:01:43.479> be<00:01:43.570> a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
the case of the key of C that would be a

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.350 
the case of the key of C that would be a
d<00:01:43.869> minor<00:01:44.190> then<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.369> play<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.820> fifth<00:01:46.000> chord<00:01:46.300> of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
d minor then you play the fifth chord of

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.350 
d minor then you play the fifth chord of
a<00:01:46.479> key<00:01:46.690> which<00:01:47.649> in<00:01:47.830> this<00:01:47.950> case<00:01:48.009> would<00:01:48.460> be<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.880> G

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
a key which in this case would be a G

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.930 
a key which in this case would be a G
major<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:50.009> then<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.160> go<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.729> first

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
major and then you go to the first

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.999 
major and then you go to the first
quarter<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.450> key<00:01:52.660> in<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.380> case<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.860> key

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
quarter of a key in the case of the key

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.290 
quarter of a key in the case of the key
of<00:01:54.130> C<00:01:54.369> it's<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.149> seat<00:01:55.860> ok<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:57.640> that's<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
of C it's a seat ok so that's the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.690 
of C it's a seat ok so that's the
fundamentals<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.350> let's<00:01:59.619> look<00:01:59.830> at<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.340> little

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
fundamentals and let's look at a little

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.870 
fundamentals and let's look at a little
more<00:02:01.740> in-depth<00:02:02.740> look<00:02:02.890> at<00:02:03.310> what's<00:02:03.640> really

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
more in-depth look at what's really

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.180 
more in-depth look at what's really
going<00:02:04.300> on<00:02:07.470> alright<00:02:08.470> now<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.679> we<00:02:08.920> have<00:02:08.950> the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
going on alright now that we have the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.610 
going on alright now that we have the
fundamental<00:02:09.819> progression<00:02:10.390> together<00:02:10.690> let's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
fundamental progression together let's

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.190 
fundamental progression together let's
look<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:12.100> little<00:02:12.190> closer<00:02:12.700> at<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.750> would<00:02:14.050> make

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
look a little closer at what would make

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.280 
look a little closer at what would make
a<00:02:14.260> jazz<00:02:14.560> progression<00:02:15.160> at<00:02:15.280> jazz<00:02:15.520> progression

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
a jazz progression at jazz progression

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.890 
a jazz progression at jazz progression
typically<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.440> jazz<00:02:17.770> they<00:02:18.580> don't<00:02:18.760> use<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.420> triad

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
typically in jazz they don't use a triad

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.430 
typically in jazz they don't use a triad
form<00:02:21.390> which<00:02:22.390> would<00:02:22.599> mean<00:02:22.750> like<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.319> a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
form which would mean like just a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.890 
form which would mean like just a
regular<00:02:23.470> d<00:02:24.250> minor<00:02:24.490> they<00:02:25.240> typically<00:02:25.720> use

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
regular d minor they typically use

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.760 
regular d minor they typically use
sevenths<00:02:26.440> or<00:02:26.620> nine<00:02:26.830> or<00:02:27.310> eleven<00:02:27.819> sort<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.180> 13

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
sevenths or nine or eleven sort of 13

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.080 
sevenths or nine or eleven sort of 13
but<00:02:29.770> today<00:02:30.040> we're<00:02:30.220> only<00:02:30.310> going<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.610> go<00:02:30.730> as<00:02:30.849> far

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
but today we're only going to go as far

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.740 
but today we're only going to go as far
as<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.390> seventh<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.550> instead<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.180> playing<00:02:34.480> D

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
as the seventh so instead of playing D

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.480 
as the seventh so instead of playing D
minor<00:02:35.020> as<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.740> two<00:02:35.890> chord<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.370> would

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
minor as the two chord you would

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.380 
minor as the two chord you would
actually<00:02:36.849> play<00:02:36.970> at<00:02:37.150> E<00:02:37.360> minor<00:02:37.630> 7

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
actually play at E minor 7

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.570 
actually play at E minor 7
the<00:02:40.390> fifth<00:02:40.629> chord<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> key<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.769> g<00:02:42.040> major<00:02:42.220> in

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
the fifth chord in a key the g major in

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.550 
the fifth chord in a key the g major in
this<00:02:42.760> case<00:02:43.030> instead<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.660> playing<00:02:43.870> G<00:02:44.110> major<00:02:44.319> you

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
this case instead of playing G major you

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.670 
this case instead of playing G major you
would<00:02:44.709> play<00:02:44.890> G<00:02:45.220> dominant<00:02:45.760> 7<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:47.050> fifth<00:02:47.349> chord

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
would play G dominant 7 the fifth chord

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.790 
would play G dominant 7 the fifth chord
of<00:02:47.860> every<00:02:48.310> key<00:02:48.580> is<00:02:48.849> always<00:02:49.599> a<00:02:49.629> dominant<00:02:50.260> 7<00:02:50.590> and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
of every key is always a dominant 7 and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.920 
of every key is always a dominant 7 and
it's<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.190> only<00:02:51.400> chord<00:02:51.879> in<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> key<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.720> a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it's the only chord in a key that is a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.280 
it's the only chord in a key that is a
dominant<00:02:53.260> 7th<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:55.030> G<00:02:55.360> or<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.690> five<00:02:55.900> chord

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
dominant 7th so the G or the five chord

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.160 
dominant 7th so the G or the five chord
will<00:02:56.830> be<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:56.980> dominant<00:02:57.250> 7th<00:02:57.819> chord<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.299> then<00:02:59.019> we

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
will be a dominant 7th chord and then we

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.020 
will be a dominant 7th chord and then we

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
Freddy green comping style so if I'm

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.110 
Freddy green comping style so if I'm
playing<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.239> D<00:03:40.420> minor<00:03:40.660> 7<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.580> feel<00:03:42.880> is

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
playing the D minor 7 the the feel is

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.100 
playing the D minor 7 the the feel is
just<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.810> down<00:03:44.080> peg<00:03:45.000> followed<00:03:46.000> by<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> release<00:03:46.810> of

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
just a down peg followed by a release of

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.860 
just a down peg followed by a release of
pressure<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.739> strings<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:51.670> order<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.720> get

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
pressure of the strings in order to get

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.729 
pressure of the strings in order to get
that<00:03:53.080> kind<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.500> muted<00:03:53.950> staccato<00:03:54.340> sound<00:03:58.739> and

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
that kind of muted staccato sound and

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.320 
that kind of muted staccato sound and
then<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.519> would<00:04:00.640> just<00:04:00.670> do<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.299> each

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
then you would just do that on each

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.300 
then you would just do that on each
chord<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.019> I'm<00:04:02.140> just<00:04:02.380> counting<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.890> four<00:04:03.160> on

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310
