00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.370
 so it is we 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.080
 heading rather we are already in 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.380
 the airport itself but this is ours 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.900
 parking as a serpentine dory as 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:28.689
 call in short we rise to the top 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.609
 we already have the 9th floor 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.020
 saw there was a sign before there was any 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:39.610
 busy so let's see what he tells us 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.510
 this this parking is like this 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.510
 here are the people 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.690
 and so here are the people 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.690
 parked 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.980
 for starters, we take a coupon such 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.980
 special 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.180

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.430
 who will come here sometime we take 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.210
 voucher such and then when leaving 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.440
 or as a general campaign I will 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.440
 explain how it all works 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.450
 Here are such cars in Germany 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 frankfurt am main 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.910
 the airport is interesting to what numbers never 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.490
 option tables yes that's how interesting 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.060
 how much is the same here and in general this 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 tenth to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.580
 we can stretch there further 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.580
 anything 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.750
 so ok 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.479
 we will search for a place or can show 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.550
 You got the car many people like to watch 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:01.619
 by car German yes by car 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.619
 can be judged by the economy of Germany 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.410
 after all, we will climb this or this 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.510
 Okay, everyone, until the new video
