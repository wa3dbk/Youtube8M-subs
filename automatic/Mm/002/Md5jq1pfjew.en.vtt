00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.950
 I went back in time to tinted and dry hair 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.920
 I hope this light does not burn much 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.280
 people look is well-nuanced in a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.029
 dried here so we can see the color 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.910
 more faithful, I clearly do not know 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.439
 how is it back there but I hope 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.130
 has stayed at least more or less 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.130
 behind 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.910
 I even give people people who 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.059
 I said sorry, the way I do 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.309
 I turned the video off but it's because the lead 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.149
 It's all very fast talking to him. 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.340
 you 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.730
 forgetting the responsibility that was 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.539
 very little he does not call me 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.879
 then rinse and all that cream with 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.140
 with rinse ink, hold on 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:59.039
 well called there watch with 2 shampoos hidratei 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:05.970
 with silicone mix vi that I dried my 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:09.420
 hair and I ended up with this 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:17.460
 look here in the treatment time 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:18.810
 the renata revealed the excuse sent to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.420
 me and my 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.000
 This is the result, I hope you can 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.549
 Well, I'll try to get to the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.990
 Do not mind the phone here. 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.460
 mess is like this 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.570
 this is the result I 'm not seeing there 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 behind 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.420
 here the image is not burnt is here 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.090
 and the image is very faithful 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.369
 Then you'll talk like cocoa. 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.320
 time this 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.229
 I confess to you, it 's people I did not see. 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.430
 much difference in duration to items such as 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.520
 I confess to you that I have not seen much 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.680
 difference in the duration of time and will have 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.340
 that put even the duration 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.989
 this shading with ink for that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.920
 shampoo that I told you that comes from 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.780
 Spain 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.720
 so it is 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.400
 I do not know if it's worth it but it's 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.040
 that business the first time I saw 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.770
 very first time I did a lot 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.050
 thing I did not stop to pay attention 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.850
 then okay as agent this time is 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.489
 doing together I promise that I will 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.489
 pay attention if it's taking longer 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.830
 itamar elano very fast how are you 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:39.209
 being and I promise that I'll tell 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:44.720
 You're burning up, you're back normal. 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.720
 For now I liked the result 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:54.480
 I thought it was a grayish blond 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:58.140
 very pretty and I think it's worth the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.500
 Shame because with a little ink you're going 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.620
 do it here for two to one in your 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.840
 hair and the cream is the mask everyone 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.510
 have at home and if you do not have samba 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.880
 pet I advise you to fulfill your 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.230
 flaxseed oil which is basically the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.940
 Same thing or those omega capsules 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.450
 has tubes in it comes full of 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.820
 capsule that the name is something of 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.970
 put two capsules of that in your 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.549
 mix and pay attention to the amount of 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.680
 ink people look I put in the total 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.630
 an amount of about 3 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.519
 centimeters is ink and if you stay 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.370
 very curious and my video was not 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.920
 enlightening enough for you I 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.109
 I say go search on youtube that has 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.380
 lots of people even teaching 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.989
 this hairdresser is not I am a hairdresser 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.060
 but I'll leave the link below that 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.329
 video that for you a link of the person 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.150
 that I saw and that I liked the most 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.519
 I do not follow her advice to the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.829
 foot of the letter, because I already told 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.840
 You tell her to put the ink on 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.940
 black black that for me did not work 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.950
 I do not know if it 's because of the paint on 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.630
 quality of ink or whether it was because 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.310
 I have already tasted the first full 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.640
 I liked the result more 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.859
 pedro side then it is but anyway 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.599
 I'll leave her channel link here. 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.830
 For you because of what I could 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.289
 understand that it is a 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.880
 hairdresser of these hairdressers 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.310
 simple lounge but 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.410
 says that in my opinion they are the best 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.360
 It's good, I'll stay here and I 'll wait. 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.270
 that you liked the result as soon as you 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.340
 I was waiting to be careful if I 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.440
 You're going to do it here, do not do it. 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.160
 I only ask someone to help you. 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.070
 because everything can not be more than two 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.050
 minutes is at most maximum at 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.750
 maximum if not you will stay with the 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.660
 green or gray hair is green 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.420
