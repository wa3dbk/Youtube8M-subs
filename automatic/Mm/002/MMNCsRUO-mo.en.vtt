00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
so here we are day two at intimate 2015

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.480 
so here we are day two at intimate 2015
I'm<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:21.050> my<00:02:21.230> wuff<00:02:21.500> one<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.980> editors<00:02:22.190> of

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
I'm with my wuff one of the editors of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.730 
I'm with my wuff one of the editors of
the<00:02:22.760> daily<00:02:23.090> news<00:02:23.300> magazine<00:02:23.870> here<00:02:24.350> at<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.560> show

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
the daily news magazine here at the show

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.540 
the daily news magazine here at the show
Mike<00:02:25.580> what<00:02:26.120> are<00:02:26.330> your<00:02:26.510> pics<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.080> day<00:02:27.260> um<00:02:27.860> I

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
Mike what are your pics of the day um I

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.910 
Mike what are your pics of the day um I
think<00:02:28.690> one<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.870> most<00:02:30.020> interesting<00:02:30.410> things

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
think one of the most interesting things

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.710 
think one of the most interesting things
is<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.610> new<00:02:32.110> hitachi<00:02:33.110> hybrid<00:02:33.770> wheel<00:02:33.980> loader

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
is the new hitachi hybrid wheel loader

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.300 
is the new hitachi hybrid wheel loader
hybrid<00:02:35.720> construction<00:02:36.410> machines<00:02:37.130> in

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
hybrid construction machines in

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.670 
hybrid construction machines in
themselves<00:02:37.730> are<00:02:38.000> nothing<00:02:38.300> new<00:02:38.470> but<00:02:39.470> what's

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
themselves are nothing new but what's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.100 
themselves are nothing new but what's
interesting<00:02:39.860> about<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.520> hitachi<00:02:40.880> machine<00:02:41.360> is

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
interesting about the hitachi machine is

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.800 
interesting about the hitachi machine is
the<00:02:42.470> first<00:02:42.740> hybrid<00:02:43.160> wheel<00:02:43.640> loader<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.540> reach

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the first hybrid wheel loader to reach

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.260 
the first hybrid wheel loader to reach
production<00:02:45.370> rather<00:02:46.370> than<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.700> prototypes

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
production rather than the prototypes

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.840 
production rather than the prototypes
have<00:02:47.480> seen<00:02:47.720> before<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.830> operating<00:02:49.310> cycle<00:02:49.580> of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
have seen before the operating cycle of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.550 
have seen before the operating cycle of
a<00:02:49.910> wheel<00:02:50.060> loader<00:02:50.360> with<00:02:50.660> its<00:02:50.840> forward<00:02:51.440> and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
a wheel loader with its forward and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.680 
a wheel loader with its forward and
reverse<00:02:51.950> movements<00:02:52.520> lends<00:02:52.970> itself<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.540> a

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
reverse movements lends itself to a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.230 
reverse movements lends itself to a
hybrid<00:02:54.080> solution<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:55.160> hybrid<00:02:56.080> drivetrain<00:02:57.080> is

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
hybrid solution the hybrid drivetrain is

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.390 
hybrid solution the hybrid drivetrain is
softer<00:02:59.240> on<00:02:59.480> are<00:02:59.840> more<00:03:00.410> easy<00:03:00.590> going<00:03:00.740> on<00:03:01.280> the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
softer on are more easy going on the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.460 
softer on are more easy going on the
mechanical<00:03:01.750> components<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.930> machine<00:03:03.230> so

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
mechanical components of the machine so

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.530 
mechanical components of the machine so
over<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.040> long<00:03:04.280> term<00:03:04.310> you're<00:03:04.790> probably<00:03:05.180> going

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
over the long term you're probably going

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.620 
over the long term you're probably going
to<00:03:05.630> see<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:06.190> saving<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.340> maintenance<00:03:07.760> costs<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
to see a saving in maintenance costs and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.650 
to see a saving in maintenance costs and
maybe<00:03:08.870> even<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.320> longer<00:03:10.100> life<00:03:11.000> cycle<00:03:11.450> for<00:03:11.600> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
maybe even a longer life cycle for the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.590 
maybe even a longer life cycle for the
machine<00:03:11.930> overall<00:03:12.380> so<00:03:13.220> that's<00:03:13.400> hitachi<00:03:13.790> which

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
machine overall so that's hitachi which

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.030 
machine overall so that's hitachi which
you<00:03:14.750> attended<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.170> press<00:03:15.380> conference<00:03:15.800> at

an<00:03:38.480> interesting<00:03:38.630> development<00:03:39.440> from<00:03:39.950> komatsu

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
an interesting development from komatsu

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.770 
an interesting development from komatsu
it's<00:03:41.300> seeing<00:03:42.190> greater<00:03:43.390> interest<00:03:44.390> in<00:03:44.630> these

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
it's seeing greater interest in these

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.870 
it's seeing greater interest in these
hybrid<00:03:45.320> machines<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:46.010> it's<00:03:46.190> broadening<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
hybrid machines so it's broadening the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.180 
hybrid machines so it's broadening the
range<00:03:47.120> thanks<00:03:47.750> Mike<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.590> really

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
range thanks Mike so to really

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.530 
range thanks Mike so to really
interesting<00:03:49.700> developments<00:03:50.239> from<00:03:50.300> here

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
interesting developments from here

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.510 
interesting developments from here
