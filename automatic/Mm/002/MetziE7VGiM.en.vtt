just<00:00:49.050> by<00:00:49.170> tapping<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
just by tapping on that it's going to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.510 
just by tapping on that it's going to
give<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> pause<00:00:51.030> right<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> that's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
give you the pause right there so that's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
give you the pause right there so that's
what<00:00:53.730> classic<00:00:54.090> cut<00:00:54.239> looks<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.110> we

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
what classic cut looks like so if we

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
what classic cut looks like so if we
disable<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.879> don't<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> respring

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
disable that we don't have to respring

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.180 
disable that we don't have to respring
or<00:00:57.750> anything<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.859> change

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
or anything like that we can just change

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
or anything like that we can just change
it<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.399> over<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> modern<00:01:00.449> HUD<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> we

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
it right over to the modern HUD and we

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
it right over to the modern HUD and we
can<00:01:01.620> enable<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> album<00:01:02.489> artwork<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:03.000> well<00:01:03.210> as

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
can enable the album artwork as well as

can enable the album artwork as well as
the<00:01:03.510> music<00:01:03.660> controls<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> actually

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the music controls now this is actually

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.789 
the music controls now this is actually
my<00:01:05.760> preference<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.590> see

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
my preference just because you can see

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
my preference just because you can see
right<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.880> actually<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.450> in

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
right up here that it's actually up in

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.960 
right up here that it's actually up in
the<00:01:09.659> top<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.799> screen<00:01:10.950> rather<00:01:11.490> than<00:01:11.640> right

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the top of the screen rather than right

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.730 
the top of the screen rather than right
there<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.299> middle<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> screen<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.590> if

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
there in the middle of the screen so if

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.219 
there in the middle of the screen so if
we<00:01:13.920> turn<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.270> obviously<00:01:15.900> pause

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
we turn this up we can obviously pause

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
we turn this up we can obviously pause
it<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.600> play<00:01:18.750> pause<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.369> very

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it we can play pause just like that very

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
it we can play pause just like that very
simple<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.990> also<00:01:22.110> change<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
simple you can also change the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
simple you can also change the
appearance<00:01:23.159> right<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> modern<00:01:24.600> HUD

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
appearance right here for the modern HUD

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.990 
appearance right here for the modern HUD
so<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.350> tap<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> minimal

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
so if we tap on this you have a minimal

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.819 
so if we tap on this you have a minimal
look<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.720> basically<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.170> gets<00:01:28.530> rid<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
look which basically just gets rid of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.640 
look which basically just gets rid of
the<00:01:29.540> album<00:01:30.540> artwork<00:01:30.780> right<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> can

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the album artwork right there so you can

this to minimal win silent so you can do

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
this to minimal win silent so you can do
that<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.149> your<00:01:45.270> phone<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.479> silent<00:01:45.659> I

that if you have your phone on silent I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.830 
that if you have your phone on silent I
like<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> bigger<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.850> sure<00:01:48.000> why<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.630> do

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
like the bigger one not sure why just do

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.990 
like the bigger one not sure why just do
but<00:01:49.560> down<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> give<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
but down here this is going to give you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
but down here this is going to give you
obviously<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.750> preview<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.530> can

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
obviously just a preview of it you can

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.710 
obviously just a preview of it you can
also<00:01:52.770> change<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> delay<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
also change the delay so this is

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
also change the delay so this is
basically<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.259> adjusting<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> amount<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
basically just adjusting the amount of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.240 
basically just adjusting the amount of
time<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.270> HUD<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.719> shown<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:58.979> now<00:01:59.009> it's

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
time the HUD is shown so right now it's

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
time the HUD is shown so right now it's
at<00:01:59.340> one<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.030> half<00:02:00.060> seconds<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.810> wanted

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
at one and a half seconds if we wanted

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.209 
at one and a half seconds if we wanted
to<00:02:01.079> change<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> two<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> half<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
to change it to two and a half and you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.920 
to change it to two and a half and you
can<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> stay<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.540> for

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
can see that it's going to stay up for

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.219 
can see that it's going to stay up for
another<00:02:03.990> two<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.619> half<00:02:04.799> seconds<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.840> that's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
another two and a half seconds so that's

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.960 
another two and a half seconds so that's
what<00:02:07.500> HUD<00:02:07.740> heed<00:02:08.009> us<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.670> actually

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
pretty cool I actually like it it gives
