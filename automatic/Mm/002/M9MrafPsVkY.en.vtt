just a sec to show you I've got it
overclocked<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.059> 4<00:00:57.420> gigahertz<00:00:58.520> ok<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
overclocked to 4 gigahertz ok so as you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.649 
overclocked to 4 gigahertz ok so as you
can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.989> there<00:01:01.670> 4<00:01:02.670> gigahertz<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.870> 980x<00:01:04.589> ok<00:01:05.659> 32

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
can see there 4 gigahertz the 980x ok 32

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.859 
can see there 4 gigahertz the 980x ok 32
nanometer<00:01:07.460> ok<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> cause<00:01:09.360> i<00:01:09.689> always

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
nanometer ok now with the cause i always

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.350 
nanometer ok now with the cause i always
go<00:01:10.170> off<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> top<00:01:10.740> core<00:01:11.070> ok<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.270> about

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
go off the top core ok so that's about

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.749 
go off the top core ok so that's about
41<00:01:13.049> degrees<00:01:13.439> idol<00:01:14.750> ok<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.670> that's<00:01:17.670> very

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
41 degrees idol ok so that's very

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.510 
41 degrees idol ok so that's very
pleasing<00:01:18.830> ok<00:01:19.830> if<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.040> go<00:01:20.250> over<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.500> cpu-z

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
pleasing ok if we go over here to cpu-z

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.120 
pleasing ok if we go over here to cpu-z
what<00:01:23.520> we've<00:01:23.729> got<00:01:23.939> we've<00:01:24.840> got<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.170> core<00:01:25.409> i7

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
what we've got we've got the core i7

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.940 
what we've got we've got the core i7
extreme<00:01:26.360> 980x<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:28.530> run<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.310> 1.2<00:01:30.650> 1.2<00:01:31.650> 9

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
extreme 980x and run it at 1.2 1.2 9

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
extreme 980x and run it at 1.2 1.2 9
volts<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.820> 4<00:01:33.479> gigahertz<00:01:34.490> ok<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:37.229> believe

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
volts at 4 gigahertz ok now I do believe

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289 
volts at 4 gigahertz ok now I do believe
that<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.100> tinker<00:01:38.490> around<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that I can tinker around with that and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.899 
that I can tinker around with that and
get<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> pulps<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> bit<00:01:40.560> lower<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> also

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
get the pulps down a bit lower and also

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.960 
get the pulps down a bit lower and also
get<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.380> overclocking<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.740> higher<00:01:43.970> so

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
get the overclocking a bit higher so

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.670 
get the overclocking a bit higher so
that's<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> will<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.720> doing<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that's what I will be doing I'm going to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280 
that's what I will be doing I'm going to
next<00:01:46.890> day<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.250> two<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.840> course<00:01:49.079> i<00:01:49.229> will

post it up here for everyone to see now

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.490 
post it up here for everyone to see now
what<00:01:52.799> I'll<00:01:52.890> quickly<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.060> start

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
what I'll quickly just do is start

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.520 
what I'll quickly just do is start
prime95<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.380> can

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
prime95 and what we can do here we can

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.969 
prime95 and what we can do here we can
see<00:02:00.020> we'll<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.140> able<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.619> how<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.969> cooler

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
see we'll be able to see how the cooler

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.139 
see we'll be able to see how the cooler
goes<00:02:04.979> under<00:02:05.579> load<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:07.459> know<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.879> see

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
goes under load I know as you can see

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.980 
goes under load I know as you can see
all<00:02:09.360> calls<00:02:09.989> are<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> hundred<00:02:10.800> percent

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
all calls are on a hundred percent

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:20.060 
all calls are on a hundred percent
okay<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:14.150> 62<00:02:15.150> degrees<00:02:18.980> that's<00:02:19.980> very

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
okay so 62 degrees that's very

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.780 
okay so 62 degrees that's very
acceptable<00:02:22.220> however<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.370> would<00:02:23.490> be

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
acceptable however I would be

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.760 
acceptable however I would be
interesting<00:02:24.330> i<00:02:24.540> will<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.900> doing<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.230> review<00:02:25.260> of

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
interesting i will be doing a review of

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.910 
interesting i will be doing a review of
the<00:02:26.030> h70<00:02:27.030> core<00:02:27.600> says<00:02:27.870> new<00:02:28.110> cooler<00:02:28.560> when<00:02:28.830> it

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the h70 core says new cooler when it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
the h70 core says new cooler when it
comes<00:02:29.130> out<00:02:29.430> okay<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.440> stay<00:02:31.440> tuned<00:02:31.940> subscribe
