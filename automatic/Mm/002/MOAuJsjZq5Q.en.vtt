00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
the Hedgehog SuperSonics unboxing as we

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.090 
the Hedgehog SuperSonics unboxing as we
can<00:00:41.960> see<00:00:42.080> right<00:00:42.260> there<00:00:42.320> this<00:00:42.680> comes<00:00:42.890> with

classic and modern supersonic supersonic

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.380 
classic and modern supersonic supersonic
through<00:00:46.970> time<00:00:47.270> it's<00:00:48.020> like<00:00:48.230> Sonic<00:00:48.620> Generations

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
through time it's like Sonic Generations

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.330 
through time it's like Sonic Generations
so<00:00:50.390> I'm<00:00:50.570> gonna<00:00:50.720> get<00:00:50.900> this<00:00:51.020> out<00:00:51.200> like<00:00:52.010> up<00:00:52.190> the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
so I'm gonna get this out like up the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.100 
so I'm gonna get this out like up the
six-inch<00:00:53.090> to<00:00:53.780> 5<00:00:54.020> like<00:00:54.470> 5<00:00:54.710> inch<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.129> 6<00:00:55.340> over<00:00:56.110> 12

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
six-inch to 5 like 5 inch to 6 over 12

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.229 
six-inch to 5 like 5 inch to 6 over 12
point<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:57.680> articulation<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.610> now<00:00:58.760> let's<00:00:59.030> get

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
point of articulation so now let's get

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.670 
point of articulation so now let's get
this<00:00:59.860> Hedgehog<00:01:00.860> out<00:01:02.199> those<00:01:03.199> we<00:01:03.379> see<00:01:03.530> right

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
this Hedgehog out those we see right

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.049 
this Hedgehog out those we see right
here<00:01:03.800> we<00:01:03.920> have<00:01:03.949> both<00:01:04.250> its<00:01:04.460> donek<00:01:04.909> the

here we have both its donek the

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.830 
here we have both its donek the
hedgehogs<00:01:06.100> classic<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.280> modern<00:01:07.659> by<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.720> way

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
hedgehogs classic and modern by the way

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.540 
hedgehogs classic and modern by the way
this<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.230> on<00:01:09.409> modern<00:01:09.830> which<00:01:10.130> we<00:01:10.250> can<00:01:10.400> see<00:01:10.520> right

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
this is on modern which we can see right

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.790 
this is on modern which we can see right
here<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:13.130> know<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.340> head<00:01:13.520> can<00:01:13.760> turn<00:01:13.970> around

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.710 

so<00:01:18.800> here<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.040> will<00:01:19.190> have<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.670> Sonics<00:01:20.090> out<00:01:20.270> so

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
so here we will have the Sonics out so

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.780 
so here we will have the Sonics out so
let's<00:01:21.170> first<00:01:21.380> start<00:01:21.500> with<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.890> modern<00:01:22.550> sonic

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
let's first start with the modern sonic

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.020 
let's first start with the modern sonic
by<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.210> way<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.770> first<00:01:28.010> of<00:01:28.159> all<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.610> head<00:01:28.790> can

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
by the way so first of all the head can

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.940 
by the way so first of all the head can
move<00:01:29.299> around<00:01:29.479> we<00:01:29.900> can<00:01:30.020> see<00:01:32.560> obviously<00:01:33.560> there

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
move around we can see obviously there

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.500 
move around we can see obviously there
is<00:01:34.130> some<00:01:34.370> detail<00:01:34.729> on<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.970> figure<00:01:35.240> which<00:01:35.390> I

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
is some detail on the figure which I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.160 
is some detail on the figure which I
will<00:01:35.690> go<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:38.000> eyes<00:01:38.180> are<00:01:38.450> red

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
will go to the eyes are red

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.170 
will go to the eyes are red
yeah<00:01:40.009> because<00:01:40.219> you<00:01:40.399> know<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:40.610> like<00:01:40.729> super

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
yeah because you know it's like super

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.990 
yeah because you know it's like super
let's<00:01:41.570> make<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> look<00:01:42.020> awesome<00:01:42.670> some<00:01:43.670> gloves

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
let's make a look awesome some gloves

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.999 
let's make a look awesome some gloves
yellow<00:01:44.450> fur<00:01:44.719> and<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.170> shoots<00:01:45.409> nothing<00:01:45.890> really

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
yellow fur and the shoots nothing really

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.200 
yellow fur and the shoots nothing really
different<00:01:46.189> us<00:01:46.430> for<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.640> eyes<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.180> know

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
different us for the eyes and you know

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.249 
different us for the eyes and you know
the<00:01:48.250> burner<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:49.399> guess<00:01:49.640> no<00:01:50.539> for<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.810> classic

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
the burner I guess no for the classic

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.959 
the burner I guess no for the classic
one<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.649> doesn't<00:01:51.829> really<00:01:52.009> have<00:01:52.310> any<00:01:52.520> different

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
one it doesn't really have any different

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.359 
one it doesn't really have any different
eye<00:01:53.030> color<00:01:53.329> for<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.570> eyes<00:01:53.689> because<00:01:54.289> this<00:01:55.159> is

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
eye color for the eyes because this is

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.370 
eye color for the eyes because this is
the<00:01:55.460> classic<00:01:55.969> one<00:01:56.119> then<00:01:56.390> before<00:01:56.719> I<00:01:56.960> didn't

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the classic one then before I didn't

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.929 
the classic one then before I didn't
even<00:01:57.530> really<00:01:57.770> even<00:01:57.890> have<00:01:58.280> any<00:01:58.460> color<00:01:58.640> for<00:01:58.789> eyes

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
even really even have any color for eyes

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.330 
even really even have any color for eyes
just<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.479> go<00:01:59.570> for<00:01:59.780> black<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:00.979> that's<00:02:01.159> crop

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
just to go for black so that's crop

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.499 
just to go for black so that's crop
that's<00:02:01.609> basically<00:02:02.060> why<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:04.340> for<00:02:04.549> this<00:02:04.700> modern

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
that's basically why so for this modern

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.389 
that's basically why so for this modern
sonic<00:02:06.049> we<00:02:06.500> can<00:02:06.649> see<00:02:06.770> right<00:02:06.920> there<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
sonic we can see right there that the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.140 
sonic we can see right there that the
hands<00:02:07.640> are<00:02:07.789> open<00:02:08.890> can<00:02:09.890> there<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:10.820> some

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
hands are open can there is some

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.080 
hands are open can there is some
articulation<00:02:12.100> can<00:02:13.100> turn<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.550> hand<00:02:13.790> around

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
articulation can turn the hand around

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.480 
articulation can turn the hand around
we'd<00:02:14.660> see<00:02:15.400> turn<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.550> around<00:02:18.160> especially<00:02:19.160> for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
we'd see turn it around especially for

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.170 
we'd see turn it around especially for
the<00:02:19.550> arm

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.610 

so<00:02:24.890> now<00:02:25.890> let<00:02:26.189> us<00:02:26.220> look<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.879> oh<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:28.140> guess<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
so now let us look at oh I guess the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.710 
so now let us look at oh I guess the
legs<00:02:28.829> no<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.819> there's<00:02:30.239> nothing<00:02:30.510> really<00:02:30.629> else

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
legs no is there's nothing really else

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.289 
legs no is there's nothing really else
to<00:02:30.989> look<00:02:31.110> at<00:02:31.319> we<00:02:32.099> see<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> legs<00:02:32.579> can<00:02:32.879> move<00:02:32.909> up

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
to look at we see the legs can move up

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.750 
to look at we see the legs can move up
and<00:02:33.870> same<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.379> other<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:35.640> ain't

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and same for the other one you ain't

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.100 
and same for the other one you ain't
trying<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.209> get<00:02:36.480> them<00:02:36.569> in<00:02:36.659> like<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> little

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
trying to get them in like a little

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.110 
trying to get them in like a little
dashing<00:02:37.680> position<00:02:38.129> let<00:02:38.310> me<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.549> try<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.819> show

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
dashing position let me just try to show

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.259 
dashing position let me just try to show
you<00:02:40.609> kind<00:02:41.609> of<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.909> dashing<00:02:42.420> position

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
you kind of like a dashing position

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.670 
you kind of like a dashing position
isn't<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:46.049> just<00:02:46.200> wanted<00:02:46.379> to<00:02:46.530> try

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
isn't that that I just wanted to try

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.410

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.910 
moving on now let's go to classic sonic
this<00:03:00.329> is<00:03:00.510> smaller<00:03:00.840> version<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.409> Sonic<00:03:01.889> the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
this is smaller version of Sonic the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.229 
this is smaller version of Sonic the
Hedgehog<00:03:02.340> classic<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:04.260> basically<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.970> time

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
Hedgehog classic so basically this time

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.679 
Hedgehog classic so basically this time
you<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.139> head<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.500> move<00:03:07.739> as<00:03:07.859> well<00:03:08.689> but

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
you know the head can move as well but

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.949 
you know the head can move as well but
the<00:03:10.409> this<00:03:10.859> time<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:12.180> hands<00:03:12.450> are<00:03:12.659> actually

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
the this time the hands are actually

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.050 
the this time the hands are actually
closed<00:03:13.409> I<00:03:14.010> know<00:03:14.849> magic<00:03:15.359> right<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.730> basically

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
closed I know magic right so basically

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.520 
closed I know magic right so basically
it's<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.720> same<00:03:18.870> thing<00:03:18.930> as<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.319> other<00:03:19.379> one

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
it's the same thing as the other one

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.929 
it's the same thing as the other one
just<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:19.920> know<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> little<00:03:20.129> bit<00:03:20.310> smaller<00:03:20.579> I

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:20.939 
just you know a little bit smaller I

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.849 
just you know a little bit smaller I
think<00:03:21.629> this<00:03:21.900> would<00:03:22.019> be<00:03:22.049> more<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.319> a<00:03:22.379> five<00:03:22.620> inch

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
think this would be more of a five inch

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.339 
think this would be more of a five inch
in<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.129> more<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> six<00:03:23.700> inch<00:03:24.200> stitch<00:03:25.200> it

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
in this more of a six inch stitch it

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.250 
in this more of a six inch stitch it
really<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.739> like<00:03:25.889> making<00:03:26.099> more<00:03:26.280> specific

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
really is like making more specific

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.189 
really is like making more specific
moving<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.579> legs<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.780> detail

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
moving on to the legs of the detail

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.189 
moving on to the legs of the detail
basically<00:03:32.069> can<00:03:32.579> go<00:03:32.730> because<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.810> leg<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.139> you

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
basically can go because the leg is you

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.050 
basically can go because the leg is you
can't<00:03:34.440> really<00:03:34.560> make<00:03:34.709> them<00:03:34.889> like<00:03:35.069> bends<00:03:35.549> cuz

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
can't really make them like bends cuz

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.680 
can't really make them like bends cuz
you<00:03:36.209> can<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:37.069> cuz<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.190> know<00:03:38.690> classic

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
you can do this cuz you know classic

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.979 
you can do this cuz you know classic
sonic<00:03:40.049> didn't<00:03:40.739> have<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:41.010> long<00:03:41.220> legs<00:03:41.609> I<00:03:41.989> did

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989
