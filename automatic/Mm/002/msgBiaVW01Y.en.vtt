00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
exercise what I'm going to do is to a

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.970 
exercise what I'm going to do is to a
ticket<00:00:02.720> from<00:00:03.720> what<00:00:03.959> we<00:00:04.140> have<00:00:04.350> done<00:00:04.560> in<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
ticket from what we have done in the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.480 
ticket from what we have done in the
previous<00:00:05.130> videos<00:00:05.839> this<00:00:06.839> one<00:00:07.230> point<00:00:07.649> space<00:00:08.220> or

one point grid what we going to do is

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.129 
one point grid what we going to do is
we're<00:00:11.010> going<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.219> use<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.610> SL<00:00:12.090> template<00:00:12.660> or

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
we're going to use this SL template or

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.740 
we're going to use this SL template or
guideline<00:00:13.679> if<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.950> want<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.790> generate<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
guideline if you want you to generate a

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.500 
guideline if you want you to generate a
a<00:00:16.139> series<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.740> em<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.510> three-dimensional

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
a series of em of three-dimensional

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.960 
a series of em of three-dimensional
boxes<00:00:18.960> or<00:00:19.170> cubes<00:00:19.529> now<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.460> before<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:20.939> that

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
boxes or cubes now but before we do that

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.070 
boxes or cubes now but before we do that
I<00:00:21.240> want<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> show<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.720> something<00:00:25.519> now

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
I want to show you something now

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.110 
I want to show you something now
this<00:00:28.710> right<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.280> is<00:00:29.990> just<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.170> shape

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.810 

because<00:00:34.809> this<00:00:34.960> two-dimensional<00:00:35.739> and<00:00:36.610> it's

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
because this two-dimensional and it's

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.870 
because this two-dimensional and it's
flat

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
flat

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.570 
flat
there's<00:00:39.450> no<00:00:39.750> sense<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.230> there's<00:00:41.040> no<00:00:41.220> sense<00:00:41.430> of

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.810 
there's no sense of there's no sense of
space<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.000> there's<00:00:42.180> no<00:00:42.330> sense<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> depth<00:00:42.870> now

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
space and there's no sense of depth now

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.430 
space and there's no sense of depth now
in<00:00:44.820> order<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.750> transition<00:00:46.320> itself

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
in order for just to transition itself

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.720 
in order for just to transition itself
into<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.820> three-dimensional<00:00:48.660> form<00:00:49.730> which

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
into in three-dimensional form which

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.150 
into in three-dimensional form which
will<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.060> a<00:00:51.120> sense<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.390> volley<00:00:51.630> into<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.160> what

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
will have a sense of volley into it what

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.370 
will have a sense of volley into it what
we<00:00:53.310> need<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> create<00:00:54.750> something<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.170> will

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
we need is to create something that will

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:03.990 
we need is to create something that will
look<00:00:55.970> something<00:00:56.970> like<00:00:57.180> this

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.450 

what<00:01:04.600> we're<00:01:04.780> really<00:01:04.989> looking<00:01:05.110> at<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.800> over

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
what we're really looking at is over

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.810 
what we're really looking at is over
here<00:01:06.760> we<00:01:07.300> only<00:01:07.450> have<00:01:07.720> four<00:01:08.380> corners<00:01:08.830> we<00:01:09.610> can

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
here we only have four corners we can

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.930 
here we only have four corners we can
look<00:01:09.910> at<00:01:10.030> it's<00:01:10.450> just<00:01:10.630> one<00:01:10.990> flat<00:01:11.560> plane<00:01:12.010> but<00:01:12.729> now

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
look at it's just one flat plane but now

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.850 
look at it's just one flat plane but now
when<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:13.570> make<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.750> jump<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.470> something<00:01:14.770> like

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
when we make a jump to something like

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.820 
when we make a jump to something like
this<00:01:15.100> we<00:01:15.850> still<00:01:16.420> have<00:01:16.630> those<00:01:16.810> four<00:01:17.110> corners<00:01:17.500> if

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
this we still have those four corners if

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.830 
this we still have those four corners if
you<00:01:17.920> want<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.220> name<00:01:18.340> them<00:01:18.580> that<00:01:18.790> way<00:01:18.940> now<00:01:19.690> but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
you want to name them that way now but

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.810 
you want to name them that way now but
to<00:01:19.930> see<00:01:20.080> how<00:01:20.229> this<00:01:20.440> really<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.400> front

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
to see how this really is just the front

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.150 
to see how this really is just the front
plane<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.390> this<00:01:22.950> three-dimensional<00:01:23.950> box

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
plane of this three-dimensional box

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.780 
plane of this three-dimensional box
there's<00:01:24.880> now<00:01:25.240> back<00:01:25.990> corners<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:27.250> upper<00:01:27.610> back

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
there's now back corners the upper back

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.109 
there's now back corners the upper back
corners<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:29.140> lower<00:01:29.410> back<00:01:29.740> corners<00:01:30.190> you<00:01:31.090> can

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
corners the lower back corners you can

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.980 
corners the lower back corners you can
look<00:01:31.420> at<00:01:31.510> this<00:01:31.600> also<00:01:31.869> as<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.590> front<00:01:33.130> plate<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
look at this also as the front plate the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.870 
look at this also as the front plate the
top<00:01:35.229> plane

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
top plane

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.399 
top plane
plane<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.719> the<00:01:37.780> right

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
plane to the right

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.459 
plane to the right
plain<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.219> left<00:01:40.689> this<00:01:41.689> right<00:01:41.990> here<00:01:42.200> being

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
plain to the left this right here being

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.319 
plain to the left this right here being
the<00:01:42.530> back<00:01:42.799> plane<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.399> racing<00:01:43.789> away<00:01:43.909> from<00:01:44.240> us

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
the back plane is racing away from us

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.779 
the back plane is racing away from us
and<00:01:44.929> also<00:01:45.259> this<00:01:45.590> right<00:01:45.859> here<00:01:46.039> seeing<00:01:46.609> the

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
and also this right here seeing the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.109 
and also this right here seeing the
bottom<00:01:47.119> plane<00:01:47.390> now<00:01:48.140> if<00:01:49.100> we<00:01:49.460> wanted<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.819> create

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
bottom plane now if we wanted to create

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.170 
bottom plane now if we wanted to create
a<00:01:50.659> perfect<00:01:51.319> cube

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
a perfect cube

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
a perfect cube
right<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.230> that<00:01:55.440> would<00:01:55.620> mean<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.830> we<00:01:56.190> will

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
right so that would mean that we will

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.010 
right so that would mean that we will
need<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.550> account<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.300> all<00:01:57.510> of<00:01:57.810> these

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
need to account with all of these

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560 
need to account with all of these
corners<00:01:58.710> even<00:01:59.220> though<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.970> might<00:02:00.150> be<00:02:00.210> one

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
corners even though there might be one

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
corners even though there might be one
that<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.870> hidden<00:02:01.110> away<00:02:01.320> from<00:02:01.710> us<00:02:01.830> because<00:02:02.130> if

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
that is hidden away from us because if

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.640 
that is hidden away from us because if
this<00:02:02.430> cube<00:02:03.210> right<00:02:03.330> here<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.690> not<00:02:03.900> transparent

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
this cube right here is not transparent

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.800 
this cube right here is not transparent
we<00:02:05.280> will<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.580> see<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:05.970> back<00:02:06.180> corner<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.660> we

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
we will not see this back corner but we

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.630 
we will not see this back corner but we
student<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.620> because<00:02:07.830> it<00:02:08.220> exists

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
student you know that because it exists

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.560 
student you know that because it exists
and<00:02:08.880> also<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.560> corner<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:12.510> will

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
and also because of this corner it will

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.230 
and also because of this corner it will
create<00:02:12.990> for<00:02:13.350> us<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.680> bottom<00:02:14.310> plate<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:15.030> know

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
create for us this bottom plate you know

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.420 
create for us this bottom plate you know
we<00:02:15.360> don't<00:02:15.480> see<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:16.620> might<00:02:16.830> not<00:02:16.920> see<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.160> if

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
we don't see it we might not see it if

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.860 
we don't see it we might not see it if
this<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.700> not<00:02:17.880> transparent<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.600> need<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
this is not transparent but we need you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.080 
this is not transparent but we need you
account<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.380> now<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.370> go<00:02:20.520> back<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
account for that now if we go back to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.180 
account for that now if we go back to
this<00:02:21.300> right<00:02:21.570> here<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.500> reason<00:02:22.830> why<00:02:22.980> we

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
this right here the reason why we

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.670 
this right here the reason why we
created<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:24.780> course<00:02:24.870> was<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.500> would

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
created this of course was we would

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.280 
created this of course was we would
actually<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:26.280> now<00:02:26.459> actually<00:02:26.970> uses<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.840> help<00:02:28.080> us

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
actually do now actually uses to help us

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.260 
actually do now actually uses to help us
to<00:02:28.470> create<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.860> series<00:02:29.220> about<00:02:29.550> three

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
to create a series about three

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.960 
to create a series about three
dimensional<00:02:30.780> boxes<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.440> cubes<00:02:31.770> using<00:02:32.730> this

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
dimensional boxes or cubes using this

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.570 
dimensional boxes or cubes using this
right<00:02:33.180> here<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.980> think<00:02:35.130> back<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.400> what

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
right here now if we think back on what

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.370 
right here now if we think back on what
after<00:02:35.940> showing<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.300> earlier<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.930> three

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
after showing you earlier a three

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.710 
after showing you earlier a three
dimensional<00:02:37.560> box<00:02:38.070> will<00:02:38.340> cube<00:02:38.700> has<00:02:38.910> more<00:02:39.570> than

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
dimensional box will cube has more than

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.370 
dimensional box will cube has more than
just<00:02:39.930> four<00:02:40.140> corners<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.370> has<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:42.290> sense<00:02:43.290> of

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
just four corners so it has a sense of

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.260 
just four corners so it has a sense of
height<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.920> sense<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.430> depth<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.970> sense<00:02:45.180> of

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
height a sense of depth in a sense of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.610 
height a sense of depth in a sense of
whipped<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:46.380> region<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:48.620> play

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
whipped so now region here is to play

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.740 
whipped so now region here is to play
station<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.160> add<00:02:50.280> some<00:02:50.459> boxes<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.940> do<00:02:51.030> now<00:02:51.690> I'm

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
station can add some boxes to do now I'm

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.850 
station can add some boxes to do now I'm
going<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.959> add<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> piece<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.320> tracing<00:02:52.590> paper

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
going to add a piece of tracing paper

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.729 
going to add a piece of tracing paper
over<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.340> first<00:02:53.900> now<00:02:54.900> before<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.260> get<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.530> I'm

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
over this first now before I get it I'm

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.570 
over this first now before I get it I'm
going<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.070> leave<00:02:56.220> behind<00:02:56.720> what<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.900> called<00:02:58.580> the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
going to leave behind what is called the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.759 
going to leave behind what is called the
registration<00:03:00.299> marks<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.260> these<00:03:01.410> are<00:03:01.590> really

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
registration marks and these are really

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.420 
registration marks and these are really
just<00:03:02.600> safety<00:03:03.600> measures<00:03:04.110> because<00:03:04.260> later<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.739> my

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
just safety measures because later on my
