00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.110 
with those two but we got Kevin Garnett
much<00:02:37.380> as<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.680> don't<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.130> his<00:02:38.400> attitude<00:02:38.610> about

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
much as I don't like his attitude about

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.420 
much as I don't like his attitude about
some<00:02:39.540> things<00:02:39.780> i<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:39.990> like<00:02:40.290> he's<00:02:40.650> intense<00:02:41.130> I

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
some things i do like he's intense I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.360 
some things i do like he's intense I
really<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.270> dig<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.660> about<00:02:42.720> him<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.890> also

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
really do dig that about him but I also

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.180 
really do dig that about him but I also
think<00:02:44.670> he's<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> bit<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.210> an<00:02:45.300> instigator<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.020> a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
think he's a bit of an instigator and a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.410 
think he's a bit of an instigator and a
little<00:02:47.190> bit<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.430> punk<00:02:47.700> not<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.240> lie

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
little bit of a punk not going to lie

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.190 
little bit of a punk not going to lie
but<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.560> know<00:02:50.100> if<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.150> comes<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.690> push

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
but you know if if it comes to push

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.990 
but you know if if it comes to push
comes<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.500> shove<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.860> might<00:02:53.070> throw<00:02:53.220> kg<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.850> my

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
comes to shove I might throw kg on my

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.970 
comes to shove I might throw kg on my
team<00:02:54.240> if<00:02:54.420> I'm<00:02:54.570> taking<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.960> roster<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.350> NBA<00:02:55.680> guys

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
team if I'm taking a roster of NBA guys

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.280 
team if I'm taking a roster of NBA guys
maybe<00:02:56.790> not<00:02:56.970> as<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.270> best<00:02:57.450> power<00:02:57.690> forward<00:02:58.110> but

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
maybe not as the best power forward but

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.590 
maybe not as the best power forward but
definitely<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.800> very<00:02:58.890> serviceable<00:02:59.520> guy<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.480> he

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
definitely a very serviceable guy and he

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.870 
definitely a very serviceable guy and he
can<00:03:00.720> hit<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.960> outside<00:03:01.110> shot<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:02.640> know<00:03:02.730> that
