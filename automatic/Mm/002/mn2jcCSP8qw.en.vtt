this<00:01:38.520> game<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.119> lazy<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> doesn't

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this game is so lazy that it doesn't

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
this game is so lazy that it doesn't
even<00:01:40.200> display<00:01:40.740> anything<00:01:41.219> when<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> press

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
even display anything when you press

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.240 
even display anything when you press
pause<00:01:41.969> I<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.689> I'm<00:01:42.930> nitpicking<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.590> how<00:01:43.920> hard

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
pause I know I'm nitpicking but how hard

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.999 
pause I know I'm nitpicking but how hard
would<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.490> been<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.149> right<00:01:45.390> pause<00:01:46.009> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
would have been to just right pause this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.830 
would have been to just right pause this
game<00:01:47.280> also<00:01:47.520> doesn't<00:01:47.969> seem<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> follow<00:01:48.450> basic

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
game also doesn't seem to follow basic

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.100 
game also doesn't seem to follow basic
video<00:01:49.350> game<00:01:49.619> logic<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.820> jump<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.509> spiked

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
video game logic you jump on spiked

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.470 
video game logic you jump on spiked
enemies<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.950> kill<00:01:53.250> them

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
enemies to kill them

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.540 
enemies to kill them
I<00:01:54.540> should<00:01:55.350> also<00:01:55.470> say<00:01:55.650> that<00:01:55.830> although<00:01:56.340> with

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
I should also say that although with

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.980 
I should also say that although with
practice<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.270> make<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.720> through<00:01:57.870> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
practice you can make it through the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 
practice you can make it through the
first<00:01:58.170> level<00:01:58.440> pretty<00:01:58.830> well<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.060> lack<00:02:00.240> of

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
first level pretty well with the lack of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.150 
first level pretty well with the lack of
recovery<00:02:00.840> time<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.260> extremely<00:02:01.890> stiff

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
recovery time and extremely stiff

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.090 
recovery time and extremely stiff
controls<00:02:02.610> you're<00:02:03.150> gonna<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.450> hit<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.960> lot

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
controls you're gonna get hit a lot

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.370 
controls you're gonna get hit a lot
and<00:02:05.220> guess<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:07.020> there's<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and guess what I don't think there's a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.070 
and guess what I don't think there's a
single<00:02:07.860> health<00:02:08.340> powerup<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.480> entire

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
single health powerup in this entire

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.350 
single health powerup in this entire
level<00:02:10.770> there's<00:02:11.610> one<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:11.940> beginning<00:02:12.060> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
level there's one at the beginning of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.050 
level there's one at the beginning of
level<00:02:12.630> 2<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.860> when<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.130> start<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.490> new<00:02:14.520> level

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
level 2 but when you start a new level

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.180 
level 2 but when you start a new level
your<00:02:15.330> health<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.690> replenished<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.740> why<00:02:16.920> would

basically<00:06:37.790> if<00:06:38.090> you<00:06:38.120> fall<00:06:38.540> in<00:06:38.690> this<00:06:38.840> level

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
basically if you fall in this level

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.690 
basically if you fall in this level
there's<00:06:39.470> a<00:06:39.530> chance<00:06:39.890> that<00:06:40.010> you<00:06:40.160> can<00:06:40.280> land<00:06:40.490> on<00:06:40.669> a

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
there's a chance that you can land on a

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.700 
there's a chance that you can land on a
lower<00:06:40.940> platform<00:06:41.510> and<00:06:41.660> keep<00:06:41.750> going<00:06:42.110> but<00:06:42.500> most

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
lower platform and keep going but most

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.740 
lower platform and keep going but most
of<00:06:42.830> the<00:06:42.919> time<00:06:43.130> I<00:06:43.160> don't<00:06:43.370> get<00:06:43.700> Jack<00:06:44.120> so

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
of the time I don't get Jack so

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.720 
of the time I don't get Jack so
basically<00:06:45.169> take<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:45.860> high<00:06:46.010> road<00:06:46.040> and<00:06:46.490> don't

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
basically take the high road and don't

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.490 
basically take the high road and don't
freak<00:06:47.060> and<00:06:47.300> fall

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
especially in a level like this we're

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:04.490 
especially in a level like this we're
jumping<00:07:02.940> from<00:07:03.240> basket<00:07:03.690> the<00:07:03.750> basket<00:07:03.780> is<00:07:04.289> life

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 
or death this mixed with the foreground

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:14.180 
or death this mixed with the foreground
makes<00:07:07.830> this<00:07:08.009> a<00:07:08.190> pure<00:07:08.550> endurance<00:07:09.449> test<00:07:09.840> oh<00:07:13.190> my
