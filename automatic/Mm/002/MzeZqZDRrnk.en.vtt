like the writing team on a television

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
like the writing team on a television
show<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.440> director<00:00:37.800> comes<00:00:38.010> up<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.250> an<00:00:38.340> idea

for<00:00:38.609> a<00:00:38.760> movie<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.629> he<00:00:39.929> writes<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> script<00:00:40.620> or

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
for a movie then he writes the script or

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.200 
for a movie then he writes the script or
he<00:00:40.949> hires<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> writer<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.670> write<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> script

and<00:00:42.510> then<00:00:43.199> we<00:00:43.559> take<00:00:43.800> those<00:00:44.010> script<00:00:44.280> pages<00:00:44.519> and

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
and then we take those script pages and

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.209 
and then we take those script pages and
we<00:00:44.789> storyboard<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.589> visualize<00:00:47.010> them

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
we storyboard them and we visualize them

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.819 
we storyboard them and we visualize them
and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.149> cut<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:48.510> together<00:00:48.660> into<00:00:49.649> what

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and then we cut them together into what

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.290 
and then we cut them together into what
we<00:00:49.920> call<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> story<00:00:50.399> reel<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.879> kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.269> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we call a story reel it's kind of like a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.239 
we call a story reel it's kind of like a
rough<00:00:51.570> draft<00:00:51.839> of<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.170> film<00:00:52.440> while<00:00:53.039> working

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249 
rough draft of the film while working

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.160 
rough draft of the film while working
with<00:00:53.429> the<00:00:53.550> director<00:00:53.640> he'll<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> lot<00:00:55.140> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
with the director he'll do a lot of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.229 
with the director he'll do a lot of
shorthand<00:00:55.499> will<00:00:55.800> help<00:00:55.949> reference<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.550> movie

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
shorthand will help reference a movie

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
shorthand will help reference a movie
from<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.499> know<00:00:58.679> the<00:00:58.949> seven<00:00:59.550> years<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
from you know the seven years of the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.119 
from you know the seven years of the
1940s<00:01:00.269> are<00:01:00.659> all<00:01:00.929> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.440> whichever<00:01:01.800> movie

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
1940s are all you know whichever movie

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.340 
1940s are all you know whichever movie
that<00:01:02.280> he<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.850> trying<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.269> reference<00:01:03.569> and<00:01:03.989> it's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that he is trying to reference and it's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.190 
that he is trying to reference and it's
our<00:01:04.470> job<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.159> he's<00:01:05.250> talking<00:01:05.670> about

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
our job to know what he's talking about

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.800 
our job to know what he's talking about
so<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.850> mean<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.030> sometimes<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so I mean I think sometimes that is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.300 
so I mean I think sometimes that is
unexpected<00:01:10.259> people<00:01:10.590> think<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.950> maybe<00:01:11.070> all

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
unexpected people think that maybe all

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.740 
unexpected people think that maybe all
you<00:01:11.399> need<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.149> to<00:01:12.329> be<00:01:12.360> able<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.570> draw

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you need to do is is to be able to draw

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.569 
you need to do is is to be able to draw
but<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.259> actually<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.829> a<00:01:13.860> pretty

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
but you actually have to have a pretty

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.060 
but you actually have to have a pretty
good<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> extensive<00:01:16.170> knowledge<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.649> films

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
good and extensive knowledge of films

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.640 
good and extensive knowledge of films
that<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.490> been<00:01:17.880> made<00:01:18.000> over

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.950 

it's<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.550> talk<00:01:22.730> that<00:01:22.880> I've<00:01:22.970> given<00:01:23.120> a<00:01:23.540> couple

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's a talk that I've given a couple

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.820 
it's a talk that I've given a couple
times<00:01:24.140> it's<00:01:24.350> called<00:01:24.530> story<00:01:24.800> as<00:01:24.950> king<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:26.830> I

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
times it's called story as king and I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.930 
times it's called story as king and I
don't<00:01:27.950> want<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.190> give<00:01:28.280> too<00:01:28.310> much<00:01:28.430> away<00:01:28.550> but<00:01:28.910> I

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
don't want to give too much away but I

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.680 
don't want to give too much away but I
basically<00:01:29.950> take<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.250> statement<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.630> that

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
basically take that statement and that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.680 
basically take that statement and that
motto<00:01:33.020> which<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:33.470> sort<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.010> what<00:01:34.220> has<00:01:34.370> guided

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
motto which is sort of what has guided

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.020 
motto which is sort of what has guided
Pixar's<00:01:35.690> filmmaking<00:01:36.230> philosophy<00:01:36.800> will<00:01:37.610> pass

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
Pixar's filmmaking philosophy will pass

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.500 
Pixar's filmmaking philosophy will pass
in<00:01:38.660> 25-30<00:01:39.470> years<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:40.760> breaking<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.360> down

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
in 25-30 years and breaking it down

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.290 
in 25-30 years and breaking it down
really<00:01:42.160> figuring<00:01:43.160> out<00:01:43.280> what<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.730> means<00:01:43.940> on<00:01:44.270> a

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
really figuring out what it means on a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.360 
really figuring out what it means on a
philosophical<00:01:44.630> level<00:01:45.050> on<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.800> practical<00:01:46.220> level

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
philosophical level on a practical level

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.930 
philosophical level on a practical level
and<00:01:46.820> then<00:01:47.030> finally<00:01:47.390> why<00:01:48.020> we<00:01:48.650> use<00:01:48.860> this<00:01:49.130> as<00:01:49.430> our

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
and then finally why we use this as our

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.250 
and then finally why we use this as our
approach<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.690> filmmaking

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
approach to filmmaking
