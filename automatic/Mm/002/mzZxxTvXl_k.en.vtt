00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello girls welcome back to me 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.850
 channel today I bring you my 5 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.450
 glazes that I recommend for this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.730
 spring season I got five picks no 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.070
 I'm saying that they necessarily have 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.320
 that I use colors like that plus I think they are 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.500
 Super ideals are super beautiful and the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.199
 truth screams spring and everything so I do not 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 I will follow fashions or trends 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.070
 nor so I simply what I like 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 but if I feel that their colors are 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.880
 super nice and since some girls I 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.980
 they have asked in my enamel collection 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 that I feel would be super boring 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.120
 if I shared all my ills with 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.649
 you do not know how I feel that I do not know 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.410
 I would be bored but if you want 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.690
 let me know what you can use them for 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 I can make you as a video of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 each brand of glazes because 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 example I have belle anse brands 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 Alliance in others that are not so 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.649
 known but I can make you as a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 video of each so they know more or less 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.899
 what colors and what do I recommend and like that but 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.289
 well I'll start with this this 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.210
 close it and more or less girls to the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.680
 names will not be exact that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.420
 right now because if I bought them as in 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.100
 other times but yes 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.720
 go and look for the color because I 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 I feel like you're not worth changing the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.210
 name but it's the same color this this 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.700
 verb is not from a line you saw and the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.340
 truth is that this line is more or 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.350
 except I really feel it does not last 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 so much but the pigmentation is not right 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.299
 the price is more or less also 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.729
 It is not so expensive or so cheap but 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.729
 it's in the middle and this is called barkat and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.490
 basically it 's a super pale yellow 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.979
 nice that does try to scream 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.530
 spring and if they want a color as well 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.259
 that my mind in this way and that of 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.929
 this color and do not need so many passes 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.970
 this is the ideal and it is called by the cap 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.159
 he says he's a boy when they grab him and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.380
 now and also, but it's the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.299
 white line look like I say another 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.780
 that has been my favorite is always this 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:03.380
 of like that and that is in color quiche 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:07.220
 and the truth in men but fitch take and 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.650
 it's a ping ping pretty nice marte not 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.740
 has brightness or anything is not fuchsia or 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.650
 Fuchsia as you say but it is like a 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.780
 zinc color in the middle I do not even know how 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.400
 describe yourself but this one yes if you're 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 looking like a mate I know that many 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.410
 they bring glitter with what purple glitters 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.170
 that you are given as well as different from me 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.380
 almost in my preference I like the most 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.790
 matte colors but if that is not a 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.090
 from my favorite brands the truth I 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.000
 I feel that for the price it costs not 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.410
 but it lasts as long and as you see in 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.660
 when it was caught because they do have 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.940
 beautiful colors the more than sale that 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.710
 I feel that the price is not worth it but good 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.470
 this is also a color that 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.420
 I recommend and well also the name I think 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.760
 that is not letting them guide for years I think 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.960
 what am I wearing it with my sister 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.250
 why 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.840
 everywhere but if I love this 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.160
 now the last three are of a brand 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.500
 I was already looking at him 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.450

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.270

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.320
 wonder is very nice brand of 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.230
 enamels at this moment I feel that it's worth 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.080
 It's worth the price it's super economical 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.420
 the colors the variety all this I feel 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.180

 if this is a good turquoise color 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.209
 I recommend them very much if 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.189
 have searched for a color so I know that then 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.889
 I look at colors and god where I find 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:13.340
 a color like that what pigment came 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:16.220
 well that is not given as well as transparent 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.500

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.019
 see that I can not be without who 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.060

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.500
 cured not so clear because he as the one 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.270
 I bring in my nails and it is more baby end 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.639
 as you can see this there is a little 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.639
 darker but it's not similar to that of is 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.099
 if these are yes and this is not a 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.289
 similar for nothing is no more clear 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.500
 than the other but not as clear as 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.690
 I say like this show and the last girls 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.310
 this color is a purple and rare the time 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.080
 I find a purple that I like 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.570
 because the truth is that purple does not 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.550
 I do not know it does not appeal to me so much but this one is 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.280
