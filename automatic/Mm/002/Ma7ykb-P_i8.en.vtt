00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 I'm more of a deserter zombie 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.679
 i am a human and hello i am ex 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.450
 andrius and today we play minecraft 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.299
 namely my new project called 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.369
 zombie and the project is about it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.480
 that we play a lot of games modes 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.230
 will be dealing with zombie and 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.970
 today we start with castro looks like this 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.160
 and that's where the game starts 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.050
 are here on the side of the people and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.100
 Must try the zombies as well as 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 possible to stop us 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.160
 our goal is to become our king 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 protect and I hope we can do it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 even if that in this game mode 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.680
 very heavy is the whole zombies 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.480
 here are all of players 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:53.010
 played and I hope we overrun each other 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.969
 not so best i tune in 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.410
 here's our little bit 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.050
 defense pretty weak and indeed 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.059
 there are such tnt zombies i know now 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.769
 not exactly one can not see and the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.240
 can blow away our wall 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.369
 and when our wall first 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.820
 It will be very hard for us to break through 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.010
 to defend our king yet 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.710
 that a tnt zombie god you want here 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.720
 by no 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 okay okay they are by romandie 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.500
 already broken 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.350
 I have to get out of here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.480
 I do not want to die against 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.070
 The zombies go away screaming 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.440
 so i will try again here 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:46.140
 somehow come up with it again 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:54.030
 Shoot the bow a bit 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.710
 already comes for my friends goes away 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.300
 God bless me, I die the same 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.790
 I'm dying already that's not 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.430
 Well , I can stand somewhere 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.100
 and a bit of my life pads 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:13.980
 I know that now nothing but it 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:15.950
 go ok ok ok ok ok bow 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.840
 arc 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.530
 okay that tmt somewhere he already has it 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.430
 explodes 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.430
 okay, what are they doing up there? 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.260
 okay that will not work so well 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.849
 because I am a praise with the bow 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.319
 best not easy in the melee and 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.310
 I'll get these skeletons now 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.310
 vorknÃ¶pfen 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.030
 or not and I die there 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.950
 works just as well now i will 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.049
 as and reborn and must now 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.799
 continue as a dog our king 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.170
 defend 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.159
 the dogs are a little weaker only one 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.959
 stronger attack but you can at least 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.879
 continue to play and is not complete 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.200
 useless even if you 're pretty much 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.790
 dies often and fast but one will 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.250
 So, every eight seconds , it revives 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.290
 this is not a problem 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.310
 and go on something robert 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.310
 exploded again 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.889
 I only hear 10,000 pig zombies 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.239
 to die 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:34.480
 I'm more of a deserter zombie 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.650
 I just went to the people 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.650
 but that was stupid the radom 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:48.340

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.030
 You have to be there too since I am dead 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.470
 nevermind button drives since then 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.030
 Runs as and to no matter I can 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.970

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:12.950

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:22.610

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.620

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.400

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.440

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.380
 they are exactly with our king and 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.720
 then we can do nothing more then 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.720
 we are consecrated to the end 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.320

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:17.640

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:27.210
 we should actually all of us 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.870
 Stand here and try to get there 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.870

 Everything is wonderful before that 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:55.140

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.620
