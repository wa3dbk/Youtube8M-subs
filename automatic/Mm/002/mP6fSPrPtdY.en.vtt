00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.980
 that is the tague the seven deadly sins 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.290
 It is enamels and asked who was it 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.930
 the dreamy anna she always liked 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.160
 photos comments she makes nails sends to 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.460
 I was as 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.800
 It's and then a kiss for you, it's over there. 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.859
 are my glazes then respond to 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.489
 greed questions the most enamel 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.129
 expensive and cheaper than I have 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:41.600
 so the most expensive enamel I have 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:45.100
 it's two of a milani 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.100
 I paid 15 reais 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:54.440
 He is beautiful, I really like him. 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.210
 I found it expensive, just how was it? 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.280
 looking for this rose 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.189
 There I said a name I want those hands. 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.409
 This is one of my dear ones and this one from here. 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.860
 I was looking for a matte black there. 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.790
 I did not think it's the one I found from that brand. 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.220
 eyelash is a beautiful matte black it stays 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.950
 It's true that I'm not going there. 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.780
 I paid between 25 and 30 reais 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.040
 So it was worth it so these are the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.080
 two more expensive 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:32.990
 the cheapest enamel I have to 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:36.350
 these are the two of Lorena and this one I 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.460
 paid around here look was about 80 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.560
 cents 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.640
 that Friday I think they were remnants of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.320
 enamel accepted promotion now gluttony 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.100
 Enamel you ate with your eyes 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:55.070
 before having in some is for those who do not 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.780
 knows to light a brand she works 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.659
 with stamps 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.310
 these are from here and I was crazy about 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.239
 This stamp does not find a place 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.140
 none stayed behind I searched and searched 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.920
 site where the bahia by 3 to 1 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.260
 one of them is then these plates and has 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.720
 the enamels are suitable for these 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:26.350
 Honey, it's ok for you to stamp this one. 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.690
 hence from here I ate with the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.220
 eyes before I sought sought 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.860
 I found and also these two is this 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.239
 From here it 's from the said belenense can and it is 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.830
 a cover strength then you can 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.890
 pass any glaze pass through you 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.910
 and the enamel gets matte 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.090
 attack too 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.880
 and this magnetic enamel 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.230
 Remember when you did not go finding 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:59.019
 very difficult and but there I found 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.930
 So are the stars of laziness which is 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.870
 the glaze you are lazy to pass 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.850
 I love white glaze looks beautiful and does not 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.500
 I came here but I confess I have 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.200
 laziness to pass because he is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.840
 so you have to pass several hands or 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.280
 then pass the shimmering beneath in 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.540
 pretend I always manchu so it's laziness 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.000
 that we went blank on the one 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.760
 little if it were easier with 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.840
 certainty and another one later I paint it 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.549
 But how long has the science of wrath now? 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.630
 which is a sign that is related to 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.370
 love and hate 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.959
 the glazes I have love relationship 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.750
 and hate are the malts with glitter 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:48.190
 I'm in love with Glitter I adore 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:52.299
 my nails are all shiny and falling 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:56.860
 mainly branded networks have very 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:04:02.650
 glitter too then look i love it 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:05.380
 glazes is however time to take 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.750
 hate them because it is very difficult to 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.210
 leave 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.610
 so you stay there with cotton acetone 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.160
 taking away pulling spinning and delay 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.980
 to have a love and hate relationship I love 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.250
 the effect, but it was time to take the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.880
 enamel of lust, which is a sign of 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.720
 that leaves my line and people are not 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.330
 There's a way I think it's red and it 's me. 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.330
 I love to know better in mine that I was going 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.290
 stay pretty and these are the reds 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.060
 What do you like most? 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:43.669
 it looks like they're all the same color but 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:47.060
 they are not all the same it is only tomato 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.880
 impala it is a well pigmented red 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.990
 so if you do not need to spend several 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.120
 hands 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.270
 The idea is to forget what it calls 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.530
 potion of love it has a shine you 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:05.140
 It's really cool to go over the red 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:09.500
 the lopes has this risked a red 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.410
 darker and madonna or speech is also 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.479
 very red 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.270
 So these are the four that I love. 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.870
 pass that line that I think leaves you 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.340
 that they look pretty proud which are 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.950
 the routes that I'm proud to have 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.320
 motorcycle people who are proud to have 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:33.620

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:50.270
