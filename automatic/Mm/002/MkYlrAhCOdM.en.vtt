00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
laying this phone down because the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300 
laying this phone down because the
sensors<00:01:07.260> raised<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.830> little<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
sensors raised up a little bit and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.760 
sensors raised up a little bit and
there's<00:01:08.580> nothing<00:01:09.240> protecting<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there's nothing protecting it so that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.250 
there's nothing protecting it so that
sensor<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.310> easily<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.119> damaged<00:01:12.570> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
sensor is easily going to get damaged so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
sensor is easily going to get damaged so
let's<00:01:13.409> open<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.890> uh<00:01:14.060> purple<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.180> first

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
let's open up this uh purple and first

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.980 
let's open up this uh purple and first
since<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.549> one<00:01:17.549> we're<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.900> be

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
since it's the one we're not going to be

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
since it's the one we're not going to be
putting<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> s4<00:01:19.580> well<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.700> wife<00:01:20.850> will<00:01:21.060> be
