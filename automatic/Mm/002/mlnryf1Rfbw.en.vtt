00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
look pretty good gotta look like the

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.450

panzerotti<00:00:19.599> you<00:00:19.930> know<00:00:20.110> so<00:00:20.680> I<00:00:21.160> got<00:00:21.520> it

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
panzerotti you know so I got it

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.800 
panzerotti you know so I got it
kinda<00:00:24.460> doesn't<00:00:24.640> look<00:00:24.880> as<00:00:25.000> good<00:00:25.239> as<00:00:25.390> the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
kinda doesn't look as good as the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.010 
kinda doesn't look as good as the
picture<00:00:26.369> not<00:00:27.369> really<00:00:27.730> at<00:00:27.910> all

picture not really at all

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.019 
picture not really at all
I<00:00:29.340> kind<00:00:30.340> of<00:00:30.399> thought<00:00:30.489> it<00:00:30.640> would<00:00:30.730> be<00:00:30.820> like<00:00:31.000> a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
I kind of thought it would be like a

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.609 
I kind of thought it would be like a
Pillsbury<00:00:31.509> adhesive<00:00:31.930> ball<00:00:32.110> or<00:00:32.380> something

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
Pillsbury adhesive ball or something

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.770 
Pillsbury adhesive ball or something
like<00:00:32.680> that<00:00:33.270> definitely<00:00:34.270> doesn't<00:00:34.450> look<00:00:34.630> like

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
like that definitely doesn't look like

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.520 
like that definitely doesn't look like
that<00:00:34.829> pretty<00:00:35.829> hard

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that pretty hard

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.560 
that pretty hard
I'm<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.370> sure<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.270> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I'm not really sure but you know it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
I'm not really sure but you know it's
it's<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.050> about<00:00:40.110> taste<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.800> these<00:00:40.920> things

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
