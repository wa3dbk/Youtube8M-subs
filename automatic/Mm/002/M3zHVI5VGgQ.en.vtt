00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.660
 556 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:27.259
 wef's small town eardrum 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:31.820
 I grab a place in the festival it contains more than 20,000 people flocked from all over the world each year commit 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.550
 These are all global investors Warren Buffett 2g Berkshire Hathaway 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.390
 Attendance at shareholders' meeting 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:44.360
 Even one week to give convenience to the end 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.370
 For those who only have one week only one week into car performance really juraneun 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.489
 Can I speak? 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:57.679
 But if the week is worth more than 100 million won , I'll get it. 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:02.149
 If anyone one of Berkshire Hathaway shares to Warren Law c presidency 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:04.539
 If you have only a state, the person already has more than 100 million won 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.539
 Be counted 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.759
 Oh , look at this. I've got a set of pouches without a meter. 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.049
 Really big 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:23.670
 Already sadistic since 2002 is when the price of 50,000 won per 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.729
 Announced this week the Investment Report 2007 14 point, and when 360,000 won 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.759
 How long does it hold us ? 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.130
 In addition to simple improvements beats I use three forceps, Man, bold poured 100% 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.939
 Only books with prices except gold 2 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.450
 We have already resumed investment of about 135% . 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:49.490
 Warren would be too great 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.490
 4 ahningeo'll look you sport is worth three or four days, Buffett invested 2 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.790
 222 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.670
 Warren just how c only reason that investing in our country as to the soaring stocks 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.740
 Puppy quiz fever was blowing. 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:09.060
 What is the secret of the rich man that Warren Buffett earned each year great results ? 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.620
 Surprisingly, the investment technique of Warren Buffett is very simple 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.560
 Many people ask the car for a dog in front of the rich man. 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.020
 Alternative rich pillows are simple 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.370
 When stock prices are low, stocks with excellent corporate content are held for long periods 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.760
 It is. 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.440
 I ignore short-term price movements yet largely about the economic outlook 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.220
 I do not care. 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:42.630
 Rise just bribe the stock seemed to buy the company looked after the zero Insurance 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.570
 In fact, it is important to evaluate the intrinsic value of a company and buy stocks traded at a lower price 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.550
 It may not be that difficult. 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.840
 The question is how firmly we can keep this investment principle 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.110
 Point. 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.110
 The difference between Warren Buffett and the average person is that practice. 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.110
 5 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.620
 Long-term to a stock that is trading below intrinsic value of your company carefully selected 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.200
 A word to hold 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.120
 I do not remember where I heard it. Right. Benjamin Graham. 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.970
 Give me an investment philosophy. 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.890
 So Warren Buffett himself said to me 85% Len Graham Payne 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:29.480
 Graham's influence was great. 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:34.430
 The first step in the world of equity investment is to put a foot in the water, 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:40.220
 I wanted to follow the investment of his teacher, Benjamin Graham. 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:44.330
 That is why we have to buy stocks of railway company, textile company, 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:50.720
 Unexpectedly, the return on investment was poor . 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:56.470
 As a result , Warren Buffett, through the manufacturer , 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.470
 I have come to realize that I am being ignored in the market. 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:07.459
 1960 g orm Puppy Sen had also mentor Philippi bodies such investments 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.370
 I started studying hard. 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:17.630
 When I meet Dili Pisor I am a great quality company, 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:23.870
 I found that even if it was expensive, I had to buy it. 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:29.750
 Also, when investing in a company, top management's ability is paramount 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:32.479
 To dominate the business and science , not only in the classroom but also in the competition 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.050
 Study 2, and 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:40.220
 That's how I met my 15% 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:46.610
 Gray Humber , who claims to be less risky by focusing on the type of asset value 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:52.340
 In other words, intangible assets are important for judging the intrinsic value of a firm. 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:57.340
 From this point on, I learned that my company should invest a few 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.340
 It has become the core of our investment philosophy . 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:05.059
 Methodology Warren Buffett ssem personal mentor Graham and Philip leave after 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:09.639
 Combine 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:15.649
 The stock is traded below the intrinsic value. 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:18.649
 It focuses on a small number of reputable companies in the industry 

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:22.639
 So the main colors to invest in coffee cf are 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:29.119
 Compared to intrinsic value, the current market cap is small 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:34.550
 Top executives are rational, and future outlooks have in common 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:38.029
 In addition , the main sales activity should be simple enough to be easily understood. 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:43.369
 Is one of Puppy's investment terms. 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:47.089
 Warren Buffett's PowerKershawei Way, which he has invested since 1962, 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:52.189
 Miro was the largest cotton fabric company in the region. 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:55.279
 But in 1965 at the time of the acquisition of Warren Buffett, the operating loss of the company 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:06:00.409
 He was living for ten million dollars. 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:04.639
 But Omaha bonje imbued with a small insurance company investment holding company while buying a place 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:09.800
 It began to transform and then to the blue house stamp 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:15.649
 Seas Candidings acquires many companies and owns them. 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:18.680
 American Express Coca-Cola to Washington Post on stocks such as ABC Broadcast 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:23.899
 I invested a lot of money. 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:26.990
 Warren Buffett, who has accumulated such a wealth of wealth and has been a winner , 

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:31.759
 June makes a huge announcement 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.589
 The murder of investment Warren Buffett from the sage of Omaha to the conscience of Wall Street 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:38.449
 It was a moment of being born again. 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:41.959
 Warren Puppy currently has the best sm also the richest in the small house under the body 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:50.149
 I 'm famous for living a simple life so I can live. 

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:54.909
 I am today's president , Bill Gates, 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:57.560
 Bill's going to donate to the Melinda Gates Foundation. 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:07:02.180
 $ 37.4 billion 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:07.280
 1, it's about 37 trillion won. 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:11.420
 Now Warren Buffett is a social practice rather than reducing runners raised an outstanding performance 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:15.830
 As a great character, I might remember you more. 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:23.210
 While listening to an interview of Warren Buffett's practice of social wealth reduction today, two hours 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:26.990
 I will like to thank you where the money to his wife married in 1952 when the resin 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:29.900
 He did not take this point because he boasted to be gathered. 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:33.210
 It was even interest 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:38.700
 I did not listen to him soon. 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:42.110
 But the more we loose money, the less of our thoughts. 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:49.090
 Return it to the world 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:49.090
 I'm leaving the world first. I just kept my promise with my wife.
