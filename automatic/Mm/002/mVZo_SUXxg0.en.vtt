find the video rather than having to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.420 
find the video rather than having to

than<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.570> watching<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.170> really<00:01:58.469> long

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
than just watching like one really long

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.709 
than just watching like one really long
video<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.549> that's<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.600> originally

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
video so that's what we originally

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.929

thought<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> mean<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.159> pretty<00:02:02.399> easy<00:02:02.729> if

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
thought but I mean it's pretty easy if

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.510 
thought but I mean it's pretty easy if
you<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.180> put<00:02:03.390> timestamps<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> video<00:02:04.520> all

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

content and we're going to try to make

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.860 
content and we're going to try to make
it<00:03:31.910> because<00:03:32.239> that's<00:03:32.419> what<00:03:32.599> you<00:03:32.690> guys<00:03:32.810> are

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870
