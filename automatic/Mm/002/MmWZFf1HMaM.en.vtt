different sounds that you're hearing and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.130 
different sounds that you're hearing and
where<00:00:30.119> they're<00:00:30.300> coming<00:00:30.510> from<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.960> tricky

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
where they're coming from it's tricky

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.659 
where they're coming from it's tricky
but<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.769> practice<00:00:31.949> you'll<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> hang<00:00:32.489> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
but with practice you'll get the hang of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.340 
but with practice you'll get the hang of
it<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:32.910> i'm<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> show<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.390> kind<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it so i'm going to show you kind of the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.470 
it so i'm going to show you kind of the
basics<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.010> understand<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.390> going

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
basics so you understand what is going

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.700 
basics so you understand what is going
to<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.200> you're<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> try<00:00:37.680> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to go on and what you're going to try to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.819 
to go on and what you're going to try to
do<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> beat<00:00:38.670> match<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.059> essentially

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
do when you beat match so essentially

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.490 
do when you beat match so essentially
what<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.980> matching<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.500> matching

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
what be matching is is just a matching

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.639 
what be matching is is just a matching
up<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.890> temples<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.730> two<00:00:44.940> different<00:00:45.329> songs<00:00:45.780> so

want to do essentially is you want to
start<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.439> record<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.509> one<00:01:45.509> on

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
start this record on the one on a one on

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.100 
start this record on the one on a one on
this<00:01:46.380> record<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.340> listen<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.509> how

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
this record and then listen to see how

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
this record and then listen to see how
it<00:01:49.259> turns<00:01:49.290> out<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.920> could<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.220> dead<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it turns out you could be dead on you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.700 
it turns out you could be dead on you
might<00:01:50.790> need<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.119> some<00:01:51.149> adjusting<00:01:51.659> right<00:01:51.899> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
might need to do some adjusting right so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100 
might need to do some adjusting right so
we're<00:01:52.860> listening<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.250> record<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:54.960> have

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
we're listening this record and we have

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.780 
we're listening this record and we have
the<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.500> right<00:01:55.829> we're<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the one right here right we're going to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.030 
the one right here right we're going to
start<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.270> right<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:57.990> right<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.920> go

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
start this right on the one right so go

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.780 
start this right on the one right so go
five<00:01:59.399> six<00:01:59.759> seven<00:02:00.570> eight<00:02:00.930> one

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.940 

that<00:02:04.720> was<00:02:04.840> good<00:02:04.960> for<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.170> sec<00:02:05.380> but<00:02:05.410> now<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.740> falls

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
that was good for a sec but now it falls

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.109 
that was good for a sec but now it falls
off<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:08.490> who<00:02:09.490> knows<00:02:09.610> what's<00:02:09.820> going<00:02:10.000> on

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
off so now who knows what's going on

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.290 
off so now who knows what's going on
right<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:11.230> essentially<00:02:11.560> what<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.880> train<00:02:13.120> is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
right so essentially what the train is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.210 
right so essentially what the train is
going<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> do<00:02:13.690> for<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.560> practice<00:02:15.040> is

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
going to do for you and the practice is

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.950 
going to do for you and the practice is
you're<00:02:15.340> going<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:15.520> be<00:02:15.640> able<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.910> hear<00:02:16.360> which

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
you're going to be able to hear which

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.840 
you're going to be able to hear which
song<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.260> ahead<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.860> other<00:02:17.980> ones<00:02:18.220> right<00:02:18.430> so

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
song is ahead of the other ones right so

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.830 
song is ahead of the other ones right so
after<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> while<00:02:19.240> you're<00:02:19.480> going<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.690> notice

so as I'm slowing it down with my finger

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.940 
so as I'm slowing it down with my finger
I'm<00:03:11.460> sort<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> touching<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.210> pot<00:03:12.420> again<00:03:12.950> just

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
to slow down the record just a bit and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.740 
to slow down the record just a bit and
I'm<00:03:17.460> moving<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.880> pitch<00:03:18.060> down<00:03:18.240> just<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.600> little

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
bit you basically have to fine tune

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.470 
bit you basically have to fine tune
yourself<00:03:24.260> until<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.410> get<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.650> right<00:03:25.680> on<00:03:29.120> thats
