giving it a passphrase wpa2 security and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.569 
giving it a passphrase wpa2 security and
preferably<00:01:33.229> rather<00:01:34.229> than<00:01:34.439> giving<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> no

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
things and then and then literally it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.230 
things and then and then literally it
just<00:01:40.020> functions<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.650> what's<00:01:41.130> called<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.520> access

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
just functions as what's called a access

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.069 
just functions as what's called a access

useful completely legitimate app you can
use<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.380> different<00:02:28.800> app<00:02:28.950> called<00:02:29.220> free<00:02:29.430> tether

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
use a different app called free tether

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.089 
use a different app called free tether
now<00:02:30.360> free<00:02:30.569> tether<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.140> install<00:02:31.500> off<00:02:31.830> the

now free tether you can install off the

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.710 
now free tether you can install off the
app<00:02:32.220> catalog<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.300> little<00:02:33.450> bit<00:02:33.569> more

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
app catalog it's a little bit more

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.479

involved I'm not going to get into that
if<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.660> want<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.930> learn<00:02:37.050> more<00:02:37.200> about<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.590> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
if you want to learn more about it you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.850 
if you want to learn more about it you
can<00:02:37.800> go<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.920> webOS<00:02:38.760> internals<00:02:39.300> org<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.900> learn

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
can go to webOS internals org and learn

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.610 
can go to webOS internals org and learn
about<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.260> google

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
about it there or you can just google

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.949 
about it there or you can just google
free<00:02:44.069> tether<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.849> webOS<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:46.319> one<00:02:46.799> word<00:02:46.980> and

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
free tether and webOS it's one word and

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.479 
free tether and webOS it's one word and
basically<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.140> way<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.890> works<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.459> if

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
basically the way this this works is if

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.890 
basically the way this this works is if
you<00:02:51.920> if<00:02:52.920> you've<00:02:53.100> basically<00:02:53.850> learn<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.510> figure

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
you if you've basically learn and figure

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.809 
you if you've basically learn and figure
out<00:02:54.959> how<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.170> install<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.709> once<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.459> install

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
out how to install it once you install

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.259 
out how to install it once you install
it<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.560> get<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> choice<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.190> Wi-Fi<00:02:59.730> Bluetooth

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
it you get the choice of Wi-Fi Bluetooth

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.320 
it you get the choice of Wi-Fi Bluetooth
and<00:03:00.480> USB<00:03:00.739> now<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> haven't<00:03:02.130> tried<00:03:02.340> actually<00:03:03.150> I

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
and USB now I haven't tried actually I

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.550 
and USB now I haven't tried actually I
haven't<00:03:03.510> tried<00:03:03.599> any<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.870> these<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:04.380> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
haven't tried any of these it's like the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.589 
haven't tried any of these it's like the
truth<00:03:04.799> but<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.819> know<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.180> I've<00:03:06.269> heard<00:03:06.450> that

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
truth but I know that I've heard that

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.449 
truth but I know that I've heard that
Wi-Fi<00:03:06.959> works<00:03:07.200> very<00:03:07.470> well<00:03:07.560> I've<00:03:08.040> heard<00:03:08.190> that

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
Wi-Fi works very well I've heard that

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.479 
Wi-Fi works very well I've heard that
maybe<00:03:08.670> Bluetooth<00:03:09.269> might<00:03:09.510> not<00:03:09.720> work<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.489> can't

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
maybe Bluetooth might not work I can't

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.059 
maybe Bluetooth might not work I can't
confirm<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.959> if<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.380> works<00:03:13.500> go<00:03:13.799> ahead<00:03:13.950> and

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
confirm this so if it works go ahead and

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.740 
confirm this so if it works go ahead and
tell<00:03:14.190> me<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.430> comments<00:03:14.849> I'm<00:03:15.330> going<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.660> go

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
tell me in the comments I'm going to go

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.050 
tell me in the comments I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.140> say<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.500> probably<00:03:16.530> does<00:03:17.130> all

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
ahead and say that it probably does all

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.050 
ahead and say that it probably does all
right<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.450> then<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.410> also<00:03:19.590> use<00:03:19.829> usb<00:03:20.459> but

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
right and then you can also use usb but

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.550 
right and then you can also use usb but
really<00:03:21.390> when<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.570> have<00:03:21.720> Wi-Fi<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.260> Bluetooth

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
really when you have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.979 
really when you have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
I<00:03:22.799> mean<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.220> don't<00:03:24.030> really<00:03:24.209> see<00:03:24.420> too<00:03:24.570> much<00:03:24.720> point

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
I mean I don't really see too much point

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.930 
I mean I don't really see too much point
using<00:03:25.170> USB<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:25.829> if<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.070> want<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> maintain

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
using USB but if you want to maintain

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.140 
using USB but if you want to maintain
absolute<00:03:27.510> maximum<00:03:27.900> throughput<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:29.100> can<00:03:29.910> use

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
absolute maximum throughput you can use

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.229 
absolute maximum throughput you can use
the<00:03:30.329> you<00:03:30.750> know<00:03:30.840> USB<00:03:31.350> cable<00:03:31.709> but<00:03:32.160> basically<00:03:33.150> it

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
the you know USB cable but basically it

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.030 
the you know USB cable but basically it
works<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.810> same<00:03:33.959> way<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:34.170> turn<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.680> and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
works the same way you turn it on and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.140 
works the same way you turn it on and
then<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:36.090> will<00:03:37.130> basically<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.670> can<00:03:38.790> use<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.030> as

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
then it will basically you can use it as

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.509 
then it will basically you can use it as
a<00:03:39.660> access<00:03:40.230> point<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.709> your<00:03:40.799> computer<00:03:41.040> all

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
a access point for your computer all

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:41.809 
a access point for your computer all
right

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
right

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.160 
right
