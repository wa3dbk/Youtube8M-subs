00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.210
 we were late 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:10.240
 as human legs of 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.240
 an image on the roof part 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.660
 then we are going to take everything that would be 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.150
 the part of the roof to clean 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.480
 We proceed to use the tool 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.740
 tie 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.800
 selecting everything in the part of 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.429
 text 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.429
 back 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.829
 and everything complete 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.310
 so that already the image to have a 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.170
 in the part that we are going to clean where 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:49.210
 concentrates the largest amount of probe 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.210
 we must do it in the selection 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.350
 What we are going to do is use the 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.500
 layer mode 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.720
 let's use a soft or soft model 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.850
 life 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.890
 that would be English and have it in Spanish 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.470
 the soft ones 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.800
 with the tool they think or we take 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.120
 with white 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.120
 and we 're going for a walk 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.680
 3% as they could see it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.030
 until we see the change we want 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.360
 but 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.460
 we unite the images 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.460
 well let's go as saturation 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.090
 and we lower the values 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.440
 as we do not feel a man calculate they were going 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.650
 all right 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.380
 when the tone that you acquire 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.610
 we accept 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.830
 we select select 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.330
 and here you can see what result 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.870
 no shadow with shadow person 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.870
 is
