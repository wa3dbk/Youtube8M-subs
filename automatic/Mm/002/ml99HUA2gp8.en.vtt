00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
that came out so far after the first

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.160 
that came out so far after the first
Super<00:05:00.090> Mario<00:05:00.300> Brothers<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.840> we<00:05:00.930> would<00:05:01.080> have

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
Super Mario Brothers that we would have

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.840 
Super Mario Brothers that we would have
moved<00:05:01.350> past<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:01.920> whole<00:05:02.190> type<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.580> game<00:05:02.700> where

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
moved past that whole type of game where

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.850 
moved past that whole type of game where
you<00:05:02.940> just<00:05:03.120> run<00:05:03.330> from<00:05:03.540> point<00:05:03.870> A<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:03.990> point<00:05:04.110> B<00:05:04.410> and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
you just run from point A to point B and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.510 
you just run from point A to point B and
the<00:05:05.250> power-ups<00:05:05.700> are<00:05:05.790> even<00:05:06.000> worse<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.540> rhino<00:05:07.520> who

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
the power-ups are even worse a rhino who

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.860 
the power-ups are even worse a rhino who
thought<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.820> would<00:05:08.910> be<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.090> good<00:05:09.300> idea<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.810> have

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
thought it would be a good idea to have
