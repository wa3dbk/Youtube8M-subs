all<00:00:01.829> right<00:00:02.129> so<00:00:02.520> here's<00:00:02.730> an<00:00:02.909> update<00:00:03.060> on<00:00:03.360> my<00:00:03.510> five

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
all right so here's an update on my five

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.470 
all right so here's an update on my five
gallon<00:00:04.170> flu<00:00:04.440> ho<00:00:04.620> chi<00:00:05.150> I've<00:00:06.150> kind<00:00:06.390> of

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
gallon flu ho chi I've kind of

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.390 
gallon flu ho chi I've kind of
rearranged<00:00:07.080> how<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.230> filters<00:00:07.710> work<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.160> little

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
rearranged how the filters work a little

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.709 
rearranged how the filters work a little
bit<00:00:08.570> this<00:00:09.570> homemade<00:00:09.960> filter<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.530> now<00:00:10.679> strictly

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
bit this homemade filter is now strictly

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.720 
bit this homemade filter is now strictly
biological<00:00:12.920> filtering<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.130> got<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.519> little

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
biological filtering it's got a little

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.070 
biological filtering it's got a little
bit<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.910> sponge<00:00:15.150> insert<00:00:15.570> down<00:00:15.690> at<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.929> bottom

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
bit of sponge insert down at the bottom

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.900 
bit of sponge insert down at the bottom
to<00:00:16.199> kind<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.500> pre-filter<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> water<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.609> I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
to kind of pre-filter the water but I

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.429 
to kind of pre-filter the water but I
wouldn't<00:00:18.449> really<00:00:18.570> consider<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:19.050> much<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
wouldn't really consider it much of a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.590 
wouldn't really consider it much of a
mechanical<00:00:19.949> filter<00:00:20.310> I'm<00:00:21.060> still<00:00:21.300> using<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
mechanical filter I'm still using the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.960 
mechanical filter I'm still using the
box<00:00:21.810> filter<00:00:22.380> I've<00:00:22.590> got<00:00:22.800> my<00:00:23.070> pure<00:00:23.310> again<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
box filter I've got my pure again and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.140 
box filter I've got my pure again and
some<00:00:24.210> extra<00:00:25.039> seachem<00:00:26.039> Matrix<00:00:26.550> sitting<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.000> in

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
some extra seachem Matrix sitting up in

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.609 
some extra seachem Matrix sitting up in
the<00:00:27.240> top<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.930> add<00:00:28.170> some<00:00:28.470> bio

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the top of that to add some bio

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.830 
the top of that to add some bio
filtering<00:00:29.599> capacity<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.900> filter<00:00:31.170> also

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
filtering capacity to that filter also

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
filtering capacity to that filter also
so<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> went<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> pet<00:00:34.440> store<00:00:34.469> today<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
so I went to the pet store today and I

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
so I went to the pet store today and I
was<00:00:35.910> looking<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.420> something<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.809> put<00:00:37.079> some

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
was looking for something to put some

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.990 
was looking for something to put some
blue<00:00:37.559> into<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> tank<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.520> didn't<00:00:38.730> think<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.969> had

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
blue into the tank I didn't think it had

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.889 
blue into the tank I didn't think it had
enough<00:00:39.300> blue<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:41.550> came<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.300> either

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
enough blue and I came up with either

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.270 
enough blue and I came up with either
some<00:00:43.850> blue<00:00:44.850> glofish<00:00:45.360> danios<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.440> neon<00:00:46.739> tetras

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
some blue glofish danios or neon tetras

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.889 
some blue glofish danios or neon tetras
and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.520> think<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.420> settled

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and I think you can see what I settled

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.029 
and I think you can see what I settled
on<00:00:49.100> I'm<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.340> excited<00:00:50.850> about<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.570> they

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
on I'm really excited about them they

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.170 
on I'm really excited about them they
moved<00:00:53.039> slightly<00:00:53.520> differently<00:00:53.850> than<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
moved slightly differently than the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.729 
moved slightly differently than the
Guppies<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> more<00:00:54.989> linear<00:00:55.170> type<00:00:55.590> of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
Guppies it's a more linear type of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.290 
Guppies it's a more linear type of
motion<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> lot<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> fun<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.000> sit<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
motion it's a lot of fun to just sit and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.880 
motion it's a lot of fun to just sit and
watch<00:00:57.449> them<00:00:57.719> contrast<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> Guppies<00:00:58.859> in

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
watch them contrast with the Guppies in

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.000 
watch them contrast with the Guppies in
color<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.579> movement<00:00:59.699> style<00:01:00.440> as<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.770> see

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
color and movement style as you can see

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.779 
color and movement style as you can see
my<00:01:02.280> shrimp<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.879> doing<00:01:03.480> very<00:01:03.690> well

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:18.569 

my<00:01:12.789> favorite<00:01:13.240> guppy<00:01:13.600> still<00:01:13.960> back<00:01:14.140> there<00:01:17.579> some

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
my favorite guppy still back there some

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:25.109 
my favorite guppy still back there some
more<00:01:18.759> on<00:01:18.850> my<00:01:18.969> shrimp<00:01:20.909> my<00:01:21.909> Tetris<00:01:22.509> I<00:01:24.000> had<00:01:25.000> to

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
more on my shrimp my Tetris I had to

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.660 
more on my shrimp my Tetris I had to
take<00:01:25.329> out<00:01:25.569> this<00:01:25.840> grass<00:01:26.709> plant<00:01:27.039> in<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.250> back<00:01:27.280> I

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
take out this grass plant in the back I

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.309 
take out this grass plant in the back I
found<00:01:27.880> out<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.060> misidentified<00:01:28.899> it<00:01:29.079> it<00:01:29.200> was

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
found out I misidentified it it was

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.160 
found out I misidentified it it was
actually<00:01:29.469> mondo<00:01:30.099> grass<00:01:30.539> so<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.569> just<00:01:31.840> removed

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
actually mondo grass so I just removed

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.080 
actually mondo grass so I just removed
it<00:01:32.349> before<00:01:32.649> it<00:01:32.740> started<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.189> rock<00:01:33.369> terribly<00:01:33.969> on

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
it before it started to rock terribly on

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.199 
it before it started to rock terribly on
the<00:01:34.209> tank<00:01:37.679> my<00:01:38.679> nearing<00:01:39.039> snail<00:01:39.429> is<00:01:39.700> back<00:01:39.939> to<00:01:40.119> her

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
the tank my nearing snail is back to her

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.999 
the tank my nearing snail is back to her
normal<00:01:40.450> self<00:01:40.780> she's<00:01:41.170> not<00:01:41.379> injured<00:01:41.739> at<00:01:41.890> all

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
normal self she's not injured at all

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.649 
normal self she's not injured at all
anymore<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:42.729> that's<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.379> plus
