to<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.719> that<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.899> have<00:01:13.259> an<00:01:13.380> rj45

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
to the right of that we have an rj45

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.029 
to the right of that we have an rj45
connection<00:01:14.759> this<00:01:15.659> connector<00:01:16.289> it<00:01:16.829> would

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
connection this connector it would

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.580 
connection this connector it would
connect<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.579> your<00:01:17.759> existing<00:01:18.299> land<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
connect up to your existing land so you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.639 
connect up to your existing land so you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
server on the network you can also

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.319 
server on the network you can also
disable<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.710> port<00:01:26.069> so<00:01:26.549> users<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.210> are

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
disable this port so users that are

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.419 
disable this port so users that are
coming<00:01:27.719> in<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.020> visiting<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.619> guests<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.249> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
768 also 1280 by 1024 so there's no need

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.839 
768 also 1280 by 1024 so there's no need
