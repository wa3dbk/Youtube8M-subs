 BP was not just a block of fire too late 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.820
 then you have to be the turning point 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.190
 it's a little can do 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.230

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.149
 pieter tops 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.059
 where you import those seven heads against that status and the kilometers that 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.619

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:49.629

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.129
 to dump 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.059

 cooper's open letter 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.729
