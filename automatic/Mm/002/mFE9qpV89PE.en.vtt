00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.789
 welcome to innovate crafts in 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.920
 this time I'll show you how to do 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.800
 these original snowflakes for 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.300
 decorate the Christmas tree you're going to 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.300
 need these materials 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.050
 glue gun ceramic dish or 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.740
 similar permanent marker soap 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.740
 gordoncillo liquid purpurina and scissors 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.769
 we take a ceramic plate and draw 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.940
 with the permanent marker a snowflake 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.539
 snow is very easy to draw look how 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.539
 it does 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.880
 for the dish do not worry it's not about 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.070
 of spoiling the dishes with a little 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.010
 degreaser or alcohol removes the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.110
 permanent marker completely and if 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.160
 you do not want to risk use a plate 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.160
 that you are not going to use 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 Once the marker is dry, we spread a 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.200
 little liquid soap all over the snowflake 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.450
 of snow 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.759
 so we will get that by putting the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.759
 glue does not stick to the plate 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.730
 this is the cord that is going to 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.700
 serve to hang the codend are about 15 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.850
 centimeters approximately to fix it 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.680
 we put it in this extreme and we begin 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.680
 to throw the glue with the gun 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.259
 you have to give glue all over the snowflake 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.840
 reviewing the whole drawing be generous and 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.940
 Take enough glue to make it 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.930
 quick so that afterwards give time to 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.930
 fix the glitter 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.600
 before it hardens we take 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.050
 enough glitter to cover all the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.050
 Snowflake 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.970
 we give a few small touches to fix the 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.970
 glitter and we wait a couple of minutes 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.030
 we take it off the plate and remove the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.030
 excess glitter 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.560
 Now with a scissors we cut the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.070
 small threads of glue that could 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.070
 have stayed 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.549
 we have already finished you have seen how easy 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.519

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.069
