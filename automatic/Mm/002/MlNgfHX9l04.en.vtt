00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hello everyone, the channel is running and now 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.300
 we will play the game assassins creed 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.700
 pirate is a very controversial game which 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.940
 many may disappoint 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.070
 the first thing you notice is that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.949
 playing assassin's creed 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.289
 Has the name of the heroes of this 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.810
 games will become pirates rather one pirate 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.240
 barely got his ship for 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.340
 cheeky temper like a local 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.219
 pirate leader 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.440
 the main goal of the game is quite predictable I 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:37.340
 I know that the main character is a pirate of course 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.739
 it will be a treasure which is encrypted 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.870
 can we assume that such a plot is a hoax 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.039
 in relation to gamers waiting 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.660
 continuation of the favorite game series yes 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:54.360
 perhaps it is possible but nevertheless the game 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.120
 turned out to be interesting in the game there 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.280
 related plot but also freedom of action on 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.109
 will be given 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.910
 really not all the time as a rule you 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.820
 will be given a goal if 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.330
 looking at mejor not limited then we can 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.970
 do what we wish and wish everyone 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.210
 normal pirates border up desirable 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.549
 trade each one on a fuel ship can 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.189
 will collect loot and if you are lucky 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.490
 there may be maps indicating 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.340
 whereabouts treasure of course such 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.340
 the rich as being the main goal 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.079
 games for all the same useful game just 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.920
 kills with its simplicity 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.130
 battle management performance 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.930
 tasks mastered within 10 minutes 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.140
 and no further development 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.640
 gets start our journey 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.439
 to be on a small schooner 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.750
 which of course is not serious and not good 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.880
 for serious matters 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.720
 so we will have to look for ways 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.120
 to get 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.290
 with the ship away, yes I am a team 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.510
 forget low 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.400
 especially as sailors may possess 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.620
 various useful skills 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.259
 without sea battles of course not 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.750
 all cost suppose guns 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.640
 powder holds explosions maneuvers for 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.670
 deviations in which two are used 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.490
 buttons and not a big deal 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.040
 what a fool would you have 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.380
 good response to management specifically 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.110
 draw attention to it all very much 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.480
 just the same you have to go 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.140
 learning these all in russian 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.790
 where, if not in the game, but pirates show all 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.400
 capabilities of modern mobile 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.350
 devices you enjoy 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.080
 magnificent sea details 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.040
 reefed and covered in dense thickets 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.530
 shores 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.690
 it all sounds like a sneer when 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.490
 you start the game 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.050
 it is clear that designers have put a lot 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.170
 effort to create sift and yes well here 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.660
 implementation 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.390
 put it mildly disappoint step 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.040
 ropes with textures on which 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.500
 pixels are peeking 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.000
 This is clearly not what everyone expected from the game. 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.590
 let's hope that 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.950
 pressure and handsome could 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.780
 assassin's creed spirax at home 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.230
 not at all . 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.400
 but if you are a fan of sea battles 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:26.040
 Of course, there is a link to the game. 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.080
 will be in the description with you was bedlam 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.799
 subscribe to the channel put the likes 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.799
