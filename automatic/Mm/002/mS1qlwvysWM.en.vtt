just select the tank look better in
general<00:00:33.590> well<00:00:34.590> let's<00:00:34.770> let's<00:00:35.250> look<00:00:35.430> at<00:00:35.550> this

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.990 

legs<00:00:42.649> for<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.840> for<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> ends<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.000> light

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
legs for the for the ends of the light

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.049 
legs for the for the ends of the light
but<00:00:48.960> since<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:50.010> tank<00:00:50.280> has<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.579> glass<00:00:50.760> top

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
but since my tank has a glass top

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.450 
but since my tank has a glass top
everyone<00:00:51.690> eyes

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
everyone eyes

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.619 
everyone eyes
we're<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.670> gonna<00:00:53.850> sit<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> fixture

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
we're just gonna sit the fixture

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.110 
we're just gonna sit the fixture
directly<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> glass<00:00:55.649> top<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.309> these<00:00:56.550> these

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
directly on the glass top so these these

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:10.100 
directly on the glass top so these these
will<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.629> needed<00:01:02.809> box<00:01:03.809> over<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:09.110> power

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
will not be needed box over there power

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:21.230 
will not be needed box over there power
cord<00:01:13.970> but<00:01:16.549> it's<00:01:17.549> very<00:01:17.909> nice<00:01:19.520> its<00:01:20.520> thing<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
cord but it's very nice its thing and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.490 
cord but it's very nice its thing and
it's<00:01:21.630> twice<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.020> light<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:23.960> my<00:01:24.960> coral<00:01:25.350> light

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it's twice as light as my coral light

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's twice as light as my coral light
fixture<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:29.150> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
fixture right on the that I have in the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.219 
fixture right on the that I have in the
LEDs<00:01:30.570> look<00:01:30.810> incredible<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.950> obviously

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
LEDs look incredible and it's obviously

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.520 
LEDs look incredible and it's obviously
how<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:35.270> how<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> lighting<00:01:36.750> industry<00:01:37.200> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
how the how the lighting industry is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.160 
how the how the lighting industry is
going<00:01:37.770> these<00:01:38.700> days<00:01:38.759> from<00:01:39.270> plant<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> tame<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
going these days from plant to tame it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.960 
going these days from plant to tame it
uses<00:01:40.740> less<00:01:40.950> power<00:01:41.009> better<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
uses less power better for the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
uses less power better for the
environment<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.119> great<00:01:46.159> LED<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.220> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
environment and it's a great LED is a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.280 
environment and it's a great LED is a
great<00:01:47.970> option<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.720> might<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
great option that you might want to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.929 
great option that you might want to
start<00:01:49.500> thinking<00:01:49.890> about<00:01:49.950> because<00:01:50.729> they're

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
start thinking about because they're

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.420 
start thinking about because they're
becoming<00:01:51.119> more<00:01:51.860> more<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.009> more<00:01:53.780> affordable

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
becoming more more and more affordable

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.100 
becoming more more and more affordable
you<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> Phoenix<00:01:57.119> logo<00:01:57.570> right<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:57.810> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
you see the Phoenix logo right there and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.350 
you see the Phoenix logo right there and
we<00:02:01.110> won't<00:02:01.290> turn<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.590> yet<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.250> we'll<00:02:02.520> take<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
we won't turn on yet but we'll take a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.730 
we won't turn on yet but we'll take a
look<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> tank<00:02:04.549> compared<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
look at it on the tank compared to the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.430 
look at it on the tank compared to the
coral<00:02:07.740> life<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.450> look<00:02:09.629> at<00:02:09.750> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
coral life so if you look at that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.130 
coral life so if you look at that
is<00:02:11.310> smaller<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.390> thinner<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:12.840> more

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
is smaller it's thinner it's more

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.790 
is smaller it's thinner it's more
compact<00:02:13.650> yet<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.730> gives<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.410> about<00:02:16.410> three

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
compact yet it gives out about three

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.790 
compact yet it gives out about three
times<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.430> par<00:02:18.170> which<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> whole<00:02:19.590> nother

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
times the par which is a whole nother

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.770 
times the par which is a whole nother
video<00:02:20.010> but<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.610> gives<00:02:20.760> up<00:02:20.940> about<00:02:21.210> three<00:02:21.600> times

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
video but it gives up about three times

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.460 
video but it gives up about three times
the<00:02:22.050> par<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:27.390> coral<00:02:27.840> light<00:02:28.020> fixture<00:02:28.440> and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the par of this coral light fixture and

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.890 
the par of this coral light fixture and
it's<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.490> much<00:02:29.730> slimmer<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.630> much

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
it's so much slimmer it's so much

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.350 
it's so much slimmer it's so much
lighter<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.710> I'm<00:02:32.070> very<00:02:32.520> excited<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.090> see<00:02:33.180> how

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
lighter and I'm very excited to see how

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.400 
lighter and I'm very excited to see how
it<00:02:33.480> looks<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.900> tank<00:02:38.510> okay<00:02:39.510> actually<00:02:39.810> we

actually looks clearer than before I

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.180 
actually looks clearer than before I
mean<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.690> mean<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.110> looks<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.440> lot<00:03:37.560> brighter<00:03:37.770> for

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.830 
mean I mean it looks a lot brighter for
the<00:03:38.250> first<00:03:38.489> couple<00:03:38.700> days<00:03:38.850> it'll<00:03:39.390> settle<00:03:39.630> down

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the first couple days it'll settle down

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.620 
the first couple days it'll settle down
a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:39.989> bit<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.610> love<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.180> shimmer<00:03:42.480> of

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
a little bit but I love the shimmer of

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.500 
a little bit but I love the shimmer of
the<00:03:42.870> LEDs<00:03:43.410> if<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.100> look<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.430> there<00:03:47.360> they<00:03:48.360> look

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the LEDs if you look in there they look

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.460 
the LEDs if you look in there they look
awesome<00:03:49.070> high<00:03:50.070> output<00:03:50.550> LEDs<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.360> my<00:03:52.019> tank<00:03:52.320> is

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
awesome high output LEDs but my tank is

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.940 
awesome high output LEDs but my tank is
just<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:52.950> tall<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:55.110> halogen<00:03:55.590> won't<00:03:55.830> be

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
just so tall that the halogen won't be

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.780 
just so tall that the halogen won't be
much<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.370> problem<00:03:56.519> in<00:03:56.940> my<00:03:57.120> estimation<00:03:57.780> but

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
much of a problem in my estimation but

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.740 
much of a problem in my estimation but
yeah<00:03:59.790> it's<00:03:59.970> looking<00:04:00.209> great<00:04:00.860> do<00:04:01.860> anything<00:04:02.220> say

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
well for my first impression it looks

well for my first impression it looks
great<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.310> thought<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.760> was<00:04:08.850> actually<00:04:09.030> gonna<00:04:09.390> be

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
great I thought it was actually gonna be

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.610 
great I thought it was actually gonna be
a<00:04:09.600> little<00:04:09.900> thicker<00:04:10.700> but<00:04:11.930> thinner<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.200> always
