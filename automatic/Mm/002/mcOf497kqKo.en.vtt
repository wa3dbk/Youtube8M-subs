in-camera image modification even if

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.059 
in-camera image modification even if
it's<00:00:05.730> only<00:00:05.879> cropping<00:00:06.420> however<00:00:07.109> Nikon<00:00:07.560> goes

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
it's only cropping however Nikon goes

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.370 
it's only cropping however Nikon goes
way<00:00:08.460> beyond<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:08.849> level<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.389> capability<00:00:10.080> with

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
way beyond that level of capability with

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.060 
way beyond that level of capability with
an<00:00:10.469> entire<00:00:10.800> menu<00:00:11.190> devoted<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.509> camera

an entire menu devoted to in camera
retouching<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.849> what<00:00:15.000> exactly<00:00:15.120> can<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.660> do

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
retouching so what exactly can you do

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.320 
retouching so what exactly can you do
with<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> retouch<00:00:16.800> setting<00:00:17.310> basically<00:00:18.150> it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
with the retouch setting basically it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.150 
with the retouch setting basically it
allows<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> fix<00:00:19.080> flaws<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.710> picture<00:00:20.039> on

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
allows you to fix flaws in a picture on

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.400 
allows you to fix flaws in a picture on
the<00:00:20.279> go<00:00:20.460> without<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> need<00:00:21.539> for<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.869> computer

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the go without the need for a computer

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.529 
the go without the need for a computer
so<00:00:23.010> how<00:00:23.160> does<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.430> retouch<00:00:23.850> function<00:00:24.269> work

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
so how does the retouch function work

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.689 
so how does the retouch function work
while<00:00:25.410> each<00:00:25.590> camera<00:00:25.890> has<00:00:26.039> its<00:00:26.310> own<00:00:26.430> set<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
while each camera has its own set of

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.160 
while each camera has its own set of
features<00:00:26.970> we'll<00:00:27.390> highlight<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
features we'll highlight some of the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.480 
features we'll highlight some of the
common<00:00:28.470> ones<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:29.039> help<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.310> make<00:00:29.429> your

enjoyable one

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610 
enjoyable one
there<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> straighten<00:00:33.660> function<00:00:34.140> whereby

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
there is the straighten function whereby

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.470 
there is the straighten function whereby
you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.950> even<00:00:35.280> add<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> picture<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:36.210> you've

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you can even add a picture if you've

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
you can even add a picture if you've
accidentally<00:00:37.230> tilted<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> camera<00:00:38.190> while

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
accidentally tilted the camera while

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.970 
accidentally tilted the camera while
shooting<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:39.660> there's<00:00:39.989> D<00:00:40.290> lighting<00:00:40.739> which

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
shooting then there's D lighting which

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.770 
shooting then there's D lighting which
is<00:00:41.100> really<00:00:41.370> cool<00:00:41.550> at<00:00:41.700> making<00:00:42.059> dark<00:00:42.329> pictures<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is really cool at making dark pictures a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
is really cool at making dark pictures a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
little darker so the picture looks more
