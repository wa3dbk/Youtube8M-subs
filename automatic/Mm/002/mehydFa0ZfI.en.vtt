00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.850 

the<00:02:25.120> biggest<00:02:25.390> difference<00:02:25.930> when<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.620> jump

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
the biggest difference when you jump

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.250 
the biggest difference when you jump
into<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.340> Porsche<00:02:27.700> from<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> BMW<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.870> that

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
into the Porsche from the BMW is that

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.700 
into the Porsche from the BMW is that
the<00:02:29.380> KN<00:02:29.800> looks<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.790> feels<00:02:31.270> more<00:02:31.840> expensive

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
the KN looks and feels more expensive

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.420 
the KN looks and feels more expensive
and<00:02:33.300> faster<00:02:34.300> too<00:02:34.590> if<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.740> leave<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.070> all<00:02:36.220> in

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
and faster too if you leave it all in

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.780 
and faster too if you leave it all in
sport<00:02:36.970> mode<00:02:37.140> then<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.290> get<00:02:38.470> stiff<00:02:39.040> dampers

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
sport mode then you get stiff dampers

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.380 
sport mode then you get stiff dampers
and<00:02:40.290> perfect<00:02:41.290> on<00:02:41.500> track<00:02:41.950> performance<00:02:42.700> there

engineering heft of those cars gets

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.580 
engineering heft of those cars gets
revealed<00:04:31.880> yeah<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.540> amazes<00:04:33.050> me<00:04:33.080> as<00:04:33.290> well<00:04:33.440> and

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
revealed yeah it amazes me as well and

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.380 
revealed yeah it amazes me as well and
you<00:04:33.650> know<00:04:33.680> what<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:34.040> KN<00:04:34.370> was<00:04:34.700> two<00:04:34.940> seconds

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
you know what that KN was two seconds

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.380 
you know what that KN was two seconds
and<00:04:35.510> lap<00:04:35.690> quicker<00:04:36.080> than<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.770> Vauxhall<00:04:37.220> vxr8<00:04:37.460> it

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390
