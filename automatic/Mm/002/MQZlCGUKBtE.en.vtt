00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.800
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.009
 new comments on the channel of 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.279
 imperial exchanges and yes today it is 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:32.670
 so far today you see the first about 24 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:35.830
 Gameplay It is he plays with the HB3 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.019
 on the map retreat you can see 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.780
 In any case, not as often as it is 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.030
 Directly a nuclear gameplay for you 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.140
 we want you as soon as possible 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 bring gameplays and I can too 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.860
 ever betray so much if the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.930
 standard of a nuclear gameplay you 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.769
 not high enough we already have 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.720
 some dna baums will play and it will 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.360
 in the near future anyway 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.150
 come some and yes shortly to this 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.729
 Gameplay was also a double 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.970
 nuclear feather time values only 15 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.310
 the jersey and then a 35 or something 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.070
 and definitely short street has 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.899
 bombarded with drones and bombed 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.729
 The paladin of the paladin is quite beautiful 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.979
 gone and there accordingly 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.689
 he could make the nuclear important 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.250
 if he has the double unclear who 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.750
 The lady luckner has made but me 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.340
 I'm definitely proud of myself 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.979
 the first gameplay here on the iaa 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.380
 left clan may comment because 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.990
 which is a nuclear 21 warfare 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.329
 is definitely cool the game 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.710
 can you have your opinion on the game in 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.570
 to write the comments 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.149
 So I thought about it for now 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.909
 Comment by advanced whether he if I am 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.509
 such a few pro and contra things 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.090
 So tell me about the game 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.569
 First of all very positive first 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.479
 graphic then negatively a negative aspect 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:59.049
 is for me that is too much for me 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.520
 that's what ghost remembers the weapons 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.590
 they just look the same 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.709
 shoot just as well and completely honestly 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.420
 from the maps and so on and so on 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.100
 running around it reminds me already 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.780
 very ghost so if it is not there 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.200
 these 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.880
 sams really do give you mega fun 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.440
 that make the game very fast 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.420
 but also some things with it 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.400
 Of course , the rest is funny in black 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.040
 For example, you could do ops 2 like that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.170
 sports isi hold yes but here is 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.000
 Of course that's where he can do that 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.010
 just jump up and jump 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.850
 on the house and as we probably do 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.950
 everyone has noticed that 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.709
 This simple game extremely difficult to 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.440
 do not know how it is designed 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.790
 that it can be that hard but it is 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.650
 just extremely difficult 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.180
 pity I think that the fanciest 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.920
 I would not shoot so well 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.989
 really wanted a game again 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.489
 where this tricks neatly pure bavaria 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.160
 but it will not be like this anyway 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.050
 boring in appearance as in ghost because 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.640
 they were really me at blessed and at 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.290
 this beautiful graphic that already reminds 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.660
 again a bit of a black ops 2 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.170
 and also the class goal here with so 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.519
 the three slots and points so where see 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.530
 it really on the points 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.940
 Arrive and not on the kids if I am 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.630
 Everything was done very cool, of course 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.209
 it is a pity that you just take care of it 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.060
 kills for a drone needs eight 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.560
 kills the game is so hard yes so 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.030
 Honestly, if you have three games for the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.329
 we need drone then it would be okay 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.220
 because the game is already hard anyway 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.890
 because you're talking around here all the time 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.010
 but of course that's mega 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.470
 makes it harder I would say that was it 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.079
 with the comment of me writes down 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.970
 in any case, your opinion on call of duty 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.790
 advanced weapon in the comments is 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.470
 of course, a lot already 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.670
 early conclusion short on the way can 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.040
 you still give it to you 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.660
 the weapons you in any case you 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.630
 can play are the ak 12 the bl 27 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.790
 and the ix if you have good same or 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.260
 otherwise I would say that was that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.030
 Of course, comments from me would be cool 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.989
 if you like me one or the other 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.239
 subscribers dallas tx of course also who 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.070
 definitely cool and and i would 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.230
 say who cool if we are on this 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.000
 gameplay now has 120 likes 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.000
 create and have a nice day and
