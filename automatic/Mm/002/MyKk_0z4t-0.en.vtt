00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
I will scale the default cube so that it

I will scale the default cube so that it
has<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> same<00:00:56.460> proportions<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.570> NES

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.510 
of the cube I'm going to widen the
window<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.439> display<00:01:13.830> three<00:01:14.100> decimal

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

places<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> nudge<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> X

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.590 
places and I'm going to nudge up the X
scale<00:01:18.920> now<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.460> point<00:01:20.700> zero<00:01:20.850> three<00:01:21.390> it's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
scale now at one point zero three it's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.990 
scale now at one point zero three it's
slightly<00:01:21.840> too<00:01:22.170> wide<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.340> point<00:01:23.369> zero

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
slightly too wide and at one point zero

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.719 
slightly too wide and at one point zero
two<00:01:24.140> it's<00:01:25.140> slightly<00:01:25.500> too<00:01:25.619> narrow<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.640> I'm

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
two it's slightly too narrow so I'm

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.950 
two it's slightly too narrow so I'm
going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> third<00:01:27.479> decimal<00:01:27.689> place

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
going to go to the third decimal place

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.990 
going to go to the third decimal place
and<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:28.680> point<00:01:29.310> zero<00:01:29.579> two<00:01:29.820> five<00:01:30.710> that's<00:01:32.000> still

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and put point zero two five that's still

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.990 
and put point zero two five that's still
slightly<00:01:33.689> too<00:01:34.110> wide

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
slightly too wide

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.520 
slightly too wide
let's<00:01:36.000> try<00:01:37.130> 2002<00:01:38.130> three<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.200> that's<00:01:40.350> much

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
let's try 2002 three and that's much

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.830 
let's try 2002 three and that's much
probably<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.100> near<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:41.790> we're<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> get

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
probably as near as we're going to get

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.370 
probably as near as we're going to get
it<00:01:45.409> I'm<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.829> enter<00:01:47.100> point<00:01:47.729> five<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it I'm going to enter point five for the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.530 
it I'm going to enter point five for the
Z<00:01:49.860> scale<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.960> nudge<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.259> down

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.600 

the<00:01:57.540> actual<00:01:57.810> location<00:01:58.070> doesn't<00:01:59.070> matter<00:01:59.250> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the actual location doesn't matter is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.900 
the actual location doesn't matter is
the<00:01:59.820> ratio<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.450> scales<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:01.080> important

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
the ratio of the scales that's important

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.719 
the ratio of the scales that's important
that's<00:02:02.910> just<00:02:03.900> marginally<00:02:04.860> too<00:02:05.100> small<00:02:07.490> as<00:02:08.490> much

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that's just marginally too small as much

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.859 
that's just marginally too small as much
while<00:02:08.880> be<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.030> close<00:02:09.240> as<00:02:09.270> we're<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.690> get

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
the top view to Y scale the cube move

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.770 
the top view to Y scale the cube move
the<00:02:18.060> background<00:02:18.450> image<00:02:18.750> down<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:23.780> increase

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
the background image down and increase

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.670 
the background image down and increase
the<00:02:25.320> Y<00:02:25.470> scale<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.910> cube<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.680> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the Y scale of the cube and that is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.770 
the Y scale of the cube and that is
slightly<00:02:28.950> too<00:02:29.250> big<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.360> value<00:02:30.660> is

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
slightly too big I can see the value is

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.710 
slightly too big I can see the value is
going<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> same<00:02:31.680> as<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.400> x<00:02:32.580> value<00:02:33.060> the
