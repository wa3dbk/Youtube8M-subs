years<00:00:02.250> ago<00:00:02.520> I<00:00:02.550> had<00:00:02.790> had<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.179> idea<00:00:03.529> to<00:00:04.529> do<00:00:04.890> a

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
years ago I had had this idea to do a

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.720 
years ago I had had this idea to do a
motocross<00:00:05.450> like<00:00:06.450> event<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:07.080> snowboards<00:00:07.740> so<00:00:08.250> we

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
motocross like event on snowboards so we

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.459 
motocross like event on snowboards so we
staged<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.269> first-ever<00:00:09.630> boardercross<00:00:10.139> race

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
staged the first-ever boardercross race

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.669 
staged the first-ever boardercross race
it<00:00:11.160> had<00:00:11.340> speed<00:00:11.759> people<00:00:12.570> riding<00:00:12.960> head-to-head

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
it had speed people riding head-to-head

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.450 
it had speed people riding head-to-head
it<00:00:14.160> had<00:00:14.340> berms<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.870> had<00:00:16.049> jumps<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:17.070> thought

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
it had berms and it had jumps we thought

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.150 
it had berms and it had jumps we thought
we<00:00:17.580> would<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:17.850> SSX<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.779> then<00:00:19.439> we'd<00:00:19.619> move<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
we would do SSX and then we'd move on to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.460 
we would do SSX and then we'd move on to
creating<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.520> new<00:00:20.550> sport<00:00:21.029> experience<00:00:21.350> in<00:00:22.350> a

creating a new sport experience in a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.730 
creating a new sport experience in a
similar<00:00:22.830> vein<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.230> passion

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
similar vein it's just out of a passion

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.210 
similar vein it's just out of a passion
of<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> make<00:00:26.670> things<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.869> interesting

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
of how to make things more interesting

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.290 
of how to make things more interesting
to<00:00:29.220> create<00:00:29.910> something<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.269> fun<00:00:35.300> you're

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to create something more fun you're

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.160 
to create something more fun you're
working<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.110> base<00:00:37.320> sport<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> first<00:00:39.960> game

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
working from a base sport the first game

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.069 
working from a base sport the first game
was<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:40.920> about<00:00:41.329> really<00:00:42.329> really<00:00:42.600> dedicated

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
was really about really really dedicated

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.470 
was really about really really dedicated
people<00:00:43.230> who<00:00:43.379> had<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.160> idea<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> vision<00:00:47.480> you

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
people who had an idea how to vision you

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660 
people who had an idea how to vision you
tend<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.260> design<00:00:49.739> something<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.520> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
tend to kind of design something that is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
tend to kind of design something that is
way<00:00:51.239> beyond<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> scope<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> can

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
way beyond the scope of what you can

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.209 
way beyond the scope of what you can
actually<00:00:52.980> pull<00:00:53.309> off<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.670> first<00:00:53.879> versions

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
actually pull off in the first versions

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.920 
actually pull off in the first versions
now<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.270> take<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> fruits<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.840> our

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
now we get to to take the fruits of our

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.020 
now we get to to take the fruits of our
labor<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.289> say<00:00:58.530> okay<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.520> got<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> core

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
labor and say okay we got the core

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
labor and say okay we got the core
experience<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:00.930> let's<00:01:00.960> let's<00:01:01.530> build

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
experience down now let's let's build

large<00:01:43.479> enough<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:43.840> sometimes<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.590> don't

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
large enough that sometimes you don't

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.859 
large enough that sometimes you don't
get<00:01:44.860> enough<00:01:45.130> cross<00:01:45.820> exposure<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.479> what<00:01:46.659> other

it's a really good opportunity for a lot
of<00:01:50.350> people<00:01:50.619> to<00:01:50.710> turn<00:01:50.890> around<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:52.750> what

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
of people to turn around and see what

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.270 
of people to turn around and see what
some<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.110> other<00:01:53.170> groups<00:01:53.409> are<00:01:53.649> getting

some of the other groups are getting

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.910 
some of the other groups are getting
into<00:01:54.580> on<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.299> surface<00:01:55.750> if<00:01:56.049> we<00:01:56.409> succeed<00:01:56.799> it

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
into on the surface if we succeed it

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.370 
into on the surface if we succeed it
looks<00:01:57.100> simple<00:01:57.490> but<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:58.180> truth<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:59.020> know<00:01:59.140> we

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
looks simple but in truth you know we

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.100 
looks simple but in truth you know we
have<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.710> first<00:01:59.920> create<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.399> world<00:02:00.929> which<00:02:01.929> is

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
have to first create the world which is

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.590 
have to first create the world which is
an<00:02:02.649> incredible<00:02:03.130> opportunity<00:02:03.330> but<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.450> also

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
an incredible opportunity but it also

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.510 
an incredible opportunity but it also
sometimes<00:02:05.110> we<00:02:05.289> come<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.710> daunting

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
sometimes we come to a daunting

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.169 
sometimes we come to a daunting
responsibility<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.920> normal<00:02:09.280> tendency<00:02:09.489> is<00:02:09.970> to

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
responsibility my normal tendency is to

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.729 
responsibility my normal tendency is to
leave<00:02:10.330> things<00:02:10.600> as<00:02:10.750> they<00:02:10.780> are<00:02:11.080> they're<00:02:11.410> working

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
leave things as they are they're working
