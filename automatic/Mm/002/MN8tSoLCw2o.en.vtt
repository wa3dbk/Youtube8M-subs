00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.369
 high point on your clear son ignores the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.969

 Here O're seeing here it is loose're 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.550
 your needle inside the chain 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.530
 What are you going to work on and pull yours? 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.660
 point I pulled here on top of the little girl 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.100
 makes your normal high point that you already did 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.530
 first high point 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.349
 Look how the two films that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.590
 are following the length is 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.200
 In the end, look clear, I'll go there. 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.950
 I'll post because I'm using the dot 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 high 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.989
 inside the chain not 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.050
 where does the needle walk 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.730
 notice the two loose wires look here 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.400
 is over the needle or is it up 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.349
 the needle here they are here they have 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.290
 that it's okay the moment you pass 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.360
 the needle by the chain, check if the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.440
 you're leaving in the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.299
 fulfillment of your work, you are 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.480
 positioning above the needle above the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:06.079
 needle on the other side pulls the needle 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.780
 your son out and O make your point 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.500
 normally high 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.340
 look here already have two O again there 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.840
 know 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.420
 the filter here also the wires that are 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.030
 accompanying then goes through 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.040
 and repairs if they remain 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.379
 on the needle or is above it and pulls 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.480
 sardine out and repair 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.880
 now that you're going to pull found to 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.489
 close looks where the two children are 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.850
 they are within that launch that you 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.069
 It's okay, I know, they'll stay there. 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.370
 here in here want to see change them here 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.000
 Look them in the thrown now you 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.209
 pass a little needle and close your stitch 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.590
 But I want to go back to work with 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:58.669
 that I was okay to loose the light wire 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.680
 I say take the wire and the darkness I 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.319
 here I am wearing dark puts the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.269
 flow will use more following length 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:10.910
 and adjust your finger if you want to use them 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:14.720
 passes through the next pull thrown to 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.989
 off and makes the high point usually looks 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.500
 here I came back to him again the XEi 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.919
 made a chain I found for 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.830
 make the high point tone closing tac 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.580
 Look here, I put three dots of 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.130
 other color 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.979
 The sequence of work, I go to the 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.229
 I'll be right back, I'll come back to show you, just look. 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.540
 I did here then O's being 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.250
 I joked with the colors 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.320
 I have a complete carreirinha of a 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.030
 color and in the second I would fall I 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.660
 I have a little fun, just one 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.480
 a little 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.030
 so I made the color dark and of course color 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.800
 dark color and clear eyes of the children here 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.230
 Are you lying to me so that you can 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.590
 to see the color that I finished is what is 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.720
 which roast and the film stand the color 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.510
 that I let pass home that has already 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.470
 switch is down 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.800
 between the dots you see here 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.370
 It's easy so now you know how to send 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.370
 bullet, it's good
