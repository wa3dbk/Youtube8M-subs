reboot<00:03:33.319> your<00:03:33.379> device<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.889> mean<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.129> is<00:03:34.280> a

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
reboot your device I mean this is a

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.759 
reboot your device I mean this is a
really<00:03:34.699> good<00:03:35.030> program<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.720> recommend<00:03:36.500> using

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
really good program I recommend using

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.069 
really good program I recommend using
this<00:03:37.099> really<00:03:37.609> I<00:03:37.639> mean<00:03:38.000> even<00:03:38.269> if<00:03:38.359> you<00:03:38.449> do<00:03:38.689> use

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
this really I mean even if you do use

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.960 
this really I mean even if you do use
iTunes<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.829> would<00:03:40.069> use<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:40.489> because<00:03:40.759> I<00:03:40.790> mean

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
iTunes I would use this because I mean

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.240 
iTunes I would use this because I mean
this<00:03:41.150> just<00:03:41.299> makes<00:03:41.419> it<00:03:41.750> ten<00:03:42.019> times<00:03:42.290> easier<00:03:42.500> it's

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
this just makes it ten times easier it's

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.640 
this just makes it ten times easier it's
a<00:03:43.400> lot<00:03:43.639> quicker<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.239> my<00:03:44.419> opinion<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.079> you<00:03:45.530> know

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
a lot quicker in my opinion and you know

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.890 
a lot quicker in my opinion and you know
it's<00:03:46.370> whatever<00:03:46.639> it's<00:03:47.180> just<00:03:47.449> whatever<00:03:47.689> you
