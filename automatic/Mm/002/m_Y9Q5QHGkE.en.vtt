little<00:01:59.340> bit<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.880> well<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.710> it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
little bit here as well so it's a it's a

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
little bit here as well so it's a it's a
pretty<00:02:02.340> good<00:02:02.579> plan<00:02:02.820> right<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.659> course

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
pretty good plan right there of course

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.429 
pretty good plan right there of course
leaving<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.649> wide<00:02:04.979> open<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> zerg<00:02:05.820> attack

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
leaving this wide open to a zerg attack

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.990 
leaving this wide open to a zerg attack
not<00:02:07.439> sure<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.890> might<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.369> best<00:02:08.489> move

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
not sure if that might be the best move

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.510 
not sure if that might be the best move
but<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.270> course<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.780> korea<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:11.250> are

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
but of course this is korea so they are

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.430 
but of course this is korea so they are

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.130 
fruitdealer just getting a nice little
bit<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:28.910> vision<00:03:29.209> seeing<00:03:29.510> what<00:03:29.660> was<00:03:29.750> going<00:03:29.900> on

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
bit of vision seeing what was going on

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.690 
bit of vision seeing what was going on
seeing<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.739> command<00:03:31.190> center<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:31.580> we'll

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
seeing that command center so we'll

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.460 
seeing that command center so we'll
probably<00:03:31.910> see<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.330> move<00:03:32.570> over<00:03:32.870> soon<00:03:33.200> enough

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
probably see this move over soon enough

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.020 
probably see this move over soon enough
probably<00:03:34.040> see<00:03:34.160> an<00:03:34.220> orbital<00:03:34.520> command<00:03:34.760> being

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
probably see an orbital command being

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.820 
probably see an orbital command being
build<00:03:35.330> up<00:03:36.070> from<00:03:37.070> him<00:03:38.080> maybe<00:03:39.080> yeah<00:03:39.470> there<00:03:39.709> we<00:03:39.800> go

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
build up from him maybe yeah there we go

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.199 
build up from him maybe yeah there we go
overall<00:03:40.250> command<00:03:40.489> now<00:03:40.640> being<00:03:40.850> filled<00:03:41.060> up

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209

going<00:03:41.540> for<00:03:41.720> another<00:03:41.840> rack<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:42.410> we're<00:03:42.500> already

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
going for another rack so we're already

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.640 
going for another rack so we're already
at<00:03:42.769> three<00:03:43.040> racks<00:03:43.390> for<00:03:44.390> hope<00:03:44.750> torture<00:03:45.230> it's

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
at three racks for hope torture it's

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.440 
at three racks for hope torture it's
going<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.830> start<00:03:46.010> pushing<00:03:46.370> out<00:03:46.519> with<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:47.060> bunch

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
going to start pushing out with a bunch

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.479 
going to start pushing out with a bunch
of<00:03:47.600> Marines<00:03:47.900> or<00:03:48.410> maybe<00:03:48.739> yeah<00:03:49.100> we<00:03:49.310> get<00:03:49.430> this

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
of Marines or maybe yeah we get this

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.729 
of Marines or maybe yeah we get this
reactor<00:03:50.030> on<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.330> one<00:03:50.540> tech<00:03:51.110> lab<00:03:51.320> going<00:03:51.530> for

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
reactor on this one tech lab going for

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.100 
reactor on this one tech lab going for
the<00:03:51.800> stim<00:03:52.040> pack<00:03:52.070> on<00:03:52.489> those<00:03:52.670> Marines<00:03:53.060> might<00:03:53.780> see

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
the stim pack on those Marines might see

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.500 
the stim pack on those Marines might see
some<00:03:54.410> rotters<00:03:54.830> coming<00:03:55.130> out<00:03:55.280> soon<00:03:55.550> enough<00:03:55.670> with

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
some rotters coming out soon enough with

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.630 
some rotters coming out soon enough with
that<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.930> metabolic<00:03:57.380> boost<00:03:57.560> coming<00:03:57.950> out<00:03:58.100> for

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
that the metabolic boost coming out for

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.479 
that the metabolic boost coming out for
fruitdealer<00:03:59.510> as<00:03:59.810> well<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.680> we're<00:04:00.890> a<00:04:00.920> little

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
fruitdealer as well so we're a little

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.130 
fruitdealer as well so we're a little
over<00:04:01.790> halfway<00:04:01.970> there<00:04:02.209> going<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.720> be<00:04:02.810> coming<00:04:03.080> up

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
over halfway there going to be coming up

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.270 
over halfway there going to be coming up
rarely<00:04:03.680> soon<00:04:04.239> it<00:04:05.239> looks<00:04:05.540> like<00:04:05.890> hope<00:04:06.890> torture

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
rarely soon it looks like hope torture

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.650 
rarely soon it looks like hope torture
just<00:04:07.459> coming<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.850> here<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.060> getting<00:04:08.510> ready

what's being billed up just sees that

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.880 
what's being billed up just sees that
one<00:04:13.040> spawning<00:04:13.400> pool<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:14.060> course<00:04:14.239> no<00:04:14.890> units

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
one spawning pool of course no units

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.170 
one spawning pool of course no units
really<00:04:16.160> being<00:04:16.310> built<00:04:16.640> here<00:04:16.700> we<00:04:16.940> do<00:04:17.030> have<00:04:17.150> a

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
really being built here we do have a

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.120 
really being built here we do have a
family<00:04:17.660> mess<00:04:17.870> coming<00:04:18.140> in<00:04:18.470> looks<00:04:18.739> like<00:04:18.890> yeah

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
family mess coming in looks like yeah

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.979 
family mess coming in looks like yeah
it's<00:04:19.310> only<00:04:19.430> out<00:04:19.640> expansion<00:04:20.269> pretty<00:04:20.840> well

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
it's only out expansion pretty well

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.330 
it's only out expansion pretty well
hidden<00:04:21.229> from<00:04:21.850> hope<00:04:22.850> torture<00:04:23.240> right<00:04:23.479> now

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
hidden from hope torture right now

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.400 
hidden from hope torture right now
so<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.090> outcomes<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.630> zerglings<00:04:25.930> certainly

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
so the outcomes of zerglings certainly

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.960 
so the outcomes of zerglings certainly
starting<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.830> push<00:04:27.070> up<00:04:27.280> through<00:04:27.520> look<00:04:27.730> at<00:04:27.820> that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
starting to push up through look at that

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.030 
starting to push up through look at that
metabolic<00:04:28.660> boost<00:04:29.020> almost<00:04:29.500> ready<00:04:29.740> we're<00:04:29.919> going

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
metabolic boost almost ready we're going

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.100 
metabolic boost almost ready we're going
to<00:04:30.130> start<00:04:30.280> seeing<00:04:30.610> these<00:04:30.730> guys<00:04:31.000> speed<00:04:31.510> up<00:04:31.690> soon
