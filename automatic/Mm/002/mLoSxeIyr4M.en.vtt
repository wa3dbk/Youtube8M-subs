here<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.800> 6<00:00:25.800> BD<00:00:26.250> 20s<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:27.900> DCC<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.410> running

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
here I have 6 BD 20s the DCC is running

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.939 
here I have 6 BD 20s the DCC is running
through<00:00:29.160> each<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> BD<00:00:30.150> 20s<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.949> I'm

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
through each of the BD 20s and I'm

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.420 
through each of the BD 20s and I'm
taking<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.660> negative<00:00:33.660> voltage<00:00:34.380> output<00:00:35.160> from

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
taking the negative voltage output from

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.229 
taking the negative voltage output from
the<00:00:35.640> BD<00:00:36.630> 20<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.610> sending<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.790> over<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
the BD 20 and sending that over to a

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.369 
the BD 20 and sending that over to a
series<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.530> relays<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.920> diodes<00:00:45.050> which<00:00:46.050> will

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
series of relays and diodes which will

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.020 
series of relays and diodes which will
convert<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.370> negative<00:00:48.149> signal<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
convert the negative signal to a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.430 
convert the negative signal to a
positive<00:00:51.030> output<00:00:52.760> to<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.000> red<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.750> green

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
positive output to the red and green

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
positive output to the red and green
LEDs<00:00:57.079> now<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.320> LEDs<00:00:58.649> make<00:00:59.070> yellow<00:00:59.640> if<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.629> both

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
LEDs now my LEDs make yellow if the both

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.390 
LEDs now my LEDs make yellow if the both
the<00:01:01.170> red<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.739> green<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:03.229> signal<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:04.680> have

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the red and green are signal or have

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.420 
the red and green are signal or have
voltage<00:01:05.790> applied<00:01:06.060> at<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> same<00:01:06.570> time<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:08.040> now

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
voltage applied at the same time so now

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.190 
voltage applied at the same time so now
I<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:09.500> demonstrate<00:01:10.500> how<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.159> works<00:01:11.930> again<00:01:12.930> on

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I will demonstrate how it works again on

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
I will demonstrate how it works again on
this<00:01:13.350> board<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.729> six<00:01:15.150> zones<00:01:15.689> set<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.820> there

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this board I have six zones set up there

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.990 
this board I have six zones set up there
only<00:01:18.060> about<00:01:18.439> 8<00:01:19.439> inches<00:01:19.740> long<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.580> each<00:01:20.640> zone

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
only about 8 inches long for each zone

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.499 
only about 8 inches long for each zone
and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.070> last<00:01:23.820> signal<00:01:24.299> right

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and you can see the last signal right

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.480 
and you can see the last signal right
now<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.020> red<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.270> occupied<00:01:27.270> by<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.259> engine

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
now is red it is occupied by the engine

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
now is red it is occupied by the engine
and<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.000> zone<00:01:30.299> before<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.310> signaled<00:01:32.310> as

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and the zone before is signaled as

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.219 
and the zone before is signaled as
yellow<00:01:33.200> ok<00:01:34.200> now<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.979> will<00:01:35.909> increase<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.840> speed

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
yellow ok now I will increase the speed

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.499 
yellow ok now I will increase the speed
and<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:39.600> zone<00:01:39.869> goes<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.380> red<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.220> one

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
and that zone goes to red and the one

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.620 
and that zone goes to red and the one
before<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.780> goes<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.350> yellow<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:45.329> clears

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
before that goes to yellow as it clears

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.510 
before that goes to yellow as it clears
the<00:01:45.840> last<00:01:46.049> zone<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.619> goes<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.040> green

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.749 

I<00:01:51.579> don't<00:01:52.149> know<00:01:52.240> if<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.390> can<00:01:52.539> hear<00:01:52.719> the<00:01:52.840> relays

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
I don't know if you can hear the relays

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:06.000 
I don't know if you can hear the relays
clicking<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:03.070> that's<00:02:03.310> it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.660 

and<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.910> same<00:02:07.120> things<00:02:07.390> happening<00:02:07.840> in<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and the same things happening in the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.770 
and the same things happening in the
signals<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.700> are<00:02:09.790> facing<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.390> opposite

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
signals that are facing the opposite

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.290 
signals that are facing the opposite
direction<00:02:10.840> they<00:02:11.470> are<00:02:11.530> also<00:02:12.000> changing<00:02:13.000> from

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
direction they are also changing from

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.030 
direction they are also changing from
red<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.630> yellow<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.920> green<00:02:15.310> as<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:17.040> engine

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
red to yellow to green as the engine

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.900 
red to yellow to green as the engine
clears<00:02:18.480> those<00:02:19.480> zones
