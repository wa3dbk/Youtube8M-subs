00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
a kite but it's slightly in angle C so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.140 
a kite but it's slightly in angle C so
is<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.869> not<00:02:09.050> straight<00:02:09.380> anymore<00:02:09.880> you're<00:02:10.880> in

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
is you not straight anymore you're in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.449 
is you not straight anymore you're in
angle<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.660> spread<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.709> that's<00:02:13.130> when<00:02:13.310> you've

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
angle to spread and that's when you've

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
to do the movement so all the time you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.150 
to do the movement so all the time you
know<00:02:19.849> that<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.599> where<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:20.810> would<00:02:21.160> that's

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
know that this is where I would that's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.430 
know that this is where I would that's
how<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:23.150> doing<00:02:23.450> who<00:02:23.540> did<00:02:23.750> attack<00:02:24.050> from<00:02:24.260> that

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
that's the chance though I'd love to use

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.630 
that's the chance though I'd love to use
that<00:02:26.480> time<00:02:26.870> movement<00:02:27.200> yeah<00:02:27.620> that's<00:02:28.130> one<00:02:28.400> way

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
that time movement yeah that's one way

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.440 
that time movement yeah that's one way
to<00:02:28.670> break<00:02:28.910> him

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
that's an idea breaking cool so this is

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.780 
that's an idea breaking cool so this is
why<00:02:38.959> on<00:02:39.140> attacks<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.650> are<00:02:39.799> learning<00:02:40.069> how<00:02:40.430> to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
why on attacks you are learning how to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.420 
why on attacks you are learning how to
break<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.569> line<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.440> quite<00:02:42.799> difficult<00:02:43.069> it's

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
break the line is quite difficult it's

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.759 
break the line is quite difficult it's
not<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.610> simple<00:02:44.180> you've<00:02:44.840> got<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.170> identify<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
not a simple you've got to identify the

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.229 
not a simple you've got to identify the
wrist<00:02:46.130> where<00:02:46.400> they<00:02:46.549> are<00:02:46.700> if<00:02:46.880> they're<00:02:47.060> too

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
wrist where they are if they're too

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.449 
wrist where they are if they're too
straight<00:02:47.599> your<00:02:48.140> foster<00:02:48.470> fist<00:02:48.799> into<00:02:48.950> straight

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
straight your foster fist into straight

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.550 
straight your foster fist into straight
it<00:02:49.819> won't<00:02:50.060> be<00:02:50.209> able<00:02:50.360> like<00:02:50.599> lock<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:50.989> like<00:02:51.140> look

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
it won't be able like lock you like look

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.550 
it won't be able like lock you like look
you<00:02:52.190> got<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.459> lens<00:02:52.970> em<00:02:53.209> slide<00:02:53.660> in<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.019> angle

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
you got the lens em slide in that angle

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.740 
you got the lens em slide in that angle
so<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:55.310> offline<00:02:55.790> too<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.120> hidden<00:02:56.360> offline

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
so it's offline too and hidden offline

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.199 
so it's offline too and hidden offline
