00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.419 
short and simple mod it's really I think
it<00:00:27.720> does<00:00:27.900> add<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.470> better<00:00:28.680> life<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.099> game<00:00:29.279> in

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429

mod<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:06.170> there's<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.650> block<00:04:06.890> called<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.550> and<00:04:08.440> let

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
mod is there's a block called a and let

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.570 
mod is there's a block called a and let
me<00:04:09.500> just<00:04:09.650> get<00:04:09.740> some<00:04:09.920> of<00:04:09.950> them<00:04:10.100> nominal<00:04:10.460> should

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
me just get some of them nominal should

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.830 
me just get some of them nominal should
be<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:10.790> properties<00:04:11.320> here<00:04:12.320> they<00:04:12.440> are<00:04:12.590> here

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
be the properties here they are here

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.920 
be the properties here they are here
there<00:04:14.840> are<00:04:15.110> blocks<00:04:15.350> of<00:04:15.560> speed<00:04:15.800> up<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:17.690> I

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
there are blocks of speed up you so I

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.300 
there are blocks of speed up you so I
don't<00:04:18.200> think<00:04:18.350> without<00:04:18.470> way<00:04:18.709> anything<00:04:19.130> about

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
don't think without way anything about

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.800 
don't think without way anything about
wave<00:04:19.520> I<00:04:19.670> won't<00:04:19.850> think<00:04:19.910> about<00:04:20.030> way<00:04:20.300> to<00:04:20.360> get<00:04:20.690> my

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
wave I won't think about way to get my

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.350 
wave I won't think about way to get my
way<00:04:20.989> I'm<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.650> little<00:04:21.860> uh<00:04:22.030> system<00:04:23.030> here<00:04:23.240> where

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
way I'm it a little uh system here where

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.080 
way I'm it a little uh system here where
if<00:04:23.570> I<00:04:23.720> go<00:04:23.990> down<00:04:24.200> here<00:04:24.230> out<00:04:24.680> I'll<00:04:25.670> show<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:25.940> and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
if I go down here out I'll show you and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.440 
if I go down here out I'll show you and
I<00:04:26.200> here<00:04:27.200> go<00:04:28.690> there<00:04:29.690> are<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.410> was<00:04:30.560> super<00:04:30.830> fast<00:04:31.450> so

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
I here go there are it was super fast so

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.730 
I here go there are it was super fast so
it's<00:04:32.750> great<00:04:32.990> for<00:04:33.020> transported<00:04:33.650> long

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
it's great for transported long

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.500 
it's great for transported long
distances<00:04:34.270> again<00:04:35.270> even<00:04:35.690> oh<00:04:35.840> there's<00:04:36.230> magma

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
distances again even oh there's magma

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.460 
distances again even oh there's magma
its<00:04:38.510> magma<00:04:38.960> because<00:04:39.230> it's<00:04:39.410> above<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.680> surface

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
its magma because it's above the surface

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.930 
its magma because it's above the surface
but<00:04:42.470> yeah<00:04:42.650> if<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:43.310> want<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.550> travel<00:04:43.700> long

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
but yeah if you want to travel long

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.110 
but yeah if you want to travel long
distances<00:04:44.530> this<00:04:45.530> is<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.770> thing<00:04:45.950> for<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:49.120> I'm

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
distances this is the thing for you I'm

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.400 
distances this is the thing for you I'm
sure<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.390> can<00:04:50.510> probably<00:04:50.720> keep<00:04:50.930> going<00:04:51.230> for<00:04:51.380> a

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
sure you can probably keep going for a

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.410 
sure you can probably keep going for a
while<00:04:51.590> um<00:04:51.860> there's<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.460> couple<00:04:52.580> more<00:04:53.060> things<00:04:53.270> I

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
while um there's a couple more things I

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.970 
while um there's a couple more things I
want<00:04:53.450> to<00:04:53.630> show<00:04:53.750> before<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.080> end<00:04:54.290> this<00:04:54.380> video<00:04:54.620> and

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
want to show before I end this video and

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.890 
want to show before I end this video and
I<00:04:55.490> will<00:04:55.670> give<00:04:55.820> them<00:04:55.940> right<00:04:56.150> now<00:04:56.300> in<00:04:56.480> their<00:04:56.660> back

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
I will give them right now in their back

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.950 
I will give them right now in their back
so<00:04:57.770> with<00:04:57.920> this<00:04:58.070> game<00:04:58.280> come<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:59.390> new<00:04:59.570> sets<00:04:59.840> of

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
so with this game come to new sets of

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.670 
so with this game come to new sets of
tools

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
tools

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.240 
tools
one<00:05:01.370> is<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.790> obsidian<00:05:02.270> -<00:05:02.480> it<00:05:02.990> actually<00:05:03.920> lasts

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
one is the obsidian - it actually lasts

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.000 
one is the obsidian - it actually lasts
longer<00:05:04.730> than<00:05:04.760> diamond<00:05:05.450> but<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.290> problem<00:05:06.800> is

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
longer than diamond but the problem is

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.400 
longer than diamond but the problem is
not<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.520> breaks<00:05:07.880> at<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.330> speed<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.960> gold<00:05:09.170> and

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
not it breaks at the speed of gold and

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.500 
not it breaks at the speed of gold and
someone<00:05:12.410> told<00:05:12.590> me<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:12.890> gold<00:05:13.580> breaks<00:05:14.000> faster

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
someone told me that gold breaks faster

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.690 
someone told me that gold breaks faster
than<00:05:14.690> any<00:05:14.870> other<00:05:15.080> block<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:16.010> I'm<00:05:16.340> pretty<00:05:16.550> sure

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
than any other block and I'm pretty sure

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.880 
than any other block and I'm pretty sure
that's<00:05:16.850> true<00:05:17.150> but<00:05:17.480> I'm<00:05:17.600> not<00:05:17.630> sure<00:05:17.960> um<00:05:18.410> so<00:05:18.740> let

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
that's true but I'm not sure um so let

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.090 
that's true but I'm not sure um so let
me<00:05:18.950> just<00:05:19.100> put<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.340> little<00:05:19.520> tester<00:05:20.270> into<00:05:20.420> this

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
me just put a little tester into this

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.190 
me just put a little tester into this
okay<00:05:22.100> here<00:05:22.250> I<00:05:22.310> have<00:05:22.490> two<00:05:22.850> blocks<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.450> diamond

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
okay here I have two blocks of diamond

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.680 
okay here I have two blocks of diamond
ore<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.430> don't<00:05:25.640> see<00:05:25.730> what<00:05:25.940> one<00:05:26.090> is<00:05:26.210> faster

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
ore and I don't see what one is faster

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.890 
ore and I don't see what one is faster
so<00:05:26.840> first<00:05:27.140> I<00:05:27.410> will<00:05:27.590> use<00:05:28.120> pickaxe<00:05:29.560> Citian<00:05:31.900> nice

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
so first I will use pickaxe Citian nice

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.560 
so first I will use pickaxe Citian nice
now<00:05:33.560> I'll<00:05:33.650> use<00:05:33.710> this<00:05:34.030> yeah<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.060> think<00:05:35.180> the

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
now I'll use this yeah I think the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.600 
now I'll use this yeah I think the
diamond<00:05:35.900> will<00:05:36.050> mains<00:05:36.260> a<00:05:36.380> bit<00:05:36.500> faster<00:05:37.010> but

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
diamond will mains a bit faster but

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.280 
diamond will mains a bit faster but
apparently<00:05:38.000> they've<00:05:38.240> seen<00:05:38.450> one<00:05:38.720> will<00:05:38.840> last<00:05:39.080> a

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
apparently they've seen one will last a

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.680 
apparently they've seen one will last a
lot<00:05:39.410> longer<00:05:39.470> than<00:05:39.800> that<00:05:39.980> so<00:05:40.310> again<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.450> city

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
lot longer than that so again the city

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.910 
lot longer than that so again the city
and<00:05:41.840> that's<00:05:41.930> basically<00:05:42.260> just<00:05:42.380> a<00:05:42.680> mixture

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
and that's basically just a mixture

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.040 
and that's basically just a mixture
between<00:05:43.100> Dimond<00:05:43.910> and<00:05:44.060> gold<00:05:44.390> in<00:05:44.720> terms<00:05:44.930> of<00:05:44.990> the

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
between Dimond and gold in terms of the

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.380 
between Dimond and gold in terms of the
length<00:05:45.260> and<00:05:45.950> then<00:05:46.190> extended<00:05:46.670> twos<00:05:46.910> I<00:05:47.180> will

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
length and then extended twos I will

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.580 
length and then extended twos I will
show<00:05:47.600> you<00:05:47.840> are<00:05:49.090> dark<00:05:50.090> stone<00:05:50.390> tools<00:05:50.720> and<00:05:50.990> these

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
show you are dark stone tools and these

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.410 
show you are dark stone tools and these
are<00:05:51.770> made<00:05:51.890> out<00:05:52.040> of<00:05:52.130> a<00:05:52.310> special<00:05:52.430> toast<00:05:52.880> a

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
are made out of a special toast a

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.200 
are made out of a special toast a
special<00:05:53.990> stone<00:05:54.200> called<00:05:54.560> dark<00:05:54.950> stone<00:05:55.220> which<00:05:56.060> i

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
special stone called dark stone which i

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.020 
special stone called dark stone which i
think<00:05:56.270> is<00:05:56.480> this<00:05:56.690> one

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
think is this one
