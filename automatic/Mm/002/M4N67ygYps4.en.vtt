00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello girls I think it's already 20th in the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.660
 attempt to hurt 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.190
 Okay, I'll show you how I'm going 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.139
 cut my hair 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.260
 my hair has a transitional phase 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.109
 How do you know the certificate at least? 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.910
 then also the Lulism Rock 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.519
 many will tell us why you do not 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.990
 cut but I because it is very difficult 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.369
 people like you can see a church 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.420
 also fulfilled and take that in a 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.160
 transition goes away but it can give a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.200
 So I'd rather leave one. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360
 A little so I intend to do mine. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.790
 October 29, which is 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.040
 The day of my birthday I'm going to give myself 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.170
 this gift with many monthly 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.450
 before deciding a large cut that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.250
 Let's make one last cut, that's it. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.489
 What am I going to do now, no way? 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 to give a balloon over a life because 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.340
 it is very lifeless so much shows and a lot 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:06.570
 luxury is here in front he's upright is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.040
 even seeing it is right and bringing it also 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.990
 It's just that here it is a little bit 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.369
 bigger 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.290
 ks two things that made back 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.259
 it is also in logical transition 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.570
 hairy but you can give a disguise 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.340
 already in front has worked hard to 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.350
 people, it's very important that you use a 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.540
 professional scissors, I'm going to use this 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:38.060
 It's good, it 's a pair of scissors. 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.060
 Hair is fine, not a pair of scissors 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:23.060
 and another at 234 ok I go on that mesh screen 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.060
 under 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.000
 you also lift hair so should 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.000
 bring here so platt 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.459
 and there it stayed 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.900
 now let's see the most important part 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.900
 I want it up ahead 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:08.900
 here I do a little different 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.900
 pay attention here
