a1 decoy just like to introduce you to
our<00:00:05.400> new<00:00:05.819> range<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.180> lamps<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.779> we<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:07.020> here

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
our new range of lamps that we have here

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.370 
our new range of lamps that we have here
all<00:00:08.130> slightly<00:00:09.000> very<00:00:09.210> slightly<00:00:09.269> different<00:00:10.139> so

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
all slightly very slightly different so

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.140 
all slightly very slightly different so
we<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.650> go<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:11.040> each<00:00:11.099> one<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.460> turn<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.969> just

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
we can go for each one in turn and just

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.030 
we can go for each one in turn and just
give<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.230> little<00:00:13.469> idea<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.769> what's

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
give you a little idea of what's

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.960 
give you a little idea of what's
available<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.179> marketplace<00:00:16.730> ok<00:00:17.730> right

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
available on the marketplace ok right

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.900 
available on the marketplace ok right
starting<00:00:18.330> at<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.480> end<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> handheld

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
starting at this end we have a handheld

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.609 
starting at this end we have a handheld
lamp<00:00:22.400> basic<00:00:23.400> 55<00:00:24.269> watts<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> hundred<00:00:25.289> watts

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
lamp basic 55 watts or a hundred watts

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.509 
lamp basic 55 watts or a hundred watts
so<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:26.369> between<00:00:26.670> 300<00:00:27.800> 450<00:00:28.800> yard<00:00:29.279> range

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
so you get between 300 450 yard range

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.720 
so you get between 300 450 yard range
with<00:00:29.820> 100<00:00:30.179> watt<00:00:30.330> ok<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.309> filters

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
with 100 watt ok we do have filters

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.290 
with 100 watt ok we do have filters
available<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.360> these<00:00:34.010> niggaz<00:00:35.030> snap-on<00:00:36.030> red

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
available for these niggaz snap-on red

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.920 
available for these niggaz snap-on red
filter<00:00:38.059> very<00:00:39.059> easy<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.480> attach<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.480> take<00:00:42.719> off

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
filter very easy to attach and take off

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.670 
filter very easy to attach and take off
no<00:00:43.200> policy<00:00:43.680> ok<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:45.930> our<00:00:46.079> basic<00:00:46.289> size

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
no policy ok so that's our basic size

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.970 
no policy ok so that's our basic size
that's<00:00:46.920> 150<00:00:47.789> millimeter<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:49.500> move<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that's 150 millimeter we move up to a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.400 
that's 150 millimeter we move up to a
slightly<00:00:50.219> larger<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:51.230> 175<00:00:52.230> millimeter

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
slightly larger one here 175 millimeter

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.990 
slightly larger one here 175 millimeter
there<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.800> slightly<00:00:56.309> larger<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:57.300> more

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
there you go slightly larger get more

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.490 
there you go slightly larger get more
red<00:01:00.000> filter<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.809> get<00:01:00.870> more<00:01:01.079> power<00:01:01.379> out

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
red filter here you get more power out

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
red filter here you get more power out
of<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.850> does<00:01:03.210> reflect<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> light

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
of this really it does reflect the light

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
of this really it does reflect the light
better<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.309> slightly<00:01:05.760> greater<00:01:06.060> range

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
better so you get slightly greater range

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
better so you get slightly greater range
with<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> 500<00:01:07.860> yards<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
with it you get out to 500 yards of that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.139 
with it you get out to 500 yards of that
one<00:01:08.790> we<00:01:10.040> do<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> battery<00:01:11.460> packs<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.939> them

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
one we do the battery packs for them

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.200 
one we do the battery packs for them
I'll<00:01:13.600> come<00:01:13.810> on<00:01:13.929> to<00:01:13.960> those<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.439> minute<00:01:15.210> these

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
I'll come on to those in a minute these

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.830 
I'll come on to those in a minute these
little<00:01:16.810> filters

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.469 

okay<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:23.900> you<00:01:24.020> got<00:01:24.110> your<00:01:24.229> 55<00:01:24.770> 100-watt<00:01:25.760> you've

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
okay so you got your 55 100-watt you've

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.800 
okay so you got your 55 100-watt you've
got<00:01:26.690> your<00:01:27.280> 175<00:01:28.280> millimeter<00:01:28.729> in<00:01:29.180> hundred<00:01:29.630> watt

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
got your 175 millimeter in hundred watt

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.960 
got your 175 millimeter in hundred watt
and<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:30.260> you<00:01:30.350> move<00:01:30.530> on<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.830> hid<00:01:31.460> which<00:01:31.820> is

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
and then you move on to the hid which is

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.219 
and then you move on to the hid which is
high-intensity<00:01:32.659> discharge<00:01:33.159> that<00:01:34.159> lab<00:01:34.369> here

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
high-intensity discharge that lab here

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.630 
high-intensity discharge that lab here
basically<00:01:36.229> you've<00:01:36.560> got<00:01:36.590> ballast<00:01:37.070> capacitor

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
basically you've got ballast capacitor

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.050 
basically you've got ballast capacitor
here<00:01:37.790> gives<00:01:38.690> your<00:01:38.840> white<00:01:39.140> light<00:01:39.759> very<00:01:40.759> very

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
here gives your white light very very

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.840 
here gives your white light very very
bright<00:01:42.490> 500<00:01:43.490> 600<00:01:43.790> yards<00:01:45.369> lovely<00:01:46.369> reflector

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
bright 500 600 yards lovely reflector

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.940 
bright 500 600 yards lovely reflector
here<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.450> same<00:01:47.659> old<00:01:47.869> white<00:01:48.080> light<00:01:48.320> so

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
here the same old white light so

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.600 
here the same old white light so
basically<00:01:49.960> what<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.140> done<00:01:51.350> at<00:01:51.470> 35<00:01:51.979> once<00:01:52.369> we

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
basically what is done at 35 once we

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.340 
basically what is done at 35 once we
don't<00:01:52.759> use<00:01:52.970> much<00:01:53.000> battery<00:01:53.600> power<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:54.170> don't

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
don't use much battery power you don't

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.170 
don't use much battery power you don't
need<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.590> carry<00:01:54.830> as<00:01:54.979> much<00:01:55.100> battery<00:01:55.550> lasting

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
need to carry as much battery lasting

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.790 
need to carry as much battery lasting
longer<00:01:56.360> we<00:01:57.259> do<00:01:57.380> those<00:01:57.649> into<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.280> same<00:01:58.490> sizes

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
longer we do those into the same sizes

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.450 
longer we do those into the same sizes
155<00:02:01.450> 175<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:04.119> stick<00:02:05.119> ballast<00:02:05.420> capacitor<00:02:05.960> there

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460
