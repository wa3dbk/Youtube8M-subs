you<00:02:29.690> know<00:02:29.810> that's<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.440> downside<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.860> using

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
you know that's the downside of using

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.130 
you know that's the downside of using
your<00:02:31.160> -<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.700> try<00:02:31.910> using<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.239> -<00:02:32.420> into<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> impugn

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
your - I try using the - into the impugn

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.990 
your - I try using the - into the impugn
to<00:02:33.290> get<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.590> kicked<00:02:33.950> over<00:02:34.190> real<00:02:34.489> quickly<00:02:34.730> while

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
to get it kicked over real quickly while

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.130 
to get it kicked over real quickly while
the<00:02:35.090> guy<00:02:35.209> was<00:02:35.390> still<00:02:35.540> there<00:02:35.810> there's<00:02:36.079> a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
the guy was still there there's a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.770 
the guy was still there there's a
potential<00:02:36.410> for<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.709> double<00:02:37.010> kill<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:37.780> but

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
potential for a double kill I think but

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.630 
potential for a double kill I think but
it<00:02:38.959> got<00:02:39.049> stuck<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.440> wall<00:02:39.650> or<00:02:40.099> didn't<00:02:40.579> get

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
it got stuck in the wall or didn't get

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.190 
it got stuck in the wall or didn't get
high<00:02:40.790> enough<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.569> know<00:02:41.660> overall<00:02:41.930> that

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
high enough so you know overall that

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.080 
high enough so you know overall that
