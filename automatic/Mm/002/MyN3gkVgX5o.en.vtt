00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:04.900
 starting with fireworks can be officially sold from today onwards 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.440
 it is expected that this year around 65 million euros worth of fireworks can be used 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.539
 in the air 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.159
 at the fireworks disaster in enschede, our reporter stands for bemen lost 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.429
 good morning 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.830
 we are forty employees who have heard that I have heard but I am there 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.179
 let's see i see it that far 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.730
 yes if you have your rearview mirror they are there waiting because from 7 years is allowed 

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:28.269
 the fireworks 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.789
 be prosecuted officially 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.489
 and I didn't just see myself going on and that is probably 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.720
 one of the first customers that will actually come 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.319
 and they have stored quite a few fireworks here 

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:41.500
 50,000 pounds 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.190
 And they expect it to be more in the next three days than with a thousand people 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.840
 buy fireworks here 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.660
 so that's quite a bit 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 And then you would think that people might wear a small bag of fireworks 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.000
 walk out over 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.360
 that is not the case 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.570
 in advance with that there are many people who just have a maximum number 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 now things work that they can take with them 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.020

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.040

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.390

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.600
 and cardiff city lights is the right end for shopping 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.340

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.720
 gives fireworks and you pay around 25 euros for it 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.400
 are the true enthusiasts 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.400

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.840

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.200
