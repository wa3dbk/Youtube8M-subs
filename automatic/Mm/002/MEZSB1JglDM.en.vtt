hey guys chrisfix here and today we're
going<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.429> take<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> look<00:00:02.850> at<00:00:03.000> what<00:00:03.149> abuse<00:00:03.540> your

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
going to take a look at what abuse your

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.990 
going to take a look at what abuse your
suspension<00:00:04.470> more<00:00:04.770> specifically<00:00:05.339> your<00:00:05.640> shocks

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
suspension more specifically your shocks

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.750 
suspension more specifically your shocks
take<00:00:06.420> on<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> daily<00:00:07.020> basis<00:00:07.470> now<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.639> gonna

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
take on a daily basis now this is gonna

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.280 
take on a daily basis now this is gonna
be<00:00:08.910> pretty<00:00:09.059> cool<00:00:09.179> because<00:00:09.510> your<00:00:09.809> suspension

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
be pretty cool because your suspension

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.390 
be pretty cool because your suspension
is<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.530> those<00:00:10.650> things<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.219> never

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
is one of those things that you never

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.669 
is one of those things that you never
get<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> see<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.480> drive<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:13.349> might<00:00:13.530> have

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
get to see as you drive you might have

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.499 
get to see as you drive you might have
an<00:00:13.769> idea<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.070> how<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.400> works<00:00:14.580> but<00:00:15.299> what's

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
an idea of how it works but what's

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.029 
an idea of how it works but what's
really<00:00:15.690> happening<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.350> drive<00:00:16.650> over<00:00:17.010> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
really happening as you drive over a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.980 
really happening as you drive over a
speed<00:00:17.310> bump<00:00:17.340> or<00:00:17.789> drive<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> highway<00:00:18.750> or<00:00:18.779> on

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
speed bump or drive on the highway or on

speed bump or drive on the highway or on
a<00:00:19.050> bumpy<00:00:19.410> road<00:00:19.619> or<00:00:19.980> even<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.460> normal<00:00:20.789> road

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
a bumpy road or even just a normal road

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.670 
a bumpy road or even just a normal road
well<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.720> my<00:00:21.869> car<00:00:22.109> rigged<00:00:22.380> up<00:00:22.470> with

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
well I have my car rigged up with

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.849 
well I have my car rigged up with
cameras<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.430> cab<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:24.470> well<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
cameras in the cab as well as in the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.529 
cameras in the cab as well as in the
rear<00:00:26.039> under<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> car<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.180> really

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
rear under the car to see what really

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.599 
rear under the car to see what really
happens<00:00:28.109> under<00:00:28.500> those<00:00:28.650> wheel<00:00:28.859> wells<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.340> you

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
happens under those wheel wells as you

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.849 
happens under those wheel wells as you
drive<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.929> my<00:00:31.109> rear<00:00:31.320> shock<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.830> all

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
drive you can see my rear shock is all

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.950 
drive you can see my rear shock is all
rusted<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.579> beat-up<00:00:33.000> well<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.450> far<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.899> know

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
rusted and beat-up well as far as I know

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.110 
rusted and beat-up well as far as I know
these<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> original<00:00:35.160> shocks<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.969> they're

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
these are the original shocks so they're

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000 
these are the original shocks so they're
14<00:00:36.540> years<00:00:36.750> old<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> hundred<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
14 years old and have a hundred and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.319 
14 years old and have a hundred and
twenty<00:00:38.250> five<00:00:38.370> thousand<00:00:38.790> miles<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.149> them

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
twenty five thousand miles on them

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.060 
twenty five thousand miles on them
obviously<00:00:39.899> these<00:00:40.020> puppies<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.469> way<00:00:40.739> past

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
obviously these puppies are way past

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.170 
obviously these puppies are way past
their<00:00:41.340> prime<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.850> should<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.090> been

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
their prime and they should have been

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.299 
their prime and they should have been
replaced<00:00:42.540> long<00:00:42.780> ago<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.860> gives<00:00:44.070> us<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
replaced long ago but this gives us a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
replaced long ago but this gives us a
good<00:00:44.460> opportunity<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:45.180> cameras<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.899> do<00:00:46.020> it

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
good opportunity to use cameras to do it

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
good opportunity to use cameras to do it
before<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.710> after<00:00:47.070> video<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.789> how<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
before and after video to see how the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.630 
before and after video to see how the
suspension<00:00:48.750> feels<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.350> reacts<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> old

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
suspension feels and reacts with the old

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
suspension feels and reacts with the old
shocks<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:51.989> brand<00:00:52.260> new<00:00:52.410> Monroes

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
shocks and then with brand new Monroes

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
shocks and then with brand new Monroes
sensor<00:00:53.280> tracks<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.329> let's<00:00:54.480> take<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.780> tire

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sensor tracks so let's take this tire

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.330 
sensor tracks so let's take this tire
off<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.440> could<00:00:55.590> give<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.710> an<00:00:55.860> idea<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.219> how

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
off so I could give you an idea of how

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.240 
off so I could give you an idea of how
the<00:00:56.399> rear<00:00:56.610> suspension<00:00:57.120> works<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> here's<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the rear suspension works so here's the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
the rear suspension works so here's the
rear<00:00:59.399> suspension<00:00:59.550> on<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.090> truck<00:01:00.390> we're<00:01:01.320> going

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
rear suspension on my truck we're going

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.049 
rear suspension on my truck we're going
to<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> rear<00:01:01.890> suspension<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.550> an<00:01:02.640> example

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
to use the rear suspension as an example

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.640 
to use the rear suspension as an example
because<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.420> could<00:01:03.570> set<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> GoPros<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
because I could set up the GoPros and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
because I could set up the GoPros and
get<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> good<00:01:05.010> view<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.220> everything<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.150> also

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
get a good view of everything it's also

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
get a good view of everything it's also
a<00:01:06.450> very<00:01:06.689> simple<00:01:07.140> suspension<00:01:07.380> setup<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.159> we'll

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
a very simple suspension setup so we'll

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.010 
a very simple suspension setup so we'll
be<00:01:08.369> able<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.729> any<00:01:08.880> differences<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.930> we

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
be able to see any differences when we

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.899 
be able to see any differences when we
put<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> new<00:01:10.350> shocks<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.790> have

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
put the new shocks in right here we have

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
put the new shocks in right here we have
the<00:01:12.030> drum<00:01:12.240> brakes<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> wheel<00:01:13.500> mounts<00:01:13.830> up

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the drum brakes so the wheel mounts up

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
the drum brakes so the wheel mounts up
to<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.180> brakes<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:16.290> we

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
to this and we have the brakes then we

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.899 
to this and we have the brakes then we
go<00:01:16.530> behind<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> brakes<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.790> we

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
go behind the brakes and you can see we

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.390 
go behind the brakes and you can see we
have<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> axle<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.750> axle<00:01:19.740> runs<00:01:19.979> across<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
have the axle the axle runs across the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.969 
have the axle the axle runs across the
truck<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.090> goes<00:01:21.689> all<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> way<00:01:22.229> across<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
truck and goes all the way across to the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.920 
truck and goes all the way across to the
differential<00:01:23.430> where<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> goes<00:01:24.659> across

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
differential where then it goes across

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.410 
differential where then it goes across
to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.290> other<00:01:25.380> side<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.700> called<00:01:26.880> solid

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
to the other side this is called solid

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
to the other side this is called solid
rear<00:01:27.600> axle<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> translates<00:01:28.650> power<00:01:28.890> coming

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
rear axle and it translates power coming

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.690 
rear axle and it translates power coming
from<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.610> engine<00:01:30.000> into<00:01:30.570> power<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> wheels

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
from the engine into power to the wheels

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
from the engine into power to the wheels
so<00:01:32.700> our<00:01:32.820> solid<00:01:33.180> rear<00:01:33.329> axle<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so our solid rear axle is right here and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.590 
so our solid rear axle is right here and
then<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> leaf<00:01:35.100> spring<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.390> leaf

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
then we have the leaf spring the leaf

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
then we have the leaf spring the leaf
spring<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.110> only<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.470> spring<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.310> it's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
spring is not only a spring but it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700 
spring is not only a spring but it's
also<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.850> structural<00:01:39.360> component<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:40.350> holds

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
also a structural component that holds

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
also a structural component that holds
the<00:01:40.799> rear<00:01:40.979> axle<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.520> place<00:01:41.790> without<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the rear axle in place without this the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.730 
the rear axle in place without this the
rear<00:01:43.229> axle<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.920> rip<00:01:44.130> right<00:01:44.310> off<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
rear axle will just rip right off so the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.469 
rear axle will just rip right off so the
leaf<00:01:46.950> spring<00:01:47.220> connects<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> body<00:01:48.090> here

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
leaf spring connects to the body here

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.639 
leaf spring connects to the body here
runs<00:01:48.960> across<00:01:49.909> mounts<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> axle<00:01:51.649> runs

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
runs across mounts to the axle runs

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.160 
runs across mounts to the axle runs
across<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.340> mounts<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> body<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:54.960> here

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
across and mounts to the body up here

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
across and mounts to the body up here
now<00:01:55.979> these<00:01:56.189> different<00:01:56.579> layers<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> leaf

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
now these different layers in the leaf

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.730 
now these different layers in the leaf
spring<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:57.930> called<00:01:58.350> Leafs

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
spring are called Leafs

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.830 
spring are called Leafs
the<00:01:59.219> more<00:01:59.430> leaves<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.390> stiffer<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the more leaves you have the stiffer the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.330 
the more leaves you have the stiffer the
spring<00:02:01.229> will<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.770> we'll<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.159> how<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
spring will be and we'll see how the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.740 
spring will be and we'll see how the
leaf<00:02:02.579> spring<00:02:02.850> works<00:02:03.090> when<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.719> our

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
leaf spring works when we go for our

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.200 
leaf spring works when we go for our
ride<00:02:04.049> working<00:02:04.799> alongside<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.490> spring<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
ride working alongside the spring is the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
ride working alongside the spring is the
shock<00:02:06.450> which<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:07.229> important<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> shock

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
shock which is very important the shock

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.650 
shock which is very important the shock
absorber<00:02:08.670> does<00:02:08.819> exactly<00:02:09.149> what<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> name

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
absorber does exactly what the name

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.809 
absorber does exactly what the name
implies<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.200> absorbs<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> energy<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.400> acts

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
implies it absorbs the energy and acts

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.650 
implies it absorbs the energy and acts
as<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> dampener<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> car<00:02:13.230> won't

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
as a dampener so the car won't

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.820 
as a dampener so the car won't
it's<00:02:13.780> around<00:02:13.960> everywhere<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.650> road

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
it's around everywhere on the road

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.440 
it's around everywhere on the road
here's<00:02:15.340> an<00:02:15.490> example<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.910> what<00:02:16.060> happens<00:02:16.390> when

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
here's an example of what happens when

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.740 
here's an example of what happens when
you<00:02:16.600> don't<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.080> shot<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:17.650> your<00:02:17.830> car<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you don't have a shot on your car you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.240 
you don't have a shot on your car you
can<00:02:19.870> see<00:02:20.050> there's<00:02:20.230> no<00:02:20.350> shock<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.890> as<00:02:21.070> I'm

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
can see there's no shock and as I'm

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.650 
can see there's no shock and as I'm
backing<00:02:21.580> out<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.730> my<00:02:21.820> driveway<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
backing out of my driveway the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.300 
backing out of my driveway the
suspension<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.290> bouncing<00:02:23.680> around<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.190> it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
suspension is bouncing around and it

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.340 
suspension is bouncing around and it
never<00:02:24.550> settles<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.870> obviously<00:02:26.230> an

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
never settles this is obviously an

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.780 
never settles this is obviously an
extreme<00:02:26.710> example<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.190> when<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.490> have<00:02:27.610> bad

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
extreme example but when you have bad

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.270 
extreme example but when you have bad
shocks<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.390> same<00:02:28.570> thing<00:02:28.750> happens<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.380> shock<00:02:30.100> is

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
shocks the same thing happens a shock is

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.220 
shocks the same thing happens a shock is
basically<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.790> piston<00:02:31.240> filled<00:02:31.600> with<00:02:31.780> fluid

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
basically a piston filled with fluid

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.710 
basically a piston filled with fluid
which<00:02:32.770> absorbs<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> impact<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:34.060> dampens<00:02:34.570> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
which absorbs the impact it dampens the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600 
which absorbs the impact it dampens the
suspension<00:02:35.350> bounce<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.860> you'll<00:02:36.160> see<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.490> in

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
suspension bounce and you'll see that in

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.580 
suspension bounce and you'll see that in
a<00:02:36.670> second<00:02:37.030> when<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.150> go<00:02:37.330> for<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.600> ride<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.560> a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
a second when we go for a ride so on a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.200 
a second when we go for a ride so on a
ride<00:02:38.920> we're<00:02:39.160> looking<00:02:39.460> at<00:02:39.550> four<00:02:39.790> different

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
ride we're looking at four different

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.720 
ride we're looking at four different
conditions<00:02:40.470> one<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.620> bumpy<00:02:42.040> uneven<00:02:42.220> road

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
conditions one is a bumpy uneven road

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.720 
conditions one is a bumpy uneven road
two<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.690> highway<00:02:44.020> driving<00:02:44.290> three<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.310> stopping

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
two is highway driving three is stopping

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.660 
two is highway driving three is stopping
and<00:02:46.000> going<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.510> four<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> speed<00:02:47.950> bump<00:02:48.130> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
and going and four is a speed bump the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.330 
and going and four is a speed bump the
first<00:02:48.970> condition<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.630> bumpy<00:02:49.990> road<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:51.220> can

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
first condition is a bumpy road you can

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.190 
first condition is a bumpy road you can
see<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.580> rear<00:02:51.760> axle<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.360> tire<00:02:52.720> jumping

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
see the rear axle and tire jumping

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.470 
see the rear axle and tire jumping
around<00:02:53.290> all<00:02:53.560> over<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.890> place<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.940> spring<00:02:55.210> is

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
around all over the place the spring is

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.360 
around all over the place the spring is
reducing<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.110> bumpiness<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.740> ride<00:02:56.920> as

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
reducing the bumpiness of the ride as

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.640 
reducing the bumpiness of the ride as
the<00:02:57.460> shock<00:02:57.820> absorbers<00:02:58.360> dampen<00:02:58.960> and<00:02:59.140> stabilize

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the shock absorbers dampen and stabilize

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.250 
the shock absorbers dampen and stabilize
the<00:02:59.680> suspension<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:01.300> crazy<00:03:01.780> how<00:03:02.110> much

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
the suspension it's crazy how much

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.930 
the suspension it's crazy how much
everything<00:03:02.320> moves<00:03:02.920> back<00:03:03.190> there<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.670> spring

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
everything moves back there the spring

everything moves back there the spring
and<00:03:04.030> shock<00:03:04.270> are<00:03:04.420> constantly<00:03:04.870> working<00:03:05.080> after

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
and shock are constantly working after

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.200 
and shock are constantly working after
seeing<00:03:05.770> this<00:03:05.890> I'm<00:03:06.070> amazed<00:03:06.460> that<00:03:06.610> they<00:03:06.820> last<00:03:07.030> as

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
seeing this I'm amazed that they last as

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.540 
seeing this I'm amazed that they last as
long<00:03:07.330> as<00:03:07.390> they<00:03:07.570> do<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:08.710> is<00:03:08.860> only<00:03:08.980> at<00:03:09.160> 35

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
long as they do and this is only at 35

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.220 
long as they do and this is only at 35
miles<00:03:09.790> an<00:03:09.880> hour

the<00:03:12.709> next<00:03:13.010> condition<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.640> cruising<00:03:14.090> on<00:03:14.150> the

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
the next condition is cruising on the

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.440 
the next condition is cruising on the
highway<00:03:14.599> at<00:03:14.720> 65<00:03:15.230> miles<00:03:15.500> an<00:03:15.650> hour<00:03:16.030> I'm<00:03:17.030> using<00:03:17.269> a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
highway at 65 miles an hour I'm using a

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:26.010 
highway at 65 miles an hour I'm using a
ramp<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.780> get<00:03:17.959> onto<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.290> highway

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.870 

at<00:03:26.560> highways<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.920> lot<00:03:27.160> smoother<00:03:27.550> they<00:03:27.700> could

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
at highways a lot smoother they could

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.760 
at highways a lot smoother they could
see<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.210> suspension<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.990> making<00:03:29.440> small

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
see that the suspension is making small

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.940 
see that the suspension is making small
adjustments<00:03:31.050> now<00:03:32.050> coming<00:03:32.290> off<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.590> highway

adjustments now coming off the highway
there's<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.310> stop<00:03:33.610> sign<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.300> have<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.570> merge

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
there's a stop sign and I have to merge

there's a stop sign and I have to merge
pay<00:03:35.830> attention<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.460> rear<00:03:36.700> axle<00:03:36.880> twisting

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
pay attention to the rear axle twisting

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.620 
pay attention to the rear axle twisting
under<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.020> torque<00:03:38.320> from<00:03:38.470> acceleration

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.230 

I<00:03:42.740> never<00:03:43.740> realized<00:03:44.190> how<00:03:44.310> much<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.700> rear<00:03:44.850> axle

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
I never realized how much the rear axle

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.480 
I never realized how much the rear axle
actually<00:03:45.600> twist<00:03:45.930> until<00:03:46.230> now<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:47.190> was<00:03:47.310> pretty

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
actually twist until now that was pretty

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.050 
actually twist until now that was pretty
cool<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.880> see<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:49.400> finally<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.520> have<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.730> speed

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
cool to see and finally we have a speed

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.880 
cool to see and finally we have a speed
bump<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.660> speed<00:03:51.960> bump<00:03:52.110> was<00:03:52.290> taken<00:03:52.620> at<00:03:52.710> 10

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
bump this speed bump was taken at 10

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.610 
bump this speed bump was taken at 10
miles<00:03:53.070> an<00:03:53.220> hour<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:57.110> this<00:03:58.110> speed<00:03:58.320> bump<00:03:58.530> was

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
miles an hour and this speed bump was

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.380 
miles an hour and this speed bump was
taken<00:03:58.950> slowly<00:03:59.280> like<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.700> would<00:03:59.850> normally<00:04:00.210> do

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
taken slowly like you would normally do

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.830 
taken slowly like you would normally do
I<00:04:01.700> think<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.820> gives<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.120> an<00:04:03.240> idea<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.600> how

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
I think that gives you an idea of how

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.210 
I think that gives you an idea of how
the<00:04:03.900> suspension<00:04:04.350> reacts<00:04:04.770> under<00:04:05.010> different

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the suspension reacts under different

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.370 
the suspension reacts under different
conditions<00:04:05.460> now<00:04:06.420> let's<00:04:06.600> change<00:04:06.780> these<00:04:07.050> shocks

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
conditions now let's change these shocks

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.410 
conditions now let's change these shocks
over<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.890> new<00:04:08.070> shocks<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.820> compare<00:04:09.300> the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
over to the new shocks and compare the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.270 
over to the new shocks and compare the
difference<00:04:09.780> in<00:04:09.900> ride<00:04:10.080> quality<00:04:10.530> most<00:04:11.010> shocks

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
difference in ride quality most shocks

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.490 
difference in ride quality most shocks
are<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.670> easy<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.060> replace<00:04:12.210> it's<00:04:13.020> just<00:04:13.290> two

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
are really easy to replace it's just two

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.780 
are really easy to replace it's just two
bolts<00:04:13.890> one<00:04:14.160> at<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.370> bottom<00:04:14.730> one<00:04:15.120> at<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.330> top

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
bolts one at the bottom one at the top

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.570 
bolts one at the bottom one at the top
and<00:04:18.110> I<00:04:19.110> have<00:04:19.140> videos<00:04:19.590> on<00:04:19.620> replacing<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> front

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
and I have videos on replacing the front

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.890 
and I have videos on replacing the front
and<00:04:20.790> rear<00:04:20.910> shocks<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:21.450> if<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.600> want<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> see

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
and rear shocks so if you want to see

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.750 
and rear shocks so if you want to see
how<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.080> do<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.440> just<00:04:22.680> check<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.430> links<00:04:23.700> in

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
how to do that just check the links in

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.490 
how to do that just check the links in
the<00:04:23.880> description<00:04:23.910> with<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> shocks<00:04:25.140> out<00:04:25.320> I

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
the description with the shocks out I

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290 
the description with the shocks out I
want<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.890> check<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.250> out<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:27.120> could

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
want you to check this out you could

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.760 
want you to check this out you could
really<00:04:27.540> see<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.930> difference<00:04:28.290> in<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.590> old

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
really see the difference in the old

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.040 
really see the difference in the old
shock<00:04:29.100> versus<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.790> new<00:04:29.940> shop<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.600> old<00:04:30.750> shocks

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
shock versus the new shop the old shocks

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.720 
shock versus the new shop the old shocks
I<00:04:31.200> could<00:04:31.350> compress<00:04:31.680> really<00:04:32.070> easily<00:04:32.490> with<00:04:32.700> my

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
I could compress really easily with my

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.510 
I could compress really easily with my
hands<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.360> they<00:04:33.690> don't<00:04:33.840> feel<00:04:34.050> smooth<00:04:34.520> these

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
hands and they don't feel smooth these

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.580 
hands and they don't feel smooth these
new<00:04:35.820> shocks<00:04:36.090> take<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.420> lot<00:04:36.780> more<00:04:37.080> force<00:04:37.410> to

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
new shocks take a lot more force to

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.080 
new shocks take a lot more force to
compress<00:04:39.680> all<00:04:40.680> right<00:04:41.040> now<00:04:41.400> we'll<00:04:41.610> add<00:04:41.640> our<00:04:41.790> new

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
compress all right now we'll add our new

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.860 
compress all right now we'll add our new
shocks<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:43.640> with<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.760> new<00:04:44.880> shocks<00:04:45.180> in<00:04:45.450> and<00:04:45.660> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
shocks and with the new shocks in and a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.420 
shocks and with the new shocks in and a
fresh<00:04:46.140> coat<00:04:46.170> of<00:04:46.440> spray<00:04:46.710> paint<00:04:46.860> on<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.280> rear

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
fresh coat of spray paint on the rear

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.750 
fresh coat of spray paint on the rear
axle<00:04:47.880> yes<00:04:48.450> I'm<00:04:48.660> not<00:04:48.780> crazy<00:04:49.050> with<00:04:49.290> my<00:04:49.410> cars

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
axle yes I'm not crazy with my cars

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.700 
axle yes I'm not crazy with my cars
let's<00:04:50.760> go<00:04:50.910> for<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> run<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:52.230> I'm<00:04:52.290> taking<00:04:52.470> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
let's go for a run so I'm taking the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.440 
let's go for a run so I'm taking the
same<00:04:52.920> roads<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.520> right<00:04:53.880> off<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.030> bat<00:04:54.300> I

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
same roads and right off the bat I

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.820 
same roads and right off the bat I
really<00:04:54.690> didn't<00:04:54.960> think<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.230> would<00:04:55.350> notice<00:04:55.530> a

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
really didn't think I would notice a

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.860 
really didn't think I would notice a
difference<00:04:56.340> but<00:04:56.820> I<00:04:56.850> could<00:04:57.030> totally<00:04:57.240> feel<00:04:57.720> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
difference but I could totally feel the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.110 
difference but I could totally feel the
difference<00:04:58.290> for<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.160> first<00:04:59.400> road<00:04:59.640> condition

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
difference for the first road condition

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.480 
difference for the first road condition
the<00:05:00.420> bumpy<00:05:00.750> road<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.650> could<00:05:01.800> really<00:05:01.950> feel<00:05:02.070> how

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
the bumpy road you could really feel how

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.370 
the bumpy road you could really feel how
much<00:05:02.610> stiffer<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.240> ride<00:05:03.450> is<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.200> rear

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
much stiffer the ride is and the rear

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.500 
much stiffer the ride is and the rear
feels<00:05:04.680> more<00:05:04.920> steady<00:05:05.340> rather<00:05:05.850> than<00:05:06.090> floating

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
feels more steady rather than floating

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.190 
feels more steady rather than floating
around<00:05:06.600> like<00:05:06.900> before

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
around like before

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.410 
around like before
for<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.290> second<00:05:10.680> row<00:05:10.800> condition<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.820> highway

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
for the second row condition the highway

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.810 
for the second row condition the highway
I<00:05:12.500> really<00:05:13.500> don't<00:05:13.800> notice<00:05:14.070> too<00:05:14.430> much<00:05:14.610> of<00:05:14.760> a

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
I really don't notice too much of a

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.760 
I really don't notice too much of a
difference<00:05:14.970> but<00:05:15.720> it<00:05:15.870> does<00:05:15.900> feel<00:05:16.290> like<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.560> car

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
difference but it does feel like the car

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.210 
difference but it does feel like the car
isn't<00:05:17.160> floating<00:05:17.400> as<00:05:17.670> much<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.930> now<00:05:19.920> for<00:05:20.130> the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
isn't floating as much and now for the

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.010 
isn't floating as much and now for the
stop-and-go<00:05:20.730> I<00:05:21.090> want<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.390> compare<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.780> before

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
stop-and-go I want to compare the before

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.800 
stop-and-go I want to compare the before
and<00:05:22.350> after<00:05:22.680> shots<00:05:22.920> so<00:05:23.820> on<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.000> left<00:05:24.210> is<00:05:24.360> before

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
and after shots so on the left is before

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.350 
and after shots so on the left is before
and<00:05:25.080> on<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.350> right<00:05:25.590> is<00:05:25.770> after<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:27.180> could

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
and on the right is after you could

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.730 
and on the right is after you could
clearly<00:05:27.660> see<00:05:27.810> when<00:05:28.170> you<00:05:28.260> break<00:05:28.530> the

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
clearly see when you break the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.920 
clearly see when you break the
suspension<00:05:29.280> doesn't<00:05:29.700> bounce<00:05:29.880> around<00:05:30.090> which

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
suspension doesn't bounce around which

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.210 
suspension doesn't bounce around which
means<00:05:31.170> that<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.440> shocks<00:05:31.680> are<00:05:31.860> doing<00:05:32.100> their

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
means that the shocks are doing their

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.060 
means that the shocks are doing their
job<00:05:32.460> when<00:05:33.360> accelerating<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:34.380> rear<00:05:34.620> axle

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
job when accelerating the rear axle

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.010 
job when accelerating the rear axle
doesn't<00:05:35.430> twist<00:05:35.700> as<00:05:35.850> much<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.360> more<00:05:36.810> of<00:05:36.900> the

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
doesn't twist as much and more of the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.600 
doesn't twist as much and more of the
parish<00:05:37.350> translated<00:05:37.950> to<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.130> wheels<00:05:38.340> rather

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
parish translated to the wheels rather

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.310 
parish translated to the wheels rather
than<00:05:38.880> twisting<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.390> suspension<00:05:39.930> which<00:05:40.140> is<00:05:40.170> a

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
than twisting the suspension which is a

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.990 
than twisting the suspension which is a
good<00:05:40.530> thing<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:41.100> that's<00:05:41.400> pretty<00:05:41.670> neat<00:05:41.850> that

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
good thing and that's pretty neat that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.780 
good thing and that's pretty neat that
we<00:05:42.120> could<00:05:42.270> actually<00:05:42.390> see<00:05:42.750> a<00:05:42.780> difference<00:05:43.790> and

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
we could actually see a difference and

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.970 
we could actually see a difference and
finally<00:05:45.270> let's<00:05:45.540> get<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.720> side-by-side<00:05:45.990> at<00:05:46.710> the

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
finally let's get a side-by-side at the

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.710 
finally let's get a side-by-side at the
speed<00:05:47.250> bone<00:05:49.730> interestingly<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:51.180> softness<00:05:51.570> of

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
speed bone interestingly the softness of

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.570 
speed bone interestingly the softness of
the<00:05:51.840> old<00:05:51.990> shocks<00:05:52.350> did<00:05:52.890> a<00:05:52.920> good<00:05:53.160> job<00:05:53.220> of

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
the old shocks did a good job of

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.760 
the old shocks did a good job of
preventing<00:05:53.850> like<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.150> big<00:05:54.480> joke<00:05:54.810> while<00:05:55.470> the<00:05:55.590> new

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
preventing like a big joke while the new

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.890 
preventing like a big joke while the new
shock<00:05:56.010> has<00:05:56.280> more<00:05:56.550> of<00:05:56.640> a<00:05:56.730> jolt<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:57.390> but<00:05:57.810> you

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
shock has more of a jolt to it but you

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.990 
shock has more of a jolt to it but you
have<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.080> lot<00:05:58.320> less<00:05:58.530> bounce<00:05:58.770> afterwards<00:05:59.430> with

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
have a lot less bounce afterwards with

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.550 
have a lot less bounce afterwards with
the<00:06:00.120> new<00:06:00.270> shock<00:06:00.540> so<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:00.900> maintain<00:06:01.080> more

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
the new shock so you maintain more

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.560 
the new shock so you maintain more
control<00:06:01.950> just<00:06:02.730> to<00:06:02.820> give<00:06:02.970> you<00:06:03.060> a<00:06:03.090> frame<00:06:03.390> by

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
control just to give you a frame by

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.180 
control just to give you a frame by
frame<00:06:03.600> because<00:06:04.230> it's<00:06:04.410> so<00:06:04.560> hard<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.830> see<00:06:05.070> in

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
frame because it's so hard to see in

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.040 
frame because it's so hard to see in
real<00:06:05.400> time<00:06:05.700> check<00:06:06.180> out<00:06:06.300> the<00:06:06.450> spring<00:06:06.780> in<00:06:06.930> the

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
real time check out the spring in the

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.050 
real time check out the spring in the
before<00:06:07.380> compared<00:06:07.800> to<00:06:07.920> the<00:06:08.010> after<00:06:08.460> you<00:06:08.790> can<00:06:08.910> see

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
before compared to the after you can see

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.820 
before compared to the after you can see
the<00:06:09.180> new<00:06:09.330> shock<00:06:09.600> dampens<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.170> leaf<00:06:10.410> spring<00:06:10.710> a

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
the new shock dampens the leaf spring a

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.530 
the new shock dampens the leaf spring a
lot<00:06:11.070> more<00:06:11.370> than<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:11.640> old<00:06:11.670> shock<00:06:12.090> and<00:06:12.300> there's

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
lot more than the old shock and there's

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.690 
lot more than the old shock and there's
a<00:06:12.630> lot<00:06:12.840> less<00:06:13.140> rebound<00:06:13.620> in<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.310> before<00:06:14.670> the

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
a lot less rebound in the before the

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.910 
a lot less rebound in the before the
spring<00:06:15.180> rebounds<00:06:15.690> more<00:06:15.930> with<00:06:16.290> the<00:06:16.440> old<00:06:16.590> shock

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
spring rebounds more with the old shock

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.770 
spring rebounds more with the old shock
and<00:06:17.250> you<00:06:17.700> can<00:06:17.820> see<00:06:17.970> that<00:06:18.150> right<00:06:18.300> here<00:06:18.570> where<00:06:18.720> I

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
and you can see that right here where I

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.450 
and you can see that right here where I
show<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.110> distance<00:06:19.440> from<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:19.800> frame<00:06:20.100> to<00:06:20.340> the

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
show the distance from the frame to the

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.490 
show the distance from the frame to the
spring<00:06:20.820> this<00:06:21.450> proves<00:06:21.750> to<00:06:21.900> me<00:06:21.930> that<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.290> ride

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
spring this proves to me that the ride

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.140 
spring this proves to me that the ride
is<00:06:22.650> actually<00:06:22.830> stiffer<00:06:23.340> and<00:06:23.550> it's<00:06:23.670> not<00:06:23.820> just<00:06:24.060> in

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
is actually stiffer and it's not just in

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.030 
is actually stiffer and it's not just in
my<00:06:24.270> head<00:06:24.510> so<00:06:25.169> although<00:06:25.290> I<00:06:25.380> can<00:06:25.620> tell<00:06:25.770> you<00:06:25.860> what

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
my head so although I can tell you what

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.620 
my head so although I can tell you what
I'm<00:06:26.160> actually<00:06:26.370> feeling<00:06:26.730> you<00:06:27.300> could<00:06:27.450> actually

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
I'm actually feeling you could actually

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.880 
I'm actually feeling you could actually
see<00:06:27.990> that<00:06:28.169> there<00:06:28.290> is<00:06:28.320> a<00:06:28.470> performance

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
see that there is a performance

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.830 
see that there is a performance
difference<00:06:29.430> between<00:06:29.760> the<00:06:29.880> new<00:06:30.030> and<00:06:30.300> old<00:06:30.450> shock

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
difference between the new and old shock

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.020 
difference between the new and old shock
now<00:06:31.800> I<00:06:31.830> think<00:06:31.950> that<00:06:32.190> was<00:06:32.310> pretty<00:06:32.550> neat<00:06:32.820> and

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
now I think that was pretty neat and

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.250 
now I think that was pretty neat and
something<00:06:33.390> you<00:06:33.480> don't<00:06:33.630> see<00:06:33.930> every<00:06:34.230> day

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
something you don't see every day

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.200 
something you don't see every day

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
below I think the takeaway from this

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.070 
below I think the takeaway from this
video<00:06:50.820> is<00:06:51.060> that<00:06:51.090> your<00:06:51.330> suspension<00:06:51.900> and

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
video is that your suspension and

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.050

especially<00:06:52.680> your<00:06:52.950> shocks<00:06:53.280> go<00:06:53.550> through<00:06:53.730> a<00:06:53.760> lot

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
especially your shocks go through a lot

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.480 
especially your shocks go through a lot
on<00:06:54.240> a<00:06:54.300> daily<00:06:54.720> basis<00:06:55.140> I<00:06:55.380> was<00:06:55.860> surprised<00:06:56.280> to<00:06:56.430> see

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
on a daily basis I was surprised to see

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.030

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
how much they move around constantly and

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.680
