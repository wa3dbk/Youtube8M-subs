before<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.370> start<00:00:47.430> shredding<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.480> before<00:00:48.840> we

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
before we start shredding but before we

start shredding we want to turn this go

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.209 
start shredding we want to turn this go
to<00:00:50.910> probably<00:00:51.300> about<00:00:51.420> medium-high<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.379> dumped

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
to probably about medium-high and dumped

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.090 
to probably about medium-high and dumped
in<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.579> good<00:00:53.730> amount<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.719> took<00:00:55.050> homemade<00:00:55.829> pico

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
in a good amount of I took homemade pico

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.970 
in a good amount of I took homemade pico
de<00:00:56.160> gayo<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.730> put<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> blender<00:00:57.980> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
de gayo and put it in the blender to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.209 
de gayo and put it in the blender to
kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.870> chop<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> down<00:01:01.020> finer<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.010> can

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
kind of chop it down finer or you can

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.329 
kind of chop it down finer or you can
use<00:01:02.329> pace<00:01:03.329> picante<00:01:03.539> sauce<00:01:04.110> whatever<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.100> feel

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
use pace picante sauce whatever you feel

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.370 
use pace picante sauce whatever you feel
like<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.479> was<00:01:06.600> probably<00:01:06.659> about

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
like you think there was probably about

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
like you think there was probably about
a<00:01:07.439> cup<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.939> way<00:01:09.150> will

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
a cup in there and then this way will

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.870 
a cup in there and then this way will
warm<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:11.010> we're<00:01:11.369> strutting<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
warm it up and as we're strutting the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.700 
warm it up and as we're strutting the
chicken<00:01:12.210> will<00:01:12.360> put<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> stir<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
chicken will put it in and stir it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.380 
chicken will put it in and stir it
around<00:01:13.890> because<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> chicken<00:01:15.030> needs<00:01:15.180> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
around because then the chicken needs to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
around because then the chicken needs to
sautee<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> probably<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.740> about<00:01:16.830> 15<00:01:17.369> or

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
sautee in that probably for about 15 or

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.980 
sautee in that probably for about 15 or
20<00:01:17.610> minutes<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.420> flavors<00:01:19.580> now<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> am
