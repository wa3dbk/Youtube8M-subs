chief<00:00:51.550> something<00:00:52.270> that<00:00:52.449> I<00:00:52.629> don't<00:00:52.690> know<00:00:52.899> that

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
chief something that I don't know that

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.689 
chief something that I don't know that
stands<00:00:53.500> for<00:00:53.770> but<00:00:53.949> someone<00:00:54.219> can<00:00:54.340> tell<00:00:54.430> me<00:00:54.520> what

that means the comments that be amazing
but<00:00:57.309> I<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:58.870> he's<00:00:58.989> iqbal<00:00:59.320> conduct<00:00:59.649> getting

but I think he's iqbal conduct getting

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.799 
but I think he's iqbal conduct getting
more<00:01:00.010> power<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.579> I<00:01:00.910> think<00:01:01.239> they<00:01:01.359> let<00:01:01.539> him<00:01:01.600> go

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
more power and I think they let him go

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.560 
more power and I think they let him go
like<00:01:02.410> they<00:01:02.649> unleashed<00:01:03.070> his<00:01:03.250> power<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.820> he's

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
like they unleashed his power and he's

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.590 
like they unleashed his power and he's
basically<00:01:05.020> free<00:01:05.380> reign<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.800> basically<00:01:06.280> free

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
about to do it then obito shows up event

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.470 
about to do it then obito shows up event
because<00:03:47.130> they<00:03:47.250> both<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.730> same<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.090> they
