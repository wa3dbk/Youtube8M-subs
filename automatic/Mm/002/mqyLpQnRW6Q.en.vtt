primarily outdoor right this is an

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.530 
primarily outdoor right this is an
outdoor<00:01:41.490> model<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.090> right<00:01:42.329> there's

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
outdoor model that's right there's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
outdoor model that's right there's
certainly<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> different<00:01:43.320> set<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.530> challenges

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
certainly a different set of challenges

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.139 
certainly a different set of challenges
for<00:01:44.159> indoor<00:01:44.549> different<00:01:44.909> set<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.119> challenges

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
for indoor different set of challenges

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.630 
for indoor different set of challenges
for<00:01:45.689> residential<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> lot<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> history

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
for residential we have a lot of history

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
for residential we have a lot of history
there<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.299> bespoke<00:01:48.659> programs<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
there and bespoke programs but the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
there and bespoke programs but the
outdoor<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> new<00:01:50.759> sort<00:01:51.149> of

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
outdoor I think is the new sort of

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
outdoor I think is the new sort of
tricky<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.530> macro<00:01:53.009> button<00:01:53.250> on

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
tricky one it's like a macro button on

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.219 
tricky one it's like a macro button on
Tower<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.060> need<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.450> address<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
Tower so we need to really address the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.810 
Tower so we need to really address the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
new the new sites we're dealing with

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.490 
new the new sites we're dealing with
yeah<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> talk<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> little<00:01:58.110> bit<00:01:58.320> about

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
yeah can you talk a little bit about

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.230 
yeah can you talk a little bit about
some<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> backhaul<00:01:59.369> solutions<00:01:59.939> that

we<00:02:38.270> had<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.510> flexibility<00:02:39.020> to<00:02:39.110> make<00:02:39.410> work<00:02:39.709> for

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
we had the flexibility to make work for

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.260 
we had the flexibility to make work for
an<00:02:40.040> offering<00:02:40.370> now<00:02:40.670> which<00:02:40.850> satellite

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
an offering now which satellite

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.820 
an offering now which satellite
operators<00:02:41.720> are<00:02:41.870> working<00:02:42.230> with<00:02:42.350> you<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:42.739> you

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
operators are working with you can you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.620 
operators are working with you can you
say<00:02:43.010> yeah<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.670> these<00:02:43.940> end<00:02:44.209> up<00:02:44.300> being<00:02:44.570> very

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
say yeah so these end up being very

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.080 
say yeah so these end up being very
bespoke<00:02:45.110> solutions<00:02:45.500> where<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.430> operator<00:02:47.000> has

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
bespoke solutions where the operator has

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.320 
bespoke solutions where the operator has
brought<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:48.140> us<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.310> satellite<00:02:49.850> provider

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
brought to us the the satellite provider

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.360 
brought to us the the satellite provider
that<00:02:50.630> they're<00:02:50.810> already<00:02:51.170> working<00:02:51.320> with<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.190> so

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
that they're already working with and so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.310 
that they're already working with and so
what<00:02:52.550> we<00:02:52.670> end<00:02:52.820> up<00:02:52.880> doing<00:02:52.940> is<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.660> quick<00:02:53.840> IOT

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
what we end up doing is just a quick IOT

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.770 
what we end up doing is just a quick IOT
and<00:02:54.680> interoperability<00:02:55.370> test<00:02:55.850> with<00:02:56.150> them<00:02:56.330> to

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
and interoperability test with them to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.030 
and interoperability test with them to
make<00:02:56.900> sure<00:02:56.959> we<00:02:57.200> can<00:02:57.320> get<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.560> working<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
make sure we can get it working and

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.890 
make sure we can get it working and
pretty<00:02:58.910> much<00:02:59.000> every<00:02:59.330> time<00:02:59.510> we've<00:02:59.690> been<00:02:59.780> able

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
pretty much every time we've been able

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.650 
pretty much every time we've been able
to<00:03:00.080> get<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.380> working<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.890> working<00:03:01.010> properly

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
to get that working and working properly

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.449 
to get that working and working properly
and<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.810> said<00:03:03.020> they're<00:03:03.170> about<00:03:03.290> 600,000<00:03:04.220> sites

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
and you said they're about 600,000 sites

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.000 
and you said they're about 600,000 sites
currently<00:03:04.940> in<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.060> database<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:06.350> that's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
currently in the database and that's

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.350 
currently in the database and that's
going<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.250> scale<00:03:07.520> or<00:03:07.760> how<00:03:07.850> do<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.030> see<00:03:08.180> that

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
going to scale or how do you see that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.300 
going to scale or how do you see that
happening<00:03:08.780> yeah<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.680> today<00:03:09.920> nine

would help us globally scale this
program<00:03:23.870> what<00:03:24.799> we'll<00:03:24.920> find<00:03:25.130> is<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.670> or<00:03:26.360> what<00:03:26.510> we

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
program what we'll find is is or what we

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.060 
program what we'll find is is or what we
found<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:26.959> with<00:03:27.170> those<00:03:27.320> nine<00:03:27.620> partners

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
found is that with those nine partners

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.759 
found is that with those nine partners
across<00:03:28.790> Europe<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.540> US<00:03:29.870> today<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.560> gave

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
across Europe and the US today that gave

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.340 
across Europe and the US today that gave
us<00:03:30.950> inventory<00:03:31.580> of<00:03:31.700> 600,000<00:03:32.570> qualified<00:03:32.989> sites

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
us inventory of 600,000 qualified sites

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.770 
us inventory of 600,000 qualified sites
which<00:03:34.310> we<00:03:34.489> think<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.790> pretty<00:03:35.180> pretty

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
which we think is pretty pretty

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.600 
which we think is pretty pretty
important<00:03:36.320> given<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.650> magnitude<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.519> the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
important given the magnitude of the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.420 
important given the magnitude of the
problem<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:38.150> operators<00:03:38.630> are<00:03:38.750> dealing<00:03:39.019> with

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
problem that operators are dealing with

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.060 
problem that operators are dealing with
we're<00:03:41.049> willing<00:03:42.049> and<00:03:42.200> happy<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.680> have<00:03:42.890> new

we're willing and happy to have new
partners<00:03:43.489> join<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.910> program<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:44.420> certainly

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
partners join the program it's certainly

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.470 
partners join the program it's certainly
not<00:03:44.780> exclusive<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.760> with<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.269> with

not exclusive and and with that with
each<00:03:47.630> new<00:03:47.660> addition<00:03:48.230> will<00:03:48.350> be<00:03:48.470> able<00:03:48.709> to

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
each new addition will be able to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.710 
each new addition will be able to
strengthen<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.430> database<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.209> just<00:03:50.329> add<00:03:50.480> in

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
strengthen the database and just add in

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.780 
strengthen the database and just add in
their<00:03:50.900> inventory<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.739> again<00:03:52.430> make<00:03:52.640> that

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
their inventory and again make that

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.610 
their inventory and again make that
available<00:03:53.030> for<00:03:53.299> operators<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.049> participate

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
available for operators to participate

okay<00:03:55.459> great<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:55.910> finally<00:03:56.269> let's<00:03:56.570> talk<00:03:56.630> a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
okay great and finally let's talk a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.690 
okay great and finally let's talk a
little<00:03:56.930> bit<00:03:57.110> about<00:03:57.410> some<00:03:57.799> of<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.130> systems

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
little bit about some of the systems

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.280 
little bit about some of the systems
installers<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.420> talked<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.870> little<00:03:59.989> bit<00:04:00.110> about

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
installers you talked a little bit about

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.170 
installers you talked a little bit about
that<00:04:00.470> earlier<00:04:00.769> but<00:04:01.040> clearly<00:04:01.610> I'm<00:04:02.090> an

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
that earlier but clearly I'm an

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.729 
that earlier but clearly I'm an
opportunity<00:04:02.780> for<00:04:02.810> smaller<00:04:03.170> companies<00:04:03.350> if

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
opportunity for smaller companies if

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.520 
opportunity for smaller companies if
they<00:04:03.769> can<00:04:04.010> become<00:04:04.130> part<00:04:04.519> of<00:04:04.579> your<00:04:04.640> database<00:04:04.880> so

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
they can become part of your database so

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.960 
they can become part of your database so
how<00:04:06.530> do<00:04:06.590> how<00:04:06.950> do<00:04:07.010> companies<00:04:07.220> get<00:04:07.549> involved

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
how do how do companies get involved

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.030 
how do how do companies get involved
yeah<00:04:08.239> that's<00:04:08.540> right<00:04:08.690> we<00:04:08.900> we<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.530> actually<00:04:09.980> in

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
of the specific skill sets needed for a

of the specific skill sets needed for a
small<00:04:50.750> cell<00:04:51.020> deployment<00:04:51.740> engineer<00:04:51.890> well<00:04:52.900> we

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
small cell deployment engineer well we

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.890 
small cell deployment engineer well we
have<00:04:54.260> designed<00:04:54.830> our<00:04:55.190> Metro<00:04:55.850> sell<00:04:56.090> products<00:04:56.720> to

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
have designed our Metro sell products to

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.320 
have designed our Metro sell products to
be<00:04:57.080> very<00:04:57.830> simple<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.790> deploy<00:05:00.670> you<00:05:01.670> know<00:05:01.790> but<00:05:02.090> in

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
be very simple to deploy you know but in

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.060 
be very simple to deploy you know but in
fact<00:05:02.510> actually<00:05:02.930> let<00:05:03.320> me<00:05:03.380> put<00:05:03.530> it<00:05:03.560> this<00:05:03.680> way<00:05:03.830> i

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
fact actually let me put it this way i

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.860 
fact actually let me put it this way i
can<00:05:04.100> deploy<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.640> so<00:05:04.910> that's<00:05:05.090> actually<00:05:05.270> an

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
can deploy it so that's actually an

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.960 
can deploy it so that's actually an
indication<00:05:06.260> of<00:05:06.590> how<00:05:07.040> simple<00:05:07.670> they<00:05:07.760> are<00:05:07.880> to

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
indication of how simple they are to

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.060 
indication of how simple they are to
deploy<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:08.750> that's<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.110> I<00:05:09.140> think<00:05:09.410> we<00:05:09.650> we

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
deploy but that's that I think we we

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.100 
deploy but that's that I think we we
need<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.520> respect<00:05:10.970> we<00:05:11.480> need<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.690> translate

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
need to respect we need to translate

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.040 
need to respect we need to translate
what<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:12.440> wireless<00:05:12.800> operator<00:05:13.250> terms<00:05:13.640> and

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
what the wireless operator terms and

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.510 
what the wireless operator terms and
guidelines<00:05:15.050> are<00:05:15.290> for<00:05:15.590> management<00:05:16.010> of<00:05:16.250> RF

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
guidelines are for management of RF

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.100 
guidelines are for management of RF
equipment<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:17.180> really<00:05:17.420> what<00:05:17.540> we're<00:05:17.660> doing<00:05:17.990> is

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
equipment so really what we're doing is

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.140 
equipment so really what we're doing is
translating<00:05:18.860> I<00:05:19.040> think<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:19.700> methods<00:05:20.030> and

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
translating I think the methods and

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.900 
translating I think the methods and
practices<00:05:20.270> of<00:05:20.770> typical<00:05:21.770> wireless<00:05:22.280> operators

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
practices of typical wireless operators

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.870 
practices of typical wireless operators
into<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:24.350> skill<00:05:24.620> set<00:05:24.860> of<00:05:24.890> these<00:05:25.070> folks<00:05:25.280> but

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
into the skill set of these folks but

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.190 
into the skill set of these folks but
you<00:05:26.000> need<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.180> have<00:05:26.270> some<00:05:26.420> general<00:05:26.750> electrical

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
you need to have some general electrical

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.780 
you need to have some general electrical
capability<00:05:27.800> or<00:05:27.830> electric<00:05:28.190> capabilities<00:05:28.730> you

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
capability or electric capabilities you

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.850 
capability or electric capabilities you
don't<00:05:28.940> need<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.120> be<00:05:29.210> an<00:05:29.300> RF<00:05:29.540> expert<00:05:29.960> that

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
don't need to be an RF expert that

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.590 
don't need to be an RF expert that
that's<00:05:31.130> not<00:05:31.280> required<00:05:31.700> at<00:05:31.910> all<00:05:32.030> but<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.450> need

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
that's not required at all but you need

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.580 
that's not required at all but you need
