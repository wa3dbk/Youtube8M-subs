go up this fire road and eventually end
up<00:00:14.050> on<00:00:14.200> the<00:00:14.320> summit<00:00:14.530> of<00:00:14.740> this<00:00:14.800> mountain<00:00:15.240> it's

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
up on the summit of this mountain it's

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.790 
up on the summit of this mountain it's
actually<00:00:16.540> quite<00:00:16.750> nice<00:00:16.900> up<00:00:17.140> there<00:00:17.170> I've<00:00:17.680> been

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
actually quite nice up there I've been

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.230 
actually quite nice up there I've been
there<00:00:17.860> many<00:00:18.130> times<00:00:20.850> that's<00:00:21.850> pretty<00:00:22.150> much

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
there many times that's pretty much

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.120 
there many times that's pretty much
where<00:00:22.480> we're<00:00:22.660> going<00:00:23.050> up<00:00:23.470> in<00:00:23.650> that<00:00:23.770> area

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
where we're going up in that area

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.259 
where we're going up in that area
actually<00:00:24.850> I<00:00:25.060> guess<00:00:25.240> it's<00:00:25.420> over<00:00:25.689> there<00:00:30.269> all

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
actually I guess it's over there all

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.880 
actually I guess it's over there all
right<00:00:31.420> well<00:00:31.660> I'm<00:00:31.779> gonna<00:00:31.900> voiceover<00:00:32.619> some<00:00:32.800> of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
right well I'm gonna voiceover some of

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.990 
right well I'm gonna voiceover some of
this<00:00:32.980> stuff<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:35.430> pink<00:00:36.430> mountain<00:00:36.579> is<00:00:36.820> in

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
this stuff this is pink mountain is in

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.729 
this stuff this is pink mountain is in
the<00:00:37.090> eastern<00:00:37.450> ranges<00:00:38.380> of<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.559> Rocky

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
the eastern ranges of the Rocky

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.080 
the eastern ranges of the Rocky
Mountains<00:00:38.890> it's<00:00:39.280> in<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.399> northern<00:00:39.760> BC<00:00:40.450> Canada

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
Mountains it's in the northern BC Canada

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.490 
Mountains it's in the northern BC Canada
it's<00:00:43.090> in<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.360> first<00:00:43.660> set<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:43.899> mountains<00:00:44.350> I

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
it's in the first set of mountains I

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.880 
it's in the first set of mountains I
suppose<00:00:44.890> that<00:00:45.190> are<00:00:45.280> part<00:00:45.700> of<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:46.890> Northern

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
suppose that are part of the Northern

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.229 
suppose that are part of the Northern
Rockies<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:50.200> were<00:00:50.260> built<00:00:50.530> about<00:00:51.239> 70

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
Rockies and they were built about 70

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.049 
Rockies and they were built about 70
between<00:00:52.690> 75<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.410> 50<00:00:53.530> million<00:00:53.950> years<00:00:54.309> ago<00:00:54.550> and

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
between 75 and 50 million years ago and

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
between 75 and 50 million years ago and
I<00:00:55.449> think<00:00:56.050> it<00:00:56.289> was<00:00:56.410> called<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.680> Laramide<00:00:57.129> orogeny

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
I think it was called a Laramide orogeny

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.869 
I think it was called a Laramide orogeny
mountain<00:00:59.680> building<00:00:59.949> event<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.610> built<00:01:00.789> the

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
mountain building event that built the

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.610 
mountain building event that built the
Rocky<00:01:01.090> Mountains<00:01:01.539> prior<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.109> that<00:01:02.230> all<00:01:02.469> of

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
Rocky Mountains prior to that all of

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.130 
Rocky Mountains prior to that all of
this<00:01:02.920> was<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.550> bottom<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.300> Pacific<00:01:04.420> Ocean

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
this was the bottom of the Pacific Ocean

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.240 
this was the bottom of the Pacific Ocean
these<00:01:05.860> are<00:01:06.119> oceanic<00:01:07.119> rocks<00:01:07.830> now<00:01:08.830> mountain

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
these are oceanic rocks now mountain

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.219 
these are oceanic rocks now mountain
tops<00:01:09.460> there's<00:01:10.450> actually<00:01:10.689> a<00:01:10.750> blue<00:01:10.930> grouse

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
tops there's actually a blue grouse

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.260 
tops there's actually a blue grouse
right<00:01:11.560> here<00:01:11.860> blue<00:01:12.400> grouse<00:01:12.610> are<00:01:12.820> great<00:01:13.030> big

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
right here blue grouse are great big

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.270 
right here blue grouse are great big
Partridge<00:01:14.049> like<00:01:14.290> things<00:01:14.590> doing<00:01:15.189> a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
Partridge like things doing a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160 
Partridge like things doing a
territorial<00:01:15.880> threat<00:01:16.210> display<00:01:16.600> read<00:01:16.900> up<00:01:17.049> on

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
territorial threat display read up on

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.899 
territorial threat display read up on
top<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.590> rock<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:18.159> guess<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.850> probably

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
top of that rock I guess you probably

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.310 
top of that rock I guess you probably
can't<00:01:19.420> see<00:01:19.659> him<00:01:19.750> but<00:01:19.960> he<00:01:20.020> was<00:01:20.140> quite

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
can't see him but he was quite

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.320 
can't see him but he was quite
spectacular<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.729> Rocky<00:01:27.939> Mountains

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
spectacular so the the Rocky Mountains

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.999 
spectacular so the the Rocky Mountains
are<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.659> whole<00:01:28.900> series<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.320> north<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.830> south

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
are in a whole series of north to south

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.289 
are in a whole series of north to south
ranges<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.829> in<00:01:33.040> between<00:01:33.369> their<00:01:33.579> river

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
ranges and in between their river

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.480 
ranges and in between their river
valleys<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.320> suppose<00:01:35.560> going<00:01:35.920> east<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.250> west

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
valleys and I suppose going east to west

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.660 
valleys and I suppose going east to west
there<00:01:36.729> are<00:01:36.880> mountain<00:01:37.360> passes<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.799> who<00:01:42.610> I

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
there are mountain passes on the who I

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.969 
there are mountain passes on the who I
suppose<00:01:43.000> on<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.210> south<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.750> pink<00:01:44.409> mountain<00:01:44.799> is

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
suppose on the south of pink mountain is

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.690 
suppose on the south of pink mountain is
the<00:01:45.659> half-way<00:01:46.659> River<00:01:47.079> and<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:48.070> forms<00:01:48.399> a<00:01:48.490> pass

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
the half-way River and that forms a pass

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.249 
the half-way River and that forms a pass
going<00:01:49.119> west

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.359 

way<00:01:54.259> back<00:01:54.530> in<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.829> day<00:01:55.009> I<00:01:55.700> suppose<00:01:56.390> in<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.659> 30s

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
way back in the day I suppose in the 30s

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.910 
way back in the day I suppose in the 30s
loitering<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:59.450> was<00:01:59.679> 1934<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:03.740> DOE

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
loitering it was 1934 the the DOE

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.080 
loitering it was 1934 the the DOE
expedition<00:02:04.670> actually<00:02:05.060> left<00:02:05.299> from<00:02:05.539> here<00:02:05.929> and

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
expedition actually left from here and

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.779 
expedition actually left from here and
headed<00:02:08.090> west<00:02:08.739> trying<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:09.800> get<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.190> Pacific

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
headed west trying to get to the Pacific

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.809 
headed west trying to get to the Pacific
I<00:02:10.940> think<00:02:11.150> they<00:02:11.300> were<00:02:12.040> anyways<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.430> they

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
I think they were anyways and they

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.880 
I think they were anyways and they
stopped<00:02:14.090> at<00:02:14.269> beedis<00:02:14.599> place<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.110> think<00:02:15.170> some<00:02:15.860> of

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
stopped at beedis place I think some of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.789 
stopped at beedis place I think some of
the<00:02:16.040> beauties<00:02:16.310> went<00:02:16.519> with<00:02:16.670> them<00:02:17.019> on<00:02:18.019> the

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
the beauties went with them on the

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.680 
the beauties went with them on the
halfway<00:02:19.130> River<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:19.940> south<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
halfway River just of the south that the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.199 
halfway River just of the south that the
we'll<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:21.530> they're<00:02:21.709> halfway<00:02:21.950> are<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.670> Beatty

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
we'll see they're halfway are the Beatty

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.449 
we'll see they're halfway are the Beatty
ranch<00:02:23.720> after<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.769> bit<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.660> um

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
ranch after a bit here um

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:36.000 
ranch after a bit here um
so<00:02:29.319> using<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:32.019> GoPro<00:02:33.019> helmet<00:02:33.860> there<00:02:34.340> HD<00:02:34.970> wide

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
so using a GoPro helmet there HD wide

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.550 
so using a GoPro helmet there HD wide
helmet<00:02:37.010> cam<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.519> guess<00:02:38.079> you<00:02:39.079> can<00:02:39.230> put<00:02:39.440> on

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
helmet cam I guess you can put on

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.020 

there<00:02:56.389> this<00:02:56.930> isn't<00:02:57.200> beauty<00:02:57.380> peak<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.709> is

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
there this isn't beauty peak this is

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.759 
there this isn't beauty peak this is
pink<00:02:59.030> mountain<00:02:59.180> nick<00:02:59.840> mountain<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.290> actually

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
pink mountain nick mountain is actually

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.860 
pink mountain nick mountain is actually
alpine<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.579> top<00:03:01.760> there<00:03:02.209> are<00:03:02.239> no<00:03:02.420> trees<00:03:02.720> on

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
alpine on the top there are no trees on

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
alpine on the top there are no trees on
the<00:03:02.930> top

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.509 

so<00:03:09.360> we're<00:03:09.480> heading<00:03:09.780> north<00:03:10.200> again<00:03:10.709> towards<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
so we're heading north again towards the

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.449 
so we're heading north again towards the
summit<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.879> the<00:03:11.970> mountain

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.640 

trying<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.610> face<00:03:18.080> West<00:03:19.080> here<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.590> could

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
trying to face West here so you could

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.740 
trying to face West here so you could
see<00:03:19.709> what's<00:03:20.010> going<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.550> kinda<00:03:21.300> hard<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.540> do

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
see what's going on but kinda hard to do

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.890 
see what's going on but kinda hard to do
off<00:03:22.709> in<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.010> distance<00:03:23.160> there<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:24.180> summit

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
off in the distance there is the summit

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.460 
off in the distance there is the summit
of<00:03:25.370> pink<00:03:26.370> mountain<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:27.300> in<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.080> minute<00:03:28.200> I'm

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
of pink mountain and in a minute I'm

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.720 
of pink mountain and in a minute I'm
gonna<00:03:28.590> show<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.340> difference<00:03:29.670> between

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
gonna show you the difference between

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.590 
gonna show you the difference between
the<00:03:30.540> GoPro<00:03:31.020> helmet<00:03:31.770> cam<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:33.569> flip<00:03:34.140> camera

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
the GoPro helmet cam and the flip camera

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:46.530 
the GoPro helmet cam and the flip camera
Ultra<00:03:36.600> HD

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.390 

so<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.900> using<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.260> Flip<00:03:48.920> Ultra<00:03:49.130> HD<00:03:51.400> on

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
so this is using the Flip Ultra HD on

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.059 
so this is using the Flip Ultra HD on
the<00:03:52.489> same<00:03:52.700> area<00:03:52.970> there's<00:03:53.150> BTS<00:03:53.540> old<00:03:54.069> ranch

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
the same area there's BTS old ranch

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.920 
the same area there's BTS old ranch
right<00:03:55.340> there<00:03:55.610> on<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.880> halfway<00:03:56.209> river<00:03:56.450> that's

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
right there on the halfway river that's

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.720 
right there on the halfway river that's
a<00:03:57.140> halfway<00:03:57.410> River<00:03:57.620> going<00:03:57.860> west<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:00.950> I

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
a halfway River going west this is I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.600 
a halfway River going west this is I
think<00:04:02.150> that's<00:04:02.540> called<00:04:02.920> two-bit<00:04:03.920> Creek<00:04:06.610> not

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
think that's called two-bit Creek not

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.710 
think that's called two-bit Creek not
sure<00:04:07.880> that<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:08.239> I<00:04:08.300> think<00:04:08.420> it's<00:04:08.599> a<00:04:08.660> little

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
sure that but I think it's a little

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.920 
sure that but I think it's a little
two-bit<00:04:09.110> Creek<00:04:10.150> there's<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.330> summit<00:04:11.630> off<00:04:11.810> in

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
two-bit Creek there's the summit off in

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.780 
two-bit Creek there's the summit off in
the<00:04:11.989> distance<00:04:12.970> that's<00:04:13.970> where<00:04:14.269> we're<00:04:14.420> going

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
the distance that's where we're going

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.890 
the distance that's where we're going
there's<00:04:16.790> a<00:04:16.910> road<00:04:17.180> we're<00:04:17.329> gonna<00:04:17.450> take<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.780> get

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
there's a road we're gonna take to get

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.180 
there's a road we're gonna take to get
there

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.620 

so<00:04:22.190> we're<00:04:22.400> going<00:04:22.820> up<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:24.880> yes<00:04:25.880> Ridge<00:04:26.150> Road<00:04:26.389> on

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
of radio towers things like that I'm not

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.990 
of radio towers things like that I'm not
sure<00:05:51.590> just<00:05:51.800> what<00:05:51.830> there<00:05:52.130> there's<00:05:52.370> Lily<00:05:52.640> Lake

sure just what there there's Lily Lake
on<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.330> right<00:05:53.540> there<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.520> guess<00:05:55.520> I<00:05:55.640> didn't<00:05:55.880> show

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
on the right there I guess I didn't show

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.140 
on the right there I guess I didn't show
it<00:05:56.030> very<00:05:56.300> well<00:05:57.280> it's<00:05:58.280> on<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.400> eastern<00:05:58.850> side<00:05:59.090> of

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
it very well it's on the eastern side of

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.730 
it very well it's on the eastern side of
pink<00:05:59.930> Mountain<00:06:01.900> these<00:06:02.900> radio<00:06:03.260> towers<00:06:03.620> there's

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
pink Mountain these radio towers there's

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.260 
pink Mountain these radio towers there's
no<00:06:03.830> electricity<00:06:04.250> up<00:06:04.490> here<00:06:04.700> or<00:06:04.790> anything<00:06:04.970> so

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
no electricity up here or anything so

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.260 
no electricity up here or anything so
they<00:06:05.390> have<00:06:05.870> propane<00:06:06.760> engines<00:06:07.760> and<00:06:08.030> they<00:06:08.090> seem

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
they have propane engines and they seem

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.270 
they have propane engines and they seem
to<00:06:08.390> run<00:06:08.540> generators<00:06:09.200> I<00:06:09.410> don't<00:06:09.620> know<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:10.130> can

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
to run generators I don't know you can

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.580 
to run generators I don't know you can
hear<00:06:10.460> engines<00:06:10.820> running<00:06:11.090> up<00:06:11.330> here<00:06:11.600> in<00:06:12.200> some<00:06:12.500> of

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
hear engines running up here in some of

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.320 
hear engines running up here in some of
those<00:06:12.740> buildings<00:06:13.220> and<00:06:13.940> I<00:06:14.000> think<00:06:14.210> they're

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
those buildings and I think they're

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.350 
those buildings and I think they're
running<00:06:14.450> on<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:14.780> propane<00:06:14.960> they<00:06:15.320> must<00:06:15.500> be<00:06:15.620> and

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
running on the propane they must be and

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.270 
running on the propane they must be and
there's<00:06:17.360> also<00:06:17.720> solar<00:06:18.470> panels<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.190> things

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
there's also solar panels and things

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.610 
there's also solar panels and things
