possibly<00:01:10.950> doing<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.580> little<00:01:11.960> overkill<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
possibly doing a little overkill of a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.480 
possibly doing a little overkill of a
body<00:01:13.350> drop<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.860> doing<00:01:14.040> three<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> half

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
body drop and doing three and a half

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.749 
body drop and doing three and a half
inches<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.659> once<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.740> old<00:01:16.920> frames<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:17.520> gone

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
inches so once the old frames all gone

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.700 
inches so once the old frames all gone
all<00:01:18.119> I'll<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:19.229> these<00:01:19.439> rods

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
all I'll have is just these rods

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.330 
thinking of using the old body mounts
and<00:03:23.630> cutting<00:03:23.870> them<00:03:23.960> down<00:03:23.990> but<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.800> think<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.190> want

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and cutting them down but I think I want

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.150 
and cutting them down but I think I want
to<00:03:25.400> make<00:03:25.520> my<00:03:25.700> frame<00:03:26.060> rails<00:03:26.590> closer<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.100> I

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
to make my frame rails closer in so I

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.510 
to make my frame rails closer in so I
can<00:03:28.220> have<00:03:28.430> run<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:28.970> larger<00:03:29.860> wheel<00:03:30.860> in<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
can have run a larger wheel in the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.520 
can have run a larger wheel in the
future<00:03:31.940> I'm<00:03:32.240> going<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.480> build<00:03:32.660> new<00:03:32.870> mounts<00:03:33.320> for

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
future I'm going to build new mounts for

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.230 
future I'm going to build new mounts for
those<00:03:33.710> when<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.010> comes<00:03:34.220> time<00:03:34.490> the<00:03:36.940> frame<00:03:37.940> kind

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
those when it comes time the frame kind

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.450 
those when it comes time the frame kind
of<00:03:38.360> sprung<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:38.870> little<00:03:39.200> bit<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:40.250> before<00:03:40.730> I

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
of sprung a little bit so before I

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.190 
of sprung a little bit so before I
unpacked<00:03:43.460> it<00:03:43.730> from<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.840> table<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:46.030> clamped<00:03:47.200> the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
unpacked it from the table I clamped the

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.030 
unpacked it from the table I clamped the
frame<00:03:48.500> back<00:03:48.740> to<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:49.100> old<00:03:49.250> frame<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:51.040> then

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
frame back to the old frame and then

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.190 
frame back to the old frame and then
weld<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.550> in<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:55.300> scrap<00:03:56.300> piece<00:03:56.510> of<00:03:56.570> tube<00:03:57.020> I

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
weld it in this scrap piece of tube I

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.400 
weld it in this scrap piece of tube I
have<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.790> angle<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.720> now<00:03:59.870> it's<00:04:00.140> sitting

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
have to the angle so now it's sitting

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.770 
have to the angle so now it's sitting
solid<00:04:01.250> right<00:04:01.430> where<00:04:01.580> it<00:04:01.670> needs<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.910> be<00:04:02.000> going

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
solid right where it needs to be going

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.460 
solid right where it needs to be going
to<00:04:03.020> start<00:04:03.770> cleaning<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.370> side<00:04:04.610> up<00:04:05.320> we're<00:04:06.320> all

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
to start cleaning this side up we're all

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.560 
to start cleaning this side up we're all
the<00:04:06.880> old<00:04:07.880> chalk<00:04:08.720> tabs<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.880> bag<00:04:10.880> plates<00:04:11.300> are

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
the old chalk tabs and bag plates are

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.420 
the old chalk tabs and bag plates are
going<00:04:12.050> to<00:04:12.110> get<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.290> cleaned<00:04:12.560> up<00:04:12.710> kind<00:04:13.400> of

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
going to get it cleaned up kind of

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.770 
going to get it cleaned up kind of
looking<00:04:13.700> like<00:04:13.730> this<00:04:13.970> side<00:04:14.210> to<00:04:14.330> side<00:04:14.540> it's

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
looking like this side to side it's

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.470 
looking like this side to side it's
almost<00:04:14.990> done

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
almost done

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.020 
almost done
but<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.510> cut<00:04:17.750> off<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:19.130> tower<00:04:20.170> up<00:04:21.170> here<00:04:22.030> and

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
but I cut off the the tower up here and

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.110 
but I cut off the the tower up here and
plated<00:04:23.420> it<00:04:23.680> all<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.920> tabs<00:04:25.160> are<00:04:25.400> off<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:26.000> one

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
plated it all the tabs are off that one

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.930 
plated it all the tabs are off that one
just<00:04:26.330> needs<00:04:26.420> a<00:04:26.540> little<00:04:26.630> more<00:04:26.960> finesse<00:04:27.920> but<00:04:28.610> I'm

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
just needs a little more finesse but I'm

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.220 
just needs a little more finesse but I'm
going<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.180> get<00:04:29.270> going<00:04:29.390> on<00:04:29.570> this<00:04:29.720> one<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.050> match

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
going to get going on this one to match

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.700 
going to get going on this one to match
it<00:04:30.470> like<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.800> other<00:04:30.920> side<00:04:31.100> let's<00:04:31.370> do<00:04:31.550> it
