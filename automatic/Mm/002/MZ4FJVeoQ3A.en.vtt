against<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.369> guess<00:00:17.760> leading<00:00:18.390> players<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.840> have

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
against I guess leading players we have

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.509 
against I guess leading players we have
betrayed<00:00:19.279> hey<00:00:20.279> guys<00:00:20.460> deliver<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:21.090> they

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
betrayed hey guys deliver because they

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.769 
betrayed hey guys deliver because they
came<00:00:23.519> back<00:00:23.670> from<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.029> national<00:00:24.359> team<00:00:24.600> and

week<00:00:28.250> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:31.170> reason<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.560> guess

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
week this is the reason I guess

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.870 
week this is the reason I guess
Liverpool<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.460> guess<00:00:33.120> remedied<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:34.050> I

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
Liverpool and guess remedied because I

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.280 
Liverpool and guess remedied because I
thought<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.180> better<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.690> play<00:00:36.899> in

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
thought that was better to play in

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.209 
thought that was better to play in
different<00:00:38.030> shape<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.570> least<00:00:40.040> they<00:00:41.040> were

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
different shape on the least they were

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.299 
different shape on the least they were

said<00:03:21.760> ok<00:03:22.209> i<00:03:22.630> also<00:03:22.989> we<00:03:23.290> consider<00:03:23.650> one<00:03:23.830> gone<00:03:24.040> of

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
said ok i also we consider one gone of

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.870 
said ok i also we consider one gone of
the<00:03:24.549> risk<00:03:24.730> or<00:03:24.910> but<00:03:25.150> sometimes<00:03:26.110> not<00:03:26.260> like<00:03:26.440> this

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
the risk or but sometimes not like this

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.360 
the risk or but sometimes not like this
you<00:03:27.880> need<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.090> add<00:03:28.360> more<00:03:28.570> concentration

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
you need to add more concentration

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.759 
you need to add more concentration
because<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.610> last<00:03:30.730> four<00:03:31.000> games<00:03:31.769> we

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
because in the last four games we

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.590 
because in the last four games we
improved<00:03:33.340> because<00:03:33.579> we<00:03:33.820> didn't<00:03:34.060> consider<00:03:34.329> goal

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
improved because we didn't consider goal

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.990 
improved because we didn't consider goal
on<00:03:34.750> extra<00:03:35.739> but<00:03:36.070> we<00:03:36.160> consider<00:03:36.519> three<00:03:36.700> gone<00:03:36.880> on

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
on extra but we consider three gone on

on extra but we consider three gone on
set<00:03:37.120> pieces<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.840> we<00:03:38.320> should<00:03:38.500> pay<00:03:38.680> more

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
set pieces and we should pay more

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.000

I don't think this no no no I think that
is<00:04:37.630> also<00:04:37.840> may<00:04:38.590> be<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:39.370> tired<00:04:39.639> after<00:04:40.410> european

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
is also may be so tired after european

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.560 
is also may be so tired after european
championship<00:04:41.889> but<00:04:42.100> I'm<00:04:42.460> not<00:04:42.850> worried<00:04:43.210> for<00:04:43.419> him

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
championship but I'm not worried for him

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.170 
championship but I'm not worried for him
because<00:04:43.750> also<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:45.040> when<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:45.550> not<00:04:45.790> wonder

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
because also it when is not wonder

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:55.110 
because also it when is not wonder
percentage<00:04:46.750> this<00:04:47.740> would<00:04:47.919> play<00:04:54.090> William<00:04:55.090> O

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
percentage this would play William O

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.170 
percentage this would play William O
game<00:04:55.510> almost<00:04:56.260> as<00:04:56.590> she<00:04:56.860> starts<00:04:57.250> earlier<00:04:58.060> than
