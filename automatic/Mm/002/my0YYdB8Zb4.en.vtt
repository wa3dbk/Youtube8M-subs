00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.110 
the top of the head it is about 22
inches<00:02:41.810> I'm<00:02:42.810> not<00:02:43.049> used<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.440> doing<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.860> nape

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
measurement but from the nape down it's

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.440 
measurement but from the nape down it's
about<00:02:51.540> 16<00:02:52.170> inches<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> synthetic

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
about 16 inches so this is a synthetic

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.180

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
wig it is not shiny and it is not heat

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:11.309 
wig it is not shiny and it is not heat
safe<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.989> back

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.660 

and<00:03:12.390> I'm<00:03:13.390> pretty<00:03:13.689> undecided<00:03:14.500> on<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.769> hair<00:03:15.010> it

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
and I'm pretty undecided on this hair it

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.259 
and I'm pretty undecided on this hair it
really<00:03:16.510> reminds<00:03:17.019> me<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.430> Bed<00:03:18.430> Head<00:03:18.459> bye

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
really reminds me of Bed Head bye

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.530 
really reminds me of Bed Head bye
forever<00:03:19.569> young

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.869 

but<00:03:23.500> this<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.860> about<00:03:24.099> three<00:03:24.400> or<00:03:24.549> four<00:03:24.730> times

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
but this is about three or four times

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.449 
but this is about three or four times
the<00:03:25.090> cost<00:03:25.360> because<00:03:26.349> it<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> double

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
the cost because it is a double

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.440 
the cost because it is a double
monofilament<00:03:27.909> top<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:30.310> shape<00:03:30.670> style<00:03:31.150> and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
monofilament top the shape style and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.509 
monofilament top the shape style and
color<00:03:32.340> okay

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
color okay

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.229 
color okay
so<00:03:34.200> for<00:03:35.200> myself<00:03:35.349> hair<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.219> never<00:03:36.549> as<00:03:36.819> long<00:03:37.060> as

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
so for myself hair is never as long as

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:37.800 
so for myself hair is never as long as
it<00:03:37.420> looks

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
it looks

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.849 
it looks
and<00:03:38.519> also<00:03:39.519> my<00:03:39.849> hair<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.180> very<00:03:40.209> long<00:03:40.569> so

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
and also my hair is very long so

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
seems you know there is a little bit of

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.700 
seems you know there is a little bit of
highlighting<00:05:05.850> but<00:05:06.330> because<00:05:06.840> it's<00:05:07.200> well

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
highlighting but because it's well

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.060 
highlighting but because it's well
blended<00:05:08.480> when<00:05:09.480> you<00:05:09.630> step<00:05:09.960> away<00:05:10.140> it<00:05:10.530> just<00:05:10.830> looks

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
blended when you step away it just looks

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.230 
blended when you step away it just looks
like<00:05:11.130> ash<00:05:12.110> brown<00:05:14.090> or<00:05:15.290> you<00:05:16.290> know<00:05:16.380> dark<00:05:16.710> blonde

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
like ash brown or you know dark blonde

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.390 
like ash brown or you know dark blonde
and<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.860> ends<00:05:20.460> are<00:05:20.670> lighter<00:05:22.220> see<00:05:23.220> how<00:05:23.340> the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
and the ends are lighter see how the

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.020 
and the ends are lighter see how the
ends<00:05:23.760> are<00:05:23.850> lighter<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:26.310> had<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.550> feeling

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
ends are lighter and I had a feeling

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.930 
ends are lighter and I had a feeling
that's<00:05:27.210> what<00:05:27.450> that<00:05:27.630> was<00:05:27.870> but<00:05:28.740> all<00:05:29.580> the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
that's what that was but all the

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.430 
that's what that was but all the
swatches<00:05:30.270> that<00:05:30.660> I've<00:05:30.780> seen<00:05:31.080> for<00:05:31.350> marble<00:05:31.590> brown

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
swatches that I've seen for marble brown

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.900 
swatches that I've seen for marble brown
didn't<00:05:34.440> say<00:05:34.740> it<00:05:35.070> was<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:36.330> ends<00:05:36.510> were<00:05:36.780> lighter

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
didn't say it was the ends were lighter

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:51.200 
didn't say it was the ends were lighter
so<00:05:39.380> tada<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.830> ends<00:05:41.070> are<00:05:41.130> lighter<00:05:41.370> right

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.969 

so<00:05:52.210> I'm<00:05:52.300> still<00:05:52.629> undecided<00:05:55.259> it<00:05:56.259> does<00:05:56.590> seem<00:05:56.949> a

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
so I'm still undecided it does seem a

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.969 
so I'm still undecided it does seem a
little<00:05:57.159> bit<00:05:59.069> you<00:06:00.069> know<00:06:00.479> appear<00:06:01.770> which<00:06:02.770> will

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
little bit you know appear which will

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:10.619 
little bit you know appear which will
probably<00:06:03.159> go<00:06:03.550> away<00:06:05.220> so<00:06:08.190> I'm<00:06:09.190> not<00:06:09.970> sure<00:06:10.030> if<00:06:10.330> I'm

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:10.629 
probably go away so I'm not sure if I'm

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.100 
probably go away so I'm not sure if I'm
gonna<00:06:10.870> return<00:06:11.229> it<00:06:11.289> I<00:06:11.940> probably<00:06:12.940> will<00:06:13.479> honestly

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
gonna return it I probably will honestly

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.050 
gonna return it I probably will honestly
because<00:06:17.129> you<00:06:18.129> know<00:06:18.250> when<00:06:18.490> you<00:06:18.580> first<00:06:18.789> put<00:06:19.030> it

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
because you know when you first put it

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.550 
because you know when you first put it
on<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:19.599> if<00:06:19.690> you<00:06:19.780> have<00:06:19.900> to<00:06:20.050> convince<00:06:20.349> yourself

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
on and if you have to convince yourself

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.490 
on and if you have to convince yourself
to<00:06:20.979> like<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.520> usually<00:06:23.699> you<00:06:24.699> know<00:06:24.849> I<00:06:25.319> have<00:06:26.319> to

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
I'm at that point now where I have to

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.689 
I'm at that point now where I have to
love<00:06:28.479> something<00:06:28.750> right<00:06:29.050> away

love something right away

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.480 
love something right away
cuz<00:06:30.699> there's<00:06:31.030> so<00:06:31.120> much<00:06:31.719> out<00:06:31.960> there<00:06:32.139> that<00:06:32.490> I

cuz there's so much out there that I

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.649 
cuz there's so much out there that I
want<00:06:33.879> to<00:06:34.030> narrow<00:06:34.629> it<00:06:34.840> down<00:06:35.129> and<00:06:36.360> so<00:06:37.360> this<00:06:37.509> is

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
want to narrow it down and so this is

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:42.779 
want to narrow it down and so this is
her<00:06:39.000> on<00:06:40.000> crease<00:06:40.509> Pam<00:06:40.810> she<00:06:41.319> you<00:06:42.159> know<00:06:42.190> hers

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
her on crease Pam she you know hers

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.300

looked really good on her and the color
was<00:06:45.520> really<00:06:45.789> nice<00:06:45.969> I<00:06:46.300> think<00:06:46.419> it<00:06:46.870> could<00:06:47.139> be<00:06:47.259> the

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.409 
was really nice I think it could be the
