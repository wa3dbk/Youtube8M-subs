 London is very beautiful. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.270
 you can use it just as a garnish or 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.890
 You can use it as I did now enough. 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.450

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.570

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.369
 Come on, I tried. We 're going to need 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.270
 transparency is to see in red the demand 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.580
 hot glue ink on the paper PVA 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.369
 red and styrofoam tape crepe and glue 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.130
 white and barbecue a ball of 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.020
 Your favor black and white scissors 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.840
 brush to start we'll find 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.700
 in the hotel paranÃ¡ four times this measure 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.200
 mod is available down here at 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.049
 description or on my facebook page 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.090
 all cut one whole and more 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.460
 three times we will cut into doing 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.799
 a leak here in the gnr part and she 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.229
 It looks like there are three of this piece we 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.689
 also remember this measure four times 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.240
 Let us also remember two squares of 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.939
 two centimeters by 12 and one more 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.850
 square of 13 by 13 all these pieces 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.920
 were reported on the paper parana and I already 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.680
 I painted them using pva ink 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.520
 Red you will paint her all 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.649
 sides 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.650
 let's cut two styrofoam squares 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.420
 having 11 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.370
 and a half centimeters on each side of the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.190
 Styrofoam ball can also be painted 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.240
 red and let's paint 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.430
 approximately 15 toothpicks 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.290
 red points do not need to paint what 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.780
 now we'll remember more or less 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.550
 12 cm here in transparency that 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.130
 It's to paste in the little window that the measure 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.500
 Next rope I put here and I cut 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.840
 to the eye and using the hot glue we 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.220
 let's paste here make plenty of glue 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.080
 hot and even with your fingers and let's talk 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.720
 transparency in the three parts now 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.850
 we're going to book six chosen guys 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.130
 for example and the other nine that go 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.440
 leaving the people will cut pieces of 10 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.360
 inches goes from six parts to 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.690
 each side of the cabin but you go 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.580
 use the mold places here on the side 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.680
 put the risk in the direction for you 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.959
 know where to put the chopsticks here 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.840
 There you will put 15 hot 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.400
 each side in the same direction 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.990
 remember to do this to the side that 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.209
 is already stuck inside that the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.160
 transparency and we will do this in 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.560
 three parts now we will use the 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.180
 styrofoam square and necklace with little 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.160
 hot glue not to melt well 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.810
 centered on the red square 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.209
 now we will go hot glue 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.080
 in the base of the economy put a side 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.840
 of the shirt 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.630
 after I did that I robbed me here 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.250
 said the toothpick where I want 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.470
 respect in Styrofoam and I'll pass glue 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.330
 who only in the latter for a team that 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.610
 I put one more on the other side I go 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.110
 do this now with the other sides 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.360
 only with a difference that we will 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.360
 Make hot glue here too on the side 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.180
 then paste the three booths to us 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.400
 will roll the bottom that is in full 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.459
 red that closed on one side 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.379
 first I'll close the others now 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.819
 sides and now we're going to use the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.370
 other two squares 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.439
 these four bands the styrofoam ball 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.989
 and another square of suppose that we go 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:59.659
 pick up a smaller red square and paste 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.939
 Also remember that your potentiated 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.829
 for supposing and can not spend much 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.379
 and now we're going to skip these 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.790
 Portable here on the side close to 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.920
 even if you can have a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.859
 little more shape the choir for tub 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.200
 last look looks a little bigger if 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.269
 I want to talk on the outside or if I want 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.669
 I can jump inside is so well 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.580
 so and now we'll pass glue that 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.010
 in the 4 particular centralized in the other 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.370
 red part we're going to give a pin on the 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.810
 styrofoam ball and put on the cap 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.760
 It 's ready, just let's go. 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.190
 put some details still as we go 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.660
 talk these details mark my self 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.150
 I cut some boxes of 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.680
 approximately one and a half centimeters 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.680
 people are going to put it here on the job 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.410
 now I'll make a little ball here as if 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.180
 was a family door 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.919
 on the block the people below symbolize 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.810
 ventilation inside the cabin 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.690
 then the reporter a piece of cardboard 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.909
 white and I wrote with the phone bookmark 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.099
 same in london shirt and I'll paste 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.470
 on the lid put a white glue ticket 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.320
 I 'm going to spread here brings the fifth 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.510
 straw paper so it will not stain the 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.970
 ink you wrote or even 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.280
 take off and paste centralized in the 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.530
 front and is ready to our cabin 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.560
 you can use it as decoration or 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:25.030
