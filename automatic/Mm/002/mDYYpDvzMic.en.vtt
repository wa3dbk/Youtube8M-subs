it goes where if I was in survival right
now<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:42.239> would<00:00:42.329> work<00:00:43.340> but<00:00:44.340> pretty<00:00:44.910> much<00:00:44.969> how

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
now that would work but pretty much how

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.330 
now that would work but pretty much how
it<00:00:45.270> works<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.809> there's<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.649> huge<00:00:46.860> redstone

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
it works is there's this huge redstone

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.209 
it works is there's this huge redstone
contraption<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.420> clock<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
contraption that's a little clock I the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.260 
contraption that's a little clock I the
pressure<00:00:50.460> plate<00:00:50.640> turns<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.300> cloak<00:00:51.539> clock<00:00:52.160> on

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
pressure plate turns to cloak clock on

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.319 
pressure plate turns to cloak clock on
and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:54.570> when<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> clock<00:00:55.739> goes<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.640> turns<00:00:57.210> on

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and then when the clock goes it turns on

here you have to do with the repeaters
and<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> trick<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> pistol

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and really a trick because the pistol

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.460 
and really a trick because the pistol
insurance<00:01:02.399> i<00:01:02.550> went<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.120> yeah<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> then

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
insurance i went on but yeah and then

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.210 
insurance i went on but yeah and then
that<00:01:05.100> connects<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> clock<00:01:06.659> anyway<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.950> was

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that connects to the clock anyway I was

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
that connects to the clock anyway I was
kind<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.400> spastic<00:01:08.640> um<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
kind of spastic um so I I think this is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.920 
kind of spastic um so I I think this is
it<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:15.000> don't<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.720> don't

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it going in and I don't know I don't

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.820 
it going in and I don't know I don't
know<00:01:16.080> what<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> call<00:01:16.710> this

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
simple to understand and the signs are

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.820 
simple to understand and the signs are
here<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.320> that<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.560> don't<00:04:18.770> misplace<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.489> TNT

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
here so that you don't misplace the TNT

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.010 
here so that you don't misplace the TNT
but<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:21.919> just<00:04:22.100> hit<00:04:22.280> here<00:04:22.550> with<00:04:22.730> right<00:04:22.970> click

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020

holding<00:04:24.020> right<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:25.419> eventually<00:04:26.419> it'll<00:04:26.930> stop

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
holding right and eventually it'll stop

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.740
