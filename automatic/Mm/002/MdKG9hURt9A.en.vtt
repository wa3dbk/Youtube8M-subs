00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.469
 hi to all and test axel public.fr 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.260
 we are at ce2 2014 on the center of 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.469
 samsung and I have galaxy under the eyes 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.510
 Pro Note 12.2 which is really the 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.440
 tablet that was announced at the cs the most 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.020
 top of the line 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.270
 because of one it's one of the biggest 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.930
 screens there is also a table cros 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.510
 12.2 but this one is also equipped with a 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.930
 espen that we have right here but who must 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.510
 tidy up somewhere there a veil to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.700
 share justice '' ok so we go 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.200
 linger pretty quickly so 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.460
 we are not going to spend so much time 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.140
 a little time with this tablet 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.060
 so at the level of the specs we have a screen 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.220
 12.1 of these from wqs g to 2560 by 1600 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.520
 like on other tablets that we could 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.809
 take in hand for now android 4 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.570
 4 points with overcoat like you 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.149
 can see it 3 giga of ram this is the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.329
 big difference also with the 12.2 the 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.829
 table pro 12.2 32 64 giga plus 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.630
 possibility to put a micro sd 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.430
 you can still have a lot of 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.979
 memory on this big tablet a 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.319
 8 megapixel camera at the back 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.020
 2 megapixels in the front a big 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.959
 battery of 9500 thousands in loss and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.670
 it's a terminal that is wifi only if 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:21.020
 I'm not wrong yeah there's no 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.429
 look like this lot for them for 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.079
 a simon will watch that worry you 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.069
 not then we'll go around the 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.649
 So large tablet screen up there 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.780
 carvin the front camera a sensor 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.030
 finally some sensors 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.479
 wow we welcome a little ax and 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.240
 back on the right 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:46.280
 naked on the right and stays at six draws and 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.440
 3 USB speakers Micro SD and sim 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.729
 ok we have a map a location for 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.119
 me too but here I look at the specs 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.830
 I have not in my opinion made 3 to effect 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.330
 alger but if so sorry excuseez 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.880
 me that actually there are two versions a 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.149
 wifi version that weighs 750 grams and a 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.729
 version 3g is what makes 7 153 g 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.090
 so that's pretty interesting in 4g there 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.390
 above you are well infrared mic 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.070
 by microphones second micro volume to 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:21.019
 nine speakers the other part of the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.120
 speaker jack has nothing to report in 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.310
 below at the back the in this 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.540
 white version and in my opinion this is the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.800
 same thing about others wait and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.800
 I 'm just going to check is quick 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.430
 so the black I went to touch the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.549
 table and another case he looked at me 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.500
 oddly so here I am age is so 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.850
 there on this one in white the matter to 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.030
 the back is like on the # 3 was 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.650
 plastic couple lice on the black 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.840
 it's rubbery plastic 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.489
 so that's important to note it 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.720
 is the least pleasant certainly a 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.950
 white version I find I understand 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.150
 not even why I did not remember 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.680
 only basic tank and on the same 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.720
 version of the butter market and there you 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.060
 have the camera ok then 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.350
 quickly on this tablet though 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.160
 I can put it back well as he 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.890
 must on his bag his little base 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.069
 what we have 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.530
 here we are going to be better we have a 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.590
 magazine type interface like on 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.520
 others with the for example the weather and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.370
 et cetera news in box 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.290
 schedule the cn as office this is the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.850
 new office suite which has been who has 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.580
 been chosen by his cash lesson did 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.770
 else it's pretty much everything we have on 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.650
 multi window that will fetch on the side 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:43.989
 here with on this one because of the big 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:48.690
 screen and ram the possibility of in 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.739
 put 4 that's pretty cool 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.670
 here you can do your stuff like 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.239
 that's mega mega multitasking so that 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.400
 it's great 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:03.610
 I like multi multi qua no not 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.140
 multi the main menu is this glider 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.060
 of course there we start to get into 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.680
 the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.450
 in little more advanced applications 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.239
 since we are on a terminal of the series 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.670
 black what do we have other is 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.100
 maybe linger richer note i 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.350
 looked at the camera quickos yeah 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.490
 it is this interface 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:27.510
 I was a child it will be already I 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:33.300
 remembers most useful faith of the tubes is 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:39.290
 expected here are six beauty serial modes 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.290

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:50.760
 not in the end or June I was watching the 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.990
 messages like that the keyboard that looks 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.760
 to have been reworked you see ah 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.860
 yes it's true that a new system of 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.630
 keyboard that has a small name it seems to me 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.830
 than 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.630
 it was in the press release I 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.130
 reminds me more but you really have 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.360
 normally ac the life that gives to 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.700
 brave and more the impression of supporting 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.750
 on keys already visually we have 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.760
 the impression of pressing the keys 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.340
 and you have a small vibration 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.140
 also attested I would love to test 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.560
 see what it looks like we have the features 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.170

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.350
 multi view multi window that appears 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:24.980
 sebo why I think I have a bug 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:28.160
 was waiting it's a bit strange simple 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.590
 sebha so can I access 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.420
 his sail then there the notifications all 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.270
 this is the last thing I wanted 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.550
 show you its interactions 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.350
 possible with the pen s then I 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.510
 discover so I see here is here yesterday 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.070

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.730
 justice '' scrapbook hours screenwriting 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.620
 the Windows phones windows remember 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.150
 you draw a good on the screen and 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.350
 you can view an application 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.380
 the application of your choice 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.520
 the music in the area that's pretty much 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.560
 if it fits 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.050
 last thing I wanted to see is 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.300
 the new flagship app news 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:18.300

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:20.920
 note that quite responsive 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.540
 these assets is not bad knowing that 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.130
 not bad 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.540
 there is what to mouth of the convent to the aj 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.360
 auxerre we have a system that's a 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.950
 zoom system I believe yeah ok that 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.300
 that's good it was a little borrowed lg 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.370
 but it's a good thing 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.160
 so there we can draw we can add 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.780
 pictures etc etc 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.810
