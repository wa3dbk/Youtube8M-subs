foundations<00:01:19.290> um<00:01:20.180> because<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.509> makes<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
foundations um because this makes the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.050

perfect color shade and they're about
the<00:01:24.240> same<00:01:24.390> consistency<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.290> they're<00:01:25.439> easy<00:01:25.619> to

the same consistency so they're easy to
mix<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.369> especially<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.780> need<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

make sure that you shake it up um so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.480
