of the product lastly I find that it's
easiest<00:00:32.780> to<00:00:33.019> just<00:00:33.410> stick<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.160> viewfinder

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
easiest to just stick to the viewfinder

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.969 
easiest to just stick to the viewfinder
but<00:00:35.150> you<00:00:35.510> can<00:00:35.659> also<00:00:35.809> use<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.350> screen<00:00:36.680> with<00:00:36.949> the

manual focus mode and I don't need to

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.309 
manual focus mode and I don't need to
completely<00:02:07.429> fill<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:07.939> entire<00:02:08.360> frame<00:02:08.840> with

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
completely fill the entire frame with

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.399 
completely fill the entire frame with

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
the white sheet of paper just a center

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.680 
the white sheet of paper just a center
portion<00:02:12.890> surrounding<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.940> center<00:02:14.209> focusing

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690

point<00:02:14.959> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
point the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.100 
point the
why<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.070> set<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.580> lens<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:17.090> manual<00:02:17.480> focuses

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
why I set the lens to manual focuses

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.410 
why I set the lens to manual focuses
because<00:02:18.530> when<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.340> look<00:02:19.850> at<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.090> white<00:02:20.240> piece

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
because when I look at the white piece

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.300 
because when I look at the white piece
of<00:02:20.450> paper<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.350> camera<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.740> not<00:02:21.890> going<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.160> have

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
of paper the camera is not going to have

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.300 
of paper the camera is not going to have
any<00:02:22.550> contrast<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.390> order<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.930> focus<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
any contrast in order to focus so the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.610 
any contrast in order to focus so the
auto<00:02:25.520> focus<00:02:25.790> just<00:02:26.240> won't<00:02:26.420> work<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.960> because

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
auto focus just won't work and because

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.350 
auto focus just won't work and because
the<00:02:27.770> camera<00:02:27.920> won't<00:02:28.250> be<00:02:28.400> able<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.640> find<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.000> focus

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
the camera won't be able to find a focus

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.290 
the camera won't be able to find a focus
it<00:02:29.810> also<00:02:29.960> won't<00:02:30.230> take<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> picture<00:02:30.970> now<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.000> use

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
it also won't take a picture now I use

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.060 
it also won't take a picture now I use
the<00:02:32.450> manual<00:02:32.630> focus<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:33.800> capture

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
the manual focus just so I can capture

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.070 
the manual focus just so I can capture
the<00:02:34.370> image<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.270> doesn't<00:02:35.570> mean<00:02:35.720> that<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
the image but that doesn't mean that the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.250 
the image but that doesn't mean that the
image<00:02:36.290> has<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.560> be<00:02:36.710> in<00:02:36.980> focus<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.780> just<00:02:39.020> point

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
image has to be in focus so just point

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.560

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
is great for composition but in this

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.530 
is great for composition but in this
mode<00:04:03.260> I'm<00:04:03.620> forced<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.280> use<00:04:04.519> the<00:04:04.730> manual<00:04:04.910> focus

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.310 
mode I'm forced to use the manual focus
I<00:04:05.830> can<00:04:06.830> use<00:04:07.340> auto<00:04:07.670> focus<00:04:08.150> if<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.630> go<00:04:08.840> into<00:04:09.110> my

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
I can use auto focus if I go into my

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.830 
I can use auto focus if I go into my
custom<00:04:09.860> functions<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.640> set<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.630> auto

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
custom functions and set it to auto

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.660 
custom functions and set it to auto
focus<00:04:12.320> there<00:04:12.590> are<00:04:12.650> two<00:04:12.860> auto<00:04:13.130> focusing

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
focus there are two auto focusing

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.240 
focus there are two auto focusing
options<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:15.170> don't<00:04:15.560> think<00:04:15.830> that's<00:04:16.010> really

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
options but I don't think that's really

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.770 
options but I don't think that's really
worth<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.609> because<00:04:16.790> manual<00:04:17.269> focus<00:04:17.600> works

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
worth it because manual focus works

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.990 
worth it because manual focus works
really<00:04:18.109> quite<00:04:18.500> well<00:04:18.680> when<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.340> zoom<00:04:19.580> into<00:04:19.790> the

really quite well when you zoom into the
image<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:21.260> what<00:04:21.410> I<00:04:21.440> mean<00:04:21.680> by<00:04:21.859> that<00:04:22.070> is

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.990

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
focus the subject and you should be able

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.010 
focus the subject and you should be able
to<00:04:46.889> get<00:04:47.069> that<00:04:47.310> in<00:04:47.580> sharp<00:04:47.999> focus<00:04:48.060> what<00:04:48.719> you<00:04:48.840> see

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
to get that in sharp focus what you see

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.260 
to get that in sharp focus what you see
here<00:04:49.409> in<00:04:49.529> sharp<00:04:50.159> focus<00:04:50.219> will<00:04:50.699> definitely<00:04:51.090> come

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
here in sharp focus will definitely come

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.499 
here in sharp focus will definitely come
out<00:04:51.300> in<00:04:51.719> the<00:04:52.199> final<00:04:52.499> image<00:04:52.680> as<00:04:53.029> sharp<00:04:54.029> focus

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
out in the final image as sharp focus

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.600 
out in the final image as sharp focus
now<00:04:55.259> the<00:04:55.319> reason<00:04:55.620> why<00:04:55.740> mine<00:04:56.009> is<00:04:56.039> not<00:04:56.249> currently

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
now the reason why mine is not currently

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.760 
now the reason why mine is not currently
focus<00:04:56.969> is<00:04:57.090> because<00:04:57.360> I'm<00:04:57.509> much<00:04:57.689> too<00:04:57.900> close<00:04:58.169> to

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
focus is because I'm much too close to

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.739 
focus is because I'm much too close to
the<00:04:58.919> subject<00:04:59.159> given<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.240> lens<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.629> I'm

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
probably don't want to use this for

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.980 
probably don't want to use this for
composition<00:05:28.949> I<00:05:29.339> can<00:05:29.520> use<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:30.240> viewfinder<00:05:30.960> for

you<00:05:44.189> need<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.430> do<00:05:44.550> is<00:05:44.699> just<00:05:44.879> press<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.270> set

to<00:05:48.210> avoid<00:05:48.750> this<00:05:49.020> mode<00:05:49.319> I<00:05:49.560> don't<00:05:49.919> think<00:05:50.129> it's

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
to avoid this mode I don't think it's

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.700 
to avoid this mode I don't think it's
necessary<00:05:50.819> and<00:05:51.089> I<00:05:51.659> think<00:05:51.689> you<00:05:52.110> can<00:05:52.289> use<00:05:52.500> the
