sleeping<00:01:07.939> with<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.330> overnight<00:01:08.600> I'm<00:01:08.990> going

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
sleeping with this overnight I'm going

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.050 
sleeping with this overnight I'm going
to<00:01:09.409> make<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:09.680> more<00:01:09.830> secure<00:01:10.190> but<00:01:10.369> Anita<00:01:10.670> ends<00:01:10.970> on

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
to make it more secure but Anita ends on

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.440 
to make it more secure but Anita ends on
my<00:01:11.150> hair<00:01:11.390> with<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.570> bobby<00:01:11.780> pin

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.180 

continue<00:01:17.450> these<00:01:17.600> steps<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.259> other<00:01:18.409> side

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.800 

this<00:01:22.190> method<00:01:22.610> works<00:01:22.820> especially<00:01:23.060> well<00:01:23.450> if<00:01:23.720> you

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
this method works especially well if you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.600 
this method works especially well if you
have<00:01:23.960> thin<00:01:24.170> hair<00:01:24.200> because<00:01:24.770> using<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.130> sock<00:01:25.399> as<00:01:25.580> a

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
have thin hair because using a sock as a

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.370 
have thin hair because using a sock as a
tool<00:01:25.940> will<00:01:26.119> widen<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.570> base<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.899> your<00:01:26.930> bun<00:01:27.170> and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
tool will widen the base of your bun and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.399 
tool will widen the base of your bun and
allow<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.920> have<00:01:28.009> big<00:01:28.250> loose<00:01:28.610> curls<00:01:29.229> if<00:01:30.229> you

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
allow you to have big loose curls if you

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:31.660 
allow you to have big loose curls if you
hear<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:30.590> super<00:01:30.979> thick<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.250> heavy

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
hear it super thick and heavy

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.460 
hear it super thick and heavy
I'd<00:01:31.940> recommend<00:01:32.299> dividing<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:32.990> into<00:01:33.110> four

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
I'd recommend dividing it into four

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.840 
I'd recommend dividing it into four
smaller<00:01:33.830> sections<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.520> using<00:01:34.940> four<00:01:35.149> socks

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
smaller sections and using four socks

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.370 
smaller sections and using four socks
now<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.149> have<00:01:38.300> your<00:01:38.450> hair<00:01:38.659> up<00:01:38.690> going<00:01:39.350> to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
now that you have your hair up going to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.809 
now that you have your hair up going to
start<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.979> waiting<00:01:40.340> game

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
start the waiting game

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.210 
start the waiting game
if<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.600> dampen<00:01:41.810> your<00:01:42.110> hair<00:01:42.259> just<00:01:42.530> lightly<00:01:42.860> it

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
if you dampen your hair just lightly it

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.710 
if you dampen your hair just lightly it
shouldn't<00:01:43.550> take<00:01:43.580> more<00:01:43.850> than<00:01:43.909> two<00:01:44.149> hours<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.690> be

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
shouldn't take more than two hours to be

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.290 
shouldn't take more than two hours to be
completely<00:01:45.229> dry<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.860> want<00:01:46.580> my<00:01:46.640> curls<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.090> last

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
completely dry I want my curls to last
