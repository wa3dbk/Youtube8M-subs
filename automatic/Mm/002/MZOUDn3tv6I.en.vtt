 available now that the site also 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.550
 Internet for mobile devices is a 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.520
 social flash service you must mind of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.000

 anonymous a service sounds familiar to you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.199
 such 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.870
 exact to the skin 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 basically it is identical indeed we have 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.219
 got what changes a little 32 than in 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.320
 those in my opinion have more interface 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.719
 intuitive and certainly the daughter of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.880
 instagram the profile less identical to 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.770
 that of instagram born much more to the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.010
 this hand always illuminated a lot 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.409
 degree with number one would have tasks 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.030
 I am deficient when I do these 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.909
 things more comical than in his mouth 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.490
 I said even if completely 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.130
 refer place you have various pils 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.040
 of the various answers and is simpler 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.790
 be able to ask questions 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.080
 at the same time to people with 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.630
 Which 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.820
 we interact it is also possible to make his own 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.710
 the move of the kind but here is definitely 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.250
 faster and in this way I am more 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.170
 urged to ask more questions 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.260
 people at the same time then of 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.480
 receive elisa on these social networks does not see 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.490
 wait to hear your phone 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.650
 draws his attention to the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.500
 fir equity notification that's why I did 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.540
 in his own way so much allowed 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.130
 you are identical pockets spend because so 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.780
 equal to last secon do you are 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.080
 precisely for these things my theories 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.180
 delirium plots and I don't go out 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.310
 I never get out of it that hard 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.840
 get out of the house but not because I like ice 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.620
 of reasons why I spent my days 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.640
 to reflect on this thing of the various 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.020
 plots that there are people of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.520
 comet heard I notice that we have been 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.220
 happy as it fails to tick 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.870
 something of mind can be annoying 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.060
 He had replicated the debates asca games 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.680
 born in jesi and therefore in my opinion this is 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.990
 what the facebook answer 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.690
 suitable and among other things there are thin ho 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.630
 made the profile let us video thought of 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.180
 find it or even an even malicious profile 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.180
 apart from that they are not corn 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.550
 everything is ok with her on Saturdays not 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.800
 you obviously do it simply 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.150
 a little to shed light on weighing this 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.710
 application of the moment also because 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.050
 we eat in the open has gone talking 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.880
 a little with you and make us this generate 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.800
 all together and say that trivial 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.760
 I think these are the plans of 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:13.190
 facebook to these are the dog rooms that 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:14.990
 Facebook is embarrassing us because 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:25.420
 I'm finishing everyone saw me edging 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:25.420
 according to me because I am sad and tuna
