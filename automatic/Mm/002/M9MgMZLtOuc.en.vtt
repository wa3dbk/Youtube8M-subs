00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hi I'm Steve Jones I'm going to tell you

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.410 
hi I'm Steve Jones I'm going to tell you
a<00:00:02.669> little<00:00:02.790> bit<00:00:02.909> about<00:00:03.600> trace<00:00:04.140> fossils<00:00:04.680> now<00:00:05.609> you

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
a little bit about trace fossils now you

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
a little bit about trace fossils now you
all<00:00:06.629> are<00:00:07.639> interested<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.790> dinosaurs<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:10.080> and

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
all are interested in dinosaurs and and

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.890 
all are interested in dinosaurs and and
all<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.309> these<00:00:11.460> animals<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.210> know<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.780> you

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
all of these animals we know that you

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.680 
all of these animals we know that you
find<00:00:13.259> big<00:00:13.590> dinosaur<00:00:14.370> bones<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.389> find

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
find big dinosaur bones and you find

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.109 
find big dinosaur bones and you find
shells<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.949> animals<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.699> can<00:00:17.850> find

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
shells of animals and you can find

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.320 
shells of animals and you can find
snails<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.050> big<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.070> forth<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.210> all

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
snails this big and so forth and we all

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.179 
snails this big and so forth and we all
wonder<00:00:21.779> at<00:00:21.900> these<00:00:22.080> wonderful<00:00:22.529> things<00:00:22.560> but

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
wonder at these wonderful things but

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.160 
wonder at these wonderful things but
they<00:00:23.310> don't<00:00:23.640> actually<00:00:23.910> tell<00:00:24.660> us<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> great<00:00:25.050> deal

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
they don't actually tell us a great deal

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.370 
they don't actually tell us a great deal
about<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.609> conditions<00:00:27.210> at<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> time<00:00:28.140> these

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
about the conditions at the time these

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.880 
about the conditions at the time these
animals<00:00:28.890> were<00:00:29.070> living<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.260> sometimes<00:00:31.260> we

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
animals were living and sometimes we

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.010 
animals were living and sometimes we
find<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.940> by<00:00:33.149> finding<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.809> animals

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
find out not by finding the animals

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.510 
find out not by finding the animals
themselves<00:00:34.550> but<00:00:35.550> by<00:00:35.820> finding<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.540> traces<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
themselves but by finding the traces and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.299 
themselves but by finding the traces and
the<00:00:38.520> trace<00:00:38.790> would<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.260> mammoth<00:00:40.920> bone

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the trace would not be a mammoth bone

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.790 
the trace would not be a mammoth bone
but<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> mammoth<00:00:43.070> footprint<00:00:44.149> for<00:00:45.149> example<00:00:45.800> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
but a mammoth footprint for example so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.670 
but a mammoth footprint for example so
if<00:00:46.950> i<00:00:47.100> find<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.579> huge<00:00:48.000> footprint<00:00:48.780> about<00:00:49.379> this

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
if i find a huge footprint about this

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.540 
if i find a huge footprint about this
across<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.629> i<00:00:51.629> find<00:00:52.140> next<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.920> mammoth

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
across and i find next to it a mammoth

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
across and i find next to it a mammoth
it's<00:00:54.210> probably<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> mammoth<00:00:55.020> footprint<00:00:55.500> i<00:00:55.710> can

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's probably a mammoth footprint i can

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
it's probably a mammoth footprint i can
tell<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> lot<00:00:56.550> from<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.969> footprint<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:58.170> far

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
tell a lot from that footprint how far

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.729 
tell a lot from that footprint how far
it<00:00:58.890> sank<00:00:59.280> into<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> mud<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.960> tells<00:01:01.350> me<00:01:01.469> how

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
it sank into the mud that tells me how

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.670 
it sank into the mud that tells me how
soft<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> mud<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.930> how<00:01:04.080> heavy<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
soft the mud was and how heavy of the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.000 
soft the mud was and how heavy of the
mammoth<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:06.450> other<00:01:06.750> kinds<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.439> things<00:01:07.740> we

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
mammoth was the other kinds of things we

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.149 
mammoth was the other kinds of things we
might<00:01:08.220> find<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> mammoth

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
might find so we know it's not a mammoth

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.200 
might find so we know it's not a mammoth
bone<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:13.200> don't<00:01:13.380> find<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.920> worm<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:15.060> we

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
bone and we don't find a worm but we

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.620 
bone and we don't find a worm but we
might<00:01:15.450> find<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> tunnel<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:17.040> worm<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
might find the tunnel of a worm and the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050 
might find the tunnel of a worm and the
reason<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.430> worm<00:01:20.670> will

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
reason for that is that the worm will

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.160 
reason for that is that the worm will
burrow<00:01:22.850> under<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.830> mud<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.299> as

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
burrow under the mud in this way and as

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.859 
burrow under the mud in this way and as
it<00:01:28.350> does<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.070> produces<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:30.060> thing

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
it does so it produces a little thing

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.690 
it does so it produces a little thing
called<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.229> worm<00:01:31.530> cast<00:01:34.009> this<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.310> tell<00:01:35.520> us<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
called a worm cast this can tell us a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840 
called a worm cast this can tell us a
great<00:01:35.880> deal<00:01:36.590> we<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> worm<00:01:38.490> burrows

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
great deal we know that the worm burrows

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
great deal we know that the worm burrows
down<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.650> find<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.939> rock<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:43.500> remains

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
down so if we find in a rock the remains

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.160 
down so if we find in a rock the remains
of<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.670> worm<00:01:44.880> tunnel<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.540> what<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> will<00:01:46.140> look

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of a worm tunnel and what it will look

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.530 
of a worm tunnel and what it will look
like<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:47.149> probably<00:01:48.259> dark<00:01:49.259> material<00:01:50.299> inside<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
like is probably dark material inside of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.190 
like is probably dark material inside of
light<00:01:52.110> material<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.119> this<00:01:54.119> material<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
light material and this material at the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160 
light material and this material at the
end<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:56.430> find<00:01:56.909> something<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
end if we find something like that it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.429 
end if we find something like that it
tells<00:01:58.649> us<00:01:58.950> which<00:01:59.490> way<00:01:59.850> up<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.689> rock<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
tells us which way up that this rock is

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.130 
tells us which way up that this rock is
and<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.490> very<00:02:02.700> important<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and that is very important that is a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.130 
and that is very important that is a
worm<00:02:04.439> cast<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.240> trace<00:02:06.840> fossil

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
worm cast this is a trace fossil

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.400 
worm cast this is a trace fossil
sometimes<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:11.270> glacier

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
sometimes on a glacier

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.130 
sometimes on a glacier
you<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.740> ice<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:16.140> ice<00:02:17.420> flows<00:02:18.420> down<00:02:18.810> let's

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
you get ice and the ice flows down let's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.980 
you get ice and the ice flows down let's
say<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.350> look<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.680> huge<00:02:20.070> chunk<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.670> ice<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.210> in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
say you look a huge chunk of ice and in

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.790 
say you look a huge chunk of ice and in
the<00:02:22.140> bottom<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.800> are<00:02:23.010> embedded<00:02:23.850> rocks<00:02:24.800> like

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the bottom of it are embedded rocks like

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.980 
the bottom of it are embedded rocks like
this<00:02:27.170> what<00:02:28.170> happens<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.120> rock<00:02:30.480> here

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
this what happens if this is rock here

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.160 
this what happens if this is rock here
as<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:32.520> ice<00:02:32.960> moves<00:02:33.960> down<00:02:34.820> these<00:02:35.820> rocks<00:02:36.330> create

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
as the ice moves down these rocks create

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.270 
as the ice moves down these rocks create
grooves<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.900> looking<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:40.050> those<00:02:40.260> grooves<00:02:40.620> we

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
grooves and looking at those grooves we

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.810 
grooves and looking at those grooves we
can<00:02:41.550> tell<00:02:41.910> which<00:02:42.570> direction<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.890> ice<00:02:44.160> was

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
can tell which direction the ice was

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.380 
can tell which direction the ice was
moving<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.620> know<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.340> rock<00:02:47.790> was

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
moving so we know that this rock was

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.990 
moving so we know that this rock was
covered<00:02:48.810> with<00:02:48.840> ice<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.980> ice<00:02:50.250> was<00:02:50.610> moving

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
covered with ice and the ice was moving

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.330 
covered with ice and the ice was moving
in<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.210> certain<00:02:51.450> direction<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:52.680> tells<00:02:53.130> us

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
in a certain direction this tells us

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.790 
in a certain direction this tells us
quite<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> lot<00:02:53.970> about<00:02:54.210> what<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.290> conditions

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
quite a lot about what the conditions

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.420 
quite a lot about what the conditions
were<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.870> isn't<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.350> physical<00:02:58.800> thing

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
were like so this isn't a physical thing

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.790 
were like so this isn't a physical thing
this<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:01.010> trace<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.720> why<00:03:04.020> trace

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
this is a trace so this is why trace

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.630 
this is a trace so this is why trace
fossils<00:03:05.370> are<00:03:05.550> really<00:03:06.180> useful
