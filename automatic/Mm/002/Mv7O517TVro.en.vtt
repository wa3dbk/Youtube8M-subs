you<00:02:11.500> really<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:12.220> gwyneth<00:02:12.580> because<00:02:13.230> she's

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
you really like gwyneth because she's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.870 
you really like gwyneth because she's
kind<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:17.230> innocence<00:02:18.190> not<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.550> right<00:02:18.700> word

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
kind of not innocence not the right word

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.080 
kind of not innocence not the right word
but<00:02:19.209> she<00:02:19.959> really<00:02:20.349> is<00:02:20.640> learning<00:02:21.640> everything

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
but she really is learning everything

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.500 
but she really is learning everything
along<00:02:22.750> with<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.680> as<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.220> reader<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.420> think

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
along with you as the reader and I think

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.360 
along with you as the reader and I think
that's<00:02:25.660> why<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.020> liked<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.890> main<00:02:27.040> character

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
that's why I liked the main character

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.540 
that's why I liked the main character
Gwyneth<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.790> much<00:02:27.970> now<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
Gwyneth so much now one of the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.729 
Gwyneth so much now one of the
characters<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.270> absolutely<00:02:31.930> adored<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
characters that I absolutely adored and

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.880 
characters that I absolutely adored and
this<00:02:32.920> book<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.690> Leslie<00:02:34.690> which<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.440> Gwyneth

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
this book is Leslie which is Gwyneth

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.390 
this book is Leslie which is Gwyneth
best<00:02:36.160> friend<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.730> also<00:02:37.830> should<00:02:38.830> definitely

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
best friend and also should definitely

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.699 
best friend and also should definitely
grow<00:02:39.880> up<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.269> become<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.840> detective<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.620> I

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
grow up and become a detective and I

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.140 
grow up and become a detective and I
think<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.099> Kirsten<00:02:42.550> should<00:02:42.760> take<00:02:43.000> that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
think that Kirsten should take that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.490 
think that Kirsten should take that
character<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:43.750> maybe<00:02:43.870> write<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.110> series<00:02:44.319> about

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
character and maybe write a series about

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.070 
character and maybe write a series about
her<00:02:44.739> because<00:02:45.069> she's<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.640> funny<00:02:46.080> especially

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
her because she's so funny especially

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.360 
her because she's so funny especially
she<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.160> Gwen<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.489> together<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:50.069> Gwyneth<00:02:51.069> has

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
she and Gwen it together but Gwyneth has

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.410 
she and Gwen it together but Gwyneth has
to<00:02:51.880> time<00:02:52.450> travel<00:02:52.660> with<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.709> male<00:02:54.640> counterpart

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
to time travel with a male counterpart

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.370 
to time travel with a male counterpart
who<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.140> from<00:02:56.470> another<00:02:56.650> family<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:59.319> she

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
who is from another family and so she

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.370 
who is from another family and so she
meets<00:02:59.920> Gideon<00:03:00.580> who<00:03:03.060> really<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.269> mean<00:03:04.569> Kirsten

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
meets Gideon who really I mean Kirsten

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.720 
meets Gideon who really I mean Kirsten
did<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.560> great<00:03:05.739> job<00:03:05.769> appealing<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.580> me<00:03:06.700> because

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
did a great job appealing to me because

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.600 
did a great job appealing to me because
I<00:03:07.680> tend<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.769> like<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.130> tall<00:03:09.310> dark<00:03:09.519> and

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
I tend to like the tall dark and

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.789 
I tend to like the tall dark and
handsome<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:11.080> green<00:03:11.260> eyes<00:03:11.410> don't<00:03:11.709> hurt

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
handsome and the green eyes don't hurt

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.759 
handsome and the green eyes don't hurt
and<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.610> Gideon<00:03:13.360> is<00:03:13.600> automatically<00:03:14.319> someone

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
and so Gideon is automatically someone

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.520 
and so Gideon is automatically someone
that<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.100> think<00:03:15.370> oh<00:03:15.519> man<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.570> would<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.350> this

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
that I think oh man I I would like this

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.880 
that I think oh man I I would like this
character<00:03:17.859> in<00:03:18.100> real<00:03:18.280> life<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:19.440> he<00:03:20.440> comes

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
character in real life and he comes

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.490 
character in real life and he comes
across<00:03:21.040> at<00:03:21.430> first<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.940> little<00:03:22.030> male<00:03:22.900> chauvinist

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
across at first a little male chauvinist

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.509 
across at first a little male chauvinist
I<00:03:23.680> think<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.430> at<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.700> same<00:03:24.970> time<00:03:25.980> he<00:03:26.980> when<00:03:27.430> he

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
I think but at the same time he when he

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.670 
I think but at the same time he when he
acts<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.910> way<00:03:28.060> is<00:03:28.359> around<00:03:28.660> other<00:03:28.840> people<00:03:29.320> so

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
acts that way is around other people so

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.349 
acts that way is around other people so
I<00:03:29.709> don't<00:03:29.980> think<00:03:30.160> that<00:03:30.280> he<00:03:30.549> wants<00:03:30.940> everyone<00:03:31.329> to

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
I don't think that he wants everyone to

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.670 
I don't think that he wants everyone to
know<00:03:31.510> what<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.049> good<00:03:32.590> guy<00:03:32.829> he<00:03:33.400> really<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.790> um

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
know what a good guy he really is um

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.250 
know what a good guy he really is um
gwyneth<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.799> brave<00:03:36.600> even<00:03:37.600> if<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.900> does<00:03:38.109> come

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
gwyneth is brave even if it does come

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.630 
gwyneth is brave even if it does come
across<00:03:38.739> as<00:03:39.630> stupid<00:03:40.630> sometimes<00:03:41.489> because<00:03:42.489> she

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
across as stupid sometimes because she

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.460 
across as stupid sometimes because she
does<00:03:42.850> things<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.359> you<00:03:43.450> think<00:03:43.690> what<00:03:44.019> are<00:03:44.230> you

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
does things that you think what are you

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.390 
does things that you think what are you
doing<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:46.000> but<00:03:46.720> ends<00:03:47.140> up<00:03:47.230> being<00:03:47.470> an<00:03:48.010> act<00:03:48.280> of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
doing but but ends up being an act of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.319 
doing but but ends up being an act of
bravery<00:03:48.640> in<00:03:49.120> most<00:03:49.359> cases<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:51.310> think<00:03:52.150> that

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
bravery in most cases and I think that

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.360 
bravery in most cases and I think that
her<00:03:52.480> inquisitive<00:03:52.989> nature<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.769> really<00:03:54.100> does

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
her inquisitive nature it really does

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.890 
her inquisitive nature it really does
steer<00:03:55.200> steer<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.350> plot<00:03:56.590> steer<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.220> story<00:03:57.519> and

steer steer the plot steer the story and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.080 
steer steer the plot steer the story and
and<00:03:58.900> that's<00:03:59.109> something<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.590> you<00:04:00.400> don't<00:04:00.670> see

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090
