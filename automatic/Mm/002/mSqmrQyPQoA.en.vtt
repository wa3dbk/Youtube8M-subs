00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
now to turn this model into an 8 Ball

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.170 
now to turn this model into an 8 Ball
side<00:00:02.970> pocket<00:00:03.950> we<00:00:04.950> have<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.310> unfold<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.029> back

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
of it so are the science of it more like

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.050 
of it so are the science of it more like
so<00:00:13.170> pull<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.549> pull<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.849> out<00:00:15.030> and

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
so pull this out and pull this out and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
so pull this out and pull this out and
here<00:00:25.070> okay<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:27.289> what<00:00:28.289> we're<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> do

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
here okay and now what we're going to do

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.000 
here okay and now what we're going to do
is<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.460> basically<00:00:30.119> wrap<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.500> around<00:00:34.010> so

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
is just basically wrap this around so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.049 
is just basically wrap this around so
what<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:36.030> clap<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
what you can do is first clap it and

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.619 
what you can do is first clap it and
fold<00:00:39.059> these<00:00:39.980> like<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:42.800> okay<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.390> now<00:00:45.390> open

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
fold these like this okay and now open

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.350 
fold these like this okay and now open
up<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:48.860> pull<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.550> point<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.300> here

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
up here and pull this point right here

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.560 
up here and pull this point right here
and<00:00:51.890> rotate<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:54.230> pull<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.530> corner<00:00:56.570> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
and rotate and now pull this corner and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.979 
and rotate and now pull this corner and
this<00:00:57.719> corner<00:00:57.780> pull<00:00:58.379> apart<00:00:58.770> and<00:01:01.370> rotate<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
this corner pull apart and rotate and

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:42.679 
this corner pull apart and rotate and
now<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.670> shape<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:07.140> thing<00:01:07.200> into<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:08.159> pocket

also now that it's open you can refine

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.999 
also now that it's open you can refine
the<00:02:00.369> ball<00:02:00.550> by<00:02:01.470> making<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> little<00:02:02.740> bit<00:02:02.860> more

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
the ball by making it a little bit more

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.389 
the ball by making it a little bit more
round<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.929> just<00:02:05.110> make<00:02:05.470> little<00:02:05.770> dents<00:02:06.250> in

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
round you can just make little dents in

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:27.289 
round you can just make little dents in
here<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.819> that'll<00:02:08.549> make<00:02:09.549> it<00:02:09.610> more<00:02:09.880> well<00:02:25.799> and

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
here and that'll make it more well and

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.789 
here and that'll make it more well and
there<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.690> eight<00:02:28.900> ball<00:02:29.110> falling<00:02:29.470> into

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
there it is the eight ball falling into

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.349 
there it is the eight ball falling into
the<00:02:29.890> side<00:02:30.100> pocket<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:32.530> also<00:02:32.680> be<00:02:32.859> ah<00:02:33.359> if

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
the side pocket and it can also be ah if
