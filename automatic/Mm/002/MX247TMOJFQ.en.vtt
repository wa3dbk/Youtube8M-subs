00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
out the stug at full speed and if you've

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.150 
out the stug at full speed and if you've
ever<00:02:55.300> driven<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.660> stug<00:02:55.900> three<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.710> know<00:02:56.950> they

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
ever driven a stug three you know they

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.950 
ever driven a stug three you know they
can<00:02:57.190> travel<00:02:57.640> quite<00:02:57.970> quickly<00:02:58.330> so<00:02:58.660> we'll<00:02:58.780> just

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
can travel quite quickly so we'll just

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.020 
can travel quite quickly so we'll just
have<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.140> quick<00:02:59.890> rewind<00:03:00.250> then<00:03:00.490> we'll<00:03:00.670> see<00:03:00.850> that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
have a quick rewind then we'll see that

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.900 
have a quick rewind then we'll see that
one<00:03:01.180> again<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:01.690> little<00:03:02.140> slower<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:03.580> if<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.730> see

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
one again a little slower so if you see

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.180 
one again a little slower so if you see
just<00:03:04.180> spots<00:03:04.450> but<00:03:05.230> still<00:03:05.530> making<00:03:05.950> his<00:03:06.040> way

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
just spots but still making his way

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.600 
just spots but still making his way
across<00:03:06.220> there<00:03:07.260> through<00:03:08.260> behind<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.280> building

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
across there through behind the building

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.520 
across there through behind the building
so<00:03:09.760> he<00:03:09.820> just<00:03:10.030> sets<00:03:10.810> his<00:03:10.930> gun<00:03:11.140> open<00:03:11.410> knows

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
so he just sets his gun open knows

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.160 
so he just sets his gun open knows
exactly<00:03:11.800> where<00:03:12.070> he's<00:03:12.100> going<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.520> shore<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.170> has

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
exactly where he's going to shore it has

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.130 
exactly where he's going to shore it has
a<00:03:14.200> quick<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.650> spots<00:03:15.490> him<00:03:15.730> as<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.480> shot<00:03:16.870> and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
a quick in spots him as a shot and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.710 
a quick in spots him as a shot and
manages<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.920> take<00:03:18.130> him<00:03:18.280> out<00:03:18.400> at<00:03:18.640> full<00:03:19.000> speed<00:03:19.300> so

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
manages to take him out at full speed so

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.880 
manages to take him out at full speed so
I<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:19.930> think<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.170> was<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.290> good<00:03:20.380> piece<00:03:20.740> of

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
I just think that was a good piece of

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.949 
I just think that was a good piece of
prediction<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.790> reaction<00:03:22.360> from<00:03:22.480> Paul<00:03:22.780> gone

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
prediction and reaction from Paul gone

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.600
