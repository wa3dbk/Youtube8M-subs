00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
showing the rearranging of all the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.740 
showing the rearranging of all the
things<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.219> did<00:00:38.940> open<00:00:39.090> 10<00:00:39.450> packs

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
things is because I did open 10 packs

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.080 
things is because I did open 10 packs
before<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.170> even<00:00:40.410> started<00:00:40.800> playing<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.190> game<00:00:41.430> so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
before I even started playing a game so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.850 
before I even started playing a game so
that's<00:00:42.420> probably<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.050> main<00:00:43.079> reason<00:00:43.260> why<00:00:43.710> I'm

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
that's probably the main reason why I'm

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440 
that's probably the main reason why I'm
not<00:00:44.040> showing<00:00:44.340> everything<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.239> want<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
get the pack openings done and I just

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.290 
get the pack openings done and I just
like<00:00:49.800> pack<00:00:50.039> openings<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.640> mean<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.210> was

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.430 
doing them I hope I keep doing more you
know<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> huge<00:00:55.110> waste<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
know I know it's kind of a huge waste of

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.660 
know I know it's kind of a huge waste of
money<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.039> buy<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> players

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
money and you can just buy the players

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.660 
money and you can just buy the players
but<00:00:57.360> since<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.629> can't<00:00:57.930> buy<00:00:58.199> coins<00:00:58.649> which<00:00:59.489> i

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
