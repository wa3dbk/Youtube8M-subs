00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
unboxing we already have the single

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060 
unboxing we already have the single
conversion<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.410> will<00:00:40.500> quickly<00:00:40.649> take

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
conversion here so we will quickly take

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.440 
conversion here so we will quickly take
a<00:00:41.280> look<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.239> s<00:00:42.600> fidos<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.940> see<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.210> are

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
a look at the s fidos and see what are

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.110 
a look at the s fidos and see what are
different<00:00:46.170> how<00:00:46.800> different<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.610> from<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
different how different it is from the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
different how different it is from the
single-sim<00:00:48.629> version<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.079> let's<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:49.469> ahead

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
single-sim version so let's go ahead

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.630 
single-sim version so let's go ahead
into<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> unboxing<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.629> galaxy<00:00:52.079> s5<00:00:52.500> duos

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.579 

so<00:00:56.879> let's<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.239> ahead<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> look<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
so let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.639 
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
box<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.050> back<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.530> the

which<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.000> LT<00:02:09.720> dual<00:02:09.929> SIM<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.440> sim<00:02:10.769> at<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> time

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
which is LT dual SIM one sim at a time

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.900 
which is LT dual SIM one sim at a time
can<00:02:12.030> support<00:02:12.660> LT<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.739> phone<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.700> that's

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
can support LT on this phone so that's

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.530 
can support LT on this phone so that's
something<00:02:15.150> cool<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:17.160> let's<00:02:17.190> take<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.239> product

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
something cool so let's take the product

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:33.360 
something cool so let's take the product
of<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.810> box<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.879> open<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.290> back<00:02:22.290> cover<00:02:22.349> here

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.120 

so<00:02:34.370> that's<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.850> extra<00:02:35.570> SIM<00:02:35.840> slot<00:02:36.200> there<00:02:36.530> or<00:02:36.890> at

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
so that's the extra SIM slot there or at

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.310 
so that's the extra SIM slot there or at
the<00:02:37.280> left<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:38.060> can<00:02:38.210> see<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.600> Micro<00:02:38.900> SIM<00:02:39.050> card

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
the left you can see the Micro SIM card

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.940 
the left you can see the Micro SIM card
slot<00:02:39.590> here<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.310> sim<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.820> written<00:02:41.710> that's<00:02:42.710> the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
slot here the sim to written that's the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.250 
slot here the sim to written that's the
Micro<00:02:43.340> SIM<00:02:43.490> slot<00:02:43.850> number<00:02:44.180> 2<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.110> the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
Micro SIM slot number 2 this is the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.680 
Micro SIM slot number 2 this is the
Micro<00:02:45.560> SIM<00:02:45.710> slot<00:02:46.010> number<00:02:46.160> 1<00:02:46.490> on<00:02:46.730> top<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.420> which

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
Micro SIM slot number 1 on top of which

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.650 
Micro SIM slot number 1 on top of which
you<00:02:48.170> can<00:02:48.320> add<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.710> 128<00:02:49.250> gigabyte<00:02:49.640> micro<00:02:50.390> sd

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
you can add the 128 gigabyte micro sd

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.750 
you can add the 128 gigabyte micro sd
card<00:02:50.690> because<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.200> supports<00:02:51.680> up<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.520> much

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
card because it supports up to that much

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.500 
card because it supports up to that much
so<00:02:53.450> that's<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.960> s5<00:02:54.890> dual<00:02:55.310> sim<00:02:55.580> here<00:02:55.790> let's<00:02:56.360> see

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
so that's the s5 dual sim here let's see

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.930 
so that's the s5 dual sim here let's see
if<00:02:56.630> there<00:02:56.810> is<00:02:56.900> anything<00:02:57.530> different<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.580> the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
if there is anything different in the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.380 
if there is anything different in the
Box<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.890> is<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.280> middle-east<00:03:01.610> version<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.210> the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
Box it is the middle-east version so the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.000 
Box it is the middle-east version so the
box<00:03:02.600> contents<00:03:03.170> should<00:03:03.440> be<00:03:03.590> slightly

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
box contents should be slightly

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.730 
box contents should be slightly
different<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.850> bunch<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.180> booklets<00:03:05.330> here<00:03:08.740> the

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
different the bunch of booklets here the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.130 
different the bunch of booklets here the
micro<00:03:10.580> USB<00:03:10.940> cable<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:12.710> battery<00:03:12.740> which<00:03:13.520> is

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
micro USB cable the battery which is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.750 
micro USB cable the battery which is
2800<00:03:15.140> H<00:03:15.320> that's<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.250> battery<00:03:18.340> that's<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
2800 H that's the battery that's the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.130 
2800 H that's the battery that's the
earphones<00:03:20.660> with<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.110> extra<00:03:21.590> earbuds<00:03:22.070> there

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
earphones with the extra earbuds there

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.580 
earphones with the extra earbuds there
and<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.290> course<00:03:24.320> we<00:03:25.010> have<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.430> huge<00:03:25.820> huge

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
and of course we have the huge huge

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.020 
and of course we have the huge huge
charger<00:03:27.590> which<00:03:28.520> is<00:03:29.050> their<00:03:30.050> pin<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:30.920> we<00:03:31.700> have<00:03:31.880> to

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
charger which is their pin so we have to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.660 
charger which is their pin so we have to
use<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.420> converter<00:03:32.780> for<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:34.160> use<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.460> here

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
use a converter for that to use it here

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.210 
use a converter for that to use it here
and<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.240> USB<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.720> course<00:03:36.020> so<00:03:36.530> that's<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.950> Box

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
and it's USB of course so that's the Box

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.610 
and it's USB of course so that's the Box
contents<00:03:37.850> let's<00:03:38.090> open<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.690> battery<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.290> see

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
contents let's open the battery and see

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.130 
contents let's open the battery and see
what's<00:03:39.920> different<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:41.060> software<00:03:41.600> but

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
what's different in the software but

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.560 
what's different in the software but
before<00:03:42.860> that<00:03:42.980> let's<00:03:43.280> quickly<00:03:43.610> take<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:44.150> look<00:03:44.180> at

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
before that let's quickly take a look at

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.050 
before that let's quickly take a look at
the<00:03:44.720> single<00:03:45.080> sim<00:03:45.320> variant<00:03:45.740> here<00:03:46.060> side-by-side

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
the single sim variant here side-by-side

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.520 
the single sim variant here side-by-side
this<00:03:47.240> is<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.480> single<00:03:47.750> sim<00:03:47.900> variant<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.290> we

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
this is the single sim variant that we

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.470 
this is the single sim variant that we
have<00:03:48.740> and<00:03:49.010> this<00:03:49.460> is<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.640> dual<00:03:49.910> sim<00:03:50.150> variant

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
have and this is the dual sim variant

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.660 
have and this is the dual sim variant
and<00:03:50.600> obviously<00:03:51.050> you<00:03:51.170> can<00:03:51.320> see<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.920> part

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
and obviously you can see that this part

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.060 
and obviously you can see that this part
of<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.180> phone<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.660> where<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.200> Micro<00:03:54.590> SIM<00:03:54.620> card

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
of the phone is where the Micro SIM card

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.720 
of the phone is where the Micro SIM card
slot<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.930> that's<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.110> slot<00:03:57.380> number<00:03:57.530> 2<00:03:57.730> so

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
slot is that's the slot number 2 so

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:08.979 
slot is that's the slot number 2 so
anyway<00:03:59.150> let's<00:03:59.330> pop<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.840> battery<00:04:00.200> in

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.559 

so<00:04:09.709> that's<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.010> phone<00:04:10.219> completely<00:04:10.489> setup<00:04:11.299> we

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
so that's the phone completely setup we

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.020 
so that's the phone completely setup we
haven't<00:04:11.959> installed<00:04:12.290> any<00:04:12.530> sim<00:04:12.920> set<00:04:13.129> but<00:04:13.459> we<00:04:13.819> can

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
haven't installed any sim set but we can

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.069 
haven't installed any sim set but we can
check<00:04:14.629> out<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:15.200> settings<00:04:15.709> that<00:04:16.160> will<00:04:17.079> give

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
check out the settings that will give

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.170 
check out the settings that will give
you<00:04:18.169> an<00:04:18.289> indication<00:04:18.590> of<00:04:18.739> what<00:04:18.949> it's<00:04:19.160> like<00:04:19.280> so

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
you an indication of what it's like so

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.159 
you an indication of what it's like so
let's<00:04:20.570> see<00:04:20.810> that's<00:04:21.259> the<00:04:22.509> network's<00:04:23.509> here<00:04:23.900> so

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
let's see that's the network's here so

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.680 
let's see that's the network's here so
there<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.530> sim<00:04:24.770> card<00:04:24.800> manager<00:04:25.430> in<00:04:25.639> which<00:04:26.419> you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
there is a sim card manager in which you

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.980 
there is a sim card manager in which you
can<00:04:26.900> change<00:04:27.229> granularly<00:04:28.130> change<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:29.000> each

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
can change granularly change the each

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.230 
can change granularly change the each
and<00:04:30.229> everything<00:04:30.470> about<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:31.039> two<00:04:31.310> sims<00:04:31.669> so

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
and everything about the two sims so

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.240 
and everything about the two sims so
these<00:04:32.539> are<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.840> two<00:04:33.020> sims<00:04:33.289> and<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:33.830> course<00:04:34.039> you

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
these are the two sims and of course you

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.040 
these are the two sims and of course you
can<00:04:34.400> change<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:35.240> preference<00:04:35.720> for<00:04:35.750> voice

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
can change the preference for voice

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.740 
can change the preference for voice
calls<00:04:36.289> video<00:04:36.949> calls<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.460> data<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.180> also

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
calls video calls and data and also

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.710 
calls video calls and data and also
there<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.500> dual<00:04:39.800> sim<00:04:40.100> always-on<00:04:40.910> which<00:04:41.509> is

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
there is the dual sim always-on which is

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.990 
there is the dual sim always-on which is
a<00:04:41.780> smart<00:04:42.530> dual<00:04:42.740> sim<00:04:42.979> feature<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.430> Samsung

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
a smart dual sim feature that Samsung

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.820 
a smart dual sim feature that Samsung
has<00:04:44.180> been<00:04:44.389> using<00:04:44.599> in<00:04:44.780> most<00:04:44.960> of<00:04:45.199> its<00:04:45.349> dual<00:04:45.560> sim

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
has been using in most of its dual sim

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.909 
has been using in most of its dual sim
phones<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:47.270> called<00:04:47.930> for<00:04:48.110> words<00:04:48.320> from<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.740> sim

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
phones it called for words from the sim

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.950 
phones it called for words from the sim
to<00:04:49.099> two<00:04:49.280> sim<00:04:49.460> one<00:04:49.699> and<00:04:49.940> that's<00:04:50.479> how<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.750> works

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
to two sim one and that's how it works

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.990 
to two sim one and that's how it works
so<00:04:51.110> this<00:04:51.320> is<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.680> dual<00:04:51.949> sim<00:04:52.220> part<00:04:52.490> of<00:04:52.699> the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
so this is the dual sim part of the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.960 
so this is the dual sim part of the
galaxy<00:04:53.449> s5<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.020> like<00:04:54.889> we<00:04:55.039> said<00:04:55.250> earlier<00:04:55.280> it's

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
galaxy s5 and like we said earlier it's

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.779 
galaxy s5 and like we said earlier it's
really<00:04:56.330> awesome<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.349> see<00:04:57.520> high-end<00:04:58.520> phones

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
really awesome to see high-end phones

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.680 
really awesome to see high-end phones
with<00:04:59.509> LTE<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.830> dual<00:05:01.580> SIM<00:05:01.849> options<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:02.360> this<00:05:02.570> is

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
with LTE and dual SIM options so this is

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.159 
with LTE and dual SIM options so this is
something<00:05:03.050> which<00:05:03.979> a<00:05:04.520> lot<00:05:05.000> of<00:05:05.210> travelers<00:05:05.870> would

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
something which a lot of travelers would

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.129 
something which a lot of travelers would
like<00:05:06.520> that's<00:05:07.520> something<00:05:08.360> really<00:05:08.509> interesting

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
like that's something really interesting

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.730 
like that's something really interesting
and<00:05:09.380> as<00:05:10.210> we<00:05:11.210> already<00:05:11.360> saw<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.750> One<00:05:12.169> m8<00:05:12.349> dual

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
and as we already saw the One m8 dual

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.830 
and as we already saw the One m8 dual
SIM<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:13.250> another<00:05:14.060> high-end<00:05:14.360> phone<00:05:14.539> so<00:05:14.720> if

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
SIM is another high-end phone so if

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.839 
SIM is another high-end phone so if
you're<00:05:14.990> looking<00:05:15.199> for<00:05:15.320> a<00:05:15.380> dual<00:05:15.590> sim<00:05:15.860> flagship

device<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.479> have<00:05:17.630> options<00:05:18.080> now<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.320> don't

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
device you have options now you don't

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.399 
device you have options now you don't
have<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.830> get<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.669> use<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.210> crappy<00:05:20.870> lower<00:05:21.169> end

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
have to get to use the crappy lower end

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:22.659 
have to get to use the crappy lower end
devices<00:05:21.680> just<00:05:22.099> for<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.310> dual<00:05:22.460> sim

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
devices just for the dual sim

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.180 
devices just for the dual sim
functionality<00:05:23.270> so<00:05:23.930> that's<00:05:24.110> one<00:05:24.470> good<00:05:24.830> change

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
functionality so that's one good change

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.939 
functionality so that's one good change
that<00:05:25.430> has<00:05:25.580> happened<00:05:25.610> in<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.120> industry<00:05:26.949> that's

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
that has happened in the industry that's

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.189
