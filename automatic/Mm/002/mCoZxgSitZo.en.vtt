00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.630
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.530
 My name is Namba from the Subaru Design Department . 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.830
 Today I'm here here to bind bng 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.650
 Design of a model called concept sti 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.730
 I would like to give you an explanation of Sterling 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.400
 It is basically yeah this car 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.150
 In a sports car that has been developed with Toyota and Subaru 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.360
 We are yeah 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:42.000
 The horizontally opposed Enzen Subaru unique flat engine anyway lower the low center of gravity 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.030
 It is a styling because it is finished, but it is the first theme to keep wind tunnel low 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.870
 Now I was 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.850
 Because in the concept that sti It is this time after 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:55.930
 It is the performance of the sti with the path Firth performance image Wide 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.910
 I wanted to express this with a good feeling of foot 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.720
 so 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.050
 It is a front-end Yeah 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:10.700
 Common to recent Subaru cars 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:14.240
 Hexagon- shaped grill and then a unique expression meeting in the headlamp 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:20.509
 Light the way of feeling like making What a say you do it a little way 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.350
 Incorporating this, the front end is thicker as a Subaru family face 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.930
 I understand that Subaru cars have come 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.770
 Does is So did a tongue ring 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:35.700
 I will explain the styling in the side view 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:40.280
 Flowing along the nine- pointed bonnet 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.840
 The cabin is characterized by this and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:49.030
 Because the engine is loaded somewhat behind 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.659
 I think that the cabin is also in the position of balance like a sports car 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.460
 It from the front fender flare land 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.340
 Rainy weather in the area 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.380
 This is Fender 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:07.630
 Overwhelming wideness and feeling of strength and stability and 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.560
 Very n fast driving 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.040
 I did that kind of styling that reminds me of 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.870
 It is an 8 tire wheel but it is 18th 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:25.330
 This is a lob dedicated lob will explain the rear end 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.620
 First dissemination of lightweight Akane carbon Though I know that the roof 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.290
 We adopt this and 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.000
 The rear lid of the rear lid and the rear bumper 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:41.030
 Diffuser 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.880
 This is a very aerodynamic contribution and it has a very sporty finish. 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.690
 Better was the same tail lamp tone 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.110
 Kedomo is in this center of the license plate gar 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:57.030
 Here too , same as with franc 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.690
 The shape of the hexagon and also in the ear combination lamp 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:06.000
 It is a part that makes a square light 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.370
 Again bygone designed to give the splendor that Do contains the Subaru even in the car 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.290
 It is a car of a cat 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.230
 Anyways 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.989
 fun car with fun to drive 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.810
 Ride I make I want to aim a good car this is it it is the styling 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:26.760
 Exciting and exciting styling 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:32.489
 I intend to do this, and in the future I hope to be represented by this car 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.250
 Subaru's styling is still a car that properly conveys the run 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.450
 then 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:41.230
 A sense of security and a car that enjoys it 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.730
 I think that let us to express these things in styling 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:50.049
 I do not want to want a life car of the characteristic of the national appearance 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.620
 And let's continue the future to Fu which it will do from now in a strong its styling 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.620
 I am thinking
