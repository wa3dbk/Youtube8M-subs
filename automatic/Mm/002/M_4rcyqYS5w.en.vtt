side<00:01:12.909> this<00:01:13.909> technique<00:01:14.360> will<00:01:14.689> be<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.930> basic

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
side this technique will be the basic

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.320 
side this technique will be the basic
step<00:01:15.590> that<00:01:15.890> Ron<00:01:16.130> will<00:01:16.310> use<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.730> correct<00:01:16.850> Sam

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
step that Ron will use to correct Sam

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.350 
step that Ron will use to correct Sam
and<00:01:17.660> when<00:01:18.590> he<00:01:18.770> uses<00:01:19.190> this<00:01:19.430> method<00:01:19.700> over<00:01:20.030> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
and when he uses this method over and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.140 
and when he uses this method over and
over<00:01:20.600> Sam<00:01:21.350> will<00:01:21.830> eventually<00:01:22.430> think<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.850> Ron's

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
over Sam will eventually think of Ron's

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.440 
over Sam will eventually think of Ron's
left<00:01:23.480> as<00:01:23.720> though<00:01:24.230> correct<00:01:24.590> side<00:01:24.910> this<00:01:25.910> in<00:01:26.210> turn

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
left as though correct side this in turn

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.270 
left as though correct side this in turn
will<00:01:26.720> make<00:01:26.780> walking<00:01:27.140> on<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.620> lead<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.980> lot

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
will make walking on the lead a lot

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.690 
will make walking on the lead a lot
easier<00:01:28.730> in<00:01:29.440> this<00:01:30.440> particular<00:01:30.770> example<00:01:31.310> you

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
easier in this particular example you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.210

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
has to hold Sam while he throws the ball

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.570 
has to hold Sam while he throws the ball
this<00:04:40.900> is<00:04:41.139> because<00:04:41.440> sam<00:04:41.740> hasn't<00:04:42.190> yet<00:04:42.520> learned

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
this is because sam hasn't yet learned

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.629 
this is because sam hasn't yet learned
to<00:04:43.120> track<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.840> scent<00:04:44.080> of<00:04:44.199> the<00:04:44.320> ball<00:04:44.500> as<00:04:44.710> he's

to track the scent of the ball as he's

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.020

still<00:04:45.940> very<00:04:46.120> young<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:47.550> he's<00:04:48.550> still<00:04:48.850> very

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
still very young and he's still very

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.180 
still very young and he's still very
keen<00:04:49.389> on<00:04:49.449> fetching<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.139> ball<00:04:50.289> because<00:04:51.009> it's

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
keen on fetching the ball because it's

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.770 
keen on fetching the ball because it's
seen<00:04:51.490> as<00:04:51.729> a<00:04:51.789> toy<00:04:52.590> so<00:04:53.590> Ron<00:04:54.190> holds<00:04:54.550> him<00:04:54.639> back<00:04:54.780> so

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
seen as a toy so Ron holds him back so

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.040 
seen as a toy so Ron holds him back so
that<00:04:55.930> Sam<00:04:56.199> won't<00:04:56.530> head<00:04:56.800> out<00:04:56.919> prematurely<00:04:57.190> and

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
that Sam won't head out prematurely and

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.570 
that Sam won't head out prematurely and
so<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.169> Sam<00:04:59.380> has<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.590> chance<00:04:59.949> to<00:05:00.100> see<00:05:00.280> where<00:05:00.460> the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
so the Sam has a chance to see where the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.570 
so the Sam has a chance to see where the
ball<00:05:00.729> went<00:05:00.970> this<00:05:01.930> way<00:05:02.110> Sam<00:05:02.830> won't<00:05:03.130> have<00:05:03.370> any

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580

problems<00:05:04.060> finding<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.660> or<00:05:04.840> bringing<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.530> back

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
problems finding it or bringing it back

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.029
