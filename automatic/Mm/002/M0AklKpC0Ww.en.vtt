00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.960
 Hi everyone, then you asked me to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.330
 make videos of the kitchen series 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.760
 natural because a little bit of it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.340
 I actually did some recipes 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.960
 for they had time to put it up 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
 youtube 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 then today I propose the recipe of 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:34.410
 natural biscuits are almost here 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.870
 finished because I show one then 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.800
 what happens when a person has 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.500
 feel sweet if you feel like dessert 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 once in a while I don't think it's a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.520
 problem 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.890
 you go to a bakery and buy one 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.170
 very good pasta a good brioche with 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.610
 butter milk and eggs 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.500
 maybe you need to pay attention 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 to the ingredients now pastry shops 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 are obliged to write 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.640
 ingredients already a few years 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.890
 however, nobody reads them often and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 gladly also in patisseries of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.990
 the biggest name is the pastry shop 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.710
 important of the country in Italy these 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.689
 there are things there is the pastry in the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.670
 main street in the main street of the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.530
 country that is a renowned award-winning company since 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.479
 1800 from 1900 and so on 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.670
 even those pastry I saw 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.810
 reading the ingredients margarine year 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.280
 vegetable 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.189
 and other junk inside don't have 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.140
 not all tradition preserved though 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.610
 some yes so you always need to do it anyway 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.990
 read the ingredients 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.030
 if instead you often want dessert 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.700
 as sometimes it happens to me is too 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.860
 certainly a psychological need 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.770
 desire for dessert is certainly not a requirement 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.039
 of the physical however also the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.380
 there is a psychological need and therefore if not 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.380
 will be satisfied over can result 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.259
 not unlimited desire in a crisis 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.310
 then bulimic then at that point yes 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.549
 can make a natural recipe a 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.480
 a little more natural without sugar than it gives you 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:18.540
 that sweet taste satisfies a little 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.299
 palate without doing so much damage 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.430
 maybe they should be dosed for snack 3 or 4 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.280
 cookies every day until it passes 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.090
 this is this desire for sweets at least 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.440
 this is the technique the strategy that that 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.420
 I adopt and it works this way 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.910
 recipe is not mine I took it from the blog 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.280
 of saffron yellow and the blog of 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.850
 giallozafferano I think he took it 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.400
 from the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.890
 natural edition biscuit book 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.730
 new earth 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.500
 this year they gave me a 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.470
 new ground subscription and a magazine 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.550
 beautiful that always talks about agriculture 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.620
 there is also an article on eco-organic cosmetics 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.690
 with an analysis of the ingredients 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.000
 done very well in a serious way 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.770
 balanced and without extremism for which 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.950
 if you want information about it 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.160
 more than watching youtube videos more or 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.560
 the less you can buy the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.840
 new earth magazine 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.240
 and now I read you because you don't remember them 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.280
 memorial and does not remember the doses memory 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.770
 so I registered everything on 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.120
 mail I read you the doses of these cookies 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:36.900
 which were made with a flour 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.350
 particular that the foil flour ve the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.660
 I show not opening because heaven 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.400
 here this is flour floretto ie 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.860
 it would be polenta flour though 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:56.460
 ground in a more subtle way more 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:59.690
 in other words, these are the finest 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.260
 doses to make cookies and they are 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:08.730
 250 g of corn flour 90 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:12.630
 grams of barley malt 60 ml of oil of 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.640
 corn 50 g of almonds 50 grams of 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.739
 hazelnuts chopped in the mixer 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.930
 I added that it's not in the recipe 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.900
 original a zest the rind of 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.670
 an orange organic the original recipe says 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.400
 I put a teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.340
 a little more and rice milk 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.600
 just enough to mix the dough e 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.220
 don't forget a pinch of salt 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.650
 this is the recipe I have 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.840
 found on the blog of saffron yellow e 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.480
 that gave birth to these biscuits that 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.460
 have 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.260
 he met with great success and that 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.420
 plus they make a pastry like pastry 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.090
 which I also used to make a 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.980
 valentine dolphin that i put of 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.190
 which I put the photo in the queue again 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.820
 this video of course if you do these 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.590
 cookies for children remember 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.750
 that if they are children used to eating 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.660
 shortcrust pastry rich in butter e 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.980
 sugar or nutella strain 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.320
 in the beginning you won't like these cookies 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.840
 because they taste much more rustic 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.190
 and indeed much more natural than 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.140
 in short, it requires a palate accustomed to 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.570
 this kind of foods fill 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:30.190
 very much you can't do it 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.110
 of these cookies and you have to chew them 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.630
 very well otherwise they stay here 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:40.330
 therefore they require slow chewing e 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.060
 just fill a lot and then leave 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.940
 a very good mouth that did it 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.640
 industrial or pastry biscuits 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.450
 often no longer for this very reason 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.860
 abuse of poor refined ingredients 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.480
 quality 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.480
 see you at the next hello video
