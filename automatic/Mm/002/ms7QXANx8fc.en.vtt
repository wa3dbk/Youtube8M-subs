00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 you will need tabasco ketchup a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 chicken schnitzel a little bit of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.920
 flour of Provence herbs salt of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.590
 paprika pepper a salad with sesame 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.140
 and for the filling we will need 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 the asra of tomatoes 2 of austin is two 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 cheeses and I replaced everything 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 just ynet toasts by 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.930
 strange in because play in hd 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.390
 yes I know thanks volos so first 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.039
 step that we will achieve the breadcrumbs 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 power is very simple to learn the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.850
 flour we add the air of provence the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.500
 salt and pepper paprika and there we 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.719
 just mix 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.280
 then we will now break down and the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.170
 chicken so for that it's very simple 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.900
 you come a first time in the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.240
 flour so here we will bring the side 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.750
 breadcrumbs and especially the spices and then 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.850
 we come into the egg that we diluted with 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.470
 a little bit of milk and then 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.549
 return to the flour 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.990
 and what you can do 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.880
 many times if you are greedy and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 if you want a thick breadcrumb 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.189
 and crisp and now the chicken 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.070
 and breakdown and we will be able to press to the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.049
 cooking the meat and for the sauce 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.450
 is very simple stably from catch up 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.220
 with a few drops of tabasco so there 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.720
 it's really to see you in function 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.500
 of one of your tastes if you want 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520
 spicy or not and here we mix 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.970
 in hot oil 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.649
 we're going to cook the chicken a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.270
 Once the chicken is cooked it 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.060
 remove it from Lille we put it on 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.670
 absorbent paper and we'll go to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 training then we will go to dressage 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.390
 so suddenly you will take the bread 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 you put it slightly in the microphone 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.760
 for about thirty seconds and have 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.090
 well 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.460
 above the chicken then we will put 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.860
 both toasts ined for mapa and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.740
 weird wheat 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.530
 we also put the two tomatoes and on 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.260
 organic bread we put sauce and salad 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.210
 and then we just close the burger 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.840
 so that's it's gone for the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.730
 tasting we have a big burger war 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.220
 frankly leberger it was of the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.840
 kill it we have a sauce well raised with 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.450
 Tabasco and his love 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 we could his companion downright well the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.680

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.970

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.070
