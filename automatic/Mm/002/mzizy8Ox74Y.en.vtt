00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:29.040 
will show you are the types of metal you
can<00:00:19.449> use<00:00:19.690> first<00:00:20.650> of<00:00:20.860> all<00:00:20.980> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.840> use

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
can use first of all you can use

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.010 
can use first of all you can use
galvanized<00:00:29.680> steel<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.000> nice<00:00:31.150> metal<00:00:31.630> it'll

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
galvanized steel it's a nice metal it'll

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.720 
galvanized steel it's a nice metal it'll
eventually<00:00:32.700> turn<00:00:33.700> into<00:00:33.730> a<00:00:34.559> gray<00:00:35.559> color<00:00:35.980> mainly

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
eventually turn into a gray color mainly

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.730 
eventually turn into a gray color mainly
because<00:00:36.940> there's<00:00:37.360> a<00:00:37.450> zinc<00:00:37.810> coating<00:00:38.290> over<00:00:38.620> it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
because there's a zinc coating over it

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.890 
because there's a zinc coating over it
and<00:00:39.900> it'll<00:00:40.900> cause<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.590> to<00:00:42.040> a<00:00:42.329> turn<00:00:43.329> gray<00:00:43.600> in<00:00:43.630> the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
and it'll cause it to a turn gray in the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:53.210 
and it'll cause it to a turn gray in the
future<00:00:44.260> alright<00:00:45.180> another<00:00:46.180> metal<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:51.180> copper

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
future alright another metal is copper

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.710 
future alright another metal is copper
this<00:00:54.220> is<00:00:54.430> a<00:00:54.460> nice<00:00:54.820> jeweler<00:00:55.270> making<00:00:55.690> metal<00:00:56.110> um

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
three months prior another metal is

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.649 
three months prior another metal is
spring<00:01:37.360> stainless<00:01:37.990> um<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.909> only<00:01:40.180> thing<00:01:40.450> about

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
spring stainless um the only thing about

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.530 
spring stainless um the only thing about
spring<00:01:41.080> stainless<00:01:41.680> is<00:01:41.979> um<00:01:42.250> it's<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.210> very

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
spring stainless is um it's a very

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.260 
spring stainless is um it's a very
strong<00:01:44.080> metal<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:46.290> very<00:01:47.290> hard<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:48.270> open

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
strong metal so it is very hard to open

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.230 
strong metal so it is very hard to open
or<00:01:49.840> close<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.229> Rings<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.820> comes<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.330> this<00:01:52.509> um

first<00:02:12.070> his<00:02:13.070> kingsmill<00:02:13.870> it's<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.930> nice<00:02:15.080> piece

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
first his kingsmill it's a nice piece

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.180 
first his kingsmill it's a nice piece
it's<00:02:15.860> double<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:17.590> European<00:02:18.590> foreign<00:02:18.890> one

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
it's double of European foreign one

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.120 
it's double of European foreign one
which<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:20.230> what<00:02:21.230> my<00:02:21.410> vest<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.980> made<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.490> of

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
which is what my vest is made out of

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.880 
which is what my vest is made out of
it's<00:02:25.130> double<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.030> makes<00:02:26.350> makes<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.530> lot<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.770> good

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
it's double it makes makes a lot of good

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.210 
it's double it makes makes a lot of good
things<00:02:28.520> but<00:02:29.140> it's<00:02:30.140> probably<00:02:30.440> not<00:02:30.620> really<00:02:31.190> a

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
things but it's probably not really a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.370 
things but it's probably not really a
good<00:02:31.520> idea<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.060> make<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.420> completely<00:02:32.990> out<00:02:33.350> of

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
good idea to make it completely out of

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.540 
good idea to make it completely out of
armor<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:35.660> anyway<00:02:36.200> next<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:39.070> next<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
armor but anyway next is next is the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.620 
armor but anyway next is next is the
European<00:02:41.330> six<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.870> one<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:43.310> really<00:02:43.820> this<00:02:44.360> is

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
European six and one it really this is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.840 
European six and one it really this is
really<00:02:45.290> strong<00:02:45.650> depending<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.370> what<00:02:46.550> kind<00:02:46.730> of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
really strong depending on what kind of

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.920 
really strong depending on what kind of
metal<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.130> 14<00:02:49.700> gauge<00:02:49.940> spring<00:02:50.390> stainless

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
metal this is 14 gauge spring stainless

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.320 
metal this is 14 gauge spring stainless
so<00:02:51.320> it's<00:02:51.650> pretty<00:02:51.950> much<00:02:52.070> almost<00:02:52.460> impossible

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
so it's pretty much almost impossible

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:02.410 
so it's pretty much almost impossible
for<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.580> break<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:56.860> next<00:02:57.860> we've<00:02:58.100> is<00:03:01.420> dragon

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
for it to break I next we've is dragon

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.990 
for it to break I next we've is dragon

expansion<00:03:22.160> pattern<00:03:23.000> which<00:03:23.300> is<00:03:23.510> usually<00:03:23.990> used

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
expansion pattern which is usually used

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.630 
expansion pattern which is usually used
to<00:03:24.440> make<00:03:25.400> cliffs<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.510> hacky<00:03:26.960> sacks<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:31.370> one

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
to make cliffs and hacky sacks this one

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.440 
to make cliffs and hacky sacks this one
has<00:03:32.200> five<00:03:33.200> triangles<00:03:33.920> built<00:03:34.520> into<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.150> using

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
has five triangles built into it using

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.680 
has five triangles built into it using
and<00:03:36.430> then<00:03:37.430> I'm<00:03:37.640> connecting<00:03:38.300> all<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.480> them

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
and then I'm connecting all of them

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.790 
and then I'm connecting all of them
using<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.140> 45<00:03:39.620> degree<00:03:39.800> suture<00:03:41.200> when<00:03:42.200> there<00:03:42.530> is

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
using the 45 degree suture when there is

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.510 
using the 45 degree suture when there is
the<00:03:43.750> expansion<00:03:44.750> pattern<00:03:46.570> right<00:03:47.570> here<00:03:48.520> see

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
the expansion pattern right here see

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.290 
the expansion pattern right here see
what<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.940> do<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.540> um<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:52.160> put<00:03:52.460> 10<00:03:52.850> or<00:03:53.060> more

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
what you do is um you put 10 or more

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.410 
what you do is um you put 10 or more
rings<00:03:53.690> around<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.590> center<00:03:55.010> ring<00:03:55.690> then<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:57.050> um

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
rings around a center ring then you um

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.770 
rings around a center ring then you um
then<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.720> connect<00:04:00.470> them<00:04:00.680> like<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.610> then<00:04:02.600> you

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
then you connect them like this then you

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.570 
then you connect them like this then you
put<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.140> expansion<00:04:03.910> which<00:04:04.910> is<00:04:05.150> um<00:04:06.580> there's

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
put the expansion which is um there's

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.570 
put the expansion which is um there's
wandering<00:04:08.210> here<00:04:09.050> there's<00:04:09.740> one<00:04:09.860> ring<00:04:10.310> right

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
wandering here there's one ring right

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.430 
wandering here there's one ring right
here<00:04:12.130> skip<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.160> middle<00:04:13.790> ring<00:04:14.030> or<00:04:14.360> you<00:04:14.810> skip<00:04:15.110> one

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
here skip to middle ring or you skip one

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.129 
here skip to middle ring or you skip one
middle<00:04:15.830> ring<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.480> then<00:04:19.000> here

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
middle ring and then here

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.950 
middle ring and then here
is<00:04:20.199> another<00:04:20.609> sir<00:04:22.259> here<00:04:23.259> is<00:04:23.469> another<00:04:23.770> expansion

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
is another sir here is another expansion

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.730 
is another sir here is another expansion
right<00:04:25.960> here<00:04:27.090> all<00:04:28.090> right<00:04:28.300> well<00:04:28.870> before<00:04:29.409> I<00:04:29.439> run

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
right here all right well before I run

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.129 
right here all right well before I run
out<00:04:29.800> of<00:04:29.949> time<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.819> want<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.389> show<00:04:31.449> you<00:04:31.629> this<00:04:31.779> last

out of time I want to show you this last
we've<00:04:32.580> um<00:04:35.189> this<00:04:36.189> one<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:36.999> scale<00:04:37.840> mail<00:04:41.099> it's<00:04:42.099> a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
we've um this one is scale mail it's a

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.899 
we've um this one is scale mail it's a
nice<00:04:42.490> weave<00:04:42.789> to<00:04:43.150> make<00:04:43.360> but<00:04:43.749> um<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:45.400> only<00:04:45.669> hard

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
nice weave to make but um the only hard

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.350 
nice weave to make but um the only hard
part<00:04:46.060> about<00:04:46.389> it<00:04:46.599> is<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.800> split<00:04:48.189> rings<00:04:48.580> here

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
part about it is the split rings here

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.730 
part about it is the split rings here
hold<00:04:49.719> on<00:04:49.840> grab<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.800> handful<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:51.550> show<00:04:51.849> you<00:04:52.740> what

hold on grab a handful and show you what

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.309 
hold on grab a handful and show you what
they<00:04:53.919> look<00:04:53.949> like<00:04:57.479> they're<00:04:58.479> like<00:04:58.689> miniature

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
they look like they're like miniature

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:04.469 
they look like they're like miniature
key<00:04:59.650> rings<00:05:02.279> yeah<00:05:03.279> they're<00:05:03.550> used<00:05:03.879> to<00:05:04.120> connect

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
key rings yeah they're used to connect

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.980 
key rings yeah they're used to connect
the<00:05:05.490> scales<00:05:06.490> on<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:06.879> back<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.419> hard<00:05:07.689> part

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
the scales on the back the hard part

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.899 
the scales on the back the hard part
about<00:05:08.110> it<00:05:08.289> is<00:05:08.500> um<00:05:10.529> it's<00:05:11.529> turning<00:05:12.039> them<00:05:12.219> in<00:05:12.759> a

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
about it is um it's turning them in a

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.269 
about it is um it's turning them in a
different<00:05:13.089> direction<00:05:13.449> each<00:05:14.080> time<00:05:14.529> that<00:05:14.979> makes

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:15.279 
different direction each time that makes

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.749 
different direction each time that makes
it<00:05:15.400> kind<00:05:15.639> of<00:05:15.729> hard<00:05:16.439> yeah<00:05:17.439> i'll<00:05:17.740> show<00:05:18.159> you<00:05:18.219> in<00:05:18.639> a
