pets<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> lecture<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:03.629> say<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.019> dogs

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
pets then the lecture will say that dogs

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.630

loud two dogs are dirty and three dogs
are<00:01:56.189> expensive<00:01:56.899> notice<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> lectures

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
are expensive notice that the lectures

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.289 
are expensive notice that the lectures
arguments<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.399> nothing<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
arguments have nothing to do with the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.690 
arguments have nothing to do with the
readings<00:02:00.600> arguments<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.799> example<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
readings arguments for example the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.240 
readings arguments for example the
lecture<00:02:03.060> says<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.479> dogs<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:03.869> expensive<00:02:04.250> but

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
lecture says that dogs are expensive but

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.889 
lecture says that dogs are expensive but
the<00:02:05.369> reading<00:02:05.670> doesn't<00:02:06.060> talk<00:02:06.210> about<00:02:06.479> money<00:02:06.780> in

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the reading doesn't talk about money in

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.680 
the reading doesn't talk about money in
fact<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.399> reading<00:02:08.729> offers<00:02:09.060> three<00:02:09.330> reasons

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
fact the reading offers three reasons

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.390 
fact the reading offers three reasons
and<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.170> lecture<00:02:10.530> offers<00:02:11.069> three<00:02:11.370> different

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and the lecture offers three different

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.850 
and the lecture offers three different
reasons<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.480> no<00:02:12.840> relationship<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
reasons that have no relationship to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.310 
reasons that have no relationship to
readings<00:02:14.190> reasons<00:02:14.580> again<00:02:15.480> what<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:15.990> just

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
readings reasons again what I just

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.140 
readings reasons again what I just
explained<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.950> not<00:02:17.310> what<00:02:17.580> happens<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
explained is not what happens on the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.080 
explained is not what happens on the
TOEFL<00:02:19.040> unfortunately<00:02:20.040> though<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.940> what

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
TOEFL unfortunately though this is what

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.580 
TOEFL unfortunately though this is what
all<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.510> TOEFL<00:02:21.870> books<00:02:22.050> teach<00:02:22.320> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
all the TOEFL books teach and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.890 
all the TOEFL books teach and
consequently<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.970> also<00:02:24.210> what<00:02:24.480> many<00:02:24.690> other

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
consequently it is also what many other

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.500 
consequently it is also what many other
language<00:02:25.380> schools<00:02:25.650> teach<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.060> why<00:02:27.180> many

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
language schools teach this is why many

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.240 
language schools teach this is why many
students<00:02:27.960> fail<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.350> achieve<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.860> score<00:02:29.130> they

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
students fail to achieve the score they

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.090 
students fail to achieve the score they
want<00:02:29.490> now<00:02:30.420> let's<00:02:31.350> look<00:02:31.530> at<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> point

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
want now let's look at the point

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.250 
want now let's look at the point
counterpoint<00:02:32.550> format<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.990> what<00:02:34.140> you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
counterpoint format which is what you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.920 
counterpoint format which is what you
will<00:02:34.560> experience<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.610> TOEFL<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
will experience on the TOEFL in the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.050 
will experience on the TOEFL in the
point/counterpoint<00:02:37.830> format<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.790> reading

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
point/counterpoint format the reading

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.850 
point/counterpoint format the reading
will<00:02:39.210> present<00:02:39.570> three<00:02:39.900> points<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
will present three points and the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.520 
will present three points and the
lecture<00:02:41.190> counters<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:42.150> opposes<00:02:42.900> each<00:02:43.230> of

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
lecture counters or opposes each of

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.910 
lecture counters or opposes each of
these<00:02:43.620> points<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> if<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:46.080> reading<00:02:46.410> says<00:02:46.709> that

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
these points so if the reading says that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.340 
these points so if the reading says that
dogs<00:02:47.160> are<00:02:47.340> good<00:02:47.550> because<00:02:47.730> they<00:02:48.120> love<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.480> the

for<00:02:52.380> instance<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.220> lecture<00:02:53.550> might<00:02:53.730> say<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
for instance the lecture might say a

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
is bad and this same structure of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.620 
is bad and this same structure of
opposition<00:03:40.400> happens<00:03:40.970> with<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.300> readings

opposition happens with the readings

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.780 
opposition happens with the readings
second<00:03:42.080> point<00:03:42.290> which<00:03:42.830> says<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:43.100> dogs<00:03:43.550> are

the<00:03:45.920> lecture<00:03:46.250> will<00:03:46.370> counter<00:03:46.760> this<00:03:46.880> point<00:03:47.209> by

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
the lecture will counter this point by

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.180 
the lecture will counter this point by
saying<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.230> dog<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.680> protects<00:03:49.040> you
