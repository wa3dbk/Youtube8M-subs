00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 we all have at least one scene related to 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.420
 the Japanese animation that has marked us 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:25.890
 during our childhood 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:32.520
 to start with this one here or 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:35.790
 still that you are you only 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.590
 asked why yes in this new 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.059
 issue we will come back on some 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.540
 cult scenes of Japanese animation 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.700
 by trying to dissect them 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.710
 hidden messages problematic direction 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.840
 artistic or music we will see this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.090
 who makes these one special is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.649
 today in these camps wish it's 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.500
 when that's the name of the show I was 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.199
 run out of ideas the more you sense his motion 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.199
 to hugo hakusho destinations 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.480
 ayacucho this series from the early years 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.860
 90 that I was covered on the chain 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.290
 mangas the chain that needed 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.480
 absolutely to do with ab1 besides to 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.760
 the late 90s for all these 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:23.450
 fucking animate magic could we 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.590
 discover this world and then not having 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.360
 known the dorothée club 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.700
 I was three years old during the last 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.770
 broadcast of bat manga and ab1 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.080
 it was a bit of a must 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.479
 finally the scene chosen today 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.310
 is in episode 74 of the line 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.050
 hot hugo to refocus things 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.180
 we are currently in the bow 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.890
 scene am like I call it duke 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.229
 and his gang finds himself confronted with 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.520
 direct sequences of the previous art you 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.960
 just need to know that 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.369
 now some people have 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.680
 developed supernatural abilities 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.840
 in the human world we call them 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.970
 capabilities the territories but prefers 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.130
 to say such ito it's more stylish each 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.960
 nobody a unique ability to these 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.399
 wacky so much that most 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.560
 fights will be closer to the 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.820
 solving a survey that a pk 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.470
 chibout de kayes 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.739
 basically it's like the ashes of a 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:15.140
 new but better what to summarize 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.470
 action so a Swiss scene henchman 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.570
 who calls himself the doctor and who is going 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.269
 roughly take a whole hostage 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.250
 armored hospital of civilians thing that is going 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.430
 propel our favorite hero in a 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.830
 unprecedented situation accustomed until then to 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.510
 stubborn at arm's length demos he gets 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.519
 found for the first time confronted 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.769
 to an enemy much weaker than him 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.480
 that he could terrace is so in a 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.880
 blow but the problem arises 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.019
 besides by the problem arises on the 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.590
 nature of this enemy 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.540
 he is human yusuke so to save 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.700
 other people will have to get dirty 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 hands and you're an asshole yes but 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.010
 human thing that drives him to the 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.010
 reflection 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.489
 which is interesting in this scene 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.019
 apart from the animation and choreography of 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.430
 crazy is we see a given hero 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.670
 question ask yourself real questions 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.010
 on the murder 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.870
 the good and the bad we see it clearly 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.709
 all reassembled and it's all the more 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.180
 marking that rare one asserts the habit 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.800
 to see a hero leave based on all 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.260
 his forces without ever causing death or 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.720
 well another hero who kills one fights 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.610
 have royally the balls the no this 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.830
 which was supposed to be just a simple 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.410
 spire becomes a real test for the 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.480
 hero in the evolution of not only the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.760
 main character but the story in 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.890
 himself because at that time of the place 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.330
 hakusho takes a turn never taken 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.400
 still in the history of shônen the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.410
 gets where yes it may sound silly 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.390
 but to see a hero ask himself the 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.980
 question whether he should kill or not kill 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.110
 especially from a guy and below that 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.290
 can be extremely surprising what 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.489
 shows that with very little 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.739
 produce a very very memorable scene 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.410
 whether it's upset to code or 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.019
 well by introducing a problematic 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.580
 just with that this passage from episode 74 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.989
 remained in the annals 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.420
 that was pretty much all for this 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.980
 first scene tell me your impressions 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.540
 on this new show do not hesitate 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.549
 not to share the ones you 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.859
 would like to speak in the show is 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.959
 this the scene that will have the most of like low 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.760
 we'll talk about it in the next episode 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.320
 otherwise it is we who will choose to 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.060
 instead we do not know too have a sausage 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.400
 not transpired on the 7 cases where 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.959
 that you propose but in the program it 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.700
 there are a lot of things so thank you 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.109
 do not forget to comment tell us 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.460
 your impressions of everything is very 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.460
 important gala
