white play the move Knight to f5 a
little<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> funky<00:00:25.890> move<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.460> move

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
looks like it hangs a knight but you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
looks like it hangs a knight but you
can't<00:00:32.730> quite<00:00:33.059> capture<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.690> Knight<00:00:33.989> because

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
attack probably ends in in something

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.209

decided to make a different move and
play<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.649> move<00:00:56.930> b3<00:00:58.309> now<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.460> move<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
you might just see the move like the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.010 
you might just see the move like the

the move here but the point I want you
to<00:01:13.350> recognize<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.010> main<00:01:14.280> point<00:01:14.640> I'm<00:01:14.820> trying

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
to recognize the main point I'm trying

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.270 
to recognize the main point I'm trying
to<00:01:15.180> make<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.659> you'll<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:16.110> from<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.920> basic

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to make and you'll see from this basic

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580 
to make and you'll see from this basic
example<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.810> you'll<00:01:18.960> see<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
example but you'll see it in all the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
example but you'll see it in all the
examples<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.909> reason<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.299> move<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
examples is that the reason the move is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.740 
examples is that the reason the move is
bad<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:23.009> has<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.750> significant

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
bad is because it has a significant

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.280 
bad is because it has a significant
drawback<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:26.210> stopped<00:01:27.210> defending<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.869> square

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
drawback it stopped defending a square

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.679 
drawback it stopped defending a square
that<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.680> once<00:01:28.979> defended<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.180> chess<00:01:30.390> every

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that it once defended now in chess every

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.440 
that it once defended now in chess every
single<00:01:31.470> move<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.159> every<00:01:33.119> move<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
single move is like this every move you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.090 
single move is like this every move you
make<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> chest<00:01:33.960> no<00:01:34.110> matter<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.619> move<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.979> is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
make a chest no matter what move it is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.020 
make a chest no matter what move it is
must<00:01:35.759> stop<00:01:36.360> defending<00:01:36.990> squares<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
must stop defending squares that the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.210 
must stop defending squares that the
piece<00:01:39.329> used<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.110> defend<00:01:40.439> before<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> moved

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
piece used to defend before it moved

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.980 
piece used to defend before it moved
that's<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.970> reality<00:01:42.119> there's<00:01:42.659> no<00:01:42.810> way<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that's just a reality there's no way to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.080 
that's just a reality there's no way to
escape<00:01:43.170> from<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> do

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
escape from it so what I like to do

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
escape from it so what I like to do
whenever<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.689> person<00:01:45.899> makes<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.320> move<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.530> first

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
whenever a person makes a move the first

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.609 
whenever a person makes a move the first
thing<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.759> say<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.960> ask<00:01:49.140> myself<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
thing is to say to ask myself the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.789 
thing is to say to ask myself the
question<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.759> squares<00:01:51.360> are<00:01:51.899> no<00:01:52.470> longer

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
question what squares are no longer

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.550 
question what squares are no longer
defended<00:01:53.369> by<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> last<00:01:53.939> move<00:01:54.560> basic

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
defended by that last move basic

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.990 
defended by that last move basic
question<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.610> look<00:01:56.759> at<00:01:56.880> this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
