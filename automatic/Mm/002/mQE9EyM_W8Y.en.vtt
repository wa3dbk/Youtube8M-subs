the brain and we'd like to be able to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.599 
the brain and we'd like to be able to
detect<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.330> damage<00:00:18.840> that's<00:00:19.050> done<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.770> you

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
detect the damage that's done and you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.650 
detect the damage that's done and you
know<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.359> help<00:00:21.600> them<00:00:21.869> get<00:00:22.140> better<00:00:22.380> over<00:00:23.160> time

so<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.930> they<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.949> return<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.369> school<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
so that they can return to school and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.810 
so that they can return to school and
their<00:00:27.510> normal<00:00:27.960> lives<00:00:31.969> brain<00:00:32.969> imaging<00:00:33.540> is

represents or is a group of approaches

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.209 
represents or is a group of approaches
that<00:00:38.250> doctors<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.210> scientists<00:00:39.750> use<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:41.010> look

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that doctors and scientists use to look

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.970 
that doctors and scientists use to look
inside<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.730> brain<00:00:42.079> without<00:00:43.079> having<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.770> open

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
inside the brain without having to open

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.340 
inside the brain without having to open
the<00:00:44.280> brain<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.920> gives<00:00:47.129> us<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
the brain up so it gives us a way of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.130 
the brain up so it gives us a way of
looking<00:00:49.350> inside<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.280> body<00:00:51.140> without

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
looking inside the body without

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.139 
looking inside the body without
requiring<00:00:52.980> any<00:00:53.399> surgery<00:00:54.149> or<00:00:54.840> blood

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.900 

scanner<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.360> another<00:01:01.350> word<00:01:02.040> we<00:01:02.220> use<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.460> an

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
scanner is a another word we use for an

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.000 
scanner is a another word we use for an
MRI<00:01:03.120> machine<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.870> sometimes<00:01:04.620> we<00:01:04.710> call<00:01:04.800> it<00:01:04.860> an

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
MRI machine so sometimes we call it an

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
MRI machine so sometimes we call it an
MRI<00:01:05.250> scanner<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.140> just

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
MRI scanner and I think that's just

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.710 
MRI scanner and I think that's just
because<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.100> produces<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:08.760> image<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.420> you're

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
because it produces an image if you're

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.290 
because it produces an image if you're
going<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.440> get<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:10.740> MRI<00:01:11.010> there's<00:01:11.909> nothing

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
going in to get an MRI there's nothing

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.719 
going in to get an MRI there's nothing
to<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.570> afraid<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.440> basically<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.280> into<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
to be afraid of you basically go into a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.969 
to be afraid of you basically go into a
tube<00:01:15.390> where<00:01:15.960> there's<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.229> large<00:01:16.560> magnetic

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
tube where there's a large magnetic

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.600 
tube where there's a large magnetic
field<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.729> completely<00:01:18.300> safe<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> might

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
field it's completely safe and you might

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.910 
field it's completely safe and you might
hear<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:21.060> clicking<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.659> clacking<00:01:21.930> but

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
hear some clicking and clacking but

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.700 
hear some clicking and clacking but
what's<00:01:23.550> happening<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.020> instruments

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
what's happening is that the instruments

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.700 
what's happening is that the instruments
are<00:01:25.830> recording<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.270> moving<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.080> water

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
are recording the moving of water

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
are recording the moving of water
molecules<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:30.630> body<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:33.030> data<00:01:33.420> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
molecules in your body and that data is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.960 
molecules in your body and that data is
then<00:01:33.869> taken<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.530> computer<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.340> processed

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
then taken to a computer and processed

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.230 
then taken to a computer and processed
and<00:01:36.149> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.840> generate<00:01:37.350> an<00:01:37.619> image<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and you can generate an image of the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.050 
and you can generate an image of the
brain<00:01:39.539> or<00:01:39.930> another<00:01:40.350> organ<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.100> body<00:01:41.190> so

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
brain or another organ in the body so

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 
brain or another organ in the body so
these<00:01:42.240> different<00:01:42.720> colors<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.310> see<00:01:44.520> in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
these different colors that you see in

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.410 
these different colors that you see in
the<00:01:44.759> image<00:01:45.050> represent<00:01:46.050> different<00:01:47.420> pathways

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the image represent different pathways

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.359 
the image represent different pathways
or<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.050> think<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.530> roads<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
or you can think of them as roads that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
or you can think of them as roads that
connect<00:01:50.789> different<00:01:50.940> parts<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> brain

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
connect different parts of the brain

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.469 
connect different parts of the brain
together<00:01:52.440> and<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.550> is<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> ways

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
together and this is one of the ways

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.120 
together and this is one of the ways
that<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.320> whether<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> brain<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
that we can see whether the brain is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.700 
that we can see whether the brain is
normal<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:57.210> whether<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.720> been<00:01:57.960> changed<00:01:58.530> in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
normal or whether it's been changed in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.560 
normal or whether it's been changed in
disease<00:01:59.160> then<00:01:59.789> here's<00:02:00.030> some<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
disease then here's some of the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.540 
disease then here's some of the
vertebrae<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> spinal<00:02:02.009> cord

vertebrae and the spinal cord

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.969 
vertebrae and the spinal cord
I<00:02:02.780> hear<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.900> spinal<00:02:04.229> cord<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.500> turns<00:02:04.770> into

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
I hear the spinal cord that turns into

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.880 
I hear the spinal cord that turns into
the<00:02:05.159> brainstem<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.720> this<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.439> corpus
