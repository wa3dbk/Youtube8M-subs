00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.090
 Currently I buy feeling every day 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.010
 strawberries it rubbish but emotionally 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.380
 at least I constantly buy many 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.020
 strawberries and they just survive here 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.239

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.190

 currently very strawberry but it is 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.870
 yes also understandable the strawberry season 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.070
 is there not so long and we 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.590
 Just want that again 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.110
 take advantage of the strawberry then again 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.290

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.120

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.340
 she gives and I am so thankful about 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.960
 this summer fruit it is one of my 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.750
 I have to be honest about my favorite fruits 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.520
 admit and everything strawberry shake is yet 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.500
 already something fine or even apple cake 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.989
 or whatever else you make of it 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.549
 because then he just had to go with and 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.320
 if other bears are already next to the 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.030
 Strawberries are lying then I will be like that 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.890
 a bit tingling because for me 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 it somehow that sign 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.299
 strawberry time will soon be over 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.819
 currants and blueberries like that 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.530
 come slowly and I have here once 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.270
 red and once black currant 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.850
 taken away because I really like them 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.350
 I eat quite often has last 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.350
 with this johannes bear as well 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.170
 jam or just as shake and 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.359
 drink as moody i just love bears 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.100
 in any form and when fresh 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.380
 then I really have to long 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.780
 I think that's one of the tastiest 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.969
 Things that are fresh berries and before 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.579
 everything in müli, especially in berries, must be 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.079
 or in the mug or what you do with it 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.850
 Whatever I do with bears 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.829
 you are always right and I am 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.170
 currently really glad that we would be time 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.560
 of course if you have children in the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.139
 household loads of apples and also 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.420
 delicious bananas are apples and bananas 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:03.279
 here simply a staple food 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.240
 my children are currently growing apples and 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:07.420
 bananas 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.459
 what the stuff holds and clearly the children 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.429
 I am happy to eat fruits and vegetables 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.109
 I'm banal again 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.390
 shopped and as always defects 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.010
 Groups have been getting away from here too 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.659
 So my son there could be a whole 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.769
 eat citizens on the day I just come 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.010
 not afterwards 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.140
 He is very happy to be a group and yes 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.780
 I am curious when this cucumber phase 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.670
 at my son from now on anyway 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.420
 Salad cucumbers until the doctor comes 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.670
 had to go back and liked that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.829
 i still liked doing and bought curves 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.540
 and what I like right now are 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.120
 avocados this is nothing new though 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.099
 Currently mala vocabulary is higher 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.290
 than usual I just can not get enough 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.450
 and my little son 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.019
 is now slowly starting to avocados too 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.879
 eat 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.769
 he always grabbed me because he was 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.989
 just too slowly wants others 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.569
 try things and avocado are 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.430
 just great when it's football 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.689
 I look forward to the castle without giggs 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.120
 tortilla chips and guacamole perfect in 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.370
 chiesa diaz or perfect in rape 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.040
 in any case, without avocado, it is even here 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.900
 not so had avocados with and one 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.810
 super cook foundation form with me 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.819
 always shallot and garlic must 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.169
 I just really always have it in my house 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.409
 because I find shallots and garlic 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:23.359
 make a perfect foundation for almost 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.829
 it always smells good when 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.949
 teams on turns or too 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.239
 garlic andré I really like that 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:31.250
 and yes of course they must also buy 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.979
 cook over we want here in any 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.870
 Fall and colorful cherry tomatoes for 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.939
 you are looking great and currently 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.430
 Are you from Germany ? Here I am 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.560
 always happy when it's formidable 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.449
 I also really like the colorful ones 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.000
 they are increasingly in summer in the 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:49.099
 winter i see you somehow and me 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.359
 like the so much just in different 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.699
 courts and I think it's great too 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.739
 when it put a tomatensalat 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.689
 can and you have a green tomato raw 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.650
 tomatoes almost black tomatoes and 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.560
 geldautomaten 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.569
 I think that's totally cool for the eye 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.579
 is much the same for much longer and if 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.220
 There are colorful tomatoes I buy the 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.109
 always and now we strawberries and 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.750
 Bear time and I have an absolute 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.780
 fan of shaikhs or even if it 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.690
 Hot is really great like fruits 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.130
 shakes on ice and yes I have like me 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.139
 I immediately took with me because 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.819
 strawberries and currants and at 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.280
 because everything is freshly cured by is 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.319
 that's a great refreshment right now 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.999
 summer and when it is very hot 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.830
 then I make myself a big drink 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:32.060
 a big sheikh and there i feel 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.009
 I'm always much better 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.139
 and I think I'm totally cool 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.060
 soy milk tastes good to me as well 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.830
 Just have something else and me 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.139
 I loved the taste of hair 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.789
 very well used to it for me 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.830
 I really enjoy it very much then 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.520
 I always take them from the proud hofgut 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.529
 it's great 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.740
 I just like the taste of it all 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:55.879
 Best of all and yes, a strawberry 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.800
 drinking with milk banana and while 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.020
 just a perfect start to the day 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.060
 currently and for the coffee 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.469
 in between, of course, soymilk me 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.259
 still find that they are easy 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.539
 It's also best to foam and me 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.460
 I really like the taste 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.860
 always take pride in the hofgut 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.169
 Today somebody else stands and I like 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.240
 the soymilk just like and 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.219
 the farmyard proudly comes the soybeans 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.110
 also from Lake Constance 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.300
 they really build that themselves and there 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.219
 can you really be sure that 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.139
 the bean from germany is on it 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.520
 genetic engineering and everything 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.949
 others too and of course that is 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.360
 super and peter soybeans need more like that 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.819
 take care a little bit where they are 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.830
 comes from and what was done with it 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.409
 Soybeans are really great too 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.659
 that's why I want to do some gene manipulation 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.550
 always know exactly where the soybean 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.379
 come here and if I have a soybean 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.330
 Cultivation in Germany then gives 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.430
 of course I like to support that 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.099
 soya milk tastes great and the 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.860
 Coffee is so perfect where we are at 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.719
 Rapeseed oil rape is currently the absolute 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.939
 It has to go fast if you eat 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.800
 comes home in the evening and I still like that 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.960
 I am with the children and he is 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.300
 already asks what do we eat today then 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.039
 I think it has to go fast most of the time 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.139
 the stomach is already down to me 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.330
 because I'm not really eating yet 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.979
 came and then we go 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.259
 really super common rapeseed and that's why 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.270
 I once again bought the raps in the 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.449
 Organic stores also need to think I'm nourishing 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.660
 me of it and anyway they are great 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.520
 everything can be perfect confers 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.980
 knows that you can do everything in raps 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.230
 curl up and make it a perfect little one 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.900
 eat if you roll a wheel and fast 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.540
 take along or the way quite relish 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.400
 When football is on the couch I think 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.430
 It always raps perfectly just go 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.560
 always or and then I thought so myself 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.970
 could have two bad food again 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.740
 I have not done that in a long time 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.420
 find it actually quite tasty as 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.670
 fever with a bit of jam or 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.110
 she gets butter or you can too 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.720
 Do other things on it but I have 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.060
 that used to eaten so often in the past 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.130
 You can also take a kid with you and you can 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.620
 the rusk of the crumbs also guaranteed 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.690
 all full because it pays properly 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.370
 car again nice to suck if the 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.260
 Children should measure in the on 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.990
 he should think about it five times 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.850
 but in any case, I also think that's one 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.650
 good parts between meal I take 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.600
 very much like to love with the children 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.120
 orient the rusk and I think 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.100
 also zwieback however always and me 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.930
 I saw that I have my organic shop 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.910
 Again, this sugar and cinnamon mix 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.710
 There is now life tree 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.600
 somehow not longer and I think so 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.850
 are very practical to us even in 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.160
 Spender same to buy one can do that 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.710
 also home mission, of course, but me 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.120
 find it totally practical and I like it 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.730
 I like to have a nice one 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.440
 café and maybe once 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.480
 nice at the table seats or again 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.220
 in between probably rather somewhere stand 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.230
 and when I am ready then when the coffee 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.660
 drinking too much then stroked me super 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.130
 like to use the milk foam sugar and 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.960
 cinnamon about it a bit 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.560
 I think that makes the coffee still 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.760
 Above all else , yummy looks good and that 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.680
 I like it really well 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.169
 and now the refrigerator is back 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.240
 something filled and my heart something again 

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:03.280
 it calms many of you, I know 

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.140
 just hate empty refrigerators and 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.180
 when it comes to football and who to me 

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.980
 Coming together has to be easy 

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.750
 what delicious to be there, even if it 

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.240
 small things are delicious it must be 

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.130
 and I would say see you tomorrow 

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:20.640
 again to a new video if you 

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:20.640
 May and until tomorrow from 13 30 clock
