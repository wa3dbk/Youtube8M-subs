 have fun with the video first 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.230
 you should set your hearth to 180 degrees 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.869
 preheat and really not hot 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.519
 that is very important and then 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.060
 I'll show you the ingredients again 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.060
 needed here 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.649
 you need mail first 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.649
 the powder 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.899
 an egg 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.600
 ca 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.190
 Photo la macarena 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.180
 then not there you can also oat milk 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.070
 or use soy milk if you like 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 the chocolate behind to decorations 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.710
 otherwise you have bought and then 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.710
 you go 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 here just needs a whole 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.150
 normal mixing bowl otherwise you too 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.680
 Bake overused 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.080
 and then it's actually already 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.380
 The ingredients then found with the mail 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380
 on 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.500
 the whole then the girls too 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.200
 Next, the baking powder 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.689
 and skilfully open an egg who from 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.689
 you can 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.780
 Add to that 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.990
 so had 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.340
 because depending on which works for actually 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.340
 and then butter 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.460
 the cocoa 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.729
 and then it looks like this 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.470
 pretty mushy are not gone well 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.209
 In any case, there is then kidnap 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.150
 and that's what you do on medium 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.989
 level up her then a nice smooth 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.989
 dough you 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.580
 at this point could then already 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.960
 Let's try the dough maybe 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.610
 not cute enough yet i have that 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.100
 recipe is about as adapted that is 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.150
 not as it is if you want 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.530
 her then a little sugar 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.970
 Add it if you are not sweet yet 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.620
 is enough and stir the whole thing again 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.350
 then you need a smartphone 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.450
 molds or as a metal martin 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.380
 form one like I have the most 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.910
 last exactly for twelve muffins and then 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.920
 I still use this place 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.450
 margarine for my movies 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.650
 if you have paper transport - 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.650
 Of course, that did not need that 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.939
 after all the movies 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.219
 greased is indeed on the dough 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.290
 fill in and that's what you do on 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.030
 best no matter if now with halme brains 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.340
 have like me here or now 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.219
 paper form is best only until 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.739
 half because the mafia become the muffins 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:27.180
 pretty much rise and that's why you should 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.569
 you no longer attend that again only 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.569
 overflowing or unnecessarily wasting 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.919
 and if you fill all the boxes 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.900
 then it looks like that 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.430
 Here, if possible, only up to the middle 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.409
 if anything more 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.409
 and then the whole thing goes into the oven 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.849
 after 20 minutes our do then 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.980
 ready and you could get out of the oven 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.200
 he will be careful 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.239
 be as with everything you get out of 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.280
 call rausholt there is of course a lot 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.260
 is very hot and then you leave that 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.720
 muffins just about ten more 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.510
 rent from cologne and then you can 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.519
 then very carefully from your form 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.859
 can make extract or paper one 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.680
 yes also so redevelop and that 's it then 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.480
 my dear my fans are seeing here now 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.250
 So on the device with the chocolate on 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.419
 the plate and if you have the concept 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.889
 I would like myself a 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.150
 Comment by or if it is natural 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.460
 would do after 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.990
 I think that's really great if 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.000
 Give me a picture on instagram of it 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.620
