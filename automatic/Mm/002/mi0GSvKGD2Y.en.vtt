00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.359 
just come off a camp from college season
so<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.590> haven't<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.890> played<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.250> each

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so we haven't really played with each

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.819 
so we haven't really played with each
other<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.909> much<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.659> think<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.590> has

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
other that much but I think that has

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.090 
other that much but I think that has
really<00:01:38.610> stepped<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.200> look<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:40.950> us<00:01:41.070> now

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
really stepped up and I look at us now

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.700 
really stepped up and I look at us now
or<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> World<00:01:42.240> Cup<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
or going to the World Cup I was so

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
or going to the World Cup I was so
impressed<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.189> our<00:01:44.310> style<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.670> play<00:01:44.820> from

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
impressed with our style of play from

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.969 
impressed with our style of play from
the<00:01:45.420> first<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.110> touch<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> ball<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.860> were

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the first time we touch the ball we were

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889 
the first time we touch the ball we were
combining<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.640> finding<00:01:47.909> fee<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.810> was

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
combining and finding fee and it was

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.749 
combining and finding fee and it was
great<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.100> kept<00:01:50.250> our<00:01:50.369> son<00:01:50.520> play

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
great to see that we kept our son play

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.080 
great to see that we kept our son play
not<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.030> against<00:01:52.100> group<00:01:53.100> play<00:01:53.310> games<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.850> in

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
not just against group play games but in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
not just against group play games but in
tougher<00:01:54.600> games<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.079> tougher<00:01:55.590> opponents<00:01:56.040> and
