00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
a two-year contract I believe is his

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.510 
a two-year contract I believe is his
deal<00:01:19.280> expires<00:01:19.640> after<00:01:19.820> 2014<00:01:20.799> he<00:01:21.799> said<00:01:22.040> on<00:01:22.190> draft

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
deal expires after 2014 he said on draft

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.490 
deal expires after 2014 he said on draft
day<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.909> he<00:01:23.030> wanted<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.270> retire<00:01:23.540> at<00:01:23.810> 36<00:01:24.320> and

day that he wanted to retire at 36 and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.770 
day that he wanted to retire at 36 and
before<00:01:24.770> last<00:01:25.010> season<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:25.430> believe<00:01:25.570> he<00:01:26.570> said

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
before last season I believe he said

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.420 
before last season I believe he said
that<00:01:26.810> he<00:01:26.990> still<00:01:27.200> wanted<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.439> retire<00:01:27.740> at<00:01:27.890> 36<00:01:28.340> and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
that he still wanted to retire at 36 and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.800 
that he still wanted to retire at 36 and
that<00:01:28.610> would<00:01:28.729> be<00:01:28.909> after<00:01:29.090> his<00:01:29.299> contracts<00:01:29.600> up<00:01:29.689> in

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
that would be after his contracts up in

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.719 
that would be after his contracts up in
2014<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:30.890> I'm<00:01:31.070> interested<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.430> see<00:01:31.549> if<00:01:31.640> he

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
2014 so I'm interested to see if he

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.090 
2014 so I'm interested to see if he
still<00:01:31.909> does<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.299> I<00:01:32.750> don't<00:01:33.680> think<00:01:33.890> he's<00:01:33.979> gonna

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
still does that I don't think he's gonna

which<00:02:40.160> right<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:40.340> he<00:02:40.460> necessarily<00:02:40.670> doesn't

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
which right now he necessarily doesn't

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.840 
which right now he necessarily doesn't
really<00:02:41.480> necessarily<00:02:41.710> but<00:02:42.710> um<00:02:42.950> yeah<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.790> think

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
really necessarily but um yeah I think

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.820 
really necessarily but um yeah I think

yeah but a week since he got hurt I said

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.790 
yeah but a week since he got hurt I said
I<00:02:58.850> think<00:02:58.940> exactly<00:02:59.690> we<00:02:59.840> didn't<00:03:00.140> he<00:03:00.200> get<00:03:00.290> hurt

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
I think exactly we didn't he get hurt

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.000 
I think exactly we didn't he get hurt
and<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.160> got<00:03:01.280> hurt<00:03:01.370> like<00:03:01.489> last<00:03:01.670> Tuesday<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.380> I

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
and I got hurt like last Tuesday so I I

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.470 
and I got hurt like last Tuesday so I I
like<00:03:04.190> pad<00:03:04.370> we<00:03:04.489> saw<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.640> lot<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:05.030> agree<00:03:05.270> with<00:03:05.390> him

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
like pad we saw a lot I agree with him

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.670 
like pad we saw a lot I agree with him
coming<00:03:05.720> off<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.930> bench<00:03:06.050> though<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.290> think<00:03:06.440> that

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
coming off the bench though I think that

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.110 
coming off the bench though I think that
his<00:03:06.830> skill<00:03:07.100> set<00:03:07.280> doesn't<00:03:07.489> work<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:07.940> Dwight

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
his skill set doesn't work with Dwight

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.670 
his skill set doesn't work with Dwight
Howard's<00:03:08.450> list<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.170> doesn't<00:03:09.290> work<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
Howard's list it doesn't work in the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.080 
Howard's list it doesn't work in the
D'Antoni<00:03:10.040> system<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.640> think<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:10.970> his

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
D'Antoni system and I think that his

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.570 
D'Antoni system and I think that his
skill<00:03:11.360> set<00:03:11.390> is<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.470> good<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:12.739> he<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.190> almost

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
skill set is so good that he can almost

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.040 
skill set is so good that he can almost
be<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.850> James<00:03:14.150> Harden<00:03:14.450> type<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.810> run<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
be a James Harden type and run the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.660 
be a James Harden type and run the
offense<00:03:15.380> through<00:03:15.620> him<00:03:15.739> with<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.220> second<00:03:16.520> unit

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
offense through him with the second unit

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.850 
offense through him with the second unit
so<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:16.940> like<00:03:17.209> him<00:03:17.300> coming<00:03:17.510> off<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> bench<00:03:17.959> but

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
so I like him coming off the bench but

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.229 
so I like him coming off the bench but
obviously<00:03:19.400> he's<00:03:19.520> hurt<00:03:19.700> right<00:03:19.850> now<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.150> that

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
obviously he's hurt right now so that

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.010 
obviously he's hurt right now so that
doesn't<00:03:20.390> really<00:03:20.540> matter

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
doesn't really matter

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.470 
doesn't really matter
oh<00:03:21.700> Clark<00:03:22.700> is<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:22.910> guy<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.239> really<00:03:23.270> like

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
I'll move on some of the younger guys

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.080 
I'll move on some of the younger guys
but<00:03:25.070> then<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.220> think<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.519> like<00:03:25.700> for<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.880> future

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
of Danilo Gallinari probably a better

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.420 
good I think they should keep him around
especially<00:04:00.019> because<00:04:00.260> I'm<00:04:01.040> with<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.310> whole

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
especially because I'm with the whole

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.770 
especially because I'm with the whole
D'Antoni<00:04:01.820> situation<00:04:02.330> which<00:04:02.480> I'll<00:04:02.600> get<00:04:02.720> into

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.600 
in a little bit I think that he's gonna
fence<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:05.989> system<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.680> that<00:04:07.310> they<00:04:07.459> should

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
fence that system and that they should

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.280 
fence that system and that they should
that<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:07.910> have<00:04:08.299> him<00:04:08.420> stick<00:04:08.690> around<00:04:08.810> or<00:04:09.080> whatever

think this team they have to think about

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.129 
think this team they have to think about

the future quite frankly you know they

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.480 
the future quite frankly you know they
they<00:05:54.409> screw<00:05:54.650> themselves<00:05:54.830> over<00:05:55.190> by<00:05:55.280> hiring

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
they screw themselves over by hiring

Panther contract they're still paying

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.480

Mike<00:06:08.150> Brown<00:06:08.389> right<00:06:08.599> now<00:06:08.780> but<00:06:09.530> they're<00:06:09.770> you

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
Mike Brown right now but they're you

and<00:06:13.039> another<00:06:13.460> coach<00:06:13.699> further<00:06:14.120> down<00:06:14.330> the<00:06:14.449> line

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
and another coach further down the line

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.640 
and another coach further down the line
and<00:06:14.780> I<00:06:14.840> think<00:06:14.870> that's<00:06:15.169> one<00:06:15.289> of<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.380> reasons

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
and I think that's one of the reasons

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.620 
and I think that's one of the reasons
why<00:06:15.770> Jim<00:06:16.460> bus<00:06:16.639> didn't<00:06:16.849> want<00:06:17.000> to<00:06:17.090> hire<00:06:17.270> Phil

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
why Jim bus didn't want to hire Phil

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.850 
why Jim bus didn't want to hire Phil
