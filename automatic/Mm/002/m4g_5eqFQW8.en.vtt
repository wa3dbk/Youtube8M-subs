00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
out okay so battery life uses Bordeaux a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
out okay so battery life uses Bordeaux a
batteries<00:00:52.410> except<00:00:52.829> mine's<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.129> mod

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
batteries except mine's a bit mod

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.080 
batteries except mine's a bit mod
