positive so I just I've been grateful to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.029 
positive so I just I've been grateful to
have<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> tool<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.200> gives<00:00:46.680> feedback

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and I think that is one of the main

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
and I think that is one of the main
problems<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:50.910> kids<00:00:51.300> shooting<00:00:51.570> today<00:00:51.870> young

two handed shooters they thumb the ball

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
two handed shooters they thumb the ball
however<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.219> want<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> phrase<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
however you want to phrase it but that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.689 
however you want to phrase it but that
is<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> great<00:00:57.859> tool<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.890> doesn't<00:00:59.250> restrict

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is a great tool that doesn't restrict

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
say that go so far as to say that every

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
young player should really start out

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.789 
young player should really start out
with<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> hone<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> their<00:01:19.409> their

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
with it just to hone in and their their

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.490 
with it just to hone in and their their
their<00:01:20.460> mechanics<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> their<00:01:21.720> form<00:01:22.049> yeah<00:01:22.470> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
their mechanics and their form yeah I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.350 
their mechanics and their form yeah I
think<00:01:22.740> it'd<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.860> great<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.400> said<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.000> used

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
think it'd be great as I said I I used

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600 
think it'd be great as I said I I used
it<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.220> college<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
it you know when I was in college and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
it you know when I was in college and
you<00:01:26.700> were<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> NBA<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you were in the NBA just not all the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.780 
you were in the NBA just not all the
time<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.040> shot<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.430> pretty<00:01:29.670> well

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
time because my shot was pretty well

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
time because my shot was pretty well
grooved<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> thought<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> helped

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
grooved but but I thought it helped

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
grooved but but I thought it helped
because<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> said<00:01:32.490> honed<00:01:32.790> me<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
because it as you said honed me in and

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.140 
because it as you said honed me in and
no<00:01:34.290> question<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.430> building<00:01:35.820> blocks<00:01:36.030> for

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
no question the building blocks for

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
no question the building blocks for
being<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> great<00:01:36.840> shooter<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.650> established

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
being a great shooter can be established

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
being a great shooter can be established
and<00:01:38.400> they<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.579> established<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.450> younger

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and they are established at a younger

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.469 
and they are established at a younger
age<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.610> develop<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
age and if you can can develop just a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.380 
age and if you can can develop just a
great<00:01:42.750> one-handed<00:01:43.470> shot<00:01:43.700> using<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
great one-handed shot using that and

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.289 
great one-handed shot using that and
just<00:01:45.540> breaking<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.229> form<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:48.149> it's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
just breaking down form I think it's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.359 
just breaking down form I think it's
wise<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:49.409> everybody<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.340> like

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
wise for for everybody to do it and like

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.710 
wise for for everybody to do it and like
I<00:01:50.460> said<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.700> used<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.329> I've<00:01:51.450> seen<00:01:51.570> other

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I said I used it and I've seen other

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
I said I used it and I've seen other
people<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.470> are<00:01:52.560> pretty

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
people use it that are pretty

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.560 
people use it that are pretty
accomplished<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.490> their<00:01:53.610> shot

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570
