00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone with your tongue and today i 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.390
 I want to talk to you about 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.090
 mac computers rather today we 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.620
 discuss the question of whether the poppy hangs and how 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.780
 speed up your other's work 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.990
 computer from sam best company 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.990
 This put seems better go 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.410
 Of course, the magician as 7 is known 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.599
 practically freezes but with strong 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 load with insufficient volume from 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.399
 rites on memory or marks on hard 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.800
 disk then at a certain load magician 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.719
 runs slower and best but not 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.450
 the cheapest way is speeding up your 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.610
 mac it is not difficult to guess update 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.430
 RAM to more powerful and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.860
 replace hard drive with ssd drive if u 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.840
 you he is still like me hard but if 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.520
 yet you do not want to change anything at 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.440
 the fact that you have a computer is not very powerful 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.070
 then I'll show you some not so much 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.329
 tricky ways to speed it up and 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.300
 the first is to promote your operating room 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.609
 system for updates and if they 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.530
 there is something i recommend you them immediately 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.659
 install like every update 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.570
 apple takes into account some old mistakes 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.369
 if they are and fixes them well and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.729
 tries to do software 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.350
 more quickly than previous versions 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.869
 the second is to cancel the launch of all programs 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.330
 when you turn on the computer and hit them out 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.320
 list of objects of entry for this go 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.659
 system settings 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.240
 group users and then to objects 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.640
 login and cancel automatically spare 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.890
 all applications on the list by ticking off 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 to the left of the program name and then 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.530
 select all the programs and hitting them by clicking 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.020
 on minus meeting you need to free 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.299
 on your hard or ssd disks as you can 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.229
 more space remove all unnecessary 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.329
 program files 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.979
 downloads and so on as for 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.170
 fully correct work you 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.909
 must have at least 10 percent 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.530
 free space on your hard 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.350
 and also ssd 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.000
 4 Try not to clog your workman. 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.920
 the table and in return you can just walk 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.770
 data on the desktop in some folder 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.300
 on your hard disk 5 if you 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.160
 do not turn off the computer completely 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.350
 then reboot it at least once 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.600
 a week to complete absolutely everyone 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.890
 programs and processes and always try 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.560
 work with a minimum amount 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 open programs i.e. complete all 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.320
 previously opened program 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.570
 which at the moment you are not 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.550
 use completes programmatically you can 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.290
 pressing the key commands generally escape 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.990
 either clicking on apple meadow 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.000
 in the upper left corner and choose from the list 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.950
 complete shrill and complete all 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.450
 programs you don't need at the moment 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.100
 but last thing i can you 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.200
 recommend this check right 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.330
 access and drive and fix errors 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.220
 if they so go 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.959
 disk utility do not worry it 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 the application is pre- installed on your 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.550
 mac choose the default hard disk 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.380
 it should be called mac hd 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.970
 and here you will need to check the rights 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.370
 access and check disk 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.290
 and then fix it it will take a couple 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.410
 minutes of course that depends on the speed 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.030
 your hard disk or ssd as well 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.340
 I can recommend you to change your 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.019
 hard drive to ssd drive it speed up 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.330
 work your mind at least twice 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.549
 because sooner or later you will have to 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.620
 do well, and on this all I hope you 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.519
