00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
some pretty good quality now I i believe

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.810 
some pretty good quality now I i believe
i'll<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.770> uploading<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.250> video<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.700> either

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
i'll be uploading this video in either

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.120 
i'll be uploading this video in either
720<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.659> 1080<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:19.530> completely<00:01:19.830> sure<00:01:20.100> yet

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
720 or 1080 and my completely sure yet

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.850 
720 or 1080 and my completely sure yet
because<00:01:20.640> i<00:01:20.880> believe<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> front<00:01:21.869> camera<00:01:22.049> only

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
because i believe the front camera only

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
because i believe the front camera only
does<00:01:23.369> 720<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> back<00:01:24.540> camera<00:01:24.840> does<00:01:25.110> 1080

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
does 720 but the back camera does 1080

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
does 720 but the back camera does 1080
so<00:01:26.070> i<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.189> i'm<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> upload<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.119> 720

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so i think i'm going to upload it in 720

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.420 
so i think i'm going to upload it in 720

able to see the true quality of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.950 
able to see the true quality of
everything<00:01:32.000> using<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> front-facing<00:01:33.479> camera

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
everything using the front-facing camera

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
everything using the front-facing camera
too<00:01:34.110> well<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.590> i<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.860> outside<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.280> i<00:01:35.490> will

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
too well so i can go outside now i will

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
too well so i can go outside now i will
warn<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> though<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.570> getting<00:01:37.200> closer<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
warn you though it is getting closer to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
warn you though it is getting closer to
winter<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.400> 30<00:01:38.759> degrees<00:01:38.939> out

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
winter here it's like 30 degrees out

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
winter here it's like 30 degrees out
actually<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.930> 31<00:01:40.380> degrees<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.250> be

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
actually think it's 31 degrees out to be

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
actually think it's 31 degrees out to be
exact<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> colors<00:01:43.079> aren't<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:43.590> good

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
exact so the colors aren't very good

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
exact so the colors aren't very good
we've<00:01:44.310> had<00:01:44.430> leaves<00:01:44.700> fall<00:01:44.970> off<00:01:45.000> already<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
we've had leaves fall off already so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.969 
we've had leaves fall off already so
there's<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.560> too<00:01:46.649> many<00:01:46.799> colors

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
there's not going to be too many colors

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.590 
there's not going to be too many colors
outside<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:48.030> case<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.270> guys<00:01:48.390> want
