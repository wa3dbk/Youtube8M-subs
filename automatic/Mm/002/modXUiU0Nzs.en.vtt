00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
answer being yeah and I'll go into it

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.859 
answer being yeah and I'll go into it
just<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.240> why<00:00:30.330> I'll<00:00:30.539> keep<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> as

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
just a bit as to why I'll keep it as

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
just a bit as to why I'll keep it as
short<00:00:30.900> as<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.380> visual<00:00:32.070> quality<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
short as I can visual quality of the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.620 
short as I can visual quality of the
models<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:32.910> included<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.450> package

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
models that are included in this package

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.139 
models that are included in this package
that<00:00:33.930> included<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> 700-900<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> 1000

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that included the 700-900 in the 1000

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.119 
that included the 700-900 in the 1000
it's<00:00:36.660> actually<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:37.230> bad<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.739> nice<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it's actually not bad it's nice and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's actually not bad it's nice and
reflective<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> gear<00:00:38.879> animations<00:00:39.329> are

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
reflective the gear animations are

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.600 
reflective the gear animations are
overall<00:00:39.809> ok<00:00:40.230> which<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.219> didn't<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.489> by

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
overall ok which if you didn't know by

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
overall ok which if you didn't know by
now<00:00:41.730> I'm<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:41.879> particular<00:00:42.210> about<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.840> gear

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
now I'm pretty particular about the gear

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.360 
now I'm pretty particular about the gear
if<00:00:43.170> they're<00:00:43.290> sinking<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:43.739> or<00:00:44.040> sink<00:00:44.280> at

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
if they're sinking a little or sink at

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.680 
if they're sinking a little or sink at
all<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.820> makes<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.180> want<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> pull<00:00:45.539> what

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
all it makes me just want to pull what

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.209 
all it makes me just want to pull what
little<00:00:45.899> hair<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> gears<00:00:47.070> are

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
little hair I have out the gears are

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.410 
little hair I have out the gears are
fine<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.579> pilot's<00:00:47.879> perspective<00:00:47.910> from

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
fine the pilot's perspective from

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
fine the pilot's perspective from
outside<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> aircraft<00:00:49.079> aren't<00:00:49.530> bad<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
outside the aircraft aren't bad the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.490 
outside the aircraft aren't bad the
copilot<00:00:50.190> seems<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.120> times<00:00:51.360> eating<00:00:52.320> his

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
copilot seems to be at times eating his

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.869 
copilot seems to be at times eating his
headset<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.190> which<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.579> could<00:00:53.730> hide

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
headset a little which I could hide

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.160 
headset a little which I could hide
pretty<00:00:54.149> easy<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.629> an<00:00:54.780> issue<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
pretty easy so that's not an issue the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.569 
pretty easy so that's not an issue the
point<00:00:55.379> being<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.489> from

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
point being that I think just from

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.099 
point being that I think just from
watching<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.210> video<00:00:57.539> most<00:00:57.780> people<00:00:58.020> can

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
watching this video most people can

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.750 
watching this video most people can
probably<00:00:58.530> agree<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.100> say<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> judging<00:00:59.670> from

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
probably agree and say the judging from

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
probably agree and say the judging from
the<00:00:59.879> exterior<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.329> not<00:01:00.449> bad<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.899> actually

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the exterior it's not bad it's actually

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
the exterior it's not bad it's actually
pretty<00:01:01.289> good<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.219> when<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:02.699> VC

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
pretty good but when we get into VC

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.609 
pretty good but when we get into VC
integration<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.690> flight<00:01:03.899> dynamics<00:01:04.049> it's

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
integration of flight dynamics it's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.410 
integration of flight dynamics it's
rough<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.369> me<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.549> work<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.119> paint's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
rough for me to work with the paint's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.640 
rough for me to work with the paint's
that<00:01:06.510> come<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.840> aren't<00:01:07.080> great<00:01:07.350> but

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that come with it aren't great but

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.899 
that come with it aren't great but
they're<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:07.920> bad<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.549> something<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
they're not bad if this is something you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.219 
they're not bad if this is something you
would<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> take<00:01:09.330> photos<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.689> roof

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
would want to take photos with roof

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.690 
would want to take photos with roof
around<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> bad<00:01:11.490> Buy

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
around in I don't think it's a bad Buy

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.250 
around in I don't think it's a bad Buy
but<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.060> you've<00:01:12.150> got<00:01:12.299> real<00:01:12.630> experience<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
but if you've got real experience in

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.690
