00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.509
 I want to show you how I am 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:14.410
 I collect blueberries with a combine 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:16.500
 any he cooked himself collected like this 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.500
 happens 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.240
 the most important thing in the company is to have bushes 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.220
 were 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.669
 different 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.360
 then the selection is effective if 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.090
 same berries to walk them a little to collect 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.770
 combine one berry it turns out 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.930
 I will decide on the account with your hands 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.079
 so the efficiency of the combine 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.239
 due only to the number of berries 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.989
 need to find bushes where the blog berries 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:54.480
 then the selection happens really in 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:58.809
 times faster 10 times faster than hands 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.199
 but good plantations are needed for this 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.939
 through 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.490
 if blueberries are few and you collect 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:09.810
 there is one berry 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.810
 decreasing efficiency 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.080
 literally for some ten to fifteen 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.080
 minutes i'm remember remember
