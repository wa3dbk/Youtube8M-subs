let it twist upon itself and what
happens<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.790> twists<00:02:17.239> up<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:19.250> makes<00:02:19.430> a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
happens is it twists up and it makes a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.550 
happens is it twists up and it makes a
fat<00:02:19.910> cord<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:22.250> only<00:02:22.700> crucial<00:02:23.390> point<00:02:23.690> or<00:02:23.989> scary

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
fat cord the only crucial point or scary

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.500 
fat cord the only crucial point or scary
point<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.370> want<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.670> hold<00:02:25.849> all<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.180> this

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
point is you want to hold all of this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.630 
point is you want to hold all of this
together<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.349> tie<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> knot<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.810> doesn't

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
together and tie a knot so it doesn't

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.320 
together and tie a knot so it doesn't
untwist<00:02:31.640> thin<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.319> tied<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.860> knot<00:02:34.330> nice

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
untwist thin so you tied the knot nice

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.589 
untwist thin so you tied the knot nice
and<00:02:35.629> tight<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.290> then<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:37.700> rub<00:02:37.940> your<00:02:38.120> hands

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
and tight and then just rub your hands

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.820 
and tight and then just rub your hands
over<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:41.540> get<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> nice<00:02:42.019> twisted<00:02:42.590> cord

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
over it and you get a nice twisted cord

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.759 
over it and you get a nice twisted cord
in<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:44.030> case<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.810> can<00:02:44.989> see<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.290> I've<00:02:45.530> used

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
in this case you can see that I've used

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.580 
in this case you can see that I've used
three<00:02:46.040> different<00:02:46.390> colors<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> dark<00:02:47.930> purple<00:02:48.410> a

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
three different colors a dark purple a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.160 
three different colors a dark purple a
medium<00:02:49.010> purple<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.700> yellow<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.959> make<00:02:51.110> a

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
medium purple and the yellow to make a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.490 
medium purple and the yellow to make a
very<00:02:51.709> very<00:02:51.980> gated<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.420> interesting<00:02:54.140> cord

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
very very gated but interesting cord

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.550 
very very gated but interesting cord
while<00:02:55.400> these<00:02:55.610> cords<00:02:56.090> were<00:02:56.209> all<00:02:56.390> used<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.200> same

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
while these cords were all used the same

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.759 
while these cords were all used the same
so<00:02:58.489> they're<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> little<00:02:58.970> bit<00:02:59.180> plainer<00:02:59.769> this

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
so they're a little bit plainer this

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.220 
so they're a little bit plainer this
piece<00:03:01.129> I<00:03:01.519> used<00:03:03.849> color<00:03:04.849> specifically<00:03:05.840> chosen

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
piece I used color specifically chosen

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.740 
piece I used color specifically chosen
to<00:03:06.709> pull<00:03:06.950> out<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.400> hand<00:03:07.670> dyed<00:03:07.879> fabrics<00:03:08.510> on

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
to pull out the hand dyed fabrics on

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.150 
to pull out the hand dyed fabrics on
this<00:03:09.650> little<00:03:09.950> purse<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:11.299> color<00:03:11.510> coordinate<00:03:12.160> so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
this little purse to color coordinate so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.430 
this little purse to color coordinate so
