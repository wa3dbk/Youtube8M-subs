more but you know five star skill moves
is<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.590> right<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.010> especially<00:01:08.340> when

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
is all right you know especially when

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.390 
is all right you know especially when
they<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.760> flare<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:10.110> cassano<00:01:10.799> isn't<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.189> think

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
they are flare but cassano isn't I think

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
they are flare but cassano isn't I think
the<00:01:11.520> reason<00:01:11.670> why<00:01:11.880> he<00:01:11.970> goes<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.390> cheap

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the reason why he goes for so cheap

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.609 
the reason why he goes for so cheap
because<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.170> stats<00:01:13.470> like

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
because these other stats like

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
because these other stats like
outstanding<00:01:13.920> i<00:01:14.189> mean<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.640> defense<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
outstanding i mean not defense and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.490 
outstanding i mean not defense and
heading<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.509> i<00:01:15.540> mean<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.720> his<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.290> know

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
heading but i mean like his you know

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.499 
heading but i mean like his you know
shots<00:01:16.920> past<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> dribbling<00:01:17.970> especially<00:01:18.420> his

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
shots past and dribbling especially his

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.090 
shots past and dribbling especially his
dribbling<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> reason<00:01:19.740> he<00:01:19.920> probably

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
dribbling but the reason he probably

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.890 
dribbling but the reason he probably
goes<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.580> cheap<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.210> i'm<00:01:21.390> gonna<00:01:21.689> guess

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
goes for so cheap is but i'm gonna guess

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.870 
goes for so cheap is but i'm gonna guess
it's<00:01:22.110> mainly<00:01:22.350> due<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> his<00:01:22.830> pace<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.670> he's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's mainly due to his pace because he's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.660 
it's mainly due to his pace because he's
got<00:01:23.970> 76<00:01:24.450> pace<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> some<00:01:25.530> reason<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.369> all<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
got 76 pace and some reason and all the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.300 
got 76 pace and some reason and all the
team<00:01:26.880> players<00:01:27.270> only<00:01:28.080> temp<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> sell<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.100> more

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
team players only temp to sell for more

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.789 
team players only temp to sell for more
if<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.060> pace<00:01:30.329> now<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.619> too
