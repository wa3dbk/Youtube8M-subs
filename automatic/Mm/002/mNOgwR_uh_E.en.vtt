probably the only two days and then too
much<00:01:14.570> we<00:01:15.570> drilled<00:01:16.350> all<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> holes<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
much we drilled all the holes for the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
much we drilled all the holes for the
wires<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.570> everything<00:01:18.600> still<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> little

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
wires and everything still a little

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
wires and everything still a little
messy<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.780> got<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> do

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
messy but you know do what you got to do

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
messy but you know do what you got to do
and<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.369> thought<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.790> fix<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.299> hole

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and this I just thought to fix that hole

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
and this I just thought to fix that hole
because<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.860> bit<00:01:26.009> too<00:01:26.159> small

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
because it was a little bit too small

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.960 
because it was a little bit too small
for<00:01:26.610> these<00:01:26.700> RCA's<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.479> through<00:01:28.400> yeah<00:01:29.400> but

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
for these RCA's to go through yeah but

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.969 
for these RCA's to go through yeah but
