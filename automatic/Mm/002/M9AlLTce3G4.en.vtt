one<00:00:00.299> way<00:00:00.480> to<00:00:00.510> prevent<00:00:00.719> flight<00:00:01.290> bumps<00:00:01.709> and

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
one way to prevent flight bumps and

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.010 
one way to prevent flight bumps and
delays<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.399> by<00:00:02.550> taking<00:00:03.060> care<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.300> mechanical

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020
