and I think it's going to have my login

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.560 
and I think it's going to have my login
already<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.190> there<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.880> should<00:01:17.150> be<00:01:17.180> trying

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
already in there so it should be trying

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.690 
already in there so it should be trying
to<00:01:18.520> authenticate<00:01:19.520> with<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:21.700> connecting

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
to authenticate with that connecting

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.000 
to authenticate with that connecting
there<00:01:23.180> goes<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:25.130> then<00:01:26.380> let's<00:01:27.380> see<00:01:27.560> if<00:01:27.650> we<00:01:27.800> can

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
there goes and then let's see if we can

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.670 
there goes and then let's see if we can
