this<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> rock<00:00:05.939> on<00:00:06.240> celestial<00:00:07.019> delay

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
this is a rock on celestial delay

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:27.480 
this is a rock on celestial delay
demonstration

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:47.770 

you

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.319 

the<00:00:48.780> rock<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.230> has<00:00:49.620> three<00:00:50.370> votes<00:00:50.399> across<00:00:50.970> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the rock on has three votes across the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.619 
the rock on has three votes across the
top<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.790> volume<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
top the first one is the volume what the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.860 
top the first one is the volume what the
volume<00:00:55.019> does<00:00:55.260> that's<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.870> that's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
volume does that's this one here that's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.799 
volume does that's this one here that's
the<00:00:58.230> volume<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:58.980> mix<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.970> one<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the volume of the mix this one here is a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.249 
the volume of the mix this one here is a
regenerate<00:01:01.970> what<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.120> regenerate<00:01:03.720> is<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
regenerate what to regenerate is it's

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.980 
regenerate what to regenerate is it's
the<00:01:04.470> echo<00:01:04.619> repeat<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the echo repeat this one here is the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.700 
the echo repeat this one here is the
time<00:01:07.460> that's<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.759> delay<00:01:09.240> time<00:01:09.409> it<00:01:10.409> has

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
time that's the delay time it has

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.249 
time that's the delay time it has
another<00:01:11.070> button<00:01:11.399> at<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> bottom<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.110> can

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
another button at the bottom it you can

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.680 
another button at the bottom it you can
have<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.470> 1x<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.369> 2x<00:01:14.910> what<00:01:15.149> that<00:01:15.330> will<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.660> is

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
have it 1x or 2x what that will do is

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.060 
have it 1x or 2x what that will do is
just<00:01:16.170> repeat<00:01:16.649> double<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.810> double<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.170> mix

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
just repeat double the double the mix

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.020 
just repeat double the double the mix
that<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.399> have<00:01:20.610> right<00:01:21.030> now<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:23.820> over

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that you have right now this one over

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.590 
that you have right now this one over
here<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.690> fast<00:01:24.990> or<00:01:25.770> slow<00:01:26.190> okay<00:01:27.030> depend<00:01:27.450> on

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
here is the fast or slow okay depend on

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.800 
here is the fast or slow okay depend on
which<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:28.050> you<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:29.270> let<00:01:30.270> me<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.539> go<00:01:30.720> ahead

going<00:01:35.789> to<00:01:35.850> take<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.149> volume<00:01:36.539> now<00:01:38.990> there<00:01:39.990> it's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
going to take the volume now there it's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.580 
going to take the volume now there it's
off<00:01:41.960> any<00:01:42.960> creasing<00:01:45.049> but<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.259> still<00:01:46.470> adjusting

I have it set somewhere around nine

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.259 
I have it set somewhere around nine
o'clock<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.959> next<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.620> time<00:02:29.269> that's

o'clock the next one is the time that's
the<00:02:30.420> delay<00:02:30.750> time<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.890> increase<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the delay time you can increase the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
the delay time you can increase the
delay<00:02:32.730> time<00:02:35.269> or<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.420> let<00:02:36.569> are<00:02:36.780> decreasing<00:02:38.390> its

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
delay time or you let are decreasing its

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.479 
delay time or you let are decreasing its
lower<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.709> sit<00:02:46.980> somewhere<00:02:47.280> around
