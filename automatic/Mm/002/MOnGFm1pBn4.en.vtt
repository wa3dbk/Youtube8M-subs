00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.250 

excuse<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.350> camera<00:02:52.739> focusing<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:55.019> there's

excuse the camera focusing so there's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.140 
excuse the camera focusing so there's
the<00:02:55.410> bottom<00:02:55.560> part<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:57.019> I'll<00:02:58.019> leave<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.260> there

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
the bottom part so I'll leave that there

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.490 
the bottom part so I'll leave that there
I'll<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.329> focused<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:04.290> that's<00:03:06.350> seven<00:03:07.350> these

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:17.030 
I'll be focused and that's seven these
segments<00:03:07.859> just<00:03:08.010> pop<00:03:08.220> off

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.030

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
so here is the main power it feels quite

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.620 
so here is the main power it feels quite
breakable<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:24.880> I'll<00:03:24.970> be<00:03:25.270> careful<00:03:25.540> with<00:03:25.810> her

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
breakable so I'll be careful with her

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:38.100 
breakable so I'll be careful with her
so<00:03:28.630> here<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.110> main<00:03:29.290> part<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.870> there's<00:03:38.050> a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
so here is the main part so there's a

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.650 
so here is the main part so there's a
main<00:03:38.320> part<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:40.630> feels<00:03:41.140> quite<00:03:41.530> nice<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:43.180> came

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
main part it feels quite nice you came

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.280 
main part it feels quite nice you came
and<00:03:43.840> plasticky<00:03:44.410> but<00:03:44.830> not<00:03:45.790> too<00:03:45.940> bad<00:03:46.180> was<00:03:47.140> to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
and plasticky but not too bad was to

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.400 
and plasticky but not too bad was to
drag<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.710> on<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.860> front<00:03:48.130> obviously<00:03:49.410> so

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
drag it on the front obviously so

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.040 
drag it on the front obviously so
there's<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.740> dragon<00:03:53.250> sword<00:03:54.250> behind<00:03:54.930> turn<00:03:55.930> all

fire

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:22.650 
fire
I'm<00:04:06.940> assuming<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:07.750> part<00:04:08.080> goes<00:04:08.290> on<00:04:08.470> here<00:04:21.660> I'll

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
I'm assuming this part goes on here I'll

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.780 
I'm assuming this part goes on here I'll
just<00:04:22.690> set<00:04:23.140> him<00:04:23.170> like<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:25.350> that'll<00:04:26.350> be

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
just set him like that that'll be

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.520 
just set him like that that'll be
something<00:04:27.790> along<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.330> lines<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:31.530> so

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
something along the lines of that so

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.190 
something along the lines of that so
let's<00:04:32.740> open<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.550> up<00:04:33.610> back<00:04:33.880> up<00:04:34.090> now<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:35.020> I'll

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
let's open it up back up now and I'll

let's open it up back up now and I'll
have<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.380> look<00:04:35.590> inside<00:04:36.070> that<00:04:37.590> stuff<00:04:38.590> inside<00:04:39.300> so

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.280
