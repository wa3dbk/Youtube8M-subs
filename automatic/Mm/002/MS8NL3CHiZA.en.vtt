00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:34.980
 of an empty jam jar or 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:38.649

 making the recipe to get started 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:08.409
 we will fill our pressure cooker back 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:12.100
 with enough water to get to 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.350
 cover our can with condensed milk 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.490
