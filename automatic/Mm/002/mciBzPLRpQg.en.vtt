 and all that this is like in all my projects that the audiences 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.659
 to the top of inestur and I make a small application 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.469
 how else this 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.729
 personalized month 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.729
 applications that I do 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:02.269
 and then here until he 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.839
 to the exact little one 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:05.810
 and so 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.259
 First 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.779
 percent 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.779
 When you leicester file 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.599
 does this window say the files together in the headquarters that are not 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.029
 private property ceiling of the gallery l l 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.609
 the congress I want to say yes 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.609
 you will calculate percent extract 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.399
 after 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.499
 I have found this but 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.499
 I am of character in fact responsible for 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.239
 what happens with my computer 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.399
 10 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.709
 certainly oceania is no longer his responsibility 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.399
 Castro and the file 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:45.420
 but I 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.650
 trust me god I downloaded it and nothing happens 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.709
 and so that they are not I have let them go peta 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.109
 two folders 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.219
 a deep crisis and the cessation customized 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.760
 does this mean the original the original file and this is the month cost 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:05.469
 but actually 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:09.699
 he is not going to do the bishops acro the default but the jealousy of jeter 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.410
 First 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.410
 come on let's go 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.999
 percent 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.999
 then we are going to transport 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.180
 being a bit slow because it is a virtual system and it has given half of it 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.349
 the Ramadan 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.430
 Alberto to 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.020
 that's why it's a little slow we love them alauÃ­ nov 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.289
 attend 32 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.180
 the folder attend 32 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.539
 then 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:47.430
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.360
 is that they have them in the search box we are going to look for the file 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:55.340
 wii elche point 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.870
 more or less 60 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.050
 the post as they take me we tell the file 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.629
 then 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.210
 for 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.180
 to be able to do this 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.639
 you can modify this 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.819
 let's think what we will assign permissions as administrator 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.669
 and then the first thing is 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.539
 in case you do not have to prevail I took it I'll leave it do not forget to put 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:21.800
 that 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 although that the vast majority use windows 7 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.419
 and then he left it on my blog 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.020
 read the letter and drive 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.969
 there are many tutorials that explain how 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.100
 the tareferos that is recontra simple two clicks 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.100
 Africa registered and ready 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.520
 after aletic with the sic it will look like a window of 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.490
 percent 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.659
 I must say that it comes to be the cmll configure all this 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.839
 from 21 5 and the lovely window but 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.450
 and it will disappear automatically
