hello anatomy students this is Rob's
watsky<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.929> we're<00:00:04.049> continuing<00:00:04.680> our<00:00:04.799> review

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
watsky and we're continuing our review

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.210 
watsky and we're continuing our review
of<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.790> appendicular<00:00:06.259> skeleton<00:00:07.259> beginning

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
of the appendicular skeleton beginning

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.950 
of the appendicular skeleton beginning
with<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.820> pelvic<00:00:09.330> girdle

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
with the pelvic girdle

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
with the pelvic girdle
now<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.710> pelvic<00:00:11.130> girdle<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.580> made<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:11.910> of

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
now the pelvic girdle is made up of

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.660 
now the pelvic girdle is made up of
several<00:00:12.360> bones<00:00:12.690> most<00:00:13.200> prominent<00:00:13.889> being<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
several bones most prominent being the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.740 
several bones most prominent being the
pair<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.299> coxal<00:00:16.049> bones<00:00:17.000> coxal<00:00:18.000> means<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.570> the

partially movable joint similar to the
sacroiliac<00:02:29.400> joint<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.120> made<00:02:30.300> up<00:02:30.420> a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
sacroiliac joint and made up a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.620 
sacroiliac joint and made up a
fibrocartilage<00:02:31.080> which<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.850> looked<00:02:33.120> at<00:02:33.360> as

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
fibrocartilage which we looked at as

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.680 
fibrocartilage which we looked at as
being<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:34.769> tissue<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.690> intervertebral

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
being the tissue of the intervertebral

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.610 
being the tissue of the intervertebral
discs<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.940> learned<00:02:39.150> about<00:02:39.269> in<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.810> axial

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
discs we learned about in the axial

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.530 
discs we learned about in the axial
skeleton<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.040> pubic<00:02:44.459> bones<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:45.269> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
skeleton so the pubic bones are the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.949 
skeleton so the pubic bones are the
anterior<00:02:46.260> bony<00:02:47.100> region<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.330> coxal<00:02:48.810> bone

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
anterior bony region of the coxal bone

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.550 
anterior bony region of the coxal bone
we<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.860> third<00:02:50.220> bony<00:02:50.640> region<00:02:51.209> which<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
we have a third bony region which is the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:03.370 
we have a third bony region which is the
seat<00:02:52.799> bone<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.100> called<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.910> ischium

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.860 

and<00:03:03.950> it's<00:03:04.190> easy<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.640> remember<00:03:05.210> just<00:03:05.420> see<00:03:05.660> the
