00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.960
 Hello 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.150
 here are five different locations than in 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.059
 reality is aurelio's magical study 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.730
 paved and I'm here to introduce you one 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.340
 new technique now that will make a 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.990
 favor that among other things the d'amico change 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:32.949
 or ghost change and marty soup 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:36.640
 fiorello today I'll show you from cuba 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:39.719
 location 7 the magical studio to have 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.729
 paid season was a technique 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.679
 interesting to use combined with 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:49.479
 player and friend of change 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.690
 basically we start from a double 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:56.289
 any outlet that leads us to have the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.859
 two cards for the senator lasts in 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:03.909
 outdoor vaccinated on protruding boulders 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.960
 from the short side that I hope now in the gesture 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:11.440
 to turn the double socket e 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.410
 apparently we change it 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.680
 let's download the card that you saw on 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:22.280
 March in this way I don't explain better 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.119
 showed him credits that I ride 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.189
 while I actually dumped spades 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.909
 13 that are blows we go the other 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.429
 cause 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.240
 let's see it for a moment in detail 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:37.280
 technician then double vaccinated so 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.079
 I said source 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.929
 now I explain to you my ring finger method 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:48.979
 but on the short external corner and the double 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.840
 of the double card obviously external 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.619
 left for me than on the left-handed 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.479
 different saints right sternum then 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:04.069
 the ring finger raises their thumb 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:06.860
 slips under the long side the better 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.549
 index foul on the long side 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.940
 then we rotate the card again 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:18.170
 doors at the top is the best index there 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.850
 allow to distort the two cards in 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:27.520
 this way then 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.520
 we are in this condition raise 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.790
 fan the two cards the thumb that 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.500
 holds the side and rests on the corner 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.540
 of the lower card e 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.850
 simultaneously from a snap the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.490
 schicchera at the cave of the card 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.730
 higher we need to cover the 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:55.180
 time and the handling of the exhibition does not 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:59.000
 will once again open double colotto 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.920
 exhaust straightens a card and then into 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.630
 based on the game or leave it on the table 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.710
 obviously they kill that then 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.040
 depends on the routine 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:12.260
 this was the friend of change as always 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.660
 to the technical advice for the correct 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.000
 execution of this technique but having 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.580
 up here world champion of micromagia 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.780
 I would pass you according to the ball is 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.940
 something to say that to help those there 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.340
 look at the correct execution of the match 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.200
 with friend but never written 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.980
 this move speaks more about this thing 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.569
 he leaves all months of retaining his friend 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.400
 teacher that true feeling but I am 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.209
 certain of the calculated on a book of 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.800
 machines and at this time it was worth 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.830
 linarol 33 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.280
 the basic idea is that between a double 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.160
 took a double card and indeed that 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.180
 normally there is a first movement 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.060
 allow to read the cause a 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.099
 provision to put on the table with 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.840
 this techniques open seconds and 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:06.299
 of the beginning yes yes yes yes so much movement 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.579
 and the impression one gets is that the paper 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.860
 never touch down and be put 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.079
 down to hold up the card is already 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.760
 xvi changed tougher future you see 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.040
 bad let's see a little look 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.019
 one so different from for example the 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.910
 seven of paintings sits that you could see today 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.990
 it seems that you do not touch the bottom is 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.700
 become the 20th monoreddito 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.889
 now sidewalls dedicating it for having 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.229
 drank this first thing like it 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.720
 makes the dowry selection comes with the idea of 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.000
 bend to fold the paper in this way 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.220
 among which the most inflexibility from the idea 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.639
 of the paper more soft syndrome 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.320
 but you see that upside down and moving it 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.160
 shift 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.380
 in front now in the right hand goes to 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.520
 take the grappa of the forefinger and 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:56.240
 here they pin in half and the ring finger yes 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.610
 notices on the support in this way the 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 card is stabilized so this takes 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.240
 this house is stabilized 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.310
 the middle invitation that is free between a 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.740
 corner and difficult padano I will have that 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.020
 because all dynamic in a moment 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.010
 when the cafe is called it pushes in 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.280
 this way 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:18.380
 here it was this point is the goat and 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.720
 they are of father you move into 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.580
 reality a card rotation 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.800
 coincide with this point if I will use the 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.950
 singer I had moment is that card 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.580
 of the system but with this vote you see 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.860
 that like the hood that was pushed aside 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.750
 goes to align perfectly with the 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.730
 deck so this essentially and 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.780
 what happens in detail in the 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.780
 very difficult to do it 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.980
 coach but obviously to this 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.570
 point at this time you have 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.410
 the impression having downloaded from 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:57.070
 card that you get the impression this is 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.420
 card has a configuration 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.490
 it is not far from the wedding 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.870
 aligned with ours if the impression that 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.030
 he never touched in March says 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.740
 this extraordinary economy of 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.350
 movements with which with a simple gesture 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.300
 say I have to go to the paper unload 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.010
 where then it is used or for a strange one 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.370
 transformation to enter a routine 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.680
 as we used to say in paper newspapers 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.530
 the local ferocity now remains to go 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.090
 to do a search to see if it is missing 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.710
 because there are techniques taken care of 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.310
 studies and there is more a meandering curtain 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.940
 collaborated to live it to reveal sometimes 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.380
 let's see how difficult it is to attribute 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.720
 precisely the authorship of a jury 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.389
 technique because there are influences 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.280
 very strong cultural and the East 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.960
 difficult to establish exactly 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.120
 but in short , we leave it as like 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.240
 no fans go to play from 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.699
 eros and corresponds more to the description 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.289
 of les combes and I support or friend 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:56.240
 as he claims he once closed 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:59.389
 saying wine was important not 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.039
 used to having him teach the 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.020
 unfortunately this case techniques 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:08.680
 exceptional for an old gift 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.680
 real thanks to the next
