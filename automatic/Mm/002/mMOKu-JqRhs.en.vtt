all the animals like you know if there

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.740 
all the animals like you know if there
was<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.149> then<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> would<00:00:36.630> be

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
was one right here then it would be

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720 
was one right here then it would be
really<00:00:36.930> cramped<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.620> getting<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.610> close

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
really cramped like getting really close

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.369 
really cramped like getting really close
to<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.059> cage<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.809> only<00:00:40.020> way<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> see

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
to this cage that's the only way to see

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.500 
to this cage that's the only way to see
the<00:00:40.500> villagers<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.210> thought<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the villagers and I just thought that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240 
the villagers and I just thought that
that<00:00:42.629> wouldn't<00:00:42.930> work<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.350> very<00:00:43.590> well<00:00:43.739> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that wouldn't work out very well I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.090 
that wouldn't work out very well I
should<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.239> build<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.350> cobblestone<00:00:46.890> wall

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
should go and build the cobblestone wall

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.650 
should go and build the cobblestone wall
first<00:00:48.170> okay<00:00:49.789> joshua<00:00:50.789> order<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.449> mind

an<00:02:40.459> hour<00:02:40.610> trying<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.420> do<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:41.900> let's<00:02:42.440> do

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
an hour trying to do this let's do

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.380 
an hour trying to do this let's do
something<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:44.980> okay<00:02:45.980> let's<00:02:46.910> just<00:02:47.150> take<00:02:47.799> some

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
something it okay let's just take some

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
something it okay let's just take some
random<00:02:50.390> colors<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:52.220> just<00:02:52.880> put<00:02:53.150> them<00:02:53.299> in<00:02:53.480> some

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.240 

and<00:02:58.030> make<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.660> totally<00:02:58.900> random<00:02:59.620> now<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.130> a

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
and make it totally random now this is a

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.620 
and make it totally random now this is a
real<00:03:00.460> world<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.150> comes<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.480> handy

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
real world that it comes in handy

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.450 
real world that it comes in handy
because<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.110> could<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:02.440> select<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.980> area

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
because I could just select this area

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.390 
because I could just select this area
that<00:03:04.240> I<00:03:04.270> need<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.960> then<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.650> could<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.160> say

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
that I need and then I could just say

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.870 
that I need and then I could just say
fill<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.000> with<00:03:07.150> these<00:03:07.450> rules<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.260> then<00:03:08.470> it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
fill it with these rules and then it

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.080 
fill it with these rules and then it
completely<00:03:09.880> randomizes<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:12.090> nothing's

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
completely randomizes it and nothing's

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.230 
completely randomizes it and nothing's
more<00:03:13.270> random<00:03:13.780> than<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:14.110> computer<00:03:14.470> okay<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.670> think

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240

words<00:05:20.130> candy<00:05:21.130> I<00:05:21.370> wasn't<00:05:21.970> it<00:05:22.150> interesting<00:05:22.630> how

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
words candy I wasn't it interesting how

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.830 
words candy I wasn't it interesting how
it's<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.230> floating<00:05:23.820> in<00:05:24.820> mid-air<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:25.600> then

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
it's just floating in mid-air and then

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.300 
it's just floating in mid-air and then
you<00:05:25.960> can<00:05:26.110> see<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.410> other<00:05:26.530> side<00:05:26.680> um<00:05:28.650> but<00:05:29.650> that's
