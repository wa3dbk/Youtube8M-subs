00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello to all guys sweeping i 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.879
 117 welcome to this new guide to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.799
 weapons on beats f4 this day we will see the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.410
 bulldog the weapon available with dragon 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.969
 tis or an assault rifle that I am 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.830
 create with this assignment what 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.389
 you will see more or less on the screen now 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.340
 real name of this weapon should be 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.810
 sr ss 7 6 2 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 not a little tongue twister from 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.199
 provincial tropea s however should 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.060
 be this here because anyway for 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.890
 inform me about the weapon point i noticed that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.210
 there was no weapon with the name bull 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.250
 more than anything else the doubt came to me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 why playing call of duty ghost 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.009
 yes I played at least once in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.690
 my life I saw that there was a gun there 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.250
 a pump called bulldog and not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.960
 it was not the same model then 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 for personal curiosity they are given 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 inform me i found out what is true 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 model name of this weapon then 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.480
 but sometimes interesting no not waiting 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.550
 other 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.660
 however let's focus on this weapon 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.969
 but precisely it is available thanks 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.680
 at the last 10 and the choice of the boy in 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.870
 I made my own little ones already 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.879
 personal opinions in the previous video 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.649
 believe in the other end of the video anyway 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 you will find it on the canal if you were there 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.460
 lost and what I think of this weapon that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.109
 simply broken course in the sense 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.910
 positive in the sense that it is too strong 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.100
 for those who really have values ​​and 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.510
 statistics that are extremely high 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.979
 first of all there is to say that if it looks like 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.930
 much with the exhaust to better say 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.400
 it is good to compare it now because 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.439
 however many of its many values 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.240
 his statistics are very similar 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.950
 first let's talk about the damage 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.320
 this weapon the bulldog will have damage 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 maximum at 34 per year 25 minutes then 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.299
 it will take three shots to kill 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.560
 8 meters after 50 or 55 meters 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.939
 honestly I do not know 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.470
 the statistics that came out are 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.450
 only partial so I can't tell you 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.369
 exactly even distance ends there 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 damage descent anyway will have going 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.210
 minimum of 25 will therefore only take 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.130
 four shots to kill identical to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.170
 ska lacquer unlike enzo though 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.479
 this weapon a red file higher a rpm 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 higher if 700 strokes per minute and it is 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.689
 a good thing basically because 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.180
 the 620 of the ska racca was really 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.250
 very low while 700 as it is 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.509
 however quite average low for a 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.280
 assault rifle however is a lot 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.960
 better makes the weapon already longer 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.340
 usable from this point of view 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.869
 as for the sun instead 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.219
 wall this time you will not only see a 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.659
 board let me explain better 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.460
 you will only see the drone mined on 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.049
 bulldog the one in the file left it out 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.700
 completely because in my opinion it was not 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.570
 of interest what you will see screen 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.130
 will be a comparison between the text 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.990
 1 of the port has left and that of 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.490
 bulldog on the right the thing you immediately 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.380
 it stands out to the eye is that the recoil 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.760
 practically the same vertical yes 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.170
 equals we are sincere 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.590
 in fact the discharge will have a recoil 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.050
 vertical 0.5 while the bulldog 0.55 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.610
 therefore slightly higher though a 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.630
 change to be different is that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.340
 horizontal 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.470
 in fact the bulldog will have a swing 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.060
 horizontal of 0.3 both to the right and to 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 left which is slightly higher 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.690
 of the ska racca who had a paltry 0.2 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.980
 both right and left 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.750
 to this text it emerges that the bulldog 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.550
 it will tend to be slightly more unstable 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.350
 of the skal h in fact horizontally 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.370
 it will fluctuate slightly more however it must 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.720
 being honest is very easy to 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.520
 check how recoil then not 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.870
 I think you will have problems for 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.340
 regarding the spread instead 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.750
 weapon accuracy the bulldog in the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.970
 targeted fire tends to be slightly 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.140
 more inaccurate than ska lacquer 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.790
 indeed over long distances 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.920
 often some shots will go totally 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.420
 to empty as regards instead the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.950
 lockout and accessories to use on 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.810
 I recommend this weapon as always 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.209
 a simple laser or reflex viewfinder 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.739
 is a laser pointer for under-the-counter because 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.330
 however they do not give so much malus 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.590
 it is worth putting ourselves as the last two accessories 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.150
 I simply recommend you 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.680
 an angled handle this because 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.360
 reduce that recoil multiplier 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.190
 arising from the first shot you shoot 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.320
 and mind you quite low like 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.420
 value 1.6 compared to many other weapons e 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.430
 low 1.6 some even exceed the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.600
 3 just to make the idea however anyway 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.280
 according to me this accessory from a 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.690
 good hand to keep the weapon stable on 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.190
 why I advise you on the rod 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.510
 not to put any accessory is that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.920
 I simply think they would be 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.900
 quite useless now I'll explain 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.700
 the reason the way I recommend you 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.100
 to use the weapon is in the spaces 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.140
 tight within 10 20 meters as best 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.790
 prefer to consider yourself tight spaces 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.190
 and to use the weapon as best as possible 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.750
 believe the fire focused files 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.700
 automatic to Africa as you believe 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.630
 really how better you are at that 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.459
 which gives you more confidence 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.299
 but while the distance increases vi 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.010
 I recommend going to shoot 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.690
 simply single gusts always and 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.579
 however in gusts two three gusts 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.019
 blows because doing so the weapon succeeds 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.880
 to remain the most stable and precise 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.959
 possible and for this reason vi 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.340
 I say don't put on an accessory 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.470
 because everyone has access to his carla 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.750
 fendi mouth compensator heavy barrel 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.370
 are all accessories that work on 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.870
 prolonged gusts on the two three shots 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.670
 do not have time to read the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.320
 their effect really so small that 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.190
 it is almost useless to put them with respect to the 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.720
 the bass they give you 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.100
 so for this reason I tell you 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.930
 to go smooth cane none 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.360
 accessory that the weapon remains exactly 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.959
 with basic statistics and will go more 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.760
 that good 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.590
 in the previous video and in the east 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.120
 but the second version of the LED 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.260
 I say we put ourselves at cannes and heavy 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.240
 to fire bursts for the simple 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.830
 reason why all the weapons as far as i am 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.360
 it's about shooting no more bursts 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.790
 precise because you simply shoot 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.410
 ends the nightmare the spread ends that is 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.170
 the spread will decide coil de crais 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.910
 returning to the middle axis e 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.650
 you can start shooting again but if with 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.990
 an ace you can also to dispare 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.610
 of 50 60 meters in automatic fire that 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.050
 for better or worse graz a heavy rod there 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.370
 you will also do to central with the bulldog not 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.320
 you will make it first because you have few 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.580
 shots will not last long though 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.410
 in your charger unless you 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.180
 think of spending 21 shots for one 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.100
 miserable who and secondly why 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.660
 however, the weapon is not perfect for 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.940
 regarding the values ​​of the 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.360
 precision of the recoil all that 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.010
 want 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.080
 so in my opinion it just isn't 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.820
 efficient I don't say that you can't 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.430
 kill someone with a heavy cane 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.020
 and the 50 60 meter automatic fire 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.060
 be clear you can do it very well 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.590
 but simply armed with little 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.700
 efficient in my opinion is really the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.290
 game is not worth the candle 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.120
 therefore for this reason vi 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.620
 I advise against putting on that they are heavy 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.450
 as I advise you not to put even one 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.040
 any other accessory on the barrel 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.730
 simply because they make it little 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.650
 efficient 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.300
 not for another summarizing the whole 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.830
 face that is an excellent weapon under many 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.210
 points of view first of all because if 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.710
 looks a lot like the scale I already have 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.260
 said how strong that weapon is 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.000
 I condemn high winds only 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.500
 shots in the magazine 21 with the story 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.660
 but he shouted more than the bullet 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.669
 slightly higher than 700 rpm than already 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.110
 makes it slightly better in my opinion 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.790
 from this point of view respect 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.950
 to the ska rackham of the comparison between 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.419
 these two weapons I will talk about in the future for 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.680
 as far as the world is concerned 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.600
 a weapon that I recommend to anyone 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.070
 because it remains very good and notes that yes 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.510
 learn to be able to rent your ass only 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.050
 it becomes an excellent mouth of fire from which
