00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.329 

Sanofi<00:00:00.810> as<00:00:00.900> well<00:00:01.079> it's<00:00:02.629> and<00:00:03.890> was<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.130> first

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
Sanofi as well it's and was it the first

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.160 
Sanofi as well it's and was it the first
time<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.730> many<00:00:05.850> years<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.240> we've<00:00:06.720> beaten<00:00:06.960> him

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
time in many years that we've beaten him

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.730 
time in many years that we've beaten him
so<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:08.069> think<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.550> was<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> big<00:00:09.389> step<00:00:09.660> for<00:00:09.840> us<00:00:09.900> and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
so I think it was a big step for us and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.200 
so I think it was a big step for us and
something<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.400> came<00:00:11.580> across<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.120> that

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
something that came across and that

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.419 
something that came across and that

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
Maxim is just so much last season was

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.939 
Maxim is just so much last season was
the<00:00:14.549> team<00:00:14.790> spirit<00:00:15.289> animals<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.770> that

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the team spirit animals but we see that

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.439 
the team spirit animals but we see that
from<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> outside<00:00:17.550> what's<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.330> be

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
from the outside what's it like to be

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.029 
from the outside what's it like to be
part<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.289> strong<00:00:19.680> liars

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039

forgiveness is without it at that a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.350 
forgiveness is without it at that a
major<00:00:42.000> part<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.600> how<00:00:43.050> strong<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.530> are<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.770> our

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
played the first half we want it at the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.180 
played the first half we want it at the
death<00:00:53.129> did<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> may<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.649> underestimate<00:00:55.649> how

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
death did we may be underestimate how

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.119 
death did we may be underestimate how
good<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.489> thought<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.000> were<00:00:57.800> no<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> don't

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
good we thought we can were no I don't

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.250 
good we thought we can were no I don't
think<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.430> i<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.820> think<00:01:00.090> full<00:01:00.870> credit<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
think so i just think full credit to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.030 
think so i just think full credit to
them<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.680> didn't<00:01:01.949> play<00:01:02.449> at<00:01:03.449> our<00:01:03.480> best<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.140> they

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
them we didn't play at our best and they

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.980 
them we didn't play at our best and they
play<00:01:05.339> probably<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> their<00:01:06.210> best<00:01:06.420> games<00:01:06.720> i

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
play probably one of their best games i

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.679 
play probably one of their best games i
think<00:01:07.229> her<00:01:07.760> adrenaline<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:09.119> always<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
think her adrenaline will always be a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630 
think her adrenaline will always be a
part<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.470> their<00:01:10.619> game<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.400> day<00:01:11.610> of

a<00:03:00.550> I<00:03:01.550> just<00:03:01.970> had<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> changing<00:03:02.630> generation<00:03:03.350> and

players<00:03:05.330> coming<00:03:05.570> through<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.070> positive

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
players coming through it is a positive

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.110 
players coming through it is a positive
but<00:03:08.480> maybe<00:03:09.550> in<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.730> middle<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.030> our

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120

qualification<00:03:12.020> is<00:03:12.170> not<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:12.830> positive<00:03:13.040> because

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
qualification is not so positive because

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.930

about what must be very disappointing

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.699 
about what must be very disappointing

good at being able to sort of just

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.120 
good at being able to sort of just
switch<00:03:38.750> off<00:03:38.959> one<00:03:39.320> thing<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.680> switching<00:03:40.040> to

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
switch off one thing and switching to

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.040 
switch off one thing and switching to
another<00:03:40.340> nah<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:41.000> think<00:03:41.090> I'm<00:03:41.420> very<00:03:41.600> easy<00:03:41.810> with

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
another nah I think I'm very easy with

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.979 
another nah I think I'm very easy with
that<00:03:42.080> because<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:44.150> been<00:03:44.630> like<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:44.930> for

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
that because it's been like this for

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.310 
that because it's been like this for
years<00:03:45.200> with<00:03:45.620> me<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:46.310> think<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.209> opposite<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.200> a

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
years with me I think the opposite is a

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.310
