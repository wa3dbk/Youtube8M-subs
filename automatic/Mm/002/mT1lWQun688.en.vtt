play the game as pixie a girl who climbs

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.490 
play the game as pixie a girl who climbs
buildings<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.270> evidently<00:01:39.689> impervious<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.399 
finds herself in the center of the earth
where<00:01:44.729> an<00:01:44.850> evil<00:01:45.060> group<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.720> creatures<00:01:45.990> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
where an evil group of creatures is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
where an evil group of creatures is
planning<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.920> conquer<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.460> surface

planning to conquer the surface

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.210 
planning to conquer the surface
obviously<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> pixie<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.649> stop<00:01:49.950> them

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
obviously it's up to pixie to stop them

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980 
obviously it's up to pixie to stop them
and<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.610> say<00:01:50.790> obviously<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> game

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and I say obviously because the game

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
and I say obviously because the game
feels<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> obvious<00:01:53.610> enough<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.090> warrant

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
feels this is obvious enough to warrant

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.760 
feels this is obvious enough to warrant
no<00:01:54.689> explanation

very nice graphics techniques the

too now the low point of the game's

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.610 
too now the low point of the game's
aesthetics<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.910> its<00:03:42.120> character<00:03:42.660> design<00:03:43.080> but

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
aesthetics is its character design but

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.380 
aesthetics is its character design but
otherwise<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.340> very<00:03:44.610> cool<00:03:44.849> looking<00:03:45.209> game

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390

just<00:03:46.349> too<00:03:46.500> bad<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.800> doesn't<00:03:46.890> play<00:03:47.310> quite<00:03:47.730> as

just too bad it doesn't play quite as

the suit you're moving in can make the

platforming especially difficult at
