00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
like that but they're difficult to be

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.290 
like that but they're difficult to be
there<00:02:25.650> because<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.100> their<00:02:26.370> size<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.640> chain<00:02:27.180> will

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
there because of their size a chain will

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.110 
there because of their size a chain will
fit<00:02:27.330> flew<00:02:27.780> through<00:02:28.110> one<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.709> block<00:02:29.370> gasps<00:02:29.940> its

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
fit flew through one and block gasps its

normal<00:02:30.570> spiders<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.140> pretty<00:02:31.770> much<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:32.160> about

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
normal spiders and pretty much all about

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.740 
normal spiders and pretty much all about
their<00:02:32.520> most<00:02:32.700> apartments<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.300> we're<00:02:33.450> fish<00:02:33.630> I

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
their most apartments so we're fish I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.740 
their most apartments so we're fish I
don't<00:02:33.900> think<00:02:34.110> could<00:02:34.230> actually<00:02:34.350> get<00:02:34.709> fruit<00:02:35.280> so

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
don't think could actually get fruit so

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.080 
don't think could actually get fruit so
yes<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.950> bit<00:02:38.220> bothersome<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.880> shy

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
yes I is a bit bothersome if you shy

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.210 
yes I is a bit bothersome if you shy
like<00:02:39.300> keep<00:02:39.900> yourself<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.470> somewhere<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
like keep yourself and somewhere and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.890 
like keep yourself and somewhere and
then<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.520> was<00:02:41.610> quickly<00:02:41.850> closed<00:02:42.300> for<00:02:42.690> and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
then it was quickly closed for and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.750 
then it was quickly closed for and
everything<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.530> yeah<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.459> showing<00:02:44.610> off

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
everything and yeah what is showing off

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.330 
everything and yeah what is showing off
a<00:02:44.880> bit<00:02:45.030> more<00:02:45.209> but<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.989> spawner<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:47.010> just

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
a bit more but the spawner here just

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.430 
a bit more but the spawner here just
don't<00:02:47.760> seem<00:02:48.090> always<00:02:48.330> spawn<00:02:48.570> them<00:02:48.750> now<00:02:48.900> then<00:02:49.320> I

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
don't seem always spawn them now then I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.290 
don't seem always spawn them now then I
think<00:02:49.680> it's<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.310> use<00:02:50.459> my<00:02:50.700> bow<00:02:51.270> and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
think it's a just to use my bow and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.600 
think it's a just to use my bow and
arrow<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.410> get<00:02:52.709> rid<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.890> their<00:02:53.280> last

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
arrow and to get rid of their last

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.080 
arrow and to get rid of their last
fighter<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.390> yeah<00:02:55.320> that's<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.880> we're

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
fighter and yeah that's that so we're

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.990

of and storm breaks I place these ones

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.210 
of and storm breaks I place these ones
manually<00:03:05.390> there<00:03:06.390> was<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.080> man<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.830> so
