the brushed metal steel itself now the
keypad<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.310> slightly<00:02:26.580> wider<00:02:27.330> than

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
keypad on this is slightly wider than

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
the previous model the bold 9000 and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.420 
the previous model the bold 9000 and
that's<00:02:30.810> due<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.170> rim<00:02:31.440> kind<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.860> shrinking<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that's due to rim kind of shrinking the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.890 
that's due to rim kind of shrinking the
bezels<00:02:33.050> with<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.040> looks<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.550> lot<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.870> only

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
bezels with so it looks a lot not only

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.720 
bezels with so it looks a lot not only
looks<00:02:37.290> better<00:02:37.800> but<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> lot<00:02:38.370> easier<00:02:38.400> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
looks better but it's a lot easier to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.330 
looks better but it's a lot easier to
type<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.300> again<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.200> has<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.410> touchscreen<00:02:40.740> on

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
type and again this has a touchscreen on

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.140 
type and again this has a touchscreen on
them<00:02:42.830> one<00:02:43.830> thing<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.280> lot<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.550> people<00:02:44.700> are
