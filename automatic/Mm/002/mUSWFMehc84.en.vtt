00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
so far it sounds really cool and a lot

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.310 
so far it sounds really cool and a lot
of<00:01:09.860> people<00:01:09.950> are<00:01:10.250> saying<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:11.300> know<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.630> sounds

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
of people are saying you know it sounds

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.810 
of people are saying you know it sounds
like<00:01:12.410> it<00:01:12.650> should<00:01:12.890> be<00:01:13.040> from<00:01:13.160> the<00:01:13.310> album<00:01:13.460> talk

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
like it should be from the album talk

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.370 
like it should be from the album talk
signal<00:01:14.330> but<00:01:14.510> i<00:01:14.540> don't<00:01:14.750> know<00:01:14.810> i<00:01:14.840> think<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.200> has<00:01:15.350> a

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
signal but i don't know i think it has a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.680 
signal but i don't know i think it has a
whole<00:01:15.740> entire<00:01:15.950> different<00:01:16.460> feel<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.600> i

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
whole entire different feel to it and i

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.230 
whole entire different feel to it and i
think<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.170> is<00:01:18.770> that<00:01:18.979> after<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.820> know<00:01:19.940> 10

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
think that is that after you know 10

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.670 
think that is that after you know 10
years<00:01:20.270> being<00:01:20.720> together<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.320> all<00:01:21.410> they<00:01:21.530> really

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
years being together and all they really

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.640 
years being together and all they really
deserve<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.940> chance<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.420> experimental<00:01:24.110> and

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
deserve the chance to experimental and

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.590 
deserve the chance to experimental and
not<00:01:24.770> be<00:01:24.890> hated<00:01:25.220> on<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.970> actually<00:01:26.120> realized

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
not be hated on and I actually realized

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600 
not be hated on and I actually realized
that<00:01:26.930> there's<00:01:27.110> like<00:01:27.290> no<00:01:27.770> major<00:01:28.130> comments<00:01:28.520> out

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
that there's like no major comments out

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.430 
that there's like no major comments out

but it does kind of sound like

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.870 
but it does kind of sound like
I<00:02:57.410> think<00:02:57.620> we've<00:02:57.740> heard<00:02:57.890> before<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.460> know<00:02:58.580> it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
I think we've heard before you know it

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.600 
I think we've heard before you know it

that type of music I think it's really
good<00:03:07.460> I<00:03:07.640> don't<00:03:07.850> think<00:03:07.880> it's<00:03:08.090> gonna<00:03:08.270> be<00:03:08.360> like<00:03:08.630> a

give that album which means pure
awesomeness<00:03:35.960> Mia<00:03:36.650> doesn't<00:03:36.950> matter<00:03:37.100> if<00:03:37.520> the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
awesomeness Mia doesn't matter if the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.150 
awesomeness Mia doesn't matter if the
album<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.330> like<00:03:38.480> another<00:03:38.780> one<00:03:39.080> or<00:03:39.350> two<00:03:39.920> to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
album is like another one or two to

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.250 
album is like another one or two to
another<00:03:40.460> one<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.940> just<00:03:41.150> matters<00:03:41.300> to<00:03:41.660> me<00:03:41.780> if<00:03:42.020> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
another one it just matters to me if the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.740 
another one it just matters to me if the
songs<00:03:42.470> are<00:03:42.860> good<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:44.240> far<00:03:44.480> from<00:03:44.630> what

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
songs are good and so far from what

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.330 
songs are good and so far from what
we've<00:03:44.900> heard<00:03:44.960> from<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.320> previews<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:46.070> think

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
we've heard from the previews I think

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.250 
we've heard from the previews I think
they<00:03:46.490> will<00:03:46.700> be<00:03:46.850> but<00:03:47.270> you<00:03:47.360> know<00:03:47.480> what<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.660> really

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
they will be but you know what I really

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.410 
they will be but you know what I really
think<00:03:48.440> about<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.800> I<00:03:49.250> think<00:03:49.850> this<00:03:49.910> album<00:03:50.330> is

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
think about it I think this album is

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.790 
think about it I think this album is
going<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.690> be<00:03:50.780> kind<00:03:50.960> of<00:03:51.080> like<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.260> mix<00:03:51.530> of<00:03:51.680> their

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
going to be kind of like a mix of their

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.220 
going to be kind of like a mix of their
two<00:03:51.980> styles<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:53.150> me<00:03:53.270> there<00:03:53.480> two<00:03:53.660> styles<00:03:54.050> are

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
two styles so to me there two styles are

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.190 
two styles so to me there two styles are
their<00:03:54.530> songs<00:03:54.740> like<00:03:54.980> shiver<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.960> regret<00:03:56.960> and

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
their songs like shiver and regret and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.500 
their songs like shiver and regret and
then<00:03:57.340> their<00:03:58.340> other<00:03:58.580> style<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.180> there<00:03:59.330> like

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
then their other style is there like

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.350 
then their other style is there like
more<00:03:59.720> darker<00:04:00.200> grittier<00:04:00.410> side<00:04:00.710> like<00:04:01.310> filth<00:04:02.150> in

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
more darker grittier side like filth in

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.840 
more darker grittier side like filth in
the<00:04:02.390> beauty<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:03.080> invisible<00:04:03.770> wall<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.610> I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
the beauty and invisible wall and I

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.920 
the beauty and invisible wall and I
think<00:04:05.030> it's<00:04:05.120> just<00:04:05.300> going<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.450> be<00:04:05.540> kind<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.810> like

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
think it's just going to be kind of like

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.510 
think it's just going to be kind of like
a<00:04:06.080> mix<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> two<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.130> know<00:04:07.250> we'll<00:04:07.490> see

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
a mix of the two and you know we'll see

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.000 
a mix of the two and you know we'll see
what<00:04:07.820> happens<00:04:08.200> but<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.380> know<00:04:09.470> what<00:04:09.710> i<00:04:09.740> have

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010
