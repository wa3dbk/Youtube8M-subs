00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
screen so there is some customization

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200 
screen so there is some customization
there<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.140> nothing<00:01:55.229> major<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.039 
look at some of the customization that
Samsung<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.460> built-in<00:01:59.880> when<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> pull<00:02:01.020> down

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the menu from the top as you can do

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.830 
the menu from the top as you can do
there<00:02:04.320> you'll<00:02:05.009> notice<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.759> has<00:02:05.840> your

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840

ability<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.380> turn<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.740> Wi-Fi<00:02:07.950> bluetooth<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
ability to turn on Wi-Fi bluetooth to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.790 
ability to turn on Wi-Fi bluetooth to
them<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.450> silent<00:02:09.750> mode<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.050> vibrate<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.560> well

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
them to silent mode and vibrate as well

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500 
them to silent mode and vibrate as well
so<00:02:11.129> that's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
so that's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.119 
so that's
some<00:02:12.659> of<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> customization<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.680> cameras

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
some of the customization the cameras

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
notice that the menu on it is quite

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.539 
notice that the menu on it is quite
different<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:19.799> you'd<00:02:19.980> expect<00:02:20.099> on<00:02:20.489> a

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
different to what you'd expect on a

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.660 
different to what you'd expect on a
normal<00:02:20.900> Android<00:02:21.900> device<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.530> certainly<00:02:23.310> there

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
normal Android device so certainly there

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.640 
normal Android device so certainly there
is<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.879> bit<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.209> customization<00:02:25.019> going<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:25.439> there

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
is a bit of customization going on there

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.289 
is a bit of customization going on there
no<00:02:26.069> doubt<00:02:26.280> there's<00:02:26.519> more<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.879> background

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
no doubt there's more in the background

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.330 
no doubt there's more in the background
that<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.510> haven't<00:02:27.720> got<00:02:27.959> two<00:02:28.140> years<00:02:28.500> one<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.280> the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.939 
the old windows mobile devices the
market<00:03:36.540> one<00:03:37.139> thing<00:03:37.319> you'll<00:03:37.440> notice<00:03:37.560> with<00:03:37.829> the

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
market one thing you'll notice with the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.390 
market one thing you'll notice with the
markets<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.549> here<00:03:38.790> well<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.329> works<00:03:39.569> fine<00:03:40.019> but

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
markets in here well it works fine but

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.099 
markets in here well it works fine but
because<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.489> its<00:03:41.609> kew<00:03:41.849> vga<00:03:42.180> resolution<00:03:42.269> it

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
because of its kew vga resolution it

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.680 
because of its kew vga resolution it
only<00:03:43.319> picks<00:03:43.709> up<00:03:43.980> those<00:03:44.280> applications<00:03:45.209> that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
only picks up those applications that

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.050 
only picks up those applications that
will<00:03:45.810> work<00:03:45.989> with<00:03:46.199> q<00:03:46.440> vga<00:03:46.799> resolution<00:03:46.889> so<00:03:47.819> if

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
will work with q vga resolution so if

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.159 
will work with q vga resolution so if
you're<00:03:48.180> missing<00:03:48.449> some<00:03:48.599> apps<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.989> there<00:03:49.079> you

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
you're missing some apps and there you

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.289 
you're missing some apps and there you
think<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.440> wasn't<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:50.099> there<00:03:50.310> that'll<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.150> why

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
think I wasn't that there that'll be why

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.490 
think I wasn't that there that'll be why
because<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:51.720> resolution<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.379> screen

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
because the resolution of the screen

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.520 
because the resolution of the screen
just<00:03:53.099> can't<00:03:53.549> handle<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.269> or<00:03:54.629> of<00:03:55.079> course<00:03:55.169> this

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
just can't handle it or of course this

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.830 
just can't handle it or of course this
is<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.680> 2.1<00:03:56.310> device<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.329> application

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
video recording I've got to say as well

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.260 
video recording I've got to say as well
it<00:04:58.140> is<00:04:58.200> customized<00:04:58.920> you<00:04:59.490> will<00:04:59.610> notice<00:04:59.820> so

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
it is customized you will notice so

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.480 
it is customized you will notice so
that's<00:05:00.960> not<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.320> normal<00:05:01.770> sort<00:05:01.980> of<00:05:02.070> camera

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
that's not the normal sort of camera

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.170 
that's not the normal sort of camera
screen<00:05:02.940> that<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.120> see<00:05:03.210> on<00:05:03.600> an<00:05:03.990> Android<00:05:04.440> device

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
screen that you see on an Android device

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.780 
screen that you see on an Android device
but<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.330> can<00:05:06.480> turn<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.780> from<00:05:06.900> camera<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.790> into

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
but you can turn it from camera and into

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.840 
but you can turn it from camera and into
video<00:05:09.270> mode<00:05:09.630> so<00:05:09.960> works<00:05:10.860> perfectly<00:05:11.340> well<00:05:11.550> but

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
video mode so works perfectly well but

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.460 
video mode so works perfectly well but
just<00:05:12.060> not<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.330> great<00:05:12.570> camera<00:05:13.020> we've<00:05:13.290> certainly

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
just not a great camera we've certainly

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.040 
just not a great camera we've certainly
seen<00:05:13.620> better<00:05:14.040> cameras<00:05:14.820> even<00:05:15.030> on<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.510> budget

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
seen better cameras even on the budget

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.620 
seen better cameras even on the budget
devices<00:05:16.620> so<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.130> bit<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.430> letdown<00:05:17.630> it

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
devices so that is a bit of a letdown it
