00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
more of a comedy thriller rather than

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.990 
more of a comedy thriller rather than

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
next in the film you know rather than

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.149 
next in the film you know rather than
just<00:01:03.420> looking<00:01:03.750> forward<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> next<00:01:04.350> joke<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
just looking forward to the next joke I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.380 
just looking forward to the next joke I
think<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> jokes<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.229> aplenty<00:01:07.229> but

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
think the jokes are there aplenty but

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
think the jokes are there aplenty but
but<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.570> were<00:01:09.750> keen<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.500> hoping<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.310> an

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
but we were keen so I'm hoping that's an

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.359 
but we were keen so I'm hoping that's an
aspect<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> which<00:01:12.240> which<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.530> distinguishes

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
aspect of it which which I distinguishes

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.710 
aspect of it which which I distinguishes
it<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> first<00:01:14.939> film<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> also<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.600> think

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it from the first film and also I think

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.399 
it from the first film and also I think
there's<00:01:16.049> quite<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> bit<00:01:17.310> more<00:01:17.340> action<00:01:18.380> quite<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
there's quite a bit more action quite a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.230 
there's quite a bit more action quite a
bit<00:01:19.560> more<00:01:19.680> action<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.580> glamorous

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
bit more action and more glamorous

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
bit more action and more glamorous
locations<00:01:21.750> which<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> why<00:01:22.409> we've<00:01:23.130> been<00:01:23.369> in
