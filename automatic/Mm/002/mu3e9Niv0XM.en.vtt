00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
again since he's a Megatron pretty cool

is<00:01:50.500> incredibly<00:01:51.190> easy<00:01:51.280> transformation<00:01:52.000> what

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
is incredibly easy transformation what

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.950 
is incredibly easy transformation what
you<00:01:52.570> do<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:52.900> lift<00:01:53.050> up<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.380> wings<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:56.350> you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you do is you lift up the wings then you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.570 
you do is you lift up the wings then you
want<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.020> turn<00:01:59.229> them<00:01:59.410> around<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.890> like<00:02:00.160> that

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580

whatever<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:12.640> he<00:03:12.700> comes<00:03:13.000> with<00:03:13.239> his<00:03:14.790> four<00:03:15.790> arm

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000

cannon<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:17.739> adds<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.100> little<00:03:18.310> weight<00:03:18.519> to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
whichever side you put it on so

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.710 
whichever side you put it on so
it's<00:03:24.460> a<00:03:24.670> little<00:03:25.150> big<00:03:25.330> but<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:26.440> know<00:03:26.560> it's

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
it's a little big but you know it's

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.670 
it's a little big but you know it's
actually<00:03:28.720> it's<00:03:29.110> it's<00:03:29.500> ridiculously<00:03:30.250> big<00:03:31.680> yeah

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
actually it's it's ridiculously big yeah

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.930 
actually it's it's ridiculously big yeah
they<00:03:33.010> could<00:03:33.190> have<00:03:33.280> done<00:03:33.400> without<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.790> whole

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
they could have done without the whole

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
they could have done without the whole
tank<00:03:34.270> thing<00:03:41.280> its<00:03:42.280> articulation<00:03:45.780> ladies<00:03:46.780> and

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
tank thing its articulation ladies and

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.470 
tank thing its articulation ladies and
go<00:03:47.050> forward<00:03:47.380> like<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.800> can't<00:03:48.520> go<00:03:48.670> back<00:03:48.910> but

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
go forward like that can't go back but

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.230 
go forward like that can't go back but
they<00:03:49.660> can<00:03:50.220> bend<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.430> knee<00:03:53.430> very<00:03:54.430> tight<00:03:54.760> joints

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
they can bend the knee very tight joints

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.500 
they can bend the knee very tight joints
here<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:56.080> can<00:03:56.290> go<00:03:56.470> out<00:03:58.140> like<00:03:59.140> that<00:03:59.470> his<00:04:00.510> bones

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
here you can go out like that his bones

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:15.420 
here you can go out like that his bones
can<00:04:02.170> go<00:04:02.350> all<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:02.740> way<00:04:02.920> around<00:04:04.350> almost<00:04:14.340> turn<00:04:15.340> at

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
can go all the way around almost turn at

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.430 
can go all the way around almost turn at
the<00:04:15.550> elbow<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:17.459> his<00:04:18.459> head<00:04:22.050> go<00:04:23.050> all<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.410> way

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
the elbow and his head go all the way

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.090 
the elbow and his head go all the way
around

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
around

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.610 
around
I<00:04:24.540> believe<00:04:25.540> that's<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.930> there's<00:04:26.170> no<00:04:28.620> there's

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
I believe that's it there's no there's

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.800 
I believe that's it there's no there's
no<00:04:29.680> hip<00:04:30.280> articulation<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.240> waist<00:04:31.540> or

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
no hip articulation and waist or

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.780 
no hip articulation and waist or
whatever<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.200> know<00:04:34.620> but<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.830> essentially<00:04:36.400> is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
whatever I know but that essentially is

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.600 
whatever I know but that essentially is
Energon<00:04:37.770> Megatron<00:04:38.770> he's<00:04:41.130> pretty<00:04:42.130> simple<00:04:42.490> you

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
Energon Megatron he's pretty simple you

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.000 
Energon Megatron he's pretty simple you
just<00:04:42.640> see<00:04:42.880> on<00:04:42.970> his<00:04:43.030> chest<00:04:44.040> Decepticon<00:04:45.040> symbol

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
just see on his chest Decepticon symbol

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.140 
just see on his chest Decepticon symbol
that<00:04:48.010> first<00:04:48.280> when<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.550> look<00:04:48.640> at<00:04:48.910> him<00:04:49.030> he

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
that first when you look at him he

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.240 
that first when you look at him he
reminds<00:04:49.600> or<00:04:50.140> when<00:04:50.380> I<00:04:50.470> look<00:04:50.680> at<00:04:50.860> him

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
reminds or when I look at him

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.830 
reminds or when I look at him
it<00:04:51.430> reminds<00:04:51.730> me<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:51.940> Galvatron<00:04:52.600> g1<00:04:53.020> Galvatron

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
it reminds me of Galvatron g1 Galvatron

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.760 
it reminds me of Galvatron g1 Galvatron
but<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.110> think<00:04:56.380> they<00:04:56.470> did<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:56.680> repaint<00:04:57.460> of

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
but and I think they did a repaint of

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.909 
but and I think they did a repaint of
this<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:00.040> turned<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.310> into<00:05:00.340> g1<00:05:01.240> Galvatron

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
this and turned it into g1 Galvatron

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.909 
this and turned it into g1 Galvatron
some<00:05:02.919> fan<00:05:03.190> did<00:05:03.400> I<00:05:03.490> believe<00:05:03.790> I'm<00:05:03.910> not<00:05:04.060> sure<00:05:05.760> but

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
some fan did I believe I'm not sure but
