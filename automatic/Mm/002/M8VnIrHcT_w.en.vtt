that's<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.390> case<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.720> all<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.929> know

perhaps an alternative you know much

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.940 
perhaps an alternative you know much
like<00:00:36.270> Huawei<00:00:36.630> perhaps<00:00:36.899> an<00:00:37.020> alternative<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.649> LG

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
