when<00:00:01.290> our<00:00:01.439> engine<00:00:01.680> becomes<00:00:01.979> inoperable<00:00:02.250> the

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
when our engine becomes inoperable the

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.160 
when our engine becomes inoperable the
first<00:00:02.970> thing<00:00:03.149> we<00:00:03.270> need<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.449> do<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.959> jettison

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
first thing we need to do is to jettison

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.000 
first thing we need to do is to jettison
all<00:00:04.589> extra<00:00:05.009> munitions<00:00:09.650> after<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.769> have<00:00:10.860> done

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
all extra munitions after we have done

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.650 
all extra munitions after we have done
that<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.849> worry<00:00:12.030> about<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> altitude

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
that we have to worry about the altitude

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.629 
that we have to worry about the altitude
we<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.320> whether<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.650> need<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.950> run<00:00:14.250> away

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
we have and whether we need to run away

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.480 
we have and whether we need to run away
we<00:00:15.210> are<00:00:15.389> 1.1<00:00:15.960> knots<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.379> then<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:16.890> 7,000

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
we are 1.1 knots out then we have 7,000

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.670 
we are 1.1 knots out then we have 7,000
feet<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.970> only<00:00:18.090> need<00:00:18.330> about<00:00:18.359> 5,000<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.500> we're

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
feet we only need about 5,000 so we're

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.500 
feet we only need about 5,000 so we're
good<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.949> go

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
good to go

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.359 
good to go
next<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.930> make<00:00:22.470> sure<00:00:22.680> our<00:00:22.920> flight

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
next we have to make sure our flight

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.660 
next we have to make sure our flight
path<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.880> between<00:00:24.359> 9<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> 11<00:00:24.869> degrees<00:00:25.369> we<00:00:26.369> do

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
path is between 9 and 11 degrees we do

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.150 
path is between 9 and 11 degrees we do
this<00:00:26.820> by<00:00:27.150> letting<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.960> 10<00:00:28.380> degree<00:00:28.619> pitch<00:00:28.890> mark

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
this by letting the 10 degree pitch mark

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.529 
this by letting the 10 degree pitch mark
and<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.369> head<00:00:29.519> line<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.210> start<00:00:30.420> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the bottom left the angle of attack is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
the bottom left the angle of attack is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
aircraft is traveling vertically so we

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.960 
aircraft is traveling vertically so we

can see the actual angle of attack by

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.460 
can see the actual angle of attack by
charging<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> difference<00:01:21.900> between<00:01:22.290> the
