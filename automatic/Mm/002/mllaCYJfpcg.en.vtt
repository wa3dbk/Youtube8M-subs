preparation and the finish and exactly
what<00:00:14.920> happens<00:00:15.340> so<00:00:15.760> it's<00:00:16.000> a<00:00:16.090> rec<00:00:16.270> level<00:00:16.660> a<00:00:16.840> lot

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
what happens so it's a rec level a lot

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.749 
what happens so it's a rec level a lot
of<00:00:17.259> people<00:00:17.800> struggle<00:00:18.160> with<00:00:18.189> the<00:00:18.340> backhand

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759 
of people struggle with the backhand

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.580 
of people struggle with the backhand
volley<00:00:18.849> whether<00:00:19.660> it<00:00:19.810> they<00:00:20.200> don't<00:00:20.320> have<00:00:20.500> the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
volley whether it they don't have the

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.200 
volley whether it they don't have the
proper<00:00:20.950> grip<00:00:21.130> to<00:00:21.279> begin<00:00:21.579> with<00:00:21.759> which<00:00:21.970> is<00:00:22.000> the

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
proper grip to begin with which is the

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.510 
proper grip to begin with which is the
Continental<00:00:22.720> but<00:00:23.200> what<00:00:23.439> I<00:00:23.470> find<00:00:23.860> more<00:00:24.040> often

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
Continental but what I find more often

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.429 
Continental but what I find more often
is<00:00:24.730> they<00:00:24.939> make<00:00:25.149> the<00:00:25.300> mistake<00:00:25.689> in<00:00:25.869> how<00:00:26.290> they

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
is they make the mistake in how they

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.859 
is they make the mistake in how they
prepare<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:27.430> racket<00:00:27.849> seem<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.180> go<00:00:28.329> back<00:00:28.599> and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
prepare the racket seem to go back and

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.889 
prepare the racket seem to go back and
through<00:00:29.590> so<00:00:30.130> it's<00:00:30.309> kind<00:00:30.489> of<00:00:30.579> changing<00:00:31.180> if<00:00:31.660> this

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:31.899 
through so it's kind of changing if this

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.420 
through so it's kind of changing if this
was<00:00:32.079> an<00:00:32.200> arrow<00:00:32.380> would<00:00:32.619> be<00:00:32.770> up<00:00:32.950> and<00:00:33.190> then<00:00:33.309> it's

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
was an arrow would be up and then it's

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.970 
was an arrow would be up and then it's
down<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:33.940> it's<00:00:34.390> not<00:00:34.600> really<00:00:35.079> consistently

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
down and it's not really consistently

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.369 
down and it's not really consistently
like<00:00:36.250> this<00:00:36.519> another<00:00:37.239> unique<00:00:37.660> thing<00:00:37.719> is<00:00:38.109> I've

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
like this another unique thing is I've

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.080 
like this another unique thing is I've
always<00:00:38.620> been<00:00:38.949> telling<00:00:39.370> people<00:00:39.670> that<00:00:39.850> the

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
always been telling people that the

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.819 
always been telling people that the
proper<00:00:40.510> preparation<00:00:40.870> for<00:00:41.289> a<00:00:41.350> backhand<00:00:41.800> volley

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
proper preparation for a backhand volley

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.060 
proper preparation for a backhand volley
is<00:00:42.250> towards<00:00:43.120> your<00:00:43.300> left<00:00:43.510> ear<00:00:43.870> so<00:00:44.079> it's<00:00:44.620> towards

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
is towards your left ear so it's towards

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.829 
is towards your left ear so it's towards
this<00:00:45.339> ear<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:45.789> kind<00:00:45.969> of<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.179> goes<00:00:46.449> up<00:00:46.660> and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
this ear you kind of it goes up and

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.650 
this ear you kind of it goes up and
tucks<00:00:47.379> in<00:00:47.679> so<00:00:48.370> that<00:00:48.609> is<00:00:48.789> important<00:00:49.239> because<00:00:49.359> if

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
tucks in so that is important because if

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.650 
tucks in so that is important because if
you<00:00:49.780> go<00:00:49.989> just<00:00:50.260> back<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.190> flops<00:00:51.519> over<00:00:51.850> this<00:00:52.480> is

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
you go just back and flops over this is

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.209 
you go just back and flops over this is
going<00:00:52.839> to<00:00:52.899> require<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.230> lot<00:00:53.469> of<00:00:53.620> timing<00:00:54.070> and

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
going to require a lot of timing and

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.189 
going to require a lot of timing and
you're<00:00:54.699> probably<00:00:54.879> going<00:00:55.059> to<00:00:55.120> be<00:00:55.269> off<00:00:55.659> along

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
you're probably going to be off along

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.139 
you're probably going to be off along
the<00:00:56.260> way<00:00:56.530> so<00:00:57.159> this<00:00:57.309> would<00:00:57.460> be<00:00:57.579> bad<00:00:57.730> this<00:00:57.999> would

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
the way so this would be bad this would

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.599 
the way so this would be bad this would
be<00:00:58.239> bad<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:58.690> bad<00:00:59.050> man<00:00:59.589> that<00:00:59.890> may<00:00:59.980> be<00:01:00.039> perfect

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
be bad this bad man that may be perfect

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.849 
be bad this bad man that may be perfect
and<00:01:00.820> then<00:01:00.969> bad<00:01:01.179> bad<00:01:01.359> bad<00:01:01.539> bad<00:01:01.719> okay<00:01:02.499> so<00:01:02.559> that's

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
and then bad bad bad bad okay so that's

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.200 
and then bad bad bad bad okay so that's
one<00:01:03.010> thing<00:01:03.100> we're<00:01:03.249> going<00:01:03.339> to<00:01:03.399> look<00:01:03.550> at<00:01:03.760> you're

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
one thing we're going to look at you're

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.760 
one thing we're going to look at you're
also<00:01:04.330> going<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.629> see<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:04.839> with<00:01:05.140> Roger<00:01:05.440> the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
also going to see that with Roger the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.010 
also going to see that with Roger the
finish<00:01:06.100> is<00:01:06.220> very<00:01:06.460> definite<00:01:07.030> it's<00:01:07.450> here<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:07.899> it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
finish is very definite it's here and it

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.929 
finish is very definite it's here and it
doesn't<00:01:08.170> go<00:01:08.409> wrapping<00:01:08.829> around<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.790> other

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
doesn't go wrapping around the other

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.109 
doesn't go wrapping around the other
cool<00:01:10.210> thing<00:01:10.479> is<00:01:10.659> that<00:01:10.840> depending<00:01:11.020> on<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:12.369> the

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
cool thing is that depending on the the

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.789 
cool thing is that depending on the the
power<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.570> he<00:01:13.689> wants<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:13.990> impart<00:01:14.409> on<00:01:14.680> the

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
power that he wants to impart on the

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.069 
power that he wants to impart on the
ball<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.189> might<00:01:15.700> be<00:01:15.850> simply<00:01:16.360> here<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.869> there

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
ball it might be simply here and there

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.959 
ball it might be simply here and there
or<00:01:17.290> if<00:01:17.710> he<00:01:17.799> has<00:01:17.950> more<00:01:18.159> time<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.610> he<00:01:18.670> wants<00:01:18.880> to

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
or if he has more time and he wants to

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.130 
or if he has more time and he wants to
do<00:01:19.090> more<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.299> a<00:01:19.450> snap<00:01:19.719> volley

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
do more of a snap volley

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.050 
do more of a snap volley
he'll<00:01:20.530> tuck<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.890> even<00:01:21.130> further<00:01:21.340> almost<00:01:21.790> behind

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
he'll tuck it even further almost behind

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.789 
he'll tuck it even further almost behind
his<00:01:22.270> head<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:22.990> we're<00:01:23.110> going<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.290> look<00:01:23.380> at<00:01:23.469> three

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799

preparation<00:01:36.280> where<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.579> goes<00:01:36.729> towards<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
preparation where it goes towards the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.319 
preparation where it goes towards the
ear<00:01:37.689> is<00:01:38.310> important<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.369> think<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:39.729> lot<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:39.939> people

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
ear is important I think a lot of people

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.149 
ear is important I think a lot of people
do<00:01:40.630> not<00:01:40.750> understand<00:01:41.350> especially<00:01:41.590> right

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
do not understand especially right

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.249 
do not understand especially right
players<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.789> juniors<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.630> technique<00:01:44.020> that

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
players and juniors the technique that

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.649 
players and juniors the technique that
happens<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.369> backhand<00:01:45.789> volley<00:01:45.909> takeaway

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
happens on the backhand volley takeaway

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.200 
happens on the backhand volley takeaway
so<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.469> notice<00:01:47.859> he<00:01:48.100> he<00:01:48.520> starts<00:01:48.909> with<00:01:49.030> his

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
so you notice he he starts with his

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.249 
so you notice he he starts with his
racket<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.149> left<00:01:52.450> hand<00:01:52.600> cradling<00:01:53.140> the

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
racket with the left hand cradling the

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.840 
racket with the left hand cradling the
racket<00:01:53.590> up<00:01:53.710> there<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> lot<00:01:54.189> of<00:01:54.310> juniors<00:01:54.640> have

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
racket up there a lot of juniors have

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.510 
racket up there a lot of juniors have
you<00:01:55.270> know<00:01:55.390> half<00:01:55.570> way<00:01:55.810> down<00:01:55.990> there<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.369> that's

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
you know half way down there so that's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.010 
you know half way down there so that's
one<00:01:57.729> thing<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:57.939> ensure<00:01:58.450> he<00:01:58.630> keeps<00:01:58.899> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
one thing that ensure he keeps the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.779 
one thing that ensure he keeps the
racket<00:01:59.380> tip<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.770> but<00:02:00.369> if<00:02:00.460> we<00:02:00.549> keep<00:02:00.729> going

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
racket tip up but if we keep going

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.940 
racket tip up but if we keep going
forward<00:02:01.329> you<00:02:01.719> notice<00:02:02.049> that<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.289> goes<00:02:02.380> up<00:02:02.679> and

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
forward you notice that it goes up and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.130 
forward you notice that it goes up and
towards<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:04.000> ear<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.479> can<00:02:04.630> see<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.929> real

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
towards the ear you can see it real

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.929 
towards the ear you can see it real
clearly<00:02:05.439> tucking<00:02:05.979> in<00:02:06.130> kind<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.579> behind<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
right here in the shoulder it's not

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.650 
right here in the shoulder it's not
behind<00:02:14.110> him<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:15.090> racket<00:02:16.090> pretty<00:02:16.300> much<00:02:16.450> stays

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
behind him the racket pretty much stays

behind him the racket pretty much stays
in<00:02:16.810> front<00:02:17.050> it's<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.379> quite<00:02:17.680> like<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> ground

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
in front it's not quite like a ground

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.890 
in front it's not quite like a ground
stroke<00:02:18.400> would<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.730> was<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> lot<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.690> rotation

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
stroke would be was a lot of rotation

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.740 
stroke would be was a lot of rotation
you<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:21.010> see<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.610> his<00:02:21.819> shoulders<00:02:22.420> are

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
you can see that his shoulders are

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.600

so we're going to keep watching this

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.220 
so we're going to keep watching this
here<00:02:29.050> comes<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:31.090> point<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.599> contact<00:02:32.050> you'll

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
here comes the point of contact you'll

he's leading with this bottom edge if

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.589 
he's leading with this bottom edge if
you<00:02:39.010> want<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.280> think<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.790> way<00:02:40.000> he's

leading with this edge he's going to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.589 
leading with this edge he's going to
make<00:02:43.569> contact<00:02:44.260> he<00:02:45.099> still<00:02:45.459> has<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.180> edge<00:02:46.420> in

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.319 
make contact he still has this edge in
front<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.380> when<00:02:47.620> he's<00:02:47.739> done<00:02:48.010> he<00:02:48.790> still<00:02:48.849> has

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
front and when he's done he still has

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.330 
front and when he's done he still has
that<00:02:49.569> edge<00:02:49.750> up<00:02:49.930> front<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.380> can<00:02:50.560> see<00:02:50.769> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
that edge up front you can see the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.130 
that edge up front you can see the
finish<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.910> right<00:02:52.180> there<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.599> doesn't<00:02:52.750> go<00:02:52.959> any

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
finish is right there it doesn't go any

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.550 
finish is right there it doesn't go any
further

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
further

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.460 
further
he<00:02:53.950> doesn't<00:02:54.370> wrap<00:02:54.700> around<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.360> body<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:55.930> did

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
he doesn't wrap around the body I did

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.289 
he doesn't wrap around the body I did
this<00:02:56.620> on<00:02:56.739> another<00:02:56.950> video<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.790> lot<00:02:58.269> of

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
this on another video but a lot of

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.479 
this on another video but a lot of
juniors<00:02:58.690> will<00:02:58.840> finish<00:02:59.019> over<00:02:59.380> there<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.160> let's

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
juniors will finish over there so let's

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.979 
juniors will finish over there so let's
get<00:03:00.610> rid<00:03:00.819> of<00:03:00.849> these<00:03:01.030> marks<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.510> watch<00:03:01.720> one

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
get rid of these marks and watch one

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.500 
get rid of these marks and watch one
more<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.500> slow<00:03:02.799> motion<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.489> this<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.329> he

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
more in slow motion and this one he

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.120 
more in slow motion and this one he
actually<00:03:04.900> has<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.079> little<00:03:05.349> more<00:03:05.440> time<00:03:05.739> so<00:03:05.980> it's

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
actually has a little more time so it's

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.190 
actually has a little more time so it's
wind<00:03:06.430> up<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.940> little<00:03:07.269> bigger<00:03:07.480> which<00:03:08.170> means

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
wind up is a little bigger which means

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.250 
wind up is a little bigger which means
it<00:03:08.590> goes<00:03:08.769> more<00:03:09.099> behind<00:03:09.579> his<00:03:09.730> head<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.599> I'm

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
it goes more behind his head so I'm

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.690 
it goes more behind his head so I'm
going<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.500> pause<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.889> here<00:03:11.920> toward<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.400> ear

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
going to pause it here toward the ear

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.129 
going to pause it here toward the ear
and<00:03:12.880> now<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.120> talks<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.420> do<00:03:13.510> more<00:03:13.720> behind<00:03:14.019> the

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
and now it talks to do more behind the

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.039 
and now it talks to do more behind the
head<00:03:14.489> compared<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.700> previous<00:03:16.120> ones<00:03:16.359> but

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
head compared to the previous ones but

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.890 
head compared to the previous ones but
the<00:03:17.170> point<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.859> not<00:03:18.069> going<00:03:18.670> back<00:03:18.970> is

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
the point is it's not going back is

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.920 
the point is it's not going back is
going<00:03:20.350> kind<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.739> up<00:03:20.920> behind<00:03:21.639> them<00:03:21.880> but<00:03:22.690> the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
going kind of up behind them but the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.020 
going kind of up behind them but the
racket<00:03:23.410> face<00:03:23.739> stays<00:03:24.190> pretty<00:03:24.609> much<00:03:24.700> it's<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
racket face stays pretty much it's the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.780 
racket face stays pretty much it's the
same<00:03:25.299> angle<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.440> entire<00:03:26.799> time<00:03:27.160> until<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
same angle the entire time until the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.150 
same angle the entire time until the
next<00:03:28.000> contact<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:29.350> most<00:03:29.500> cases<00:03:29.709> even

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
next contact and in most cases even

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.430 
next contact and in most cases even
before<00:03:30.310> all<00:03:30.730> right<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:31.540> that's<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.019> proper

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
before all right so that's the proper

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.730 
before all right so that's the proper
take<00:03:32.650> away<00:03:32.920> on<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.220> backhand
