going in and not too long just a few

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.639 
going in and not too long just a few
minutes<00:00:05.250> um<00:00:06.029> know<00:00:06.750> if<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.020> can<00:00:07.140> see<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.440> but

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
minutes um know if you can see that but

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.490 
minutes um know if you can see that but
there<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.859> little<00:00:08.130> bit<00:00:08.280> of<00:00:08.429> smoke<00:00:09.500> coming

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
there is a little bit of smoke coming

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.950 
there is a little bit of smoke coming
out<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.800> chimney<00:00:11.540> it's<00:00:12.540> probably<00:00:12.840> gonna

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
out of the chimney it's probably gonna

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.419 
out of the chimney it's probably gonna
go<00:00:13.139> away<00:00:13.259> once<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.679> heats<00:00:13.860> up<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.130> little<00:00:14.309> bit

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
go away once it heats up a little bit

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.210 
go away once it heats up a little bit
more<00:00:15.139> now<00:00:16.139> let's<00:00:16.440> take<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> look<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.130> at

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
more now let's take a look in here at

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:27.050 
more now let's take a look in here at
the<00:00:17.310> second<00:00:17.699> date<00:00:17.820> burn<00:00:18.090> see<00:00:18.990> how<00:00:25.760> you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.910> see

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the second date burn see how you can see

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269 
the second date burn see how you can see
that<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> camera<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.279> definitely

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
that in the camera but it's definitely

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.270 
that in the camera but it's definitely
going

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.280 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.500 

there<00:00:33.280> is<00:00:33.400> some<00:00:33.580> smoke<00:00:33.940> I<00:00:34.150> think<00:00:34.360> that's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
there is some smoke I think that's

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.860 
there is some smoke I think that's
happened<00:00:34.870> well<00:00:35.410> yeah<00:00:35.620> this<00:00:35.770> did<00:00:35.980> happen<00:00:36.370> last

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
happened well yeah this did happen last

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.729 
happened well yeah this did happen last
time<00:00:38.970> basically<00:00:39.970> it<00:00:40.030> just<00:00:40.500> takes<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.590> while<00:00:41.710> to

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
time basically it just takes a while to

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.970 
time basically it just takes a while to
get<00:00:41.980> all<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.220> gases<00:00:42.670> in<00:00:42.820> there<00:00:42.970> flammable

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
get all the gases in there flammable

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.470 
get all the gases in there flammable
hopefully<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.130> works<00:00:45.400> I<00:00:46.290> do<00:00:47.290> have<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:48.309> am<00:00:49.239> just

hopefully that works I do have I am just
running<00:00:49.629> this<00:00:49.900> off<00:00:50.050> one<00:00:50.320> fan

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
this one blower here I've got it set to

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.450 
this one blower here I've got it set to
primary<00:00:56.080> and<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:58.239> secondary<00:00:59.100> got<00:01:00.100> valves

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
primary and the secondary got valves

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.780 
primary and the secondary got valves
I've<00:01:00.550> got<00:01:00.699> them<00:01:00.820> both<00:01:00.940> wide<00:01:01.239> open<00:01:01.629> right<00:01:01.780> now

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
I've got them both wide open right now

we'll see how that works okay it's been
about<00:01:05.950> five<00:01:06.399> more<00:01:06.610> minutes<00:01:06.759> I<00:01:07.000> just<00:01:07.180> came<00:01:07.300> back

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
about five more minutes I just came back

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.200 
about five more minutes I just came back
and<00:01:07.690> checked<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.430> don't<00:01:09.430> see<00:01:09.610> any<00:01:09.759> smoke<00:01:09.880> at

that's really easy basically I had I had
done<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.759> test<00:01:19.060> burn<00:01:19.590> earlier<00:01:20.590> this<00:01:20.740> morning

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
done a test burn earlier this morning

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.440 
done a test burn earlier this morning
and<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:24.340> light<00:01:24.490> this<00:01:24.700> up<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:25.000> actually<00:01:25.119> just

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
and to light this up I actually just

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.010 
and to light this up I actually just
pulled<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.810> coals<00:01:26.050> oxide<00:01:26.470> changed<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:28.479> my

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
pulled the coals oxide changed my my

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.100 
pulled the coals oxide changed my my
manifold<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.770> there<00:01:29.920> just<00:01:30.039> a<00:01:30.160> little<00:01:30.430> bit<00:01:30.550> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
manifold in there just a little bit and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.680 
manifold in there just a little bit and
I<00:01:32.110> pulled<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.009> out<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:34.000> coals<00:01:34.270> were<00:01:34.420> still

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
I pulled it out and the coals were still

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.779 
I pulled it out and the coals were still

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
hotter I had him out in a wheelbarrow

five minutes
totally<00:01:53.440> clean<00:01:53.619> now<00:01:53.950> take<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:54.819> look<00:01:55.060> in<00:01:55.209> here

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
totally clean now take a look in here

totally clean now take a look in here
see<00:01:55.569> what's<00:01:55.780> going<00:01:56.080> on<00:01:57.360> look<00:01:58.360> down<00:01:58.630> there

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.460 

it<00:02:04.500> looks<00:02:04.830> like<00:02:05.010> it's<00:02:05.250> pretty<00:02:06.090> good<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:07.290> not

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
it looks like it's pretty good it's not

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.660 
it looks like it's pretty good it's not
the<00:02:09.530> type<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.680> burn<00:02:10.860> look<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> had<00:02:11.520> before

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the type of burn look that I had before

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.000 
the type of burn look that I had before
using<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.360> real<00:02:12.600> true<00:02:12.900> secondary<00:02:13.620> burn<00:02:13.830> it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
using that real true secondary burn it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.610 
using that real true secondary burn it
wasn't<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:15.090> thing<00:02:15.330> was<00:02:15.480> pretty<00:02:15.720> crazy<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.350> I

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
wasn't that thing was pretty crazy but I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.510 
wasn't that thing was pretty crazy but I
think<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.520> was<00:02:18.380> wasn't<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.590> easy<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:20.130> lit

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
think it was wasn't as easy to get lit

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.280 
think it was wasn't as easy to get lit
and<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.850> wasn't<00:02:21.180> easy<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.420> keep<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:22.140> this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and it wasn't easy to keep it going this

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.350 
and it wasn't easy to keep it going this
thing<00:02:22.560> seems<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.950> light<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:26.360> works

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
thing seems to light right up and works

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.540 
thing seems to light right up and works
quite<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> bit<00:02:27.930> better<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.230> I'm<00:02:29.100> gonna<00:02:29.310> shut

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
quite a bit better so I'm gonna shut

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.100 
quite a bit better so I'm gonna shut
this<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.970> let<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.180> go<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.570> just<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.990> know

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
this and let it go and just you know

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.190 
this and let it go and just you know
make<00:02:31.350> sure<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.590> really<00:02:31.860> keeps<00:02:32.040> working<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:33.200> so

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
make sure it really keeps working but so

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.130 
make sure it really keeps working but so
far<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.560> seems<00:02:34.800> really<00:02:35.570> really<00:02:36.570> good<00:02:36.930> it's

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
far this seems really really good it's

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.230 
far this seems really really good it's
lighting<00:02:37.410> up<00:02:37.500> quick<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.870> my

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
lighting up quick so I can have my

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.910 
lighting up quick so I can have my
boiler<00:02:42.240> set<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.720> thermostat<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.620> kicks

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
boiler set on the thermostat just kicks

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
boiler set on the thermostat just kicks
that<00:02:44.100> fan<00:02:44.400> off<00:02:44.670> when<00:02:47.060> when<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> water<00:02:48.360> gets

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
that fan off when when the water gets

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.270 
that fan off when when the water gets
hot<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.020> kicks<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.380> back<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.800> when<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.040> get

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
hot and kicks it back on when I get

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.449 
hot and kicks it back on when I get
close<00:02:50.730> back<00:02:50.970> down<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:53.010> should<00:02:53.190> light

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
close back down and it should light

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.729 
close back down and it should light
right<00:02:53.640> back<00:02:53.880> up<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.360> had<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:54.810> you

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
right back up because I had this you

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.560 
right back up because I had this you
know<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.860> had<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.370> totally<00:02:56.610> shut<00:02:57.030> off<00:02:57.209> for<00:02:59.570> at

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
know I had it totally shut off for at

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.100 
know I had it totally shut off for at
least<00:03:00.720> five<00:03:01.590> or<00:03:01.620> six<00:03:01.980> hours<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:03.000> thought<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.900> I

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
least five or six hours I thought that I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.449 
least five or six hours I thought that I
thought<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> coals<00:03:04.739> are<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:04.980> totally<00:03:05.280> gone

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
thought the coals are not totally gone

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.070 
thought the coals are not totally gone
out<00:03:05.670> but<00:03:05.820> once<00:03:06.000> they<00:03:06.120> got<00:03:06.270> some<00:03:06.450> oxygen<00:03:06.810> they

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
out but once they got some oxygen they

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.949 
out but once they got some oxygen they
they<00:03:07.320> laid<00:03:07.530> right<00:03:07.680> back<00:03:07.920> up<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.570> as<00:03:09.570> long<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.900> I

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
they laid right back up so as long as I

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.170 
they laid right back up so as long as I
don't<00:03:10.019> let<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.500> stove<00:03:11.250> run<00:03:11.550> really<00:03:11.820> low<00:03:12.000> on

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
don't let the stove run really low on

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.740 
don't let the stove run really low on
wood<00:03:13.400> it'll<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:14.610> cycle<00:03:14.970> back<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.570> often

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
wood it'll just cycle back on and often

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.800 
wood it'll just cycle back on and often
and<00:03:16.170> keep<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.709> water<00:03:16.920> nice<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.280> hot<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:17.880> well

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and keep the water nice and hot so well

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.860 
and keep the water nice and hot so well
it<00:03:18.930> seems<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.260> be<00:03:19.380> going<00:03:19.530> pretty<00:03:19.680> good<00:03:20.870> I've

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
it seems to be going pretty good I've

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.330 
it seems to be going pretty good I've
pretty<00:03:22.080> much<00:03:22.170> burned<00:03:22.560> up<00:03:22.709> all<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.010> wood<00:03:23.130> I've

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
pretty much burned up all the wood I've

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.110 
pretty much burned up all the wood I've
got<00:03:23.549> in<00:03:23.730> there

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
got in there

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.550 
got in there
somebody<00:03:24.959> was<00:03:25.230> gonna<00:03:25.379> tie<00:03:25.739> in<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.670> little<00:03:26.910> bit

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
somebody was gonna tie in a little bit

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.470 
somebody was gonna tie in a little bit
but<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:28.709> been<00:03:28.890> going<00:03:29.190> good<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.819> did<00:03:30.180> run<00:03:30.300> into

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
but it's been going good I did run into

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.520 
but it's been going good I did run into
a<00:03:30.599> little<00:03:30.780> bit<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.140> problems<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.860> put<00:03:32.670> some<00:03:32.970> I

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
a little bit of problems I put some I

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.369 
a little bit of problems I put some I
had<00:03:34.530> some<00:03:34.709> post<00:03:35.599> post<00:03:36.599> that<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> had<00:03:37.019> cut<00:03:37.230> off

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
had some post post that I had cut off

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.930 
had some post post that I had cut off
some<00:03:37.650> pressure-treated<00:03:38.160> ones<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.640> put<00:03:38.819> in

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
some pressure-treated ones I put in

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.240 
some pressure-treated ones I put in
there<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.110> did<00:03:40.349> end<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:40.650> smoking<00:03:41.010> a

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
there and that did end up smoking a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.059 
there and that did end up smoking a
little<00:03:41.340> bit<00:03:42.170> but<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.200> think<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.620> burned<00:03:43.830> that

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
little bit but I think it's burned that

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.550 
little bit but I think it's burned that
up<00:03:44.280> now<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.760> at<00:03:45.660> least<00:03:45.780> whatever<00:03:46.140> was<00:03:46.349> in<00:03:46.470> it

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
up now and at least whatever was in it

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.170 
up now and at least whatever was in it
caused<00:03:46.799> me<00:03:46.980> problems<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.700> seems<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.090> be

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
caused me problems and that seems to be

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.580 
caused me problems and that seems to be
going<00:03:48.330> good<00:03:48.599> now<00:03:49.129> pretty<00:03:50.129> hot<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.610> there<00:03:51.590> I've

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
going good now pretty hot in there I've

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.440 
going good now pretty hot in there I've
pretty<00:03:53.099> much<00:03:53.190> just<00:03:53.580> turned<00:03:54.060> off<00:03:54.269> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
pretty much just turned off the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.839 
pretty much just turned off the
secondary<00:03:55.019> burn<00:03:55.230> I'll<00:03:56.069> with<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.459> design

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
secondary burn I'll with this design

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.870 
secondary burn I'll with this design
I've<00:03:57.060> got<00:03:57.269> now<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.480> don't<00:03:57.660> think<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.170> need<00:03:58.440> it

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
I've got now I don't think I need it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.140 
I've got now I don't think I need it
cuz<00:03:59.880> I<00:03:59.970> get<00:04:00.120> enough<00:04:00.360> air<00:04:01.349> just<00:04:01.709> from<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
cuz I get enough air just from the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.490 
cuz I get enough air just from the
primary<00:04:03.150> burn<00:04:03.390> since<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:03.930> all<00:04:04.049> just<00:04:04.230> going

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
primary burn since it's all just going

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.410 
primary burn since it's all just going
straight<00:04:04.620> through<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:05.040> bottom<00:04:05.430> there<00:04:05.610> and

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
straight through the bottom there and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.720 
straight through the bottom there and
straight<00:04:06.810> down<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.040> I'm<00:04:08.099> not<00:04:08.280> getting<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.549> log

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
straight down so I'm not getting a log

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.809 
straight down so I'm not getting a log
in<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.299> lot<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.170> oxygen<00:04:10.349> getting<00:04:10.920> used<00:04:11.190> up<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.670> it

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
in a lot of oxygen getting used up in it

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.030 
in a lot of oxygen getting used up in it
and<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.720> primary<00:04:13.140> burn<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.500> there's<00:04:13.620> plenty

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040
