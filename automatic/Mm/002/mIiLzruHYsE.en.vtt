00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.390
 Munich in the new Bundesliga season 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.599
 the opponent before the new extended 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.420
 spectator backdrop of 71,000 in the

 alliance arena the vfb stuttgart the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.070
 bavaria without the sick arjen robben 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 for with bastian schweinsteiger of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.039
 beginning at the bank first 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:29.580
 new entry to javier martinez and his 24th 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.140
 happy birthday in love the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.870
 bayern led from right to left 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.940
 stuttgart in attack of the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.670
 ball comes to martin harnik martin 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.040
 harnik r with the chance to take an early lead 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.780
 to go 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.399
 huge opportunity for the vfb stuttgart 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.940
 manuel newer is with the fingertips 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.340
 still on the ball and directs to the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.739
 latte the bavaria needed a while 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.850
 right up to her first really thick 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.359
 possibility of new gustavo she has in the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.439
 24 minute pitch at this shot of 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.210
 luis gustavo 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.810
 there were really few missing 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.790
 centimeters or even millimeters of bavaria 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.270
 The game seemed to be under control now 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.200
 but have free kick in the 25 minute 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.909
 Harnik is back on the ball and an inside 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.550
 this time no chance of defense 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.700
 four times 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:33.220
 after the free kick by boka harnik 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.930
 very suspicious decision 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.390
 jerome boateng was missing in this 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.630
 situation in the domestic defense became 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.690
 at this time outside the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.900
 playing field treated and so the leadership 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.390
 for the vfb the bavaria but little 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.540
 shocked makes the pressure forward 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.950
 thomas müller is ready to play 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.100
 great use 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.710
 ribery and again thomas müller is coming 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.820
 but shot into the arms of 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.850
 sven ulreich a great football game with 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.830
 on both sides mandzukic 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.500
 on the right side müller with the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.170
 volley decrease ulreich and müller sets 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.010
 after the compensation for the FC Bayern 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.280
 Munich the one to one in the 33rd 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.560
 minute by the tireless thomas 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 miller 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.830
 lima the prep work class already the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.650
 Volly decrease and that sets however 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.190
 actually after is faster than all 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.270
 other 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.459
 thomas müller 1 to 1 33 minutes the 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.520
 same minute and again beats 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.600
 it one 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.880
 in the vfb gate this time it is toni kroos 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.300
 which deducts from 20 meters 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.450
 the lead two hits within 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.080
 60 seconds for fc bavaria munich 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.030
 what a shot of toni kroos too 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.010
 Ulreich is probably still there with the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.160
 But the goal can not be fingertips 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.070
 prevent and bavaria this again 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.290
 time the ball of ribery on mandzukic 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.690
 and requires and not only he 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.240
 eleven meters after an action by arthur 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.300
 boka so there are some 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.580
 umpire this so something whistling it 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.120
 continue at the intermediate level of 2 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.270
 1 luiz gustavo that is about 30 meters 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.380
 and that in a maximum of 30 centimeters at 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.600
 post over 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.770
 and on the right side of the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:36.300
 inside the 3 1 by luiz gustavo in 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.930
 the 43 minute what a goal too much 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.960
 far away 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:46.680
 and the brazilian uses this 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:49.380
 Traumtor to the 3 1 yet another 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.959
 possibility for the bayern again good 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.780
 conquered the ball franck ribery in the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.209
 final minutes of the first round 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.040
 müller again with the volley decrease and 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.820
 the attempt by mandzukic still to the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.520
 ball to come 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.290
 not worked but synonymous with the 3 2 1 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.690
 At half-time the fans are completely satisfied 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.480
 the vfb at the beginning of the second half with 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.580
 tunay torun for tamas hajnal but the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.579
 bavaria continues in the forward 47 minute 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.909
 the 4 to all 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.430
 mandzukic the vfb still not right 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:28.219
 outside the cabin though you look 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.939
 Of course, a lot had been done then 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:34.610
 but that four to one is something like that 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:37.509
 like a final decision 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.770
 müller still fails but then is 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:46.340
 Mario Mandzukic Star brings the ball 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:49.099
 over the goal line 4 to 1 again in the 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.000
 fourth duty is a goal of 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:55.599
 New access to the fc bavaria munich and 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.699
 then a quick counter to the corner 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.969
 manuel neu introduces him to franck 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.469
 ribery five against two in the majority mario 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:07.490
 mandzukic with his second goal 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:11.560
 no, but thomas müller with his 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.659
 second goal the 5 2 1 in the 49 minute 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.300
 what's up with that? 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.819
 team of bruno labbadia goes after 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.300
 look at this overpower 5 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.560
 2 now here at 1 sven ulreich im tor 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.379
 of the vfb 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:32.150
 he was able to get almost broke 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:35.270
 he still rescues the keeper of the shiny 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.400
 vfb but against this head soon he is 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.370
 of course powerless and that was long ago 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.780
 not the end yet 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.120
 51 minutes back the bavaria 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.490
 This time on the head and bastian 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.600
 Schweinsteiger and he does his 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.600
 hit a worth seeing goal for 6 to 1 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.040
 he is happy to be quite bastian 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.000
 Schweinsteiger from the beginning 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.620
 finally again and then a strong one 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.300
 performance crowned with this hit 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.380
 but then again the vfb 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.910
 stuttgart with a possibility on 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.690
 Correction of results this becomes the first 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.669
 this until the second manuel new 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.650
 So it will be two in a row 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.060
 tested that was it but also 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.530
 at least what the big ones 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.350
 Opportunities anging in the 74 minute 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.790
 then this unsightly action 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:37.200
 benefits and this is advised 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:39.840
 to each other money for boateng and smooth 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.540
 red for this which the decision of 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.180
 referee kinhöfer also does that 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.630
 for the vfb stuttgart loses so 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.320
 his most dangerous offensive man in 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.180
 the last 15 minutes of this game and 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.610
 at least one more game after 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.680
 this completely redundant action 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.539
 then the change of bastian 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.039
 Schweinsteiger a very special 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.409
 change was for him that came 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.539
 birthday boy 24 he became today 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:09.789
 not the bastille but the yes how 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:12.819
 I have her martin is his first 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:16.210
 so use for the fc bavaria munich 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:18.580
 and right at the beginning a great start 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.669
 this pass in the run of thomas 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:25.060
 müller even if it can not be counted 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.680
 it stayed at the end of the clear 6 2 1 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.479
 for the fc bavaria munich 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.689
 congratulations again to the 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.689
 birthday boy
