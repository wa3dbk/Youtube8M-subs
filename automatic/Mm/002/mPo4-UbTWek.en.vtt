started riding motorcycles when I was

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.239 
started riding motorcycles when I was

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
ever since then I've had one and really

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.060 
ever since then I've had one and really
started<00:00:18.340> to<00:00:18.539> slowly<00:00:19.539> learn<00:00:19.929> through<00:00:20.679> many

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
started to slowly learn through many

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.490 
started to slowly learn through many
bikes<00:00:21.279> dirt<00:00:21.760> bikes<00:00:22.000> evolved<00:00:22.960> into<00:00:23.140> street

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
bikes dirt bikes evolved into street

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.829 
bikes dirt bikes evolved into street
bikes<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:24.039> then<00:00:24.880> obviously<00:00:25.029> got<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.689> little

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
bikes and then obviously got a little

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.290 
bikes and then obviously got a little
bit<00:00:25.990> better<00:00:26.170> and<00:00:26.470> I<00:00:26.910> wanted<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:27.970> give<00:00:28.119> a<00:00:28.150> bit

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
bit better and I wanted to give a bit

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.909 
bit better and I wanted to give a bit
more<00:00:28.449> safer<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.050> more<00:00:29.169> predictable<00:00:29.439> more

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
more safer and more predictable more

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.400 
more safer and more predictable more
confidence<00:00:30.490> so<00:00:31.419> I<00:00:31.779> looked<00:00:32.080> into<00:00:32.259> the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
confidence so I looked into the

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.020 
confidence so I looked into the
California<00:00:32.830> Superbike<00:00:33.070> school<00:00:33.220> to<00:00:33.700> enhance

California Superbike school to enhance

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.930

some<00:00:34.210> of<00:00:34.330> the<00:00:34.390> skills<00:00:34.630> I<00:00:34.810> I<00:00:35.020> already<00:00:35.260> had<00:00:35.559> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
some of the skills I I already had and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.190 
some of the skills I I already had and
correct<00:00:36.940> some<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.210> bad<00:00:37.329> habits<00:00:37.750> that<00:00:38.079> I've

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
correct some of the bad habits that I've

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.939 
correct some of the bad habits that I've
obviously<00:00:39.090> gained<00:00:40.090> over<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.329> years<00:00:40.420> as<00:00:40.780> well

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
obviously gained over the years as well

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.889 
obviously gained over the years as well
for<00:00:41.949> women<00:00:42.250> I<00:00:42.370> think<00:00:42.610> it's<00:00:42.789> um<00:00:43.059> it's<00:00:43.690> a

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
for women I think it's um it's a

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.790 
for women I think it's um it's a
challenge<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:44.710> ride<00:00:44.890> motorcycles<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:46.800> its

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
its fundamentals really basic

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.979 
its fundamentals really basic
fundamentals<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.370> you<00:00:52.329> have<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.690> put<00:00:52.840> your

farther and pushed it to another

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.880 
farther and pushed it to another
boundary<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.780> thought<00:02:41.080> I'd<00:02:41.260> be<00:02:41.470> there<00:02:41.710> and

and<00:02:45.970> builds<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.510> my<00:02:46.660> confidence<00:02:48.060> definitely

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
and builds and my confidence definitely

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.460 
and builds and my confidence definitely
is<00:02:49.120> better<00:02:49.540> than<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:49.930> ever<00:02:50.020> been<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.440> a

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
is better than it's ever been on a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.620 
is better than it's ever been on a
motorcycle
