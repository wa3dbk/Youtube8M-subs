 in the club fc krasnodar 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.980
 he was boosting the ja at the post 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.890
 of advanced striker does he that he is a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 silver card boustila note frankly 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.160
 impressive 83 years old note 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.140
 attackers it's really 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.620
 awesome for a money card 74 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.340
 its price is quite high at 1,389 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.220
 currently on 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.050
 on on xbox on the ps3 is a little less 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.300
 charges do not have access the green brief 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.000
 on the side of these statistics the links 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.670
 simply amazing 1.80 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.339
 ball control finish in January 88 years 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.800
 long hot 85 shooting power four 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.479
 twenty thirteen degas also note a beautiful 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.510
 volley room of 80 trains on the side 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.700
 physical 88 in acceleration 80 in agitate 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.200
 82 in balance 84 years of times and 1,85 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.930
 in strength for a silver card it's 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.770
 really abused it's really for for 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.970
 me 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.860
 First I tell you guys 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.770
 he is the best Brazilian striker of 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.899
 hameem it's even great at diego costa 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.060
 when he was himself Brazilian before 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.200
 that that passionately brief adopted that he has 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.119
 four stars of the bad foot 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.830
 only 3 technical accuracy 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.360
 his little flat but he is really 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.580
 impressive I place them in a 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.560
 small team to squeeze with 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.509
 brazilians I played I did the most 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.800
 reviewed only there is only account 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.090
 gold teams as we can see the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.720
 first action to the big hit so 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.330
 first of all we will illustrate the points 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.920
 negatives that's because he has two it's 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.880
 the price td first of all the price it's 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.160
 normal for a four agents this is 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.270
 really expensive even if the vow for 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.520
 me it does not bother me at all to put 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.509
 more than 380 me credit the slaughter guest 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.830
 you have the means 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.060
 let it be really a nugget 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.800
 so at the same time you see it's 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.979
 super purpose the passive than ever with 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.060
 his other negative point is the last 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.720
 these three men of technical gesture 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.010
 this is me I like to dribble hugo everything 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.740
 single gene not really not 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.240
 dribbling or kiffing victims 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.830
 dribble who are like me that can be 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.300
 a little brake it shows to gc's notes 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.210
 Northeast 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.320
 that's really what it takes 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.020
 side of the positives 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.310
 the thing that marked me the most and gace 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.620
 it's a stadium in force 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.600
 frankly in force at the lowest cost of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.250
 poles the opponent ton he still has 1 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.970
 85 in strength for a money card that's 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.650
 really amazing 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.740
 he is not very tall he does put back 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.520
 some 80 but be the strength he has 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.080
 frankly all the defenders and the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.720
 candles mouth of thiago silva she has 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.350
 even moves sergio ramos it's abused 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.910
 its finish 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.580
 its finish for a silver card certainly 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.560
 and it's boost but it's being abused 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.330
 guy i tell you ah it's for me 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.970
 the best Brazilian striker of the 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.490
 player you put him in front with a 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.670
 small boat is perfect alloy audi 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.890
 it's his bad foot left foot of 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.570
 not too much baseline difference if 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.630
 I say no bullshit he's right-handed 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.580
 so with the left foot it goes also of the foot 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.870
 right left outside 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.150
 it's beautiful it's beautiful 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.830
 put its effects it is abused braga ya 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.090
 a lot of goals from the former star of the foot 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.380
 law 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.390
 these contributions too I do not have any 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.370
 spoken just before but they are 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.690
 elevated in the attacked means in der in 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.140
 defense what it takes for an attacker 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.750
 peak 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.400
 it's a guy who will mark you early 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.310
 the ja's do not be afraid of spear in 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.250
 depth he only has 80 speed 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:41.170
 on the map 80.2 sorry but that's it 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.310
 force then is rarely stopped 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.060
 also what really impressed me 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.260
 his relaxation 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.270
 it is not very big but I have a 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.010
 but 80 there is a superb relaxation 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.260
 I will score a lot of goals should 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.610
 to score one or two max I have not looked 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.620
 I did not try to score a head 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.880
 probably because with the country it is 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.290
 so good that this dad to score from 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.240
 the head puts his head 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.880
 she has a goal or two what I have you 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.870
 said it does not take any proof that 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.300
 poses no problem 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.230
 his physique that I say extraordinary 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.610
 it's a long shot I put two or 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.170
 three or can see in the video a 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.690
 big punch and his punching power 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.300
 who is 95 who is really 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.209
 impressive at 95 guys for a 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.519
 money card 93 forgiveness for catalan

 really got to goal so it's the gard 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.110
 we finished the compilation so for the balance sheet 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.950

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.350
 you say to place it it's a little 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.660
 hard because in krasnodar physics 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.700
