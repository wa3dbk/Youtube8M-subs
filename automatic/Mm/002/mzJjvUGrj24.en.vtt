better<00:00:32.550> than<00:00:32.640> hazard<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.270> better<00:00:33.750> than<00:00:33.960> Lamar

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
better than hazard and better than Lamar

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.709 
better than hazard and better than Lamar
and<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.949> think<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> moment<00:00:35.430> he's<00:00:36.030> kind<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.510 
and I think at the moment he's kind of
proven<00:00:37.109> to<00:00:37.289> be<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.680> way<00:00:37.800> scoring<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> lot<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
proven to be that way scoring a lot of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
proven to be that way scoring a lot of
girls<00:00:38.789> and<00:00:39.269> he<00:00:39.510> looks<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.929> good

pierce<00:00:47.489> upfront<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.969> Emile<00:00:48.690> Sinclair<00:00:48.989> but

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
pierce upfront in Emile Sinclair but

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:51.349 
pierce upfront in Emile Sinclair but
very<00:00:49.710> early<00:00:49.949> on<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.399> split<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:50.850> open<00:00:50.999> like<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
very early on we split them open like a

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.000 
very early on we split them open like a
diamond<00:00:51.659> that<00:00:51.899> never<00:00:52.199> split<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.469> diamond<00:00:52.620> open

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
diamond that never split a diamond open

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.889 
diamond that never split a diamond open
I<00:00:53.069> think<00:00:53.249> that's<00:00:53.399> quite<00:00:53.519> hard<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.089> so<00:00:54.719> we

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
I think that's quite hard to do so we

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
I think that's quite hard to do so we
split<00:00:55.139> open<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.589> an<00:00:55.889> orange<00:00:56.069> we'll<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.579> see

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
split open like an orange we'll just see

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.160 
split open like an orange we'll just see
an<00:00:56.760> orange<00:00:57.089> because<00:00:57.359> that<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:57.839> easy<00:00:58.019> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
an orange because that is very easy to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.590 
an orange because that is very easy to
split<00:00:58.499> open<00:00:58.799> and<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.489> make<00:00:59.729> it<00:00:59.909> one<00:01:00.120> nil<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
split open and we make it one nil in a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
split open and we make it one nil in a
move<00:01:00.780> arsal<00:01:01.289> would<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.620> proud<00:01:01.889> of<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.249> we<00:01:02.489> make

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
move arsal would be proud of and we make

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
move arsal would be proud of and we make
it<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.179> nil<00:01:03.389> not<00:01:03.629> long<00:01:03.780> after<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.559> trumpet

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it to nil not long after when trumpet

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.800 
it to nil not long after when trumpet
goes<00:01:05.369> through<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.820> he<00:01:05.909> smashes<00:01:06.299> under<00:01:06.720> the

had he had a decent team he didn't have
the<00:03:57.170> best<00:03:57.380> team<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.739> world<00:03:57.769> but<00:03:58.459> he<00:03:58.579> did

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
the best team in the world but he did

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.940 
the best team in the world but he did
have<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.970> challenging<00:03:59.480> squad<00:03:59.870> now<00:04:00.350> we<00:04:00.410> replace

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
have a challenging squad now we replace

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.740

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.849 
comes casteels I think that move needed
to<00:04:05.359> be<00:04:05.480> made<00:04:05.660> as<00:04:05.840> we<00:04:05.870> go<00:04:06.200> up<00:04:06.230> against<00:04:06.620> tougher

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
to be made as we go up against tougher

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.009 
to be made as we go up against tougher
squads<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.459> know<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.030> last<00:04:08.239> team<00:04:08.510> didn't<00:04:08.930> have

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
squads I know the last team didn't have

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.750 
squads I know the last team didn't have
a<00:04:09.079> tough<00:04:09.260> score<00:04:09.500> whatsoever<00:04:10.010> but<00:04:10.250> we<00:04:10.459> will<00:04:10.639> be

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
a tough score whatsoever but we will be

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.550 
a tough score whatsoever but we will be
coming<00:04:10.970> up<00:04:11.060> against<00:04:11.389> much<00:04:11.690> tougher<00:04:11.989> sports<00:04:12.350> in

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
coming up against much tougher sports in

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.920 
coming up against much tougher sports in
the<00:04:13.130> future<00:04:13.579> so<00:04:13.760> income<00:04:14.180> casteels<00:04:14.720> and
