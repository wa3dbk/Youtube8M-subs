being<00:02:33.060> at<00:02:33.209> their<00:02:33.390> level<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:33.989> it's<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.200> smaller

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
being at their level so it's a smaller

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.160

pores<00:02:34.890> smaller<00:02:35.250> rackets<00:02:36.030> modified<00:02:36.600> Paul's<00:02:36.900> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
pores smaller rackets modified Paul's it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.590 
pores smaller rackets modified Paul's it
makes<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.560> lot<00:02:37.709> easier<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.489> kids

therefore they have greater success
through<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.099> program<00:02:41.370> they<00:02:41.790> obviously<00:02:41.940> can

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
through the program they obviously can

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.420 
through the program they obviously can
see<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.780> improvement<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.980> they<00:02:44.220> progress

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
see that improvement as they progress

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.790 
see that improvement as they progress
they<00:02:44.940> know<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.330> it's<00:02:45.510> doing<00:02:46.260> well<00:02:46.530> they're

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
they know that it's doing well they're

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.280 
they know that it's doing well they're
achieving<00:02:47.250> goals<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:48.510> they<00:02:48.660> yet<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.170> move

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
achieving goals and they yet and move

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.990 
achieving goals and they yet and move
through<00:02:49.440> those<00:02:49.650> programs<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.370> graduate

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
through those programs so they graduate

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.460 
through those programs so they graduate
from<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.330> red<00:02:51.480> ball<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.900> then<00:02:51.959> they<00:02:52.110> go<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.319> to

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
from the red ball and then they go on to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.340 
from the red ball and then they go on to
the<00:02:52.560> orange<00:02:52.890> cause<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.489> like<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.660> their<00:02:54.930> idols
