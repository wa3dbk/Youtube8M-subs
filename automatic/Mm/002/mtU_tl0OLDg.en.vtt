corners here and like I said guys the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.319 
corners here and like I said guys the
setup<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.890> manually<00:00:38.520> man<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
setup is you just manually man up the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
setup is you just manually man up the
corner<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.500> safety<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> outside

corner or the safety with the outside
wide<00:00:41.969> receiver<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.600> then<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.739> see

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
wide receiver and then as you can see

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.880 
wide receiver and then as you can see
you<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> nice<00:00:44.960> i'll<00:00:45.960> show<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.590> many<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you get a nice i'll show you as many a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.560 
you get a nice i'll show you as many a
lot<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.399> replays<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.969> video<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> go

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
lot of replays in this video to go

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.900 
lot of replays in this video to go
through<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.219> basically<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:50.460> happens

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
through this but basically what happens

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.430 
through this but basically what happens
is<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.930> basically<00:00:52.140> use

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
is what you can do is you basically use

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.660 
is what you can do is you basically use
this<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:54.090> faux<00:00:55.370> double<00:00:56.370> coverage

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
this as a as a faux double coverage

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.400 
this as a as a faux double coverage
since<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.270> technically<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.960> double

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
since you don't technically have double

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
since you don't technically have double
coverage<00:00:58.649> available<00:00:58.800> anymore<00:00:59.340> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.329> see

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
coverage available anymore you can see

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
coverage available anymore you can see
that<00:01:00.600> there's<00:01:00.780> nowhere<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.289> throw<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> ball

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that there's nowhere to throw the ball

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.910 
that there's nowhere to throw the ball
right<00:01:01.829> now<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.840> this<00:01:03.840> play<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.409> especially

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
right now and this play is especially

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.960 
right now and this play is especially
effective<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.610> someone<00:01:05.790> likes

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
effective if you have someone likes

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.370 
effective if you have someone likes
running<00:01:06.119> drags<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.080> leave

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
running drags because you can just leave

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
running drags because you can just leave
your<00:01:07.530> corner<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.909> safety

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
your corner there and then your safety

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
your corner there and then your safety
can<00:01:09.689> follow<00:01:09.960> him<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.470> better<00:01:10.680> coverage

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
can follow him and get better coverage

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.330 
can follow him and get better coverage
on<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> drag<00:01:11.909> route<00:01:12.260> so<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.590> time<00:01:13.950> i<00:01:13.979> didn't

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
on the drag route so that time i didn't

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
on the drag route so that time i didn't
do<00:01:14.430> any<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.970> didn't<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.509> any<00:01:15.689> adjustments<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
do any I didn't do any adjustments and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
do any I didn't do any adjustments and
even<00:01:16.680> though<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> sack<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.030> guys<00:01:18.180> are

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
even though I get the sack you guys are

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.840 
even though I get the sack you guys are
going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.540> able<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.280> corner

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
going to be able to see that the corner

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.840 
going to be able to see that the corner
route<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.299> wide<00:01:21.810> open<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:22.530> somebody<00:01:23.430> wanted<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
route is wide open if somebody wanted to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.749 
route is wide open if somebody wanted to
throw<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.830> as<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.640> I

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
throw it so as you can see here if I

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.819 
throw it so as you can see here if I
don't<00:01:27.000> give<00:01:27.360> him<00:01:27.390> safety<00:01:28.049> help<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.619> let

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
don't give him safety help and just let

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.100 
don't give him safety help and just let
the<00:01:28.950> play<00:01:29.130> run<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.520> you've<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the play run out you've got that that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.990 
the play run out you've got that that
free<00:01:31.500> three<00:01:31.890> yards<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.220> space<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
free three yards of space there and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
free three yards of space there and
corner<00:01:33.659> routes<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:33.990> absolutely<00:01:34.770> killer

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
corner routes are absolutely killer

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.460 
corner routes are absolutely killer
