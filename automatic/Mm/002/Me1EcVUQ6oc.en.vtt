00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.170 

inside<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> truck<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.790> 2005<00:00:32.790> model

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.250 

and<00:00:36.180> I'm<00:00:36.300> guessing<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> hand<00:00:37.110> grip

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.540 
and I'm guessing there was a hand grip
up<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.890> point<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.309> looks<00:00:38.430> like

work<00:04:24.240> well<00:04:25.240> right<00:04:25.630> along<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.020> front<00:04:26.260> where

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
work well right along the front where

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.570 
work well right along the front where
that<00:04:26.740> aluminum<00:04:27.220> meets<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:28.390> fiberglass<00:04:28.810> I

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
that aluminum meets that fiberglass I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.250 
that aluminum meets that fiberglass I
guess<00:04:30.580> it's<00:04:30.850> cracked<00:04:31.210> somewhere<00:04:31.750> up<00:04:31.930> in<00:04:32.050> there

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260
