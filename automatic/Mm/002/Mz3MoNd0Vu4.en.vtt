00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
a few websites let me just pick some

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.430 
a few websites let me just pick some
random<00:00:47.670> video<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:50.629> don't<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.170> don't

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
random video I don't know I really don't

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.790 
random video I don't know I really don't
matter<00:00:57.530> let's<00:00:58.530> pick<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.859> one

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
matter let's pick this one

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.979 
matter let's pick this one
so<00:01:01.800> it'll<00:01:02.160> play<00:01:02.370> videos<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.300> YouTube

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so it'll play videos from YouTube

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.620 
so it'll play videos from YouTube
even<00:01:04.830> though<00:01:04.949> YouTube<00:01:05.460> uses<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> Flash<00:01:06.360> Player

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
even though YouTube uses a Flash Player

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.289 
even though YouTube uses a Flash Player
but<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> guess<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.100> embedded<00:01:08.820> inside<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but I guess it's just embedded inside of

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.340 
but I guess it's just embedded inside of
the<00:01:09.540> app<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.310> video<00:01:11.549> will<00:01:11.640> start<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.350> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the app so the video will start and you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.070 
the app so the video will start and you
can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.070> yeah<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:15.080> anyways

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
can see it so yeah that's that anyways

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.550 
can see it so yeah that's that anyways
um<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:17.009> will<00:01:17.189> play<00:01:17.430> sites<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:17.970> other<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
video from there so there's not a whole

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.569

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
lot of websites that do that um and also

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.030 
lot of websites that do that um and also
using<00:01:54.509> YouTube<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> Internet<00:01:55.710> Explorer

using YouTube on the Internet Explorer

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.069 
using YouTube on the Internet Explorer
app<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.490> kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.939> pointless<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.810> there's

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
app is kind of pointless because there's

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.249 
app is kind of pointless because there's
a<00:01:58.170> YouTube<00:01:58.740> app<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.490> dedicated<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.630> for

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
YouTube so there's that and that pretty

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.700 
YouTube so there's that and that pretty
much<00:02:06.030> wraps<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.259> no<00:02:07.439> legitimate

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
much wraps it up there is no legitimate
