00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.420
 hello to everyone except to present to you 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.089
 my modpack for the game world of tanks for 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 fresh patch leads literally 1 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.029
 February 100 more precisely sooner than higher 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.699
 you are watching this video this modpack 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.000
 minimalist here everyone does not have much 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.400
 large bells and whistles that is to a minimum 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.529
 if you already rocked him then this just 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.840
 rock you will notice almost nothing 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.360
 new and if it is not when I 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.980
 I will tell you that it is the first plan 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.940
 first there is a server list and ping up 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.100
 I now show them a test video 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 so only one while servachok 35 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 ping up to him on a regular series has everything 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.340
 these crustaceans and all pinging if somewhere p on 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 The server does not respond, too, are always shown 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.989
 You can choose a server if you have any 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.239
 glitches start quite useful 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.909
 piece by the way did not write in the comments 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.150
 why is a bunch of gold here a bunch of experience 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.390
 silver guys this is a test all this 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.850
 the question is pressing and then the crew 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.430
 you can put one button there 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.950
 native type what did you learn this 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.259
 tank or better lego crew 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.960
 same class if you just need sources 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.939
 get that is, let's say native 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.590
 the crew and you just sit 1 button 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.829
 all who are trained exactly on 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 I have two puppy were retrained 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.060
 here to land in the barracks unfortunately in 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.909
 this patch is a bunch of missing buttons 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:47.460
 land pazor all be in trouble this 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.320
 there is also quite in this finger 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.970
 put here such a crew is not here as 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.350
 would 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.120
 sits right away the best crew that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.610
 can not be planted here 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.240
 catalysis either native crew or withdrawal 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.960
 what exactly 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.570
 want a button is also quite useful but it 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.410
 already standard standard that is possible here 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.890
 so standard 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:16.260
 to land either the crew 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.780
 best to use barefoot and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.730
 plant either native crew whether to be gone 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.800
 the same class extra button 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.050
 not sometimes useful feature 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.540
 you have a lot of prem tanks there elevators four 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.990
 clearer then his crew between the machines 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.690
 back and forth chasing is tossed 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.200
 very often this is also useful a little 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.300
 changed appearance firstly seen on 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.010
 what tank do you have master on which 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.280
 where you have a master yet or there 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.540
 second degree first degree 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.790
 little niggle but someone's mouth 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.060
 achieves the masters it will be quite 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.170
 nice well and plus of course it is 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.900
 achievement extended stats on 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.320
 all vehicles allocated premium technology 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.330
 golden color is completely isolated 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.640
 something about this victory technique how many 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.410
 wins need to increase interest on 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.830
 this car how many there need to complete 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.790
 percent partial halves here are very 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.510
 also home data is useful for wot 0 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.930
 8 8 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.790
 performance statistics goes exactly here 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.920
 from this version is also very useful who 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.209
 watching over 100 then who wants you were very 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.560
 big nice tsiferki 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.360
 it would be very, very bad for 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.270
 pandora almost everything that is like 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.730
 probably change very, very little now 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.989
 We look at what is actually in the battle for what 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.989
 it looks like the battle itself is in this modpack 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:54.810
 to the herd of pawns on the test immediately yes here and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.670
 it costs xvm it is exactly for me like this 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.550
 that is, to be seen 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.800
 tanks they are nicknames on alt naturally immediately 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.070
 nicknames are shown 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.990
 it is useful that interesting 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.710
 newcomer immediately visible in the first these 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.200
 breaking through 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.750
 how much damage have you done 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.480
 this is then my modpack utu because of this 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.140
 very relevant and when used in 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.390
 mini game 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.120
 Panzer points I thought she was already seen on 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.910
 my channel with not seen look very 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.750
 littered mined mini game + shown 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.230
 who will 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.030
 punches you who ever shot at you 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.370
 what is shooting at you that is either this 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.790
 Golda either this is a land mine who exactly this 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:40.230
 did quite a very good thing 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.790
 the next moment is the mini cards you already 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.250
 probably see firstly this is a square 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.960
 drawing is a very useful thing she 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.910
 shows the distance at which 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.640
 enemy tanks will stick out here 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.980
 in this box you see a car that is 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.200
 see them not on mini cards see them 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.180
 so here is the usual ordinary sight 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.060
 I â€™m not the three owl 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.750
 on the screen and if the tank is behind 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.860
 square and you won't see it that is if 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.670
 you 71 will be released on 9 whether I will not see 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.670
 Unfortunately 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.210
 here's a plus circle circle displays 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.870
 450 standard distance in my opinion 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.319
 meters 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.900
 I can really be wrong, but 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:28.509
 I think so that is for example the circle 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.550
 the light on which the tank is ideal 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:35.139
 conditions a spherical vacuum tank can 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:41.080
 devote the enemy can see the enemy 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:44.440
 maybe to dream of doing a sign yet 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.020
 see break through summed up damage 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.190
 shows the last damage which was and 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:56.460
 what he did is more precise a bit changed 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:59.919
 the panel here it is now shown 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.830
 more clearly more brightly + damage 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.120
 you who pass this too 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.169
 illuminated ovda 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.349
 and of course according to your numerous 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.819
 requests to zoom you the same cool 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:14.379
 same big 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:17.099
 but without black frames around the edges also 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:20.080
 now everything is exactly as you requested 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:22.330
 comment on my modpack minimalistic 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.159
 offer your mods in 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.280
 comments under the video on YouTube 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:30.330
 know in group vkontakte put modpak 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.330
 and all bye
