this like the seven gallon fuel tank
seemed<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.970> flip<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.300> bed<00:02:38.709> do<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.770> on<00:02:39.860> that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
seemed to flip the bed do it on that

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.040 
seemed to flip the bed do it on that
side<00:02:41.140> pull<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.470> side<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:43.930> go<00:02:44.930> ahead

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
side pull it on this side to go ahead

00:02:45.050 --> 00:03:03.600 
side pull it on this side to go ahead
and<00:02:45.700> take<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> little<00:02:47.120> ride

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.590 

okay<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:05.530> is<00:03:05.680> our<00:03:05.800> gauge<00:03:06.040> cluster<00:03:07.380> we<00:03:08.380> have

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
okay this is our gauge cluster we have

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.410 
okay this is our gauge cluster we have
the<00:03:10.600> RPM<00:03:11.430> miles<00:03:12.430> an<00:03:12.580> hour<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:12.880> convert<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.390> to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the RPM miles an hour you convert it to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.150 
the RPM miles an hour you convert it to
kilometers<00:03:14.290> an<00:03:14.410> hour<00:03:14.530> also<00:03:15.360> see<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.390> thing<00:03:17.160> you

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
kilometers an hour also see a thing you

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.280 
kilometers an hour also see a thing you
have<00:03:18.340> sixty<00:03:19.030> five<00:03:19.180> point<00:03:19.630> two<00:03:19.660> miles<00:03:25.020> so<00:03:26.020> those

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
have sixty five point two miles so those

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.840 
have sixty five point two miles so those
are<00:03:26.440> all<00:03:26.560> things<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.980> clocks<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.400> course<00:03:27.670> not

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
are all things the clocks of course not

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.600 
are all things the clocks of course not
right<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.350> gas<00:03:29.560> gauge<00:03:29.860> do<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:30.459> had<00:03:30.580> a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
right this is a gas gauge do we had a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.220 
right this is a gas gauge do we had a
five<00:03:30.790> that's<00:03:31.300> still<00:03:31.630> pretty<00:03:31.780> good

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
five that's still pretty good

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.900 
five that's still pretty good
we've<00:03:32.680> only<00:03:32.740> filled<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.130> up<00:03:33.190> once<00:03:33.520> since<00:03:33.760> we

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
we've only filled it up once since we

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.880 
we've only filled it up once since we
got<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.820> go<00:03:37.450> ahead<00:03:37.570> start<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.050> that's<00:03:38.770> two

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
got it so go ahead start it that's two

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.860 
got it so go ahead start it that's two
wheel<00:03:39.040> drive<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.250> four<00:03:39.520> wheel<00:03:39.700> drive<00:03:40.590> get<00:03:41.590> it
