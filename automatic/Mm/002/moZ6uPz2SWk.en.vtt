00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello everyone talks to the champion 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.020
 world of martial arts mister 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.420
 satan this time I will talk to you about 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.370
 the numerous inconsistencies present 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.280
 along dragon ball and dragon ball 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.600
 At the end of the video, the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.619
 main reason for said 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.140
 inconsistencies let's start the ship of 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.330
 goku when boku is 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.010
 hospitalized it is known that he asks 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.929
 help Bulma's dad to give him 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.420
 build a ship to go to mockus 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.340
 and since previously you did not have a 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.440
 technology to develop a ship that 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.690
 I could travel so far in the universe 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.210
 it was thought to use the ship as a base 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.730
 of some of the sayayin unfortunately 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.920
 the radio was destroyed by goian the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.080
 of napa was accidentally destroyed 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.440
 by bulge with the remote control and the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.650
 goku destroyed by beak the certain not of the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.270
 everything happens that in chapter 18 where 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.160
 goian transforms into a monkey 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.920
 gigantic with a holographic moon 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.570
 it turns out to be a filler chapter if it 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.030
 will take into account that chapter 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.800
 it would be quite confusing how it is that 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.480
 a ship that supposedly would have been 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.400
 destroyed by itch or 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.470
 gross to mind has been used by the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.680
 vulva dad to build the ship in 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.490
 where goku travel to mekhissi the origin 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.240
 of android number 8 in episode 42 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.430
 of dragon ball 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.820
 Dr. Flave supposedly created 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.040
 octavio the android number 8 nevertheless 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.550
 this statement is discarded since in the 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.410
 chapter 367 of the sleeve the same cover 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.540
 shows us the doctor's relationship 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.970
 maquilero with their creations between 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.730
 which is the android number 8 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.680
 It should be noted that Dr. Flave is a 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.620
 fill character so there's no 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.780
 doubt the origin of the android creation 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.280
 of the dragon spheres in the episode 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.170
 33 of dragon ball 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.880
 master roshi tells krillin 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.880
 about the legend of the spheres of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.740
 dragon according to this the spheres of the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.780
 dragon originally were one 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.150
 sphere that God had granted to 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.550
 men because of the kindness of these but 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.560
 over time they became ambitious and 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.290
 was this the reason for the separation of the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.450
 original seven-part sphere 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.760
 explanation is present only in 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.960
 that chapter of the anime and it's not going to be 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.510
 mentioned 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.850
 the destruction of the planet belli is in 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.770
 episode 20 of dragon ball z kai 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.050
 osama tells goku about how a 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.270
 supposed god that existed on the planet 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.700
 bellita attracted a meteor shower 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.610
 towards the planet punishing the actions 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.790
 malignant sayayin however in 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.680
 chapter 197 of the manga even though 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.540
 radice mentions that supposedly the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.180
 planet had been destroyed by a 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.610
 meteorite is never mentioned anything about 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.290
 of a god what makes this 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.210
 situation is that fell sama was 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.640
 aware of the existence of freezer 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.890
 the sayayin and in general of history 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.050
 of many planets in the galaxy so 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.110
 which is especially strange how it was 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.360
 that the legend of the god originated 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.890
 again a filler episode 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.720
 the true mother planet of the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.450
 sayayin if we take as reference 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.820
 again episode 20 of dragon ball 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.950
 z kai osama relates that there are them to jim and 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.100
 i suffered them jim lived on the same planet 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.440
 however in the special the plan for 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.390
 eradicate the sayayin vegueta relates 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.370
 that the fujin were the inhabitants 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.350
 originals of the planet known as 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.870
 planet planck and that one day the 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.030
 and they came to invade it this gives rise to 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.340
 believe that possibly somewhere 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.590
 of the universe the original planet of the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.050
 There is a gene that still exists although it would be 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.240
 difficult to know its location and if some 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.370
 sayayin of said planet were scattered 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.100
 through space or they stayed inhabiting 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.620
 said planet the transformation of 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.080
 trunks despite the fact that the vast majority 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.060
 we know the dramatic transformation of 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.550
 trunks in super sayayin in the special 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.220
 the warriors of the future goian and trunks 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.200
 this scene is not shown in the manga anymore 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.390
 that since the beginning of this drone c's 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.420
 already has the ability to transform 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.430
 in a super saiyan and possibly this 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.630
 change in the special has been added 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.370
 with purposes of drama the hell 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.530
 despite the hell seen in the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.510
 anime dragon ball z did not appear in the 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.460
 manga until the resurrection of 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.370
 frizer we have witnessed three 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.770
 different versions of this hell 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.230
 of dragon ball z based on the goku 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.390
 Japanese with elements like ogres and 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.670
 the blood pools the hell of 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.530
 dragon ball gt an underground place and 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.020
 gloomy very different from its counterpart 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.270
 of dragon ball z and the hell of the 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.130
 movie the resurrection of frizer that 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.840
 according to this one it turns out to be the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.820
 hell of the earth a place 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.220
 apparently gentle with fairies and 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.500
 stuffed animals parading happily 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.330
 around your cocoon with this 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.820
 affirmation seems to be that each 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.650
 planet owns its own hell and that 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.080
 regardless of race or origin 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.540
 of the deceased being if it is a being 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.660
 evil this one will go to the hell of the planet 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.730
 where chancha tenzing hand died and 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.850
 chaos against special forces 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.900
 hinju to understand why this is a 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.700
 inconsistency 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.210
 we have to analyze two events 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.490
 analogs goku step approximately 130 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.720
 days training with kai osama and being 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.580
 a sayayin still 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.530
 its power to a little over eight thousand 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.660
 units in change 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.270
 let's take there and whose power was not very 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.550
 above the sauber man his stay 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.350
 in the other world along with tenzing hand 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.480
 and chaos until the arrival of the forces 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.640
 specials none happened for a week 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.260
 as then already wide and others 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.150
 they were able to overcome the 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.820
 warriors that almost claim the life of 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.350
 same vegueta and the others the answer 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.560
 it's more complex than all 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.950
 we hope it 's anime stuffing like 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.880
 we were able to analyze the vast majority of 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.770
 inconsistencies in the argument of 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.390
 dragon ball are because of the chapters 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.790
 fill or elements that never 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.950
 were present in the manga 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.900
 which they have created some confusion 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.090
 throughout the history of dragon ball or 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.460
 in some cases great debates for 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.290
 solve mysteries many of which 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.290
 can be clarified by comparing the 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.480
 manga with the anime you know some other 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.460
 inconsistency in the arguments of the 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.680
 dragon ball story 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.630
