00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.810 

you

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.390 

now<00:01:38.820> i'm<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.300> play<00:01:39.600> china<00:01:39.960> glaze<00:01:40.290> bra<00:01:40.680> or

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
now i'm going to play china glaze bra or

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.770 
now i'm going to play china glaze bra or
a<00:01:41.790> bridge<00:01:42.560> for<00:01:43.560> Audrey

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.890 

so<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:52.810> applied<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.680> china<00:01:54.190> glaze<00:01:54.520> on<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.720> nail

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
so I applied the china glaze on the nail

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.460 
so I applied the china glaze on the nail
and<00:01:56.550> it's<00:01:57.550> around<00:01:58.000> two<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.930> half<00:01:59.080> or<00:01:59.290> three

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
and it's around two and a half or three

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.520 
and it's around two and a half or three
coats<00:01:59.680> actually<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:01.120> I<00:02:01.180> could<00:02:01.390> get<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.810> the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
coats actually so I could get and the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.380 
coats actually so I could get and the
reason<00:02:02.650> I<00:02:02.830> did<00:02:03.040> this<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.460> because<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:04.180> nails

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
reason I did this is because the nails

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.110 
reason I did this is because the nails
take<00:02:04.660> white<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.350> it's<00:02:05.740> plastic<00:02:06.400> so<00:02:06.730> that's

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
take white and it's plastic so that's

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.150 
take white and it's plastic so that's
right<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.540> complete<00:02:07.990> coats<00:02:08.320> but<00:02:08.619> on<00:02:08.800> my<00:02:08.950> real

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
right the complete coats but on my real

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.810 
right the complete coats but on my real
nails<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:09.850> only<00:02:10.060> applied<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:10.479> approach<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.610> now

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
nails I only applied to approach so now

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:24.680 
nails I only applied to approach so now
i'm<00:02:13.300> going<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:14.200> play<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:16.050> top

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.110 

so<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:25.720> applied<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.440> top<00:02:26.860> coat

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
so I applied this top coat

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.550 
so I applied this top coat
and<00:02:30.120> they<00:02:30.720> didn't<00:02:30.989> want<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.200> apply<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.440> on

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and they didn't want to apply it on

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.289 
and they didn't want to apply it on
camera<00:02:31.799> just<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.879> guys<00:02:33.120> know

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
if you have long nails you could just

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.290 
if you have long nails you could just
put<00:05:13.890> another<00:05:14.040> one<00:05:14.220> here<00:05:14.460> which<00:05:14.730> I'll<00:05:15.000> be<00:05:15.180> doing

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
put another one here which I'll be doing

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
after that all you do is wait for it to

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.500 
after that all you do is wait for it to
dry<00:05:21.690> really<00:05:22.230> good<00:05:22.470> and<00:05:22.710> I'm<00:05:23.670> going<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.090> apply

but this is how my nails look exactly
like<00:05:36.450> that<00:05:36.770> but<00:05:37.770> let's<00:05:38.010> just<00:05:38.100> change<00:05:38.400> it<00:05:38.610> a<00:05:38.670> bit

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
like that but let's just change it a bit

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:47.760 
like that but let's just change it a bit
so<00:05:39.060> it<00:05:39.120> could<00:05:39.240> be<00:05:39.270> two<00:05:39.600> nails<00:05:40.020> tourism

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.680 

so<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:48.800> decided<00:05:49.250> not<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.550> put<00:05:49.700> another<00:05:50.030> one<00:05:50.540> of
