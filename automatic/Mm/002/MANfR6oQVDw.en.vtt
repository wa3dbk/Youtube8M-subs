your transmitter on and then it'll say
bind<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.990> let<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:27.630> give<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> sec

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
bind just let go and just give it a sec

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.050 
bind just let go and just give it a sec
and<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:31.320> will<00:01:31.470> hear<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> servo<00:01:32.250> pretty<00:01:32.909> much

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and you will hear the servo pretty much

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.440 
and you will hear the servo pretty much
this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:34.280> stabilizing<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> gyro<00:01:36.060> right<00:01:36.299> now

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this is a stabilizing the gyro right now

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.620 
this is a stabilizing the gyro right now
gyro<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:41.420> move<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
gyro so you as you can see move the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:51.020 
gyro so you as you can see move the
swashplate<00:01:43.100> where<00:01:44.100> find<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:49.340> trim<00:01:50.340> down<00:01:50.579> all

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
swashplate where find it trim down all

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
swashplate where find it trim down all
the<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.390> down<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.840> got<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> come<00:01:52.320> down<00:01:52.560> your

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the way down you got to come down your

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.969 
the way down you got to come down your
um<00:01:53.390> gotta<00:01:54.390> trim<00:01:54.689> down<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:54.960> throttle<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.770> not

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
um gotta trim down your throttle if not

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.999 
um gotta trim down your throttle if not
this<00:01:56.790> LED<00:01:57.360> will<00:01:57.509> stay<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> stay<00:01:58.229> red<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
this LED will stay to stay red as you

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.700 
this LED will stay to stay red as you
guys<00:01:59.189> saw<00:01:59.490> now<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.780> green<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.439> know

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
guys saw now that it's green now we know

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.120 
guys saw now that it's green now we know
that<00:02:01.740> our<00:02:02.670> trim<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.210> down<00:02:03.990> enough<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> actually

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that our trim is down enough to actually

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.139 
that our trim is down enough to actually
make<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.360> throttle<00:02:07.170> set<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.119> we

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
make the throttle set so now if we

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.150 
make the throttle set so now if we
throttle

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
throttle

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.040 
throttle
this<00:02:12.160> can<00:02:12.400> see<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.760> now<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.210> matter<00:02:13.510> actually

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
this can see that now it matter actually

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.960 
this can see that now it matter actually
turn<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> green<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.130> started<00:02:15.490> throttling

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
turn a green and it started throttling

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.580 
turn a green and it started throttling
so<00:02:17.490> pretty<00:02:18.490> much<00:02:18.580> now<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:18.940> know<00:02:19.270> it's<00:02:19.530> now<00:02:20.530> you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
so pretty much now you know it's now you

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.100 
so pretty much now you know it's now you
know<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.420> perfectly<00:02:22.420> bind<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.990> your

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
know it's perfectly bind it to your

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.170 
know it's perfectly bind it to your
Disick<00:02:23.590> side<00:02:23.860> now<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.520> need<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.700> trim<00:02:25.150> and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
Disick side now you just need a trim and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.610 
Disick side now you just need a trim and
do<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:26.050> know<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.560> usual<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:27.280> your<00:02:28.260> usual<00:02:29.260> to
