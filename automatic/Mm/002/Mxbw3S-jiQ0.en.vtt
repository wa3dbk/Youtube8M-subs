00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
um now I'm going to move on to the build

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.830 
um now I'm going to move on to the build
alright<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.600> build

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
alright so this is what your build

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.640 
alright so this is what your build
should<00:01:31.170> look<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.380> um<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> early<00:01:34.200> game<00:01:34.409> so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
should look like um in the early game so

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740 
should look like um in the early game so
you're<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:36.090> longsword<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
you're going to get the longsword and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.830 
you're going to get the longsword and
then<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.350> life<00:01:37.530> steal<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.700> after<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.630> get

early game then I'll show you what you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.039 
early game then I'll show you what you
do<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.189> back<00:02:02.479> stage<00:02:03.479> two<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
do have to get it back stage two of the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.770 
do have to get it back stage two of the
build<00:02:04.350> should<00:02:04.590> look<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:06.659> you've

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
build should look like this so you've

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.969 
build should look like this so you've
got<00:02:06.810> your<00:02:06.960> infinity<00:02:07.380> edge<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> phantom

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
got your infinity edge and phantom

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.059 
got your infinity edge and phantom
dancer<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.869> your<00:02:09.869> final<00:02:10.319> bill<00:02:10.500> should<00:02:10.830> look

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
dancer and your final bill should look

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.660 
dancer and your final bill should look
like<00:02:11.099> this

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
like this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.690 
like this
now<00:02:13.410> most<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.530> my<00:02:14.650> games<00:02:14.709> don't<00:02:15.160> allow<00:02:15.430> me<00:02:15.580> to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
now most of my games don't allow me to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.610 
now most of my games don't allow me to
get<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.150> last<00:02:16.599> infinity<00:02:17.140> edge<00:02:17.260> because

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
get to the last infinity edge because

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.160 
get to the last infinity edge because
that<00:02:18.550> right<00:02:18.880> there<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.120> your<00:02:19.209> last<00:02:19.510> item<00:02:19.900> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
that right there is your last item the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.790 
that right there is your last item the
first<00:02:20.380> infinity<00:02:20.739> edge<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:22.540> if<00:02:22.750> they<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:22.959> go

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
first infinity edge but if they do go

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.170 
first infinity edge but if they do go
ahead<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.010> get<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> usually<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:24.849> have<00:02:24.970> the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
ahead and get it usually I have the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.220 
ahead and get it usually I have the
Dorian's<00:02:25.480> blade<00:02:25.720> berserkers<00:02:26.170> Greaves

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230

infinity edge blood third are a phantom

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.870 
infinity edge blood third are a phantom
dancer<00:02:31.569> last<00:02:32.020> whisper<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.760> maybe<00:02:33.760> a

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
dancer last whisper and maybe a

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.430 
dancer last whisper and maybe a
bloodthirster<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:34.690> that's<00:02:34.810> usually<00:02:35.020> my<00:02:35.260> end

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
bloodthirster and that's usually my end

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.380 
bloodthirster and that's usually my end
game<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:36.160> if<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.370> have<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.489> super<00:02:36.940> long<00:02:37.120> game

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
game but if you have a super long game

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.330 
game but if you have a super long game
you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:38.020> finish<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.500> bloodthirster<00:02:39.190> and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
you can finish up that bloodthirster and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.180 
you can finish up that bloodthirster and
get<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.640> final<00:02:39.880> infinity<00:02:40.480> edge<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.950> is

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
get that final infinity edge and that is

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.170 
get that final infinity edge and that is
the<00:02:42.910> final<00:02:43.450> ash<00:02:43.660> build<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:45.190> now<00:02:45.370> we<00:02:45.430> will<00:02:45.850> jump

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.449 
it's all okay as you can see here I see
this<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:11.670> at<00:04:11.910> full<00:04:12.330> health<00:04:12.600> chasing<00:04:13.200> me<00:04:13.459> my

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
this in at full health chasing me my

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.890 
this in at full health chasing me my
play<00:04:14.760> little<00:04:15.030> trick<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:15.420> him<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.660> he<00:04:15.780> gets

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
play little trick on him and he gets

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:32.200 
play little trick on him and he gets
kind<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.410> embarrassed

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.790 

although<00:04:33.210> talent<00:04:33.960> takes<00:04:34.110> me<00:04:34.260> out<00:04:34.380> but<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.590> think

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
although talent takes me out but I think

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.260 
although talent takes me out but I think
it<00:04:34.920> was<00:04:35.010> worth<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.640> juke<00:04:35.880> the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
it was worth it just to juke the

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.120
