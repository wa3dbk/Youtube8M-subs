again<00:00:30.689> was<00:00:30.990> consenting<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:32.040> experiment

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
again was consenting to this experiment

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
again was consenting to this experiment
why<00:00:32.820> they<00:00:33.030> did<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.450> highway<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.079> not<00:00:34.260> in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
why they did it on a highway and not in

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.229 
why they did it on a highway and not in
a<00:00:34.440> parking<00:00:34.800> lot<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.250> sake<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> safety<00:00:35.820> I'm

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a parking lot for the sake of safety I'm

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.920 
a parking lot for the sake of safety I'm
not<00:00:36.840> entirely<00:00:37.170> sure<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.670> aside<00:00:39.270> these

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
not entirely sure but that aside these

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.350 
not entirely sure but that aside these
hackers<00:00:40.350> actually<00:00:41.190> took<00:00:41.430> control<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
hackers actually took control of the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.560 
hackers actually took control of the
cars<00:00:43.020> steering<00:00:43.770> its<00:00:44.250> braking<00:00:44.910> system<00:00:45.329> even

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
cars steering its braking system even

its<00:00:45.690> transmission<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.739> even<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:47.640> than<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
its transmission and even more than that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.260 
its transmission and even more than that
they<00:00:48.719> could<00:00:48.989> wirelessly<00:00:49.710> track<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.789> route<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
they could wirelessly track the route of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.220 
they could wirelessly track the route of
the<00:00:51.539> car<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:52.020> taking<00:00:52.590> via<00:00:53.219> GPS<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.539> how<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> all

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the car was taking via GPS so how is all

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.069 
the car was taking via GPS so how is all
this<00:00:55.260> possible<00:00:55.800> well<00:00:56.730> thanks<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
this possible well thanks to this

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.700 
this possible well thanks to this
merging<00:00:59.010> together<00:00:59.399> of<00:01:00.079> technology<00:01:01.079> with

its IP address specifically its
entertainment<00:01:15.780> system<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.369> similar

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
entertainment system it's really similar

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
entertainment system it's really similar
to<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.299> we've<00:01:18.450> seen<00:01:18.689> recently<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
to what we've seen recently with a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.230 
to what we've seen recently with a
hacker<00:01:20.390> accessing<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.570> plane<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.920> its

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
hacker accessing a plane and all its

controls through an entertainment system

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.480 
controls through an entertainment system
which<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.210> again<00:01:27.659> ridiculous<00:01:28.470> now<00:01:28.950> thankfully

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
which is again ridiculous now thankfully

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.850 
which is again ridiculous now thankfully
these<00:01:30.299> hackers<00:01:30.630> from<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.200> story<00:01:31.439> as<00:01:31.560> well<00:01:31.740> as

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
these hackers from this story as well as

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.219 
these hackers from this story as well as
the<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.159> from<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> plane<00:01:32.790> story<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.869> doing

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the one from the plane story we're doing

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.460 
the one from the plane story we're doing
this<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.850> purposes<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.439> happens

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
this for good purposes but what happens

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.640 
this for good purposes but what happens
when<00:01:38.030> nefarious<00:01:39.030> entities<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.900> people<00:01:40.409> or

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
when nefarious entities like people or

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.859 
when nefarious entities like people or
governments<00:01:41.310> get<00:01:41.909> hold<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.420> technology

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
governments get hold of this technology

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
governments get hold of this technology
it's<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:44.159> great<00:01:44.490> example<00:01:44.759> would<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it's a great example would be the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
it's a great example would be the
michael<00:01:45.780> hastings<00:01:45.990> story<00:01:46.649> again<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.670> not

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
michael hastings story again it's not

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.910 
michael hastings story again it's not
known<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.360> sure<00:01:48.780> whether<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> government<00:01:49.740> or

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
known for sure whether a government or

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.219 
known for sure whether a government or
an<00:01:50.009> individual<00:01:50.490> did<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.420> he<00:01:51.689> was<00:01:51.899> said

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
an individual did that but he was said

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.249 
an individual did that but he was said
to<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.710> driven<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> grandma<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.840> then

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to have driven like a grandma and then

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.990 
to have driven like a grandma and then
all<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> sudden<00:01:55.829> he<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.340> speeding<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> his

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
all the sudden he was speeding and his

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.539 
all the sudden he was speeding and his
car<00:01:57.270> went<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.020> flames<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.680> seems<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.430> bit

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
car went up in flames it seems a bit

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.370 
car went up in flames it seems a bit
suspicious<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.329> me<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.719> something<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
suspicious to me so it's something to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.980 
suspicious to me so it's something to
consider<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:03.030> even<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.479> importantly

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
consider but even more importantly

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.350 
consider but even more importantly
seemingly<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.070> biggest<00:02:05.549> implication<00:02:06.270> in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
seemingly the biggest implication in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.510 
seemingly the biggest implication in
this<00:02:06.509> whole<00:02:06.689> story<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.530> interpret<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
this whole story that I interpret is

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.170 
this whole story that I interpret is
that<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.840> many<00:02:10.050> cars<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.489> drive<00:02:11.520> every
