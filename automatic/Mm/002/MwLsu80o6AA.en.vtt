00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 so my dear welcome on the canal 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.690
 n roll and now it goes with the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.960
 Team of the week forecast continues 11 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.490
 It's not Sunday anymore 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.440
 meanwhile monday but i was yesterday 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.450
 way too tired i am generally very very 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.580
 tired this trip in the valley I casino 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.430
 from the corinthians has a forge 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.740
 and they played to zero 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.000
 I have a player from before 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.730
 bayonet donetsk rakizki or something yes 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 so ukraine has zero 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.399
 played and he has his thing behind 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.899
 well done which won the individual 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.160
 against Poland was but I have 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.739
 So then you know it was only yes 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 So international games are played 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.550
 qualifying games for the wm but the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.170
 friendly games and the u21 count 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.670
 I do not care about it now 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.340
 I know that the friendship game 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.350
 do not count and must from the u21 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.940
 Honestly , it would be too much 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.489
 work these little ones now 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.649
 to locate younger players 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.229
 That's why I clearly take the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.540
 old sacks of the 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.640
 qualifying matches the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.909
 world championship and yes the good olsen 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.860
 made a goal this was the 20 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.869
 I think then have won the 2 1 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.500
 So had secured the victory 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.070
 on the right, I have that from a yes 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.439
 was not a wm game but a league game 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.140
 only a goal in the Brazilian league 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.630
 and a template then made before those 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.170
 I have the home dice games too 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.659
 his 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.470
 at the russian game they have 4 0 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.549
 won 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.320
 the russians and there are several people 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.189
 a gate shot several people in the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.070
 play midfield 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.399
 once there was the collective village he is called 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.649
 I believe then the blues and soul him 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.240
 the left midfielder is force 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.159
 I'm not sure the names 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.500
 honestly Russian names are 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.659
 not the easiest but I have 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.840
 now the glowing head taken because I 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.119
 see it so my dear the requirement 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.500
 or the expectation that a central 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.649
 attacking midfielder a goal 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.780
 shoots is lower than the central one 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.960
 central midfielder because he just 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.630
 is much more offensive and therefore 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.070
 more train to the gate and a higher one 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.600
 chance has now purely 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.130
 mathematically considered or a 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.330
 also have a bit better strategically 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.010
 I bought the glacier because he did 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 The highest requirements are around one 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.870
 shoot and tell him 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.490
 I managed quite another 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.560
 townsend of tottenham 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.290
 he scored a goal and what 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.950
 player of the game in england 14 because 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.630
 I believe that and left then 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.540
 hesekiel lavezzi i find the name 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.250
 he won two goals very cool here 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.850
 shot for argentina 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.030
 we can hope that one of the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:53.810
 very good saved because left 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.830
 players an info then comes in the storm 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.070
 I did robin van persie 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.990
 at holland game 8 2 1 it went off and 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.390
 edin dzekos the double against 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.920
 Liechtenstein is controversial 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.880
 theme of this robin van persie 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.520
 There were many players in the 8-1 victory 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.530
 have done well on it 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.740
 I will immediately go number 1 and 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.390
 then again trutmann the zdf I have 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.290
 what said actually take that 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.420
 I left out 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.630
 I'm very sorry he has a goal and 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.090
 a template makes 18 2 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.670
 1-win and therefore therefore also 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.570
 zdm was I have the unpacked robin 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.610
 van persie 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.040
 I always used to say patrick 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.110
 if you still remember one is 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.200
 safe thing has definitely come 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:48.170
 89 89 89 has the emigrant 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.880
 kompa dress that is very much there 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.010
 the requirements very very high but am 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.100
 3 so a hat trick 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.250
 he would have to suffice jacko as I said 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.810
 however, with two goals, he is 583 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.160
 perfectly adequate I am 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.320
 pretty sure on this tv 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.880
 I have it very difficult 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.000
 I have to play international games 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.410
 to say because playing at league that is 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.630
 quite clearly there are also certain 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.240
 I miss the word, I just have it 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.720
 in a sentence the bbl if someone there 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.450
 hat trick makes him come as someone 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.120
 in the swiss league or source 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.380
 that is, it is rated the better 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.540
 are ranked higher 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.000
 Here, on the other hand, it is difficult to say 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.760
 is a boston against liechtenstein match 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.560
 something exciting something important though 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.540
 Well, let's go to the bank about Michael 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.930
 long from the grashoppers zurich has for 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.480
 Swiss victory goal won in 2010 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.060
 kill village has four gates against shell 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.010
 ground shot 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.570
 That's four gates should be yes 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.470
 which is why I only play in the bronze game 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.810
 do not think that anyone 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.020
 will be interested and manni of the 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.990
 vancouver did a hat trick and 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.850
 should therefore also appear then 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.060
 you see here here is a place 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.830
 free at the zdf place here in the startelf 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.720
 I deliberately released that because 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.330
 I want to ask you what you think I am 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.080
 have three options yes the sentimental 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.550
 the nostalgic option del piero 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.890
 he made a dream campfire 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.380
 I was the player of the game 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.150
 a bit of it but that's just it 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.160
 a thing that I respect 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.990
 hold older player is then we have 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.760
 nicklas bbttner with two goals he was 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.220
 striker's ideas are against italy 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.620
 played 2 to 2 it went out 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.650
 that means he's undecided 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.160
 secured or enabled and so to speak and 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.820
 Last but not least, Alex is his name 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.770
 real to the tongue twister alexis sanchez 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.710
 He also did the double pack 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.070
 the drew alexis on 3 3 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.900
 sanchez should come last week 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.300
 both me and many others 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.520
 from which I got the opinion 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.680
 have no idea why come closer 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.900
 Honestly, I do not know who 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.060
 devil because in it dedicated to closer to 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.910
 but bring good but make it is 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.260
 just so happen but accordingly 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.420
 I would assume that now 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.320
 maybe okay last week say something 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.030
 can come differently 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.130
 this week was almost the same 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.170
 done then we just bring it 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.550
 this week because the competition 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.460
 also the same but now times 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.960
 better, therefore, I would sanchez 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.340
 reintun write me the comments if 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.990
 you would insert there 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.560
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.560
 next time
