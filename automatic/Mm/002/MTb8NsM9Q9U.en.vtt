00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.359
 a dose 2010 does not augur an interface 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.010
 graphically slightly reworked by 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.139
 compared to mt 4 that we also find 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
 in windows put me on the back of this 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.200
 last windows 2000 is renowned for its 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.030
 stability whether with 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 professional or server versions 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.900
 windows 2000 finds a place of choice 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.060
 in business through the integration of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.039
 the active directory of the server 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.269
 integrated web or terminal server that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.550
 allowed to log in to 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.990
 distance over the system handles 1 gigabyte 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.880
 of RAM works with 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.949
 multiple processors and integrates for the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.540
 first time internet explorer 5 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.340
 it will finally be necessary to wait until 2001 for 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.559
 that windows xp plays us his little 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.690
 music is unquestionably part 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.489
 most microsoft systems 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 successful and most valued based on 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.149
 the windows 2000 kernel and finally 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.340
 totally rid of the old ms 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.969
 back windows xp is also famous for its 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.010
 stability 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.690
 but xp also marks a turning point on the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 finished graphical plane the unique tones 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.079
 austere gray graphical interface reviewed 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.550
 in depth adds a touch of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.500
 default colors the start button 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.539
 towards is attached to a taskbar of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.979
 blue color if needed a system of 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.510
 advanced customization allows even 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.340
 to use themes of your choice 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 then web side in addition to internet 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.549
 explore 6 at a time when messaging 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.380
 instant has the wind in its sails 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.090
 microsoft decides of interest windows 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.770
 messenger and to stem the wave of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.479
 hacking windows xp also mark 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.310
 the arrival of the famous activation system 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 microsoft that will be found on 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.920
 all future versions of windows 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.420
 until our days 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.250
 the first service pack of the oes 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.869
 will bring support for usb 2 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.579
 for its part the service pack 2 will fill 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.290
 the many security vulnerabilities of xp 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.210
 thanks to a redesign of a good part 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.619
 of the bone indeed after installation the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.360
 control panel integrates a 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.950
 security center that gives access to a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.630
 parent can improve accompanied by a 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.909
 module that checks for the presence of a 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.460
 antivirus update and we have this time 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.200
 windows vista released in January 2006 on 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.640
 system is quickly under fire 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 much heavier criticism than 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
 windows xp the system requires a 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 more muscular config to that is added from 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.590
 multiple youthful defects in part 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.670
 due to a precipitous slow exit from 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.500
 boot file copies 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.450
 endless indexing of files 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.159
 spinning the hard drives 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.960
 ergonomics we will remember the famous and 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.460
 binding security had enough that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.719
 multiplied the dialogs for 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.640
 agree during the installation 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.660
 of software for example but the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.640
 different vista problems have 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.110
 overshadowed his many qualities 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.940
 the system introduces a new kernel 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.069
 which will later serve as a base for windows 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.080
 7 and windows 8 for the first time the 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.849
 indexing engine and integrated in the heart 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.319
 of the system to launch a program 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.970
 find a file or get your hands on 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.319
 a parameter just tap a 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.970
 string in the menu 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.650
 visually start the interface 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.060
 aero manages window transparency 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.620
 and relies for that on the map 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.819
 graph although many all his 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.470
 strengths will not be enough to 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.209
 straighten the bar for the general public 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.069
 of his later microsoft will correct the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.660
 most defects with a service pack 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.180
 but it was very late will not improve 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.280
 not really the reputation of vista and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.730
 its late 2009 windows 7 ensures the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.829
 reports 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.110
 microsoft is based on the architecture of 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.400
 vista and refines the interface the themes 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.560
 make their appearance rather their 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.060
 reappearance and ergonomics side aero snap 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.739
 allows to quickly put two 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.569
 windows side by side and it's also 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.799
 since windows 7 we get an overview 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.720
 open tabs in the browser 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.160
 or that we can follow the evolution of a 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.230
 download or a copy of 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.850
 ergonomics side files the system gives 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.139
 the ability to pin programs 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.459
 or documents in the taskbar 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.380
 which gains in thickness 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.420
 taking over the concept of the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 famous apple dock lighter and better 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.829
 finished that vista windows 7 reconciles 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.750
 microsoft with its users and its 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.639
 batteries for the end of the world in 2012 that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.170
 landed windows 8 microsoft is at the 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.670
 hangs with touch pads 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.799
 as this segment grows in power 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.269
 but the firm counter attack trying 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.280
 to unite the best of both worlds with 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.079
 his new system it is enticing 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.889
 on paper but microsoft decides to 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.299
 place in force 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.620
 whatever the modern device where he 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.510
 will be displayed in full screen after 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.910
 startup including on computers 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.989
 desktop without touch screen even 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.700
 turning it off will require 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.349
 imperatively go through the tile box 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.790
 to launch programs or search 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.500
 files and yes it's that the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 sacrosanct the start menu disappears 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.190
 to make subway the central point of 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.840
 the ergonomics of the system and despite this 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.310
 forcing accompanied by the signature of 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.079
 some checks to the developers the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.760
 apple store bigger hurts to expand 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.069
 in application later microsoft 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.660
 will put some water in his wine with 8 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.950
 points or customs building but the 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.450
 harm is done to the general public and 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.099
 some windows 8 experts 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.190
 extends the list of windows versions 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.780
 disappointing 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.400
 and yet as in the days of vista 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.440
 qualities are also at the rendezvous 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.360
 faster startup time with fast 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.340
 boot improved copy window system 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.170
 update or restore pc

 automatic backup ribbon in 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.230
 the task manager explorer 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.210
 review montage and prints say high and 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.130
 I'll go through all the ingredients of 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.650
 successes are there except the essential one 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.690
 true hybrid ergonomics adapted to 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.300
 universe tablets and stops be the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.640
 promise of windows 10 and precisely on 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.410
 move on to this new bone scheduled for 2015 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.030
 this new version of windows promises 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.590
 two ergonomics distinguish to fit 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.870
 for tactile use or use 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.820
 of office and of course on windows 10 mark 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.350
 also the return of the start menu under the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.970
 fire microsoft critics is doing 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.320
 back and that we will not complain and 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.060
 like happiness does not come alone 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.440
 will also have virtual office and 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.150
 a task manager reviewed and 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.530
 corrected which will make the most of the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.360
 screen surface to display a 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.720
 overview of windows and applications 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.720
