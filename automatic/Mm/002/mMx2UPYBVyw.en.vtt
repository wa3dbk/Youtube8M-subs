00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.590
 which is quite old, it is not accidental 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.789
 connection what do I have from the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.789

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.840

 I'll have something back tomorrow 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.430
 unlocked by a 50,000 and then 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.310
 I raced off I 'll be right 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.630
 freak out 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.920
 I do not have any chance of lead 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.750
 then I can also try a few games 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.070
 and my chair is down here right now 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.380
 of course that makes it bock now 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.009
 my chair 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:12.120
 I am not always right here 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:14.069
 lower cognac would actually be 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.420
 I had one today today 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:23.069
 had thought over the subject and I will 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.360
 also cut again and showed 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.190
 I considered myself I make even a 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.660
 small comments about referats knows 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.930
 yes everyone i am somehow i have to 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.190
 say noticed notes prefer sitting here 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.170
 you might notice it here now 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.510
 Nothing but I'm always awesome 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.600
 Excited in front of speakers and I'm real 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.910
 i hate what i am i am trying 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.590
 delay as long as possible 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.700
 maybe you know the one or the other 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.549
 others then that will be familiar 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.600
 Shit comes back here we come from 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.700
 and I'm really scared 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.720
 Before that you always looked what 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.700
 you can do it a bit 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.859
 excite excitement 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.239
 no no no no and especially at 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.890
 I 've written a seminar with you 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.720
 had and then had the seminar 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.859
 make presentation was really right 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.859
 really excited 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.540
 no idea it was just halfway 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.040
 hour preparation 20 minutes referat man 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.690
 makes herself worried about the mega 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.390
 if the stress of growth 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.040
 which is not what if you think something 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.050
 is when the others laugh or something 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.060
 but thinks in the end it is something 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.860
 should they laugh then please what is there 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.989
 because it's everyone's laugh there 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.849
 just as excited because in the abstract and 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.590
 therefore, no idea can be the 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.450
 actually not bad bank 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.040
 the most important thing is and you want it 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.920
 not believe me is mine 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.200
 opinion is the preparation 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.360
 you know where you are doing referate where 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.470
 you now actually has no idea 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.450
 Might say mist it is one 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.849
 shit unimportant abstract where you romans 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.590
 concentrate where you really just bare 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.170
 will repair a bit of his lot 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.190
 gets a theme and cuts practically 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.599
 everybody gets a little bit informed and 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.819
 But then he has the facts down 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.500
 that is really good if 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.810
 you really dominated the topic and 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.849
 we just have to try that you 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.530
 a little interest in the topic 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.000
 finds and it is not that hard 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.440
 because you just believe a bit 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.940
 we have to read it here 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.430
 always a bit of what probably not ran 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.200
 So you can be interested and then it works 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.479
 much easier and then it is easy 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.520
 quite quite important that you do this 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:35.110
 referat two times two passes three times 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.650
 simply from the game does not have to be of the 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.780
 mirrors are just a bit 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.030
 store down and that you the die 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.580
 the other students also involved 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.780
 It always gets really good and if you are 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.150
 then you have a bit luck 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.070
 already much better feeling in the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.780
 stomach had a structure in it if you 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.979
 the lecture and then you know okay 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.729
 Now I want to be at the job now 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.110
 I'm at the job 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:01.300
 and then it's all important 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.289
 easier off and who is her now 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.090
 last time noticed 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.349
 that is really easier and then 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.280
 I am you can believe me because I have 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.510
 really scared 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.830
 l have always been lately 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.210
 So it motivates me a bit 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.039
 i like to think i'm babbling here like this 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.669
 many people in youtube so i used to 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.080
 it was more 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.300
 I thought you now simply load times 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.789
 at the referenzen findings from or 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.410
 it runs a few people you think you notice 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.440
 me so blatantly at when I make abstracts 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.570
 but actually quite cool and im 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.450
 in the middle 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.490
 no i go into this game too much 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.790
 I shit, I'm the third one 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.560
 So yes one last tip 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.730
 afterwards if you have been with me since and 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.690
 It's not a tip if you're in the middle of it 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.430
 then it's really then can you 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.930
 totally relaxed be just the people 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.630
 a little bit of a picture does a bit 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.330
 humorous brings here and there times 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.410
 again a cheeky saying but 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.470
 Actually, that's really preparation 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.120
 most important at his presentation and you 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.530
 Will remember if you do that then 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.530
 good could and dominates the topic 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.140
 makes even the middle of it so fun to 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.000
 comes the next I referat I 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.350

 then we all advise each other 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.440
 Everyone would have to learn from each other and 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.440
 Now I'm out skin in
