00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
what are some of the difference between

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.200 
what are some of the difference between
this<00:00:54.090> game<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.449> its<00:00:54.870> predecessor<00:00:55.440> um<00:00:56.430> well<00:00:57.120> we

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this game and its predecessor um well we

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.340 
this game and its predecessor um well we
got<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> obvious<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
got the obvious which is you know the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.990 
got the obvious which is you know the
technical<00:00:58.739> differences<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.489> push<00:00:59.789> things

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
technical differences so we push things

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.340 
technical differences so we push things
forward<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.329> terms<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.629> graphics<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
forward in terms of graphics and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.900 
forward in terms of graphics and
mechanics<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.340> everything<00:01:02.550> else<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:02.820> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
mechanics and everything else all of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
mechanics and everything else all of
that<00:01:03.000> looks<00:01:03.210> looks<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.899> feels<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.439> better

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that looks looks and feels a lot better

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.280 
that looks looks and feels a lot better
but<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.270> shogun<00:01:06.659> 2<00:01:06.750> though<00:01:07.170> we

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
but I think for for shogun 2 though we

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.109 
but I think for for shogun 2 though we
got<00:01:07.409> maybe<00:01:07.799> two<00:01:08.070> principal<00:01:08.580> big<00:01:08.700> differences

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
got maybe two principal big differences

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.929 
got maybe two principal big differences
one<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.960> about<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.710> immersion<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.460> kind

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
one is about the the immersion and kind

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.520 
one is about the the immersion and kind
of<00:01:11.970> character<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> game<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.380> want

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
of character of the game we really want

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.870 
of character of the game we really want
to<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.650> back<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> time<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.400> people<00:01:14.670> really

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
to get back to a time when people really

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
to get back to a time when people really
kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> invest<00:01:15.479> emotionally<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> game

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
kind of invest emotionally in the game

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
kind of invest emotionally in the game
you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.790> an<00:01:18.210> empire<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you know that you have an empire that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.969 
you know that you have an empire that
you<00:01:18.720> care<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.409> characters<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you care about you have characters the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
you care about you have characters the
arrays<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.790> we've<00:01:20.909> introduced<00:01:21.270> an<00:01:21.390> RPG<00:01:21.869> system

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
arrays so we've introduced an RPG system

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
arrays so we've introduced an RPG system
to<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> character<00:01:23.159> campaign<00:01:23.490> map<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> help

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to the character campaign map to help

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.310 
to the character campaign map to help
their<00:01:24.030> happen<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.720> really<00:01:25.110> feel<00:01:25.290> like

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
their happen so you really feel like

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
their happen so you really feel like
you're<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.860> agents<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> yours<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.790> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you're your agents of yours and you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.160 
you're your agents of yours and you
develop<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.299> over<00:01:27.479> time<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> you're<00:01:27.990> kind

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
develop them over time and you're kind

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.969 
develop them over time and you're kind
of<00:01:28.229> commits<00:01:28.500> them<00:01:28.619> they're<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.860> just

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
of commits them they're not just

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.060 
of commits them they're not just
expendable<00:01:29.880> nobody's<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.540> most

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
expendable nobody's on the most

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.160 
expendable nobody's on the most
and<00:01:32.000> then<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.360> other<00:01:32.390> thing<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:32.750> course<00:01:32.810> is

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
and then the other thing of course is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.620 
and then the other thing of course is
we've<00:01:34.100> added<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.370> huge<00:01:34.850> kind<00:01:35.150> of<00:01:35.210> multiplayer

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
we've added a huge kind of multiplayer

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.969 
we've added a huge kind of multiplayer
compounding<00:01:36.080> this<00:01:36.170> time<00:01:36.380> around<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.860> it's

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
compounding this time around and it's

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.580 
compounding this time around and it's
it's<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:37.700> pretty<00:01:38.060> massive<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:39.380> kind<00:01:39.560> of

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
it's it's pretty massive so you kind of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.260 
it's it's pretty massive so you kind of
have<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.740> permanent<00:01:40.190> online<00:01:40.460> presence<00:01:41.090> as<00:01:41.180> an

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
have a permanent online presence as an
