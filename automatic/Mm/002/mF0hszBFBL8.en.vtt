it's a nice balance on the spoke we get

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.480 
it's a nice balance on the spoke we get
33<00:00:25.710> knots<00:00:25.859> out<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
33 knots out of it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.169 
33 knots out of it

of watersports it's a perfect balance on

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.940 
of watersports it's a perfect balance on
the<00:00:32.369> spider<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:36.300> we've<00:00:36.510> got<00:00:36.720> a<00:00:36.950> bait

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the spider so here we've got a bait

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
the spider so here we've got a bait
station<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.910> cut<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.180> three<00:00:39.360> rods<00:00:39.800> put

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
station we can cut out three rods put

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.740 
station we can cut out three rods put
our<00:00:40.950> knives<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.100> also<00:00:44.310> nuts<00:00:44.700> out

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.070 

which<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> quite<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> new<00:00:49.410> feature<00:00:49.650> that<00:00:52.490> it

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
which is quite a new feature that it

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.170 
which is quite a new feature that it
works<00:00:55.080> very<00:00:55.440> well<00:00:55.590> we've<00:00:56.160> got<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> nice<00:00:56.790> height

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
works very well we've got a nice height

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.120 
works very well we've got a nice height
as<00:00:57.390> well<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:58.020> cutting<00:00:58.650> your<00:00:58.740> bait<00:00:58.950> and

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
as well for cutting your bait and

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.410 
as well for cutting your bait and
fitting<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.970> here<00:01:03.769> to<00:01:04.769> tow<00:01:05.580> tanks<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
fitting just here to tow tanks here and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.849 
fitting just here to tow tanks here and
they<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.250> tied<00:01:09.149> up<00:01:09.359> and<00:01:09.600> by<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.439> stripe

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
they they get tied up and by this stripe

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.590 
they they get tied up and by this stripe
here<00:01:11.039> so<00:01:11.460> they're<00:01:11.939> completely<00:01:12.090> out<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.539> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
here so they're completely out of the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.880 
here so they're completely out of the
road<00:01:12.749> we're<00:01:12.960> running<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> fuel<00:01:13.469> filter<00:01:13.649> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
road we're running a fuel filter that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.319 
road we're running a fuel filter that
would<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.609> the<00:01:14.700> outboard<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.179> our

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
would be when the outboard and our

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.620 
would be when the outboard and our
batteries<00:01:15.749> are<00:01:15.869> stacked<00:01:16.109> on<00:01:16.229> under<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:17.630> but

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
batteries are stacked on under there but

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.880 
batteries are stacked on under there but
the<00:01:18.780> 4.85

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the 4.85

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.419 
the 4.85
the<00:01:20.880> ballast<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.749> is<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.499> hundred<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
the ballast on this is a hundred and

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.779 
the ballast on this is a hundred and
eighty<00:01:23.549> liters<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.259> equivalent<00:01:25.679> of<00:01:25.859> two

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
eighty liters so it's equivalent of two

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.020 
eighty liters so it's equivalent of two
good-sized<00:01:27.210> people<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.280> what<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.490> does<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
good-sized people and what that does is

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.059 
good-sized people and what that does is
at<00:01:30.270> rest<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.869> gives<00:01:31.020> us<00:01:31.170> nice<00:01:31.380> stability<00:01:31.920> at

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
at rest it gives us nice stability at

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.789 
at rest it gives us nice stability at
rest<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.490> when<00:01:32.609> we<00:01:32.759> stop<00:01:32.999> the<00:01:33.030> fish<00:01:33.799> underway

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
rest so when we stop the fish underway

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.919 
rest so when we stop the fish underway
what<00:01:35.039> we<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.579> lock<00:01:35.819> that<00:01:36.060> water<00:01:36.299> end<00:01:36.630> so

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
what we can do is lock that water end so

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.989 
what we can do is lock that water end so
it's<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.139> same<00:01:39.289> leader<00:01:40.289> here<00:01:40.789> and<00:01:41.789> that's

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
it's the same leader here and that's

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.819 
it's the same leader here and that's
locked<00:01:42.240> Duncan<00:01:42.719> yep<00:01:43.289> that's<00:01:43.469> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> give

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
locked Duncan yep that's going to give

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.090 
locked Duncan yep that's going to give
us<00:01:43.859> a<00:01:44.039> lot<00:01:44.159> bit<00:01:44.429> of<00:01:44.520> punch<00:01:44.789> from<00:01:45.090> sea<00:01:45.359> so<00:01:46.100> what

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
us a lot bit of punch from sea so what

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.779 
us a lot bit of punch from sea so what
happens<00:01:47.429> is<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.780> nose<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:50.130> heavier<00:01:50.609> so

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
happens is the the nose is is heavier so

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.300 
happens is the the nose is is heavier so
we've<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.240> more<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:52.139> more<00:01:52.619> weight<00:01:52.859> forward

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
we've got more more more weight forward

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.949 
we've got more more more weight forward
and<00:01:53.459> we<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.209> we're<00:01:54.329> getting<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.659> lot<00:01:54.780> better

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
and we get it we're getting a lot better

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.770 
and we get it we're getting a lot better
ride<00:01:55.289> through<00:01:55.709> the<00:01:55.829> seat<00:01:56.450> it's<00:01:57.450> gonna<00:01:57.539> take

up here we've got a rocket launcher
which<00:02:10.979> again<00:02:11.160> was<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.490> new<00:02:11.750> feature<00:02:12.750> last<00:02:13.110> year

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
which again was a new feature last year

which again was a new feature last year
this<00:02:14.760> illness<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.540> extra<00:02:15.750> five<00:02:15.959> rods<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.560> also

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
this illness and extra five rods it also

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.070 
this illness and extra five rods it also
gives<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.340> nice<00:02:17.490> place<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.910> put<00:02:17.940> our<00:02:18.209> our<00:02:18.480> anchor

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
gives a nice place to put our our anchor

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.970 
gives a nice place to put our our anchor
