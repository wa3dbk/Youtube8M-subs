here see just lift it off and eat it and
that<00:01:47.369> pops<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.880> off<00:01:48.229> there<00:01:49.229> you'll<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.860> able

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that pops right off there you'll be able

that pops right off there you'll be able
to<00:01:50.130> clean<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> off<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.869> forth<00:01:52.170> too<00:01:52.409> if

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
to clean that off and so forth too if

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.300 
to clean that off and so forth too if
it's<00:01:52.950> dirty<00:01:53.189> set<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.299> aside<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.320> Jays

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it's dirty set that aside so Jays

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.830 
it's dirty set that aside so Jays
appliance<00:01:56.909> has<00:01:57.090> his<00:01:57.299> fancy<00:01:57.719> tools<00:01:57.960> about<00:01:58.259> 180

$785<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.670> cool<00:02:02.939> looking<00:02:03.329> tool

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
$785 that is really cool looking tool

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.429 
$785 that is really cool looking tool
real<00:02:03.990> heavy<00:02:04.759> but<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.909> expensive<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> want

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
real heavy but it's expensive so I want

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.740 
real heavy but it's expensive so I want
to<00:02:07.500> show<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.950> there's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> there's<00:02:08.670> a

to show you that there's a there's a

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.420 
to show you that there's a there's a
cheaper<00:02:09.750> way<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.220> probably

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
cheaper way to do this and you probably

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.040 
cheaper way to do this and you probably
have<00:02:11.700> everything<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.360> need<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:12.720> garage

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
have everything you need in your garage

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.000 
have everything you need in your garage
to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.270 
to
so<00:02:14.700> now<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.750> got<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.260> cap<00:02:16.530> off<00:02:16.799> one<00:02:17.250> of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
so now that we got the cap off one of

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.559 
so now that we got the cap off one of
those<00:02:17.430> we<00:02:17.609> want<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.819> take<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.120> piece<00:02:18.390> off

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
those we want to take this piece off

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.360 
those we want to take this piece off
them<00:02:18.689> rather<00:02:18.870> than<00:02:19.049> have<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.379> see<00:02:19.560> me<00:02:19.709> unscrew

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
them rather than have you see me unscrew

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.800 
them rather than have you see me unscrew
all<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.670> these<00:02:20.790> I've<00:02:21.030> taken<00:02:21.269> them<00:02:21.480> all<00:02:21.599> out

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
all of these I've taken them all out

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.690 
all of these I've taken them all out
just<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.560> save<00:02:22.769> time<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:23.219> I've<00:02:23.310> taken<00:02:23.489> all

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
just to save time so I've taken all

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.869 
just to save time so I've taken all
those<00:02:23.879> screws<00:02:24.150> out<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:25.430> then<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.579> little

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
those screws out and then this little

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.349 
those screws out and then this little
piece<00:02:27.599> here<00:02:27.629> we're<00:02:28.379> going<00:02:28.469> to<00:02:28.560> remove<00:02:28.829> that

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
piece here we're going to remove that

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:34.970 
piece here we're going to remove that
okay<00:02:32.090> set<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.299> aside<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.900> then<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.829> have

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
okay set that aside and then we have

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.410 
okay set that aside and then we have
this<00:02:35.099> little<00:02:35.280> piece<00:02:35.549> here<00:02:35.790> I'm<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.389> to

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
this little piece here I'm just going to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.780 
this little piece here I'm just going to
pull<00:02:36.689> that<00:02:36.810> off

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
pull that off

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.699 
pull that off
okay<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.060> got<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.209> little<00:02:39.510> wash<00:02:40.379> your<00:02:40.590> hair

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
okay it's got a little wash your hair

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.929 
okay it's got a little wash your hair
you<00:02:40.799> want<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.010> leave<00:02:41.129> that<00:02:41.310> there<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:41.760> just

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
you want to leave that there so just

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.500 
you want to leave that there so just
turn<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.239> upside<00:02:42.420> down<00:02:42.859> like<00:02:43.859> that<00:02:44.359> okay

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
turn that upside down like that okay

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.530 
turn that upside down like that okay
and<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:46.290> now<00:02:46.439> what<00:02:46.680> we<00:02:46.799> want<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.189> is<00:02:47.549> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and so now what we want to do is you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.319 
and so now what we want to do is you
don't<00:02:48.689> want<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:48.989> try<00:02:49.169> to<00:02:49.230> pull<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:49.829> up<00:02:50.489> okay

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
don't want to try to pull this up okay

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.569 
don't want to try to pull this up okay
it's<00:02:51.900> extremely<00:02:52.829> difficult<00:02:53.010> you'll<00:02:53.370> hurt

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
it's extremely difficult you'll hurt

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.220 
it's extremely difficult you'll hurt
your<00:02:53.790> back<00:02:53.939> trying<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.359> do<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.659> so<00:02:54.840> that's<00:02:54.989> why

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
your back trying to do it so that's why

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.369 
your back trying to do it so that's why
Jays<00:02:55.590> tool<00:02:56.209> is<00:02:57.209> very<00:02:57.419> instrumental<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.139> what

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
Jays tool is very instrumental in what

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.959 
Jays tool is very instrumental in what
it<00:02:58.500> does<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:58.980> what<00:02:59.129> we<00:02:59.310> figured<00:02:59.549> out<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.939> just

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
it does but what we figured out is just

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.080 
it does but what we figured out is just
it's<00:03:00.810> really<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.200> physics<00:03:01.709> problem<00:03:01.980> okay<00:03:02.849> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
it's really a physics problem okay and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.170 
it's really a physics problem okay and
it's<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.510> physics<00:03:03.870> solution<00:03:04.379> so<00:03:04.620> he's<00:03:04.769> using

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
it's a physics solution so he's using

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.750 
it's a physics solution so he's using
leverage<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.719> pull<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.079> tub<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.530> by<00:03:07.889> keeping

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
leverage to pull the tub up by keeping

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.220 
leverage to pull the tub up by keeping
the<00:03:08.879> spindle<00:03:09.299> down<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.689> I'll<00:03:09.780> show<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.079> what

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
the spindle down and I'll show you what

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.000 
the spindle down and I'll show you what
I<00:03:10.260> mean<00:03:10.439> by<00:03:10.500> that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
I mean by that

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.179 
I mean by that
so<00:03:11.700> what<00:03:11.909> we<00:03:12.000> did<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.329> we<00:03:12.359> simply<00:03:13.049> did<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.530> we

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
so what we did is we simply did this we

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.220 
so what we did is we simply did this we
take<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.609> little<00:03:15.090> jack<00:03:15.419> this<00:03:15.750> comes<00:03:16.019> out<00:03:16.109> of

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
take this little jack this comes out of

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.500 
take this little jack this comes out of
my<00:03:16.319> daughter's<00:03:16.709> little<00:03:16.950> Protege<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.299> get

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
my daughter's little Protege you can get

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.479 
my daughter's little Protege you can get
any<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.049> these<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.859> probably<00:03:20.159> have<00:03:20.340> them

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
any one of these you probably have them

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.369 
any one of these you probably have them
in<00:03:20.609> your<00:03:20.699> car<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.449> you've<00:03:21.599> got<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> small<00:03:22.019> car<00:03:22.290> if

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
in your car if you've got a small car if

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.409 
in your car if you've got a small car if
not<00:03:22.620> go<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:22.979> neighbor<00:03:23.220> they<00:03:23.760> probably<00:03:24.060> have

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
not go to a neighbor they probably have

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.689 
not go to a neighbor they probably have
it<00:03:24.629> okay<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.069> what<00:03:26.220> we<00:03:26.310> did<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.549> we're<00:03:26.669> just

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
it okay and so what we did is we're just

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.159 
it okay and so what we did is we're just
going<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:26.970> set<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.389> top<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.750> there<00:03:27.989> like

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
going to set that on top of there like

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.960 
going to set that on top of there like
that<00:03:28.939> okay<00:03:29.939> and<00:03:31.099> then<00:03:32.099> I<00:03:32.129> have<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.669> I<00:03:32.879> think

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
that okay and then I have this I think

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
inches across okay so we cut that the

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.599 
inches across okay so we cut that the
saw<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:42.689> a<00:03:42.810> 2x4<00:03:43.439> then<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.340> we're<00:03:44.459> going<00:03:44.579> to

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609
