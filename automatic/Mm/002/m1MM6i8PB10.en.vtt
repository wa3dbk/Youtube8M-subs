00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 Here I want to show the kiwi 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.209
 I planted 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.030
 last year 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.010
 and nothing now 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.150
 We are in the month of May and they are already starting 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.860
 to leave the flowers and well it seems that 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.860
 this year maybe there are kiwis 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.680
 this is the kill as you see I put some 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.490
 sticks and the same are scratching 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.290
 they are scratching themselves to other changes 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.290
 and always thrown up 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.400
 this is the kiwi kills 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.280
 that goes up from below 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.840
 the one that was there is a very grateful plant 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.580
 that easily grows the only thing that 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.780
 need is a place where 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.810
 a chain a stick to go up 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.350
 and a little bit of 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.700
 and treat it with a little water and in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.420
 he the plant grows alone and I here 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.420
 I put a chain 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:45.220
 here in the chain that comes from below 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.830
 but the gentleman goes up the chain and and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 come here 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.920
 the balcony here the kiwi that when 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.390
 there was the way you can remember a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.020
 little the root and here we the buds 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.719
 question addressed looking for its lines 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 to find your line we will help you 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.930
 as follows no 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.930
 we take the tip 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.150
 and I have here is not for two posts 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.359
 let's say that this is because it has 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.359
 what 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.460
 and already he will go looking 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.290
 the way to go taking shape towards this 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.910
 side 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.530
 here they come and they are already studying 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.550
 strong as we already studied the double 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.470
 here is already trunk and what I did is that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.290
 the bush that rises from here of the earth 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:49.640
 is soon directly on earth 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.640
 with ji and I put the chain to this one 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.599
 chain 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.620
 and he has gone braiding is gone 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.599
 braiding and already what's here is trunk 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.230
 because it is a chain but if it were another 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:06.190
 the same thing was split but then the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.090
 chain goes up goes up rises 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.090
 to the top 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.450
 and nothing and you can get it 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.980
 very nice effects and with the kiwi is 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.220
 like a bar you can practically 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:24.250
 serve to replace sticks to cover 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.370
 the car when it does only 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.380
 the truth that grows very fast and gives 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.950
 Very tasty kiwis 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.970
 besides the kiwi is a good source of 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.720
 food that carries a lot of vitamin c and is 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.720
 very healthy 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.180
 Y 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.730
 and
