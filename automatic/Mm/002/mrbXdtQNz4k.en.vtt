00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.989
 and we are with him to make a list of 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.680
 The main novelties that this 

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:19.840
 terminal 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.090
 to replace galaxy that box that is 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.210
 the previous telephone that the signature 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.990
 Korean had as flagship 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.430
 main differences that we found 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.050
 outside an estuary have deep 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.220
 but it practically does not affect the size 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.410
 which is really what we want 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.559
 Compare that's a little higher 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.020
 of s 5 but nevertheless we win in 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.300
 thickness we gain because it is thinner 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.309
 samsung galaxy s 5 and as you can see 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.720
 here higher in width are 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.510
 practically the same we're going to put that 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.960
 4 ahead a little bit wider 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.239
 galaxy of 5 and you can see it here because 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.149
 Is this mainly by things 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.579
 one side we have a 5.1 screen 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.399
 inches with which we grow a little bit 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.930
 the galaxy s 4 but it is also a 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.750
 of the great novelties that this 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.790
 Samsung Galaxy S 5 is that it is resistant 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 To the water to be resistant to water there 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.790
 that create a watertight compartment what 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.200
 that makes the terminal 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.030
 slightly in size you do not see that it is not 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 a lot of fact we can buy it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.140
 easily compare here and that is that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.550
 profiles are still very tight today 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.170
 I want to attract only a little bit bigger 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.880
 of what we have got used to samsung 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.320
 that are usually very small but it is 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 because of that to that compartment 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.030
 tight to achieve resistance to 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.010
 water make the phone think that a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.650
 little in size yet we get 5 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.960
 point in inches in a very fair size 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.740
 in the hand fits perfectly is handled 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.720
 very very good 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.950
 we come to all the buttons without any 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.690
 type of problem we are on that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.970
 we left a very small hand but maybe 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.130
 we must know what we are facing 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.890
 when we are with a 5.1 phone 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.770
 inches is the samsung galaxy s 5 account 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.390
 with a qualcomm snapdragon processor 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.970
 801 this is an evolutionary step regarding 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.009
 its predecessor I explain a little 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.940
 over right now we have in the market 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.649
 3 processor is the snapdragon of 800 thousand 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.440
 800 bird and the 800 ac this 800 ac is called 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.660
 it is also known as snapdragon 801 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.850
 which is precisely what 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.740
 there is not much difference between these 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.990
 We have already explained the terminals in 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.520
 a free android article 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.470
 but it is important to keep it in mind 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.030
 we are with a process a little bit more 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 powerful that wins but good is 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.950
 true the design the design changes 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.810
 slightly and especially especially in 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.000
 the back side as you see the curves 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.490
 laterals are still maintained we continue 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.280
 having this profile that simulates a bit 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.960
 a metallic finish and as I said is the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.060
 rear which unlike more 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.120
 they change both the material and the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.130
 finished the material has a feeling 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.570
 much less plastic seems maybe 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.460
 remember the tablet maybe a nexus 7 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.650
 such a thing is it is difficult to write 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.600
 which is a much more pleasant touch 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.650
 it's not so similar to plastic as 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.180
 we had in s 3 or in lc 4 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.140
 there are different colors we have four 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.930
 colors the white the copper the black and the 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.910
 blue this is metallic blue is not a 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.830
 pretty attractive color 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.040
 and will be and is done through the 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.920
 Rear interchangeable housings these 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.110
 Interchangeable housings is a detail 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.030
 very important to keep in mind since 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.830
 samsung has managed to keep that 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.010
 we can remove the back cover 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.260
 let's check it 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.299
 while the phone is still 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.980
 water resistant this this does not 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.450
 it means that without the bone shell 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.849
 represents water as you can see here 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.680
 we have some small profiles that 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.840
 prevent water from entering this part 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.090
 which is the part of the battery and the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.390
 sim card and the microsd card that 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.060
 I would go here 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.530
 then it is that you have all the good is 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.720
 that samsung has gotten us to have 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.610
 still the removable battery and the 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.950
 microsd card that are a must 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.830
 entity every time we get a 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.380
 water resistance 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.640
 very interesting we stayed for the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.310
 back of the phone because 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.370
 we have two novelties we have a camera 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.320
 16-megapixel rear not only that 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.989
 but also according to samsung is the 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.260
 Fastest market approach and fair 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.300
 under a floro pulse reader that 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.460
 we will try to see how it works and this 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.110
 of this little sensor that you see here is 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.690
 a reader to read the pulse that connects 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.750
 with applications like that of samsung 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.060
 and it allows us then our pulse to 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.220
 add it to exercise this 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.780
 type of applications we go to the 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.430
 front part the front 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.320
 It also includes a great novelty that 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.470
 has the samsung galaxy is 5 and is 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.800
 this button this button that yes it seems 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.070
 the physical button that are 600 terminals 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.930
 they have a very new thing and that is that it has 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.760
 a fingerprint reader we have 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.260
 preconfigured for 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.840
 configuration we have to go through again 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.610
 eight times our fingerprint and 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.110
 that mode is to save the memory already 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.400
 from there, it helps us to unlock 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.260
 the phone we simply have to 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.700
 pass like this 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.280
 and as you can see it is unlocked by reading 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.200
 our pirate footprint then 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.030
 we enter the interface in the phone 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.470
 touchwiz is still very similar have 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.300
 changed some things on the screen 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.890
 initial then everyone how is this 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.960
 remember much governed from the access 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.440
 left but in this case we enter 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.440
 you kill 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.130
 the icons as you see have not changed 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.630
 maybe it sounds to you that if there should be 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.370
 changed where we found the 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.110
 new icons is here 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.910
 the adjustment zone comes with these 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.949
 new icons of where if we go into 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.750
 adjustments themselves and not in these 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.229
 quick judgments we already see the total change 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:47.120
 these are the new icons that we have 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.120
 in the gospel samsung galaxy s 5 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.259
 let's try some things over here 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.960
 for example I knew he had said that 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:57.729
 we had the pulse reader and reader 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.729
 We can find it in the sky 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.640
 and from here heart rate 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.289
 we will simply have to press the 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:14.330
 leave the button your finger on the sensor 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.330
 and in a while it will end of means 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.009
 I'm a little bit accelerated 106 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.289
 beats per minute is simply a 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.039
 example of how new you have got 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:29.360
 another thing that we liked a lot 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.530
 this had already had him in his last 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.750
 tablet bed 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.930
 but finally samsung has put the button 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.000
 of multitasking within the 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.130
 main buttons we have the button 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.050
 home the back button and the button 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.669
 of multitasking that used to be from a menu 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.130
 way that integrates much better with 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.870
 Android is that we can do it we have 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.340
 this this personalized menu of 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.599
 multitasking by samsung and from here 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.760
 we can access the latest 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:58.900
 applications delete them 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.060
 android 4.4 series kitkat that wants 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.070
 say that as we name our 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.040
 phone we will not have to update and 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.139
 let's meet with android 4.4 15 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.300
 years 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:13.969
 so this is the first look that 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.969
 we are casting the samsung galaxy s 5
