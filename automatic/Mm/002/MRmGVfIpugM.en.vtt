kind<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.680> got<00:01:10.799> play<00:01:10.979> around<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.640> one

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
kind of got play around with it but one

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.630 
kind of got play around with it but one
of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> other<00:01:12.479> tricky<00:01:12.750> things<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.640> can't

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of the other tricky things is that can't

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.539 
of the other tricky things is that can't
use<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.360> sidebar<00:01:15.960> scroll<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
use the sidebar scroll here on the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
use the sidebar scroll here on the
contacts<00:01:18.210> unless<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.780> push<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.259> hard

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
contacts unless you push it really hard

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.280 
contacts unless you push it really hard
and<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.490> that's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:21.090> awkward<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and so that's a little awkward but you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.240 
and so that's a little awkward but you
know<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.680> touch<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> middle

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
know that if you touch it the middle

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.270 
know that if you touch it the middle
it's<00:01:23.490> fine<00:01:23.930> but<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> sides<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.710> doesn't

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
it's fine but the sides just doesn't

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.880 
it's fine but the sides just doesn't
want<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> work<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:28.259> trying<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.799> the
