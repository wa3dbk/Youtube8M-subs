well so in this game play for
scorestreaks<00:00:19.800> i'm<00:00:19.980> using<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.670> South<00:00:20.939> chopper

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
scorestreaks i'm using the South chopper

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.590 
scorestreaks i'm using the South chopper
lodestar<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.830> VTOL<00:00:23.310> warship<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.970> like

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
lodestar and the VTOL warship I like

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.210 
lodestar and the VTOL warship I like
using<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.990> combination<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.680> scorestreaks

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
using this combination of scorestreaks

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.310 
using this combination of scorestreaks
because<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:27.210> work<00:00:27.420> off<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.840> another<00:00:27.960> to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
because they work off one another to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.839 
because they work off one another to
help<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> reach<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:28.830> next<00:00:29.189> court<00:00:29.640> street

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
for example when you get the South

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.049 
for example when you get the South
chopper<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.640> flying<00:00:32.940> around

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
chopper it's going to be flying around

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.910 
chopper it's going to be flying around
racking<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:34.020> kills<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.559> will<00:00:34.710> bring<00:00:34.770> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
racking up kills which will bring you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.889 
racking up kills which will bring you
closer<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.430> your<00:00:35.460> next<00:00:35.820> score<00:00:36.030> streak<00:00:36.329> which

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
closer to your next score streak which

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.959 
closer to your next score streak which
in<00:00:37.050> my<00:00:37.170> case<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> lodestar<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.820> i'll<00:00:38.940> use

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
in my case is the lodestar then i'll use

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.760 
in my case is the lodestar then i'll use
the<00:00:39.239> lodestar<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.899> help<00:00:40.050> me<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> enough<00:00:40.500> kills

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the lodestar to help me get enough kills

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
to get the VTOL warship I cut this

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
to get the VTOL warship I cut this
gameplay<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> end<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> match<00:00:44.309> because

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
gameplay to the end of the match because

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
gameplay to the end of the match because
I<00:00:44.789> actually<00:00:45.090> didn't<00:00:46.079> even<00:00:46.230> start<00:00:46.379> doing<00:00:46.559> good

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I actually didn't even start doing good

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
I actually didn't even start doing good
until<00:00:47.129> later<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> match<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:48.989> first

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
until later on in the match so my first

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.619 
until later on in the match so my first
tip<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.829> give<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.489> too<00:00:50.640> easy<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.449> you're

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
tip is don't give up too easy if you're

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
tip is don't give up too easy if you're
not<00:00:51.750> doing<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.739> play<00:00:52.949> throughout<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
not doing good just play throughout the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.770 
not doing good just play throughout the
whole<00:00:53.579> game<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.090> never<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
whole game because you never know you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
whole game because you never know you
might<00:00:55.050> actually<00:00:55.320> start<00:00:55.710> doing<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.370> good

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
might actually start doing really good

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
might actually start doing really good
later<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.030> at<00:00:57.300> some<00:00:57.510> point<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> game<00:00:57.989> now

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350

so good just play the game and have fun

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.039 
so good just play the game and have fun
with<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.119> my<00:01:24.299> stealth<00:01:24.600> chopper

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
with as you can see my stealth chopper

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
with as you can see my stealth chopper
has<00:01:25.229> gotten<00:01:25.560> me<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> load<00:01:25.890> start<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.490> didn't

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
has gotten me a load start and I didn't

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.179 
has gotten me a load start and I didn't
really<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.780> too<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
really have to do too much at all so the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.580 
really have to do too much at all so the
trick<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.509> utilize<00:01:30.509> scorestreaks<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.470> earn

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
