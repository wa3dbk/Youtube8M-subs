these in I think last week or this week

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.250 
these in I think last week or this week
very<00:00:13.410> cool<00:00:13.679> blade<00:00:14.070> shape<00:00:14.450> great<00:00:15.450> improvements

very cool blade shape great improvements

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.099 
very cool blade shape great improvements
on<00:00:16.580> the<00:00:17.580> Tachyon<00:00:18.000> by<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> way<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.900> first

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
on the Tachyon by the way the first

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.560 
on the Tachyon by the way the first
version<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> tachyon<00:00:20.130> Elza<00:00:20.910> tachyon<00:00:21.300> 2

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
version of the tachyon Elza tachyon 2

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.679 
version of the tachyon Elza tachyon 2
had<00:00:22.320> these<00:00:22.470> barrel<00:00:22.830> spacers<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.510> see

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
had these barrel spacers so you can see

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.000 
had these barrel spacers so you can see
those<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.109> pulled<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.470> off<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> shelf

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
those here I pulled one off the shelf

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.730 
those here I pulled one off the shelf
this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> bowie<00:00:26.460> blade<00:00:27.380> have<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> barrel

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
this is a bowie blade have the barrel

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.160 
this is a bowie blade have the barrel
spacers<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.119> has<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.810> block

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
spacers here this one has these block

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.959 
spacers here this one has these block
spacers<00:00:31.710> which<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.309> think<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> lot<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.759> people

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
spacers which I think a lot of people

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.520 
spacers which I think a lot of people
are<00:00:33.059> excited<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:33.960> those<00:00:34.290> kind

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
are excited about you can see those kind

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.160 
are excited about you can see those kind
of<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.649> close-up<00:00:35.510> kind<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.570> an<00:00:36.630> interesting

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
of a close-up kind of an interesting

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
of a close-up kind of an interesting
shape<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.620> wasn't<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> spacer<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.730> threw

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
shape it wasn't just a spacer they threw

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.850 
shape it wasn't just a spacer they threw
in<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.020> Microtech<00:00:40.440> typically

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
in there that's not Microtech typically

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.850 
in there that's not Microtech typically
rolls<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.969> things<00:00:42.860> just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
rolls is they don't just do things just

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
rolls is they don't just do things just
to<00:00:44.010> throw<00:00:44.340> them<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.789> they<00:00:44.969> decorate<00:00:45.629> them

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to throw them in they they decorate them

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.250 
to throw them in they they decorate them
as<00:00:46.760> they<00:00:47.760> go<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.960> one<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> cool

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
as they go so that is one of the cool

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.600 
as they go so that is one of the cool
features<00:00:52.289> about<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> blade

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
features about this as well as the blade

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.910 
features about this as well as the blade
shape<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> same<00:00:55.020> Tachyon<00:00:55.500> features

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
shape all of the same Tachyon features

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.670 
shape all of the same Tachyon features
as<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.430> other<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.260> previous

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
as the other one the the previous

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.459 
as the other one the the previous
version<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.250> think<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> weight<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.350> just<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
version I think the weight is just a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.110 
version I think the weight is just a
little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.070> heavier<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> block

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
little bit heavier with the block

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.890 
little bit heavier with the block
spacers<00:01:03.619> 5.2<00:01:04.619> 8<00:01:05.040> ounces<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> block

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
spacers 5.2 8 ounces with the block

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
spacers 5.2 8 ounces with the block
spacers<00:01:07.350> versus<00:01:08.210> 4.7<00:01:09.290> with<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.670> bowie<00:01:11.670> blade

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
spacers versus 4.7 with the bowie blade

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
spacers versus 4.7 with the bowie blade
and<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:13.310> barrel<00:01:14.310> spacers<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:16.290> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and the barrel spacers so I know you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
and the barrel spacers so I know you
guys<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.159> particular<00:01:17.880> about<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
guys are very particular about the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.140 
guys are very particular about the
weight<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.950> works<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.460> let<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.060> show

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
weight and how that works so let me show

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
weight and how that works so let me show
you<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> center<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.689> gravity<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.409> one

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619

right in there BAM so you kind of get an

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.480 
right in there BAM so you kind of get an
idea<00:02:01.780> let<00:02:02.229> me<00:02:02.289> show<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:02.469> a<00:02:02.560> side-by-side<00:02:02.799> of

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
idea let me show you a side-by-side of

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.880 
idea let me show you a side-by-side of
the<00:02:03.700> two<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:04.000> them<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:05.320> can<00:02:05.439> see<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:05.680> one's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
the two of them you can see this one's

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.369 
the two of them you can see this one's
got<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.039> bead<00:02:06.460> blast<00:02:06.729> finish<00:02:07.090> on<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.570> if

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
got the bead blast finish on it so if

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:09.600 
got the bead blast finish on it so if
that's<00:02:08.470> what<00:02:08.679> you're<00:02:08.800> privy<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.099> that's<00:02:09.459> gonna

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
that's what you're privy to that's gonna

passionate<00:04:57.650> about<00:04:57.680> it<00:04:58.039> from<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.600> spectator

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
passionate about it from a spectator

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.170 
passionate about it from a spectator
perspective<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.370> think<00:05:01.729> there's<00:05:01.880> room<00:05:02.030> in

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
perspective and I think there's room in

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.629 
perspective and I think there's room in
the<00:05:02.270> community<00:05:02.660> for<00:05:02.840> for<00:05:03.710> spectators<00:05:04.130> indeed

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
the community for for spectators indeed

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.790 
the community for for spectators indeed
I<00:05:04.669> think<00:05:04.820> there<00:05:05.150> should<00:05:05.180> be<00:05:05.479> more<00:05:05.870> spectators

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
I think there should be more spectators

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.159 
I think there should be more spectators
of<00:05:07.130> Bali<00:05:07.400> songs<00:05:07.669> rather<00:05:07.940> than<00:05:08.180> just<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.539> because

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
of Bali songs rather than just a because

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.430 
of Bali songs rather than just a because
honestly<00:05:09.650> you<00:05:10.160> guys<00:05:10.280> know<00:05:10.490> this<00:05:11.169> Bali<00:05:12.169> guys

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
honestly you guys know this Bali guys

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.520 
honestly you guys know this Bali guys
well<00:05:13.370> Bali<00:05:13.669> songs<00:05:14.060> not<00:05:14.510> so<00:05:14.660> much<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.960> guys<00:05:15.169> but

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
well Bali songs not so much the guys but

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.500 
well Bali songs not so much the guys but
Bali<00:05:15.770> songs<00:05:16.070> in<00:05:16.220> general<00:05:16.610> kind<00:05:17.150> of<00:05:17.210> get<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.330> bad

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
Bali songs in general kind of get a bad

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.010 
Bali songs in general kind of get a bad
rap<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.020> I<00:05:18.860> think<00:05:19.729> if<00:05:19.849> people<00:05:20.000> realize<00:05:20.750> this

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
rap and I think if people realize this

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.750 
rap and I think if people realize this
is<00:05:21.200> more<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.530> community<00:05:21.889> it's<00:05:22.099> a<00:05:22.220> sport<00:05:22.580> it's
