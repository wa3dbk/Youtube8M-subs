00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.929

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.419

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.100

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.610
 shirt with a party is in fabric 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.890
 if this recent issue is enough 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.510
 rigid enough enough to iron so this 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.609
 will be perfect for the party meal 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:37.399
 show how to achieve them 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.359
 different stages of this looting 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.649
 hello then I'm sorry for my 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.679
 voice today I'm a little bit 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.309
 cold then start by opening your 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:49.289
 towel completely if it's like 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.819
 often a towel that go out of the fold 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.339
 in four lanes grabbed him the edge in 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:59.390
 bottom right and bring them back to the 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.390
 center but not completely 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.690
 in this way 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.200
 there are no precise landmarks here we go 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.570
 to say that you have to bring it about 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.680
 three quarters of the diagonal of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.680
 square which down right 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.740
 bring the edge down left along 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:37.200

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.200
 corner at the top right like these 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.329
 and finally the top left corner 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.409
 and you get the rectangle shape 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.229
 it's not very serious it 's not 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.549
 extremely accurate it's not always 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.549
 easy luxury and a paper towel 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.569
 Now fold the two straight sides 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.569
 and left in the center of the model 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.510
 like this 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.010

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.689
 the towel that pass your finger 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.810
 with the nail do otherwise it risks the 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:53.500
 tear is so get off the beautiful or the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:01.359

 both two angles at the top right and 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.859
 left towards the center of the model like 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.859
 this 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.730
 now to form the sleeves or 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:32.020
 strip the flap at the bottom and fold it in 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.520
 diagonal in this way again there 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:41.680
 there are no precise landmarks does the 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:47.770
 judge and now to finish up the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:50.610
 bottom of the model is stuck prince down 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.610

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.500
 towel of identical size and 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.720
 cut it in four we use 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.570
 only quarter of the towel 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.840
 place your square diagonally etc 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.900
 linked so as to divide the angle 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.199
 the upper right angle in three parts 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.500
 equal to operate approximately 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.500
 this way 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:43.919
 crush the magpies and share again 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.919
 the tie in 3 this way 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.169
 crush well 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.260

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:10.280
 clie lapointe duo tie left 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:14.060
 like these return 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.350
 and wrap the tip in this way 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.350
 to form the knot 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.900
 and to block do not flip 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.010
 or down the tie the little 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:40.460
 tip has returned there in the node of 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:41.870
 so that he does not get rid of the 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.970
 tie is over you can the 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.970
 place on the shirt you did 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.300
 I made the tie a little long there 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.620
 should have done the knot 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.930
 a little bit lower 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.370
 soro was prettier then for lack 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.370
 I folded a tiny 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.660
 towel but with a towel 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:07.940
 standard style of 40 cm side after 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:10.480
 that's what we get a shirt a 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.480
 little bigger 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.940
