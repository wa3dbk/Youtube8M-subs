 he assumed the identity of the jackal jackal 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.789
 he had samples of all his students 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.210
 between those who were peter parker and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.190
 gwen stacy began to clone the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.530
 discovering that Peter Parker was in 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.260
 reality spiderman 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 before the appearance of the clone of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.690
 spiderman known as bng king and the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.570
 criminal known as the jackal had 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.590
 created another clone that would be known more 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.290
 late as ka in the tire that was the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.170
 first temporary success of the jackal by 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.100
 cloning spiderman but the process of 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.009
 cloning turned out to be defective with the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.070
 time cain degenerated leaving him 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.479
 scars all over his face and also his 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.330
 body 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.390
 the jackal tried to kill cain but in 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.970
 change this grew stronger and with the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.450
 time was overcoming the force of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 original spiderman caÃ­nes followed the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.300
 ben reilly steps blaming him a 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.480
 murder to give the real petter 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.990
 the life he could never have 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.510
 then he went to the laboratory in ruins 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.570
 of the jackal in order to discover 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.240
 Who is the true spiderman when 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.610
 manages to get the data from the computer 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.830
 an alleged mechanism is activated 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.500
 defense that opens a capsule of 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.930
 cloning from which peter parker comes out 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.050
 at that moment the jackal arrives 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.900
 Cain and seeking the truth attacks him alone 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.300
 to find more confusion in that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.970
 moment makes its appearance write that 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.430
 I was watching the movements of 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.260
 meat all this time and while 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.050
 spoke with the jackal 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.990
 Cain escaped with the disk that contained the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.720
 supposed truth of spiderman 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.120
 Cain followed Peter Parker and handed him 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.400
 the disk telling him that it contained the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.890
 truth about the clone and he went 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.320
 angry vettel put on the suit of 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.440
 spiderman and followed meat to 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.930
 discover why he was doing this 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.480
 cain knowing that the confrontation was 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.820
 inevitable he realized that everything 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.900
 was prepared by the jackal and that 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.930
 they were only mario 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.060
 for he decided not to fight and the minor 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.060
 carelessness of spiderman escaped
