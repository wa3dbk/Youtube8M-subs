00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.269
 of a trio of gamers with this our 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 very first video and what better way to 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.500
 start with something new that with another 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 new thing so is friends the new 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.720
 nintendo console is here but 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.550
 it's worth buying a wii or 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.619
 find out to begin let me 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.169
 tell them that if the only console that 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.180
 possess of this generation is a guild 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.730
 I definitely recommend that you 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 buy a wii but what if you guys 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.260
 have a ps3 or 360 a console with 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.510
 hd graphics and with multiplatform games 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.559
 it will be worth the wii let's start with 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.359
 this 5 reasons to buy a wii or 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.429
 obviously there are many more reasons I 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.040
 I only bring them 5 because I want to have 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:59.970
 this the shortest and simplest 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.740
 number 5 the console itself by the console 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.960
 itself I mean the hardware of the wii 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.610
 which is more powerful than that of the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.950
 other consoles 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.530
 the console is small and goat in each 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.900
 small space besides having four 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.080
 ports its lived the console itself is a 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.350
 reason why buy the console 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.600
 number 4 the internet and online I 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.700
 I mean all the things that have to 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.860
 see with internet in the wii since ni 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.410
 look up to nintendo wii until the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.020
 browser if he or seen a place 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.050
 called by many the social network of 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.150
 gamers nintendo wii a place where 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.390
 You can have all your applications 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.450
 video as youtube netflix hulu and many 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.490
 more all in one place 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.060
 simply excellent and the browser in 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.160
 the wii according to many user reports 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.770
 they say it's incredibly good that it's 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.259
 fast that everything looks detailed that is 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.930
 easy to write on the touch screen is 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.270
 a great browser there are people who 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.470
 says it's even better than firefox or 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.790
 internet explorer wow 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.259
 let's go to the next number 3 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.670
 retrocompatibility something that has been a 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.000
 little hard to achieve for the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.870
 competition from the gameboy advance 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.420
 nintendo has made the backward compatibility 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.700
 of something that always comes in its 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.360
 consoles but I think with the wiiu 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.400
 they have perfected the backward compatibility 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.740
 just think, you can play all the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.320
 Will's games and they will be able to use all their 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.810
 accessories from the nunchuk to the 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.030
 classic controller the super the balance 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.170
 board all willy accessories 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.840
 they are there for wii 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.730
 without counting all the classic games that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.310
 You can buy in the eshop and virtual 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.760
 console number 2 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.920
 the range for there are so many things that you can 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.560
 do with this control milestone from maps 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.320
 and menus until you pass the entire game to the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.780
 You can surf the internet a lot 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.150
 more easily talk about games with 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.500
 your friends 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.170
 half definitely change many 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.810
 things just have to wait that brings us 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.970
 nintendo and the developers for 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.160
 many this milestone control itself is the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.860
 better reason why buy the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.930
 but in my opinion there is something else something 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.210
 better than the range for the definitive 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.440
 reason why buy this console 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.330
 And it is 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.790
 what they like so much about 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.820
 nintendo what differentiates 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.580
 nintendo of your competition nothing more and 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.160
 nothing less than his Nintendo games is 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.100
 known for having excellent exclusives 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.460
 as mario metroid zelda star fox 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.950
 pokemon f0 games that you do not find in 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.410
 other side but the bad thing about nintendo is 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.870
 they have almost no games tir party for 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.090
 usually the nintendo consoles just 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.120
 they have nintendo games but this time 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.970
 not this time you can crush bombs and 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.550
 kill us in a console you can defeat 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.040
 to ganondorf and kill zombies after all 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.320
 in one place is the combination 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.540
 between excellent nintendo games with 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.130
 excellent tir party games what will 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.130
 this console so special 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.639
 good friends this has been everything I hope 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.919
 that now have less doubts I am the 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.989
