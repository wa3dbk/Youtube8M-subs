performance after the game the entire
team<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.679> we<00:01:46.770> determine<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.340> they're<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
team and we determine if they're on a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.699 
team and we determine if they're on a
hot<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.000> cold<00:01:48.270> streak<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:49.080> let<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.410> carry

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
hot or cold streak we let that carry

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.710 
hot or cold streak we let that carry
forward<00:01:50.099> into<00:01:50.280> upcoming<00:01:50.729> weeks<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.240> really

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
forward into upcoming weeks and really

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.109 
forward into upcoming weeks and really
kind<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.170> set<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.069> tone<00:01:53.190> for<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.610> season<00:01:54.030> as

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
kind of set the tone for your season as

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.699 
kind of set the tone for your season as
you<00:01:54.209> go<00:01:54.330> along<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.959> not<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.410> like<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
you go along and it's not just like a
