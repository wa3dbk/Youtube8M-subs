game<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> pistol<00:00:42.989> especially<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.649> casual

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
game with a pistol especially in casual

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.720 
game with a pistol especially in casual
where<00:00:45.690> people<00:00:46.050> already<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.829> pre-purchased

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
where people already have pre-purchased

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
where people already have pre-purchased
Kevlar<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.239> helmet<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:49.230> pretty<00:00:49.559> hard<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
Kevlar and helmet it's pretty hard to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.189 
Kevlar and helmet it's pretty hard to
get<00:00:49.950> kills<00:00:50.250> well<00:00:50.940> not<00:00:51.300> pretty<00:00:51.600> cool

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
get kills well not pretty cool

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.160 
get kills well not pretty cool
it's<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.219> more<00:00:53.340> difficult<00:00:53.610> since<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.360> most

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
it's a bit more difficult since at most

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.330 
it's a bit more difficult since at most
ranges<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.129> two<00:00:56.309> shot

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
ranges it's like it's a two shot

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
ranges it's like it's a two shot
headshot<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.600> anyways<00:00:59.210> after<00:01:00.210> I'm<00:01:00.300> finished

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
headshot but anyways after I'm finished

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.110 
headshot but anyways after I'm finished
I<00:01:01.140> guess<00:01:01.739> getting<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> gameplay<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.820> my

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
I guess getting all the gameplay for my

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.530 
I guess getting all the gameplay for my
video<00:01:03.420> I've<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.979> guess<00:01:05.549> hours<00:01:06.270> in

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
video I've put a lot of I guess hours in

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
video I've put a lot of I guess hours in
do<00:01:06.780> playing<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> pistol<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> only

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
do playing with that pistol and only

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
do playing with that pistol and only
that<00:01:08.640> pistol<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:09.720> whenever<00:01:10.049> I'm<00:01:10.290> playing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that pistol so then whenever I'm playing

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.340 
that pistol so then whenever I'm playing
a<00:01:10.710> competitive<00:01:10.979> game<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.080> I'm<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.290> a
