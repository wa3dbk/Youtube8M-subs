00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:04.370
 We're at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Upstairs, in the Ancient Near East section. 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.360
 We are studying the art of Assyria here. 

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:12.711
 When you enter a gallery full of such symbols of power, your eyes are scared. 

00:00:14.088 --> 00:00:16.645
 There are big sculptures supporting the gates, 

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.014
 fantastic and really great as well. 

00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:24.531
 Despite being in a modern museum full of security measures of the 21st century 

00:00:25.062 --> 00:00:26.868
 I admit I'm a little bit scared. 

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:29.019
 These statues are quite high. 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.294
 And he forms a gateway to the entrance of the king's throne room. 

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:36.077
 I mean, not out of the throne room. 

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:40.454
 right after you enter the door, they welcome you inside the room. 

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:47.315
 Logically, a person who can enter the palace's throne room must be an invited guest. 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.687
 And yet, the task of these statues is to scare even the guests. 

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:57.787
 Because even the privileged guests should be reminded of the power of the King. 

00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:03.469
 So, what is there to represent power other than colossal dimensions? 

00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:08.471
 I think the creatures themselves seem pretty daunting. 

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.575
 I call it creature because the heads are human, 

00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:14.778
 but their bodies look like powerful monsters. 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.236
 On one side the cat looks like the bull's body on the other side. 

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:25.436
 Actually, this is the face of the king we saw and he's looking right at us. 

00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:29.566
 Both sides have one face and are symmetrical. 

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:32.750
 That's when you realize 

00:01:33.383 --> 00:01:35.266
 a creature that looks at you, 

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:37.227
 the king is not his own. 

00:01:37.688 --> 00:01:39.501
 Let's look at the bodies of these creatures. 

00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:43.144
 He's got two different legs in the front. 

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.730
 He has hooves on the right, he resembles a bull 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.860
 on the left side it looks like a cat with claws. 

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:59.588
 When you enter the room, you face these monsters that are looking at you, and you stand before you see the King inevitably. 

00:02:00.977 --> 00:02:05.756
 Then as you walk through the gap between them, you realize that these monsters have wings. 

00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:09.979
 It's a pretty complicated, fantastic creature. 

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:13.183
 And this is a symbol of power, 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.373
 I'm sure the minds of people who look at this fantastic creature are confusing. 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.003
 When you enter the king's throne room, this image is a factor that absorbs people. 

00:02:25.723 --> 00:02:30.943
 When we go past them we notice something interesting about the naturalness of the figures. 

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:35.275
 When we look at them from the front we see two legs. 

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.454
 Then we walk aside 

00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:39.947
 except for the front leg 

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.589
 We see three more legs. 

00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:44.457
 If you look carefully 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.277
 There are five legs in total. 

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:50.489
 In other words, two different perspectives were used, 

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:55.232
 this detail cannot be clearly seen at first sight. 

00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:00.620
 You have to look at this statue either from the front or from the side and both kinds of meaning are complete. 

00:03:01.726 --> 00:03:03.153
 But if you look at the center 

00:03:03.607 --> 00:03:05.809
 you encounter a five-legged creature. 

00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:08.321
 Thanks to this trick, 

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:10.277
 approaching the throne room 

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:16.045
 you are standing in front of the monster. It's like, "Hey, stop." Like he says. 

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.813
 And if we keep walking, 

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:22.131
 the creature seems to be walking with us. 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.525
 That's exactly what you're feeling between the two statues. 

00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:32.092
 It creates a sense of motion because we see all four legs that must have when moving. 

00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:37.235
 If the feet were next to each other like in the front, then it wouldn't have the same feeling. 

00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:43.299
 The figure is depicted in motion when viewed from the side to emphasize the power of the body. 

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:46.002
 There's a lot of carving, 

00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:49.409
 wings and beards were studied in detail. 

00:03:50.842 --> 00:03:54.657
 We can see the typical Mesopotamian-style naturalism and stylization. 

00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:59.519
 There are certain parts of the body that are quite naturalistic, natural. 

00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:04.369
 These claws look like cat claws, we can almost see muscles. 

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:07.600
 But many details have been stylized, 

00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:10.433
 evolved into repeated geometric shapes. 

00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:13.414
 Like, hair and beard, 

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:15.903
 or just like in the wings. 

00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:18.837
 Pretty natural and supernatural, 

00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:21.852
 we also see this in the overall design. 

00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:26.101
 These are design elements that are not seen in nature, 

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:30.759
 but in the beard we can see all these repeated rectangles and spirals, 

00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:32.832
 stands quite decorative. 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.924
 We can see this as a typical guardian figure from the ancient world. 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.671
 In Mesopotamia, hair and beards are often associated with the elements. 

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:49.974
 Assyrian art and early Mesopotamian art were not very focused on the king. 

00:04:51.547 --> 00:04:54.046
 Early examples of Mesopotamian art, 

00:04:54.047 --> 00:04:57.605
 the Sumerian art, for example, is more focused on the gods. 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.415
 And he sees the king as the representative of the gods. 

00:05:02.563 --> 00:05:06.978
 Beware, the kings as the representative or servant of the gods; 

00:05:07.755 --> 00:05:08.923
 gods are not kings. 

00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:13.689
 And here, in an interesting way, we see the king's head. 

00:05:14.678 --> 00:05:18.889
 But the three-horned crown he wore on his head is a detail of the gods. 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.958
 There's something we need to clearly understand, 

00:05:23.602 --> 00:05:27.907
 And who is to accept the power and kneel before us.
