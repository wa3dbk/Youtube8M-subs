00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.029
 hello very good to all welcome from 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.460
 new to canada and administered a question 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.200
 by twitter they asked me what is the 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.119
 cache and I guess they were referring to the 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.889
 cache of the processors given for the 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.019
 type of devices that they can use 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.509
 the cache with mobile phones tablets 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.980
 hard drives and so on and so on 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.509
 I guess the question was going to devote to 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.310
 the court of the processors and could 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.589
 explain what it is so we're going to 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.539
 start with the simple the simplest 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:29.499
 a whole processor needs 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.290
 instructions and data and we will explain 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:35.710
 is also a teacher says to a child 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.510
 two and five that would be data but if not 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.400
 they tell him the instruction that is sum 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.380
 multiply or whatever the child will not know 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.230
 what to do with the processors happens what 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.410
 same programs need to facilitate 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.400
 instructions and data to the processor 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.470
 instructions so they know what 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.020
 do and data so they know with what 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.190
 do it therefore these programs that 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.450
 they are in the storage units 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.000
 which are usually hard drives 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.760
 they need to send that data to a 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.890
 processor I say you will have the difference 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.860
 of speed so to speak it would be 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.320
 in frequencies is very different is a 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.850
 hard disk or an SSD is super slow 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.010
 compared to the hyper speed a 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.350
 processor for this is used in the 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.630
 main memory that is the ram the breast 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.940
 it's much faster than the ssd itself 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.910
 that the hard drives but a lot more 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.120
 slow that the memories engage and there it is 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.280
 where we go then all that data is 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.650
 load ram memory and this in turn 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.960
 it is charged depending on your use of the 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.640
 floors the instructions and the two steps 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.320
 they entrust us with the different types of 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.170
 memory is cached to follow 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.690
 balancing by matching the frequency 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.820
 of the processor and thus facilitate data 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.610
 to suffer in his real time or in his 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.740
 often that goes like that because if not the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.430
 processor would lose many cycles of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.680
 computing 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.600
 so we tried an otherwise 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.120
 any processor that works in 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.850
 3.5 gigahertz really works 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.890
 which means that he makes 3,500 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.660
 millions of operations per second or 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.030
 decided those of computing per second 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.160
 however if we take the ram that is the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.130
 simplest data the most standard would be 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.830
 the ddr 3600 we could say melt to 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.410
 1600 graces not given that it works under 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.770
 two channels really works 800 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.440
 megahertz 800 earnings at 3500 is very 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.270
 very big the difference which he wants 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.730
 say that it is the strips processor is only 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.100
 of information from the instructions and 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.380
 data from the ram would lose many cycles 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.960
 of computing would be very good 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.910
 wearable a lot of time they would waste 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.980
 for that memories are used 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.810
 intermediates that are the streets the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.760
 streets you have to understand that they are very 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.420
 faces to make and that come in three 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.020
 levels 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.210
 l1 l2 and l3 each level is more expensive than 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.550
 manufacture that is to say the l1 is much more 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.220
 face that the r2 the r2 is much more 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.310
 face that the l 3 and 3 is rather more expensive 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.400
 was also the frequency is something 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.049
 what to keep in mind 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.510
 work at the same frequency as the 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.640
 processor the r2 roughly in half 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.640
 and the letters in an intermediate between ram 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.300
 and the r2 let's explain this from another 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.700
 way too 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.320
 the f1 is a type of memory that is 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.170
 embedded within each core of the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.030
 processor is a processor 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.600
 processors come with the cache 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.220
 l1 l2 and l3 inside inside the 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.660
 processor architectures I think 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.090
 that why put some to 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.310
 we can understand each other better there are the 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.140
 cores there are other types of components 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.910
 inside a processor but there are two 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.100
 computing cores within those 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.830
 cores is embedded the euro cache 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.030
 is therefore the fastest memory for 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.990
 give function to the frequency of 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.330
 processor or at very similar frequencies 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.100
 and it is also the most expensive and therefore the 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.780
 smallest of all normally when 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.510
 we bought a process that tells us the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.130
 116 kilobyte cache this cache 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.630
 you have to understand that it's dedicated by 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.610
 example is if a processor has 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.370
 four cores each of its cores 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.950
 I would have 16 kilobytes 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.780
 that with respect to the cache with respect 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.670
 to the cache l2 we have two architectures 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.220
 different you have to understand that it is more 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.590
 slower than the l2 cache and faster than 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.930
 the cache l3 and that is also very expensive 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.269
 factory in these architectures how do you 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.949
 find the l2 cache dedicated by 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.610
 core is to say each core will have the 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:26.610
 cache r1 and r2 and the architecture 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.220
 shared that would be core 0 and core 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.979
 we share the core l2 cache a 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.139
 core three share cache l2 that would be 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.169
 powerful architectures possible and for 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.880
 last we have the l3 cache that would be a 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.380
 widespread cache for all 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.240
 shared processor for all 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.710
 processor as I say the holidays of 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.090
 cache are included from the same 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.940
 processor or is not something we can 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.340
 modify and also tell you that the cache 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.420
 of normally put a box 8 mega 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.160
 something out there because 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.080
 you have to understand that that's 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.760
 essential so that the processor does not 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.580
 lose computing times and that the 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.440
 cache is very very important is one of 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.290
 the most important factors at the time 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.400
 to measure the performance of a processor 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.070
 let's see now other little ones 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.510
 Details 90 very technical details but 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.120
 all details so we can understand 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.470
 how it works first of all there is that 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.930
 understand that the processor is going to catch 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.400
 data of the court the euro is worth if not 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.870
 Find a piece of information what you will find in the 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.130
 cache l2 if you can not find it either 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.110
 I look for the crisis song and neither 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.390
 find the ram so it is 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.750
 necessary that those data and instructions 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.460
 are always at hand in one's cache 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.230
 for this algorithms are used 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.970
 which are the ones that decide 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.800
 instructions and what data should 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.120
 stored in each type of cache 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.890
 I will not bury more technical details 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.600
 because it could happen to us now talking 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.390
 about the operation of the cache 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.250
 all different algorithms I'll just tell you 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.870
 that the l1 cache contains an information 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.310
 there are usually two caches is one 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.750
 man I only said one but 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.720
 There is usually one for instructions 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.300
 a device 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.680
 let's take the luxury cache all the 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.990
 data and instructions will be 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.000
 copied in the l2 cache but in cache l2 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.370
 it's bigger so it's also going to have 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.680
 other type of data and instructions all 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.570
 the data of the l2 cache will be 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.180
 made in the l3 cache which in turn 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.890
 It is also bigger and therefore it goes 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.750
 do you also have other data and 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.820
 extra instructions and all that data 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.740
 lacazette user manual 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.140
 they 're also going to be on the ram so 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.650
 redundant is a cyclical way that 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.900
 has the processor to never lose 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.610
 process times now yes guys yo 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.730
 I think with this you will have stayed more or 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.980
 less well I think there are seven more or 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.360
 less well it 's a kind of memories 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.400
 intermediates that are used to 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.890
 accelerate the different processes between 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.810
 the different components and different 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.750
 frequencies between them so that from that 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.760
 way we do not waste computing time 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.230
 in the case of hard drives and I'm going 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.640
 to explain very quickly is used to 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.200
 similarly a hard drive 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.560
 conventional is a dish that rotates by 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.810
 a 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.570
 kind a gramophone of this from another life 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.520
 that we see in the shots and really that 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.320
 it's too slow to accelerate that process 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.610
 with respect to the system bus it 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.860
 use a locality h 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.840
 that is, a memory type is added 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.330
 ram what he does is save the data 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.550
 most used instructions on the disk 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.040
 hard and therefore can send them by the 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.980
 faster data bus those are what 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.200
 caches is not made no no 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.270
 I can not explain it is much more 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.700
 go into very technical details about 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.700
 complexes that surely many do not 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.870
 you understand so nothing guys now 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.430
 you know if you liked the video what 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.410
 you can support with a like if it has not 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.850
 liked because you can always give 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.080
 dislike you can also follow me on 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.970
