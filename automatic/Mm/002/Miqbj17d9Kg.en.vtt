minutes worth of a movement drill that I

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.629 
minutes worth of a movement drill that I
do<00:00:08.250> using<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.480> uppercut<00:00:10.260> donut<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.460> heavy

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
do using a uppercut donut and the heavy

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.919 
do using a uppercut donut and the heavy
bag<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.740> recommend<00:00:13.740> using<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.849> nice<00:00:15.150> sized<00:00:15.480> tire

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
bag I recommend using a nice sized tire

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.220 
bag I recommend using a nice sized tire
because<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.670> has<00:00:17.880> more<00:00:18.359> spring<00:00:18.960> and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
because it just it has more spring and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.950 
because it just it has more spring and
more<00:00:19.529> elasticity<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.720> an

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
more elasticity to it but if you have an

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.620 
more elasticity to it but if you have an
old-fashioned<00:00:22.890> donut<00:00:23.310> ring<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:24.150> heavy<00:00:24.330> bags

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
advantages of the power and muscular

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610

coordination<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> bring<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.410> all

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
