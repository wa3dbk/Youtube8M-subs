00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
you're just going to fold it and make a

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.469 
you're just going to fold it and make a
little<00:01:07.100> loop<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.850> I'll<00:01:08.000> use<00:01:08.179> the

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
little loop and I'll use the

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.029 
little loop and I'll use the
medium-sized<00:01:09.259> here<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:09.649> you<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:09.830> see<00:01:10.009> a

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
medium-sized here so you can see a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.740 
medium-sized here so you can see a
little<00:01:10.250> better<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.119> all<00:01:11.270> we're<00:01:11.420> going<00:01:11.539> to<00:01:11.630> do

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
little better and all we're going to do

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.969

is<00:01:11.929> we're<00:01:12.080> just<00:01:12.110> going<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:12.410> take<00:01:12.590> this<00:01:12.770> loop

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
is we're just going to take this loop

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.350 
is we're just going to take this loop
we're<00:01:13.250> going<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.429> pinch<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:13.729> down<00:01:13.910> so<00:01:14.210> it's

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
we're going to pinch it down so it's

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.330 
we're going to pinch it down so it's
nice<00:01:14.539> and<00:01:14.810> small<00:01:15.020> we're<00:01:15.740> just<00:01:15.920> going<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.130> pass

hole of the indicator once we do that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.320 
hole of the indicator once we do that
we're<00:01:25.130> going<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.280> push<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.670> loop<00:01:25.880> all<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.179> way

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
we're going to push the loop all the way

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.359 
we're going to push the loop all the way
through<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.530> we're<00:01:27.709> going<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.860> kind<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.160> come

that's how you know it's properly seated
onto<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.479> indicator<00:02:02.959> now<00:02:03.739> to<00:02:03.890> get<00:02:04.099> the

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220

leader you're going to push the material
through<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.270> grommet<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.110> you're<00:02:15.230> going<00:02:15.319> to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
through the grommet then you're going to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.650 
through the grommet then you're going to
pull<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.099> back<00:02:16.310> end<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:16.970> loop<00:02:17.180> here<00:02:17.510> all

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
pull the back end of this loop here all

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.190 
pull the back end of this loop here all
the<00:02:18.200> way<00:02:18.319> up<00:02:18.590> over<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:20.450> indicator<00:02:20.840> here<00:02:21.080> I'll

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
the way up over the indicator here I'll

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.300 
the way up over the indicator here I'll
show<00:02:21.379> you<00:02:21.410> how<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.680> do<00:02:21.829> it<00:02:21.950> again<00:02:24.040> put<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.129> back

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
show you how to do it again put it back

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.949 
show you how to do it again put it back
on

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
on

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.240

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
so you can see there how the lines

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.620 
so you can see there how the lines
seated<00:02:29.640> against<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.000> indicator<00:02:30.360> all<00:02:30.540> I'm

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.880 
seated against the indicator all I'm
going<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.170> push<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.680> leader

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
going to do is just push the leader

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.220 
going to do is just push the leader
through<00:02:32.280> I'm<00:02:33.030> going<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.300> take<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.690> loop<00:02:33.959> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
through I'm going to take that loop and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.100 
through I'm going to take that loop and
just<00:02:34.260> pull<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.740> up<00:02:34.920> over<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:36.300> indicator<00:02:36.690> then

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
just pull it up over the indicator then

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.710 
just pull it up over the indicator then
you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.350> just<00:02:37.500> pull<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:38.010> loop<00:02:38.330> entirely<00:02:39.330> out

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
you can just pull the loop entirely out

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.960 
you can just pull the loop entirely out
and<00:02:40.709> then<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.069> have<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> nice<00:02:41.400> clean<00:02:41.730> leader

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and then you have a nice clean leader

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.699 
and then you have a nice clean leader
and<00:02:42.180> doesn't<00:02:42.480> damage<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.930> won't<00:02:43.110> hurt<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.500> and

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
and doesn't damage it won't hurt it and

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.910 
and doesn't damage it won't hurt it and
it's<00:02:44.580> ready<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.850> use<00:02:45.060> again<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.650> find
