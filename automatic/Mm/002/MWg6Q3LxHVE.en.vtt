because<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.060> first<00:01:34.330> thing<00:01:34.420> we'll<00:01:34.750> do<00:01:34.990> is<00:01:35.320> to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
because the first thing we'll do is to

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.160 
because the first thing we'll do is to
cut<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.190> then<00:01:36.369> ultimately<00:01:37.119> develop<00:01:37.720> a

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
cut it and then ultimately develop a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.830 
cut it and then ultimately develop a
musclin<00:01:38.590> out<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.070> that's<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.150> first<00:01:40.450> step

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
musclin out of it that's the first step

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:51.760 
musclin out of it that's the first step
so<00:01:41.290> then<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:42.009> piece<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:43.479> it's<00:01:43.630> like<00:01:43.750> pac-man
