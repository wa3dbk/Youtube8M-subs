peppermint<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:51.119> guess<00:01:51.450> mochas<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:52.170> they

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
peppermint and I guess mochas what they

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.399 
peppermint and I guess mochas what they
say<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:54.060> good<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.479> could<00:01:54.689> compare<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.229> I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
say but it's good I could compare this I

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
say but it's good I could compare this I
could<00:01:55.799> compare<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> sorry<00:01:56.610> tongue-tied<00:01:57.090> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
could compare the sorry tongue-tied I

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.410 
could compare the sorry tongue-tied I
could<00:01:57.960> compare<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.920> last<00:01:59.850> year's<00:02:00.149> dark

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
could compare this to last year's dark

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
could compare this to last year's dark
chocolate<00:02:00.810> mint<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.229> regard<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
know well that was stronger but this is

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.869 
know well that was stronger but this is
it's<00:02:05.939> good<00:02:06.180> nonetheless<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.380> great<00:02:07.560> set

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879
