00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
suggest for heavier weighted wigs or

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.660 
suggest for heavier weighted wigs or
wigs<00:03:14.930> that<00:03:15.080> pull<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.560> any<00:03:15.709> specific<00:03:15.980> direction

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
wigs that pull in any specific direction

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.340 
wigs that pull in any specific direction
you<00:03:16.790> do<00:03:16.940> quite<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.239> bit<00:03:17.360> where<00:03:17.780> it's<00:03:17.959> going<00:03:18.230> to

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
you do quite a bit where it's going to

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.940 
you do quite a bit where it's going to
pull<00:03:18.620> from<00:03:19.510> mine<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> really<00:03:21.140> long<00:03:21.170> link<00:03:21.709> so

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
pull from mine is a really long link so

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.310 
pull from mine is a really long link so
it<00:03:22.070> pulls<00:03:22.280> back<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.000> i've<00:03:23.180> got<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.630> double<00:03:24.140> row

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
it pulls back so i've got a double row

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.600 
it pulls back so i've got a double row
actually<00:03:25.160> up<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.489> front<00:03:25.670> here<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:28.549> the

up with your lumps in your wig I've done
that<00:05:09.300> before<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.779> always<00:05:10.289> used<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.590> lay<00:05:10.830> them

that before I always used to lay them
back<00:05:12.419> here<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.229> then<00:05:13.319> my<00:05:13.589> wigs<00:05:13.860> would

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
back here and then my wigs would

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.070 
back here and then my wigs would
actually<00:05:14.550> shift<00:05:14.909> their<00:05:15.240> weight<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.599> pull

actually shift their weight and pull

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.850 
actually shift their weight and pull
upwards<00:05:16.919> which<00:05:17.610> would<00:05:17.789> actually<00:05:18.089> cause<00:05:18.300> more

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
upwards which would actually cause more

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.579 
upwards which would actually cause more
visible<00:05:19.860> areas<00:05:20.699> through<00:05:21.629> here<00:05:22.139> and<00:05:22.289> at<00:05:22.439> the

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:22.589 
visible areas through here and at the

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:27.050 
visible areas through here and at the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
back so just along the edge there and

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.579 
back so just along the edge there and
then<00:05:27.240> once<00:05:27.449> you've<00:05:27.689> done<00:05:27.900> that<00:05:27.960> with<00:05:28.319> all<00:05:28.560> your
