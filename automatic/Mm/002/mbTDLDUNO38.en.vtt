 rodents schoolchildren remember with horror 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.720
 the test subjects survived for only 20 days 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.730
 malnutrition we came one 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.680

 fed on chips practically bald from them 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.400
 our eyes were closed we became their very 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.560
 sorry we decided to stop the experiment 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.060
 after that I bypass the de departments 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.280
 in the supermarket where these are sold 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.170
 products for experiment carefully 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.760
 followed at the agrarian university all

 experimental health research staff 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.610
 noted in the journal of animals 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.620
 photographed later in the laboratory 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.080
 it turned out that those rodents 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.150
 fed on potato crisps and feed 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.340
 adding flavorings upset

 decompose liver reason 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.030
 yellowish clay color indicates 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.390
 the fact that the liver cell is filled with the same 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.520
 time as the faces and corridors of newspapers 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.979
 managed to blame chemistry teacher for cruel 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.170
 treatment animals 1 baht which helped 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.690
 many teenagers refuse harmful 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.610
 food was spent on extracurricular activities with 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.570
 permission of parents of high school students and 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.850
 school principal 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.770
 Yes, and the students themselves confirm other 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.960
 the arguments would not be so convincing 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.760
 original not skoda of these people of course 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.990
 I feel sorry for these rats for the same products 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.150
 consumed by people 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.980
 if the animal does not give junk food alone 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.680
 active ie these additives are not needed 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.470
 children even reviewed the menu favorite 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.020

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.620
 filming a training film about the dangers of fast food 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.870
 an unusual lesson in healthy eating 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.760
 Ukrainian scientists are interested here 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.260
 Food Technology Institute, I'm sure 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.150
 what make children and teenagers 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.310
 refuse junk food can only

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.910
 Dnepropetrovsk schoolchildren still 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.100
