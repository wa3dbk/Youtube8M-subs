00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.320
 for the doctor gottfried cornelissen the cancer is a consequence of a damage 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.630
 sustained on the metabolism of cellular mitochondria 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.210
 result of both a nutritional deficiency 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.160
 as of the impact of the toxics on them 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.710
 the mutation of youths would therefore be an effect and not a cause of the cell 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 tumoral 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.760
 this agent 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.840
 she finishes cÃ¡ceres institution 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.490
 by the way here 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.889
 First of all it has to be said that 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.119
 We have been able to feel many therapeutic interventions in 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.809
 mitochondria and we have had many successes with that kind of treatments in 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.640
 the last three or four years we have worked intensively in this field and 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.770
 I have not had any patient what athenaeum to die with this treatment in 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.230
 the mitochondria 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.810
 the fair reinforce the immune system with supplements suitably tested for 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.860
 each patient 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.210
 balance the hormonal system 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.020
 and eliminate toxic materials from the body 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.200
 to prevent 60 and 80% of tumor development from entering 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.150
 simple therapy that is so complemented with a diagnostic device and 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.470
 treatment for ten frequencies the moral capable of providing correct 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.740
 imbalances before damage to the mitochondria occurs 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.140
 and of reversing the situation when its owners to produce 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.720
 between the two a series of important events cdp for mitochondria 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.280
 and this has supposed it is possible to say that hour of degeneration of the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.030
 mitochondria a very important element although cross action for example that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.840
 help in the toxic and face in the cell on the side took central of the rotary 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.140
 he taught us the fourteenth selenium movies we do not have to otatillos no one so 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.169
 both nin 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.599
 we would not have a destruction tic make the cell other enzymes like 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.129
 and is for example also help in the recovery of mitochondria but yes 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.139
 it's possible 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.849
 and that is to cornelis that cancer is not a local pathology 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.129
 without a systemic degenerative process is to say that they are going 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.949
 that starts when the so-called basic system of physics gets dirty affecting 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.389
 to functioning mitochondria of cells 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.739
 and these in an attempt to survive 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.789
 start the mechanism of cellular fornication 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.919
 what we call k 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.229
 that is, if the extracellular matrix supports the logic of the basic system 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:49.379
 and fiscal solidifies is poisoned or generates 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.979
 it stops coming this way it generated sadness the cells 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.229
 and therefore to their mitochondria 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:58.799
 There are many different pathologies, cancer, and the detection of 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.639
 species we could be 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.039
 Act 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.039
 now prevent these types of cancer 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.129
 it can be done if the diagnosis is made 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.549
 precocious with 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.719
 side long enough before the 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.599
 in the development of the tumor could be done but there are others 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.859
 moncada to the cancer there deficits that was of has to prove it in the 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.349
 patients for example in 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.459
 the case of prostate cancer 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.579
 Most cases are 12 17 5 Extremadura 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:36.180
 we decided to your patients before it should arise from a tumor we could help them 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:37.899
 to prevent cancer 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:38.840
 for good 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.470
 Internal omar dirty is a sea that yields little and also information subject 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.859
 and the energy 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.919
 of its good condition depends therefore what vital functions such as transmission 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.529
 of water oxygen and electrolytes are correct and the body can 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.129
 stay in balance with an ideal peak 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.889
 the problem is how to assess that situation in order to treat it 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.079
 and with Melissa in assure respect 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.989
 Nowadays, only the diagnosis with a default device allows to evaluate the 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.549
 real state of mitochondrial function 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.769
 with him he can tell up tells me quantitatively how much energy 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.709
 produce the cells 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.789
 everything said would explain it in detail in his presentation 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 there 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.159
 for maradona
