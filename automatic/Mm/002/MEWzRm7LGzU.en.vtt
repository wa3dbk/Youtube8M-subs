00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.280 
appearance of being hot these two
scientists<00:03:14.030> have<00:03:14.360> said<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:14.989> they<00:03:15.140> are

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
scientists have said that they are

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.000 
scientists have said that they are

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.990 
Sun that's where the magnetic field
lines<00:03:21.230> are<00:03:21.500> simplest<00:03:21.950> they<00:03:22.160> they<00:03:22.640> come<00:03:22.880> away

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
lines are simplest they they come away

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.060 
lines are simplest they they come away
from<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.420> Sun<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.930> they<00:03:24.680> enter

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
from the Sun and they enter

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.820 
from the Sun and they enter
interplanetary<00:03:25.970> space<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:27.410> there<00:03:27.799> you

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
interplanetary space and so there you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.800 
interplanetary space and so there you
have<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.070> fairly<00:03:28.430> simple<00:03:28.730> structure<00:03:29.180> now<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
have a fairly simple structure now the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.570 
have a fairly simple structure now the
electrical<00:03:30.410> model<00:03:30.530> points<00:03:30.950> out<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.280> the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
electrical model points out that the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.670 
electrical model points out that the
coronal<00:03:32.120> holes<00:03:32.360> are<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.840> regions<00:03:33.260> where<00:03:33.620> the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
coronal holes are the regions where the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.370 
coronal holes are the regions where the
particles<00:03:34.459> are<00:03:34.760> accelerated<00:03:34.910> away<00:03:35.750> from<00:03:36.019> the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
particles are accelerated away from the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.160 
particles are accelerated away from the
Sun<00:03:36.650> electrically<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.670> appear<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.750> be<00:03:38.870> cooler

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
Sun electrically and appear to be cooler

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.400 
Sun electrically and appear to be cooler
simply<00:03:39.709> because<00:03:40.100> they<00:03:40.730> are<00:03:40.760> not<00:03:41.060> colliding<00:03:42.049> so

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
simply because they are not colliding so

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.530 
simply because they are not colliding so
much<00:03:42.620> with<00:03:42.950> surrounding<00:03:43.640> matter<00:03:44.209> and

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
much with surrounding matter and

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.960 
much with surrounding matter and
therefore<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.650> apparent<00:03:46.190> temperature<00:03:46.400> is

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
therefore the apparent temperature is

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.539 
therefore the apparent temperature is
lowest<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:47.959> yet<00:03:48.380> their<00:03:48.560> velocity<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.160> highest

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
lowest and yet their velocity is highest

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.509 
lowest and yet their velocity is highest
