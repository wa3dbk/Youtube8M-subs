they<00:00:27.080> first<00:00:27.590> hatched<00:00:27.890> out<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.430> egg<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:29.000> put

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
they first hatched out of the egg I put

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.540 
they first hatched out of the egg I put
them<00:00:29.660> in<00:00:29.780> here<00:00:30.110> and<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.890> water<00:00:31.100> level<00:00:31.460> is

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
them in here and the water level is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.810 
them in here and the water level is
about<00:00:31.700> 2<00:00:31.910> here<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:33.040> you<00:00:34.040> want<00:00:34.310> to<00:00:34.460> do<00:00:34.610> that

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
about 2 here and you want to do that

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.910 
about 2 here and you want to do that
like<00:00:35.480> just<00:00:35.840> an<00:00:35.930> inch<00:00:36.140> of<00:00:36.740> water<00:00:37.180> because<00:00:38.920> the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
like just an inch of water because the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.470 
like just an inch of water because the
water<00:00:39.950> pressure<00:00:40.520> can<00:00:40.760> really<00:00:41.030> affect<00:00:41.300> their

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
water pressure can really affect their

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.010 
water pressure can really affect their
swim<00:00:41.720> bladder<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:44.120> less<00:00:44.329> water<00:00:44.630> pressure

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
swim bladder and the less water pressure

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.310 
swim bladder and the less water pressure
they<00:00:45.290> have<00:00:45.320> also<00:00:45.920> helps<00:00:46.610> them<00:00:46.760> save<00:00:47.090> energy

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
they have also helps them save energy

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.400 
they have also helps them save energy
and<00:00:48.850> then<00:00:49.850> when<00:00:50.210> they<00:00:50.329> were<00:00:50.390> 2<00:00:50.660> weeks<00:00:50.840> old<00:00:51.050> I

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
and then when they were 2 weeks old I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.190 
and then when they were 2 weeks old I
feel<00:00:51.800> it's<00:00:51.980> here<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:53.480> was<00:00:53.600> mainly<00:00:53.810> just

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
feel it's here and that was mainly just

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.930 
feel it's here and that was mainly just
so<00:00:54.590> that<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.829> sponge<00:00:55.100> filter<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:55.700> added

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
so that the sponge filter that I added

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.540 
so that the sponge filter that I added
to<00:00:56.090> their<00:00:56.329> tank<00:00:56.630> could<00:00:57.230> run<00:00:57.470> properly<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.370> I

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
to their tank could run properly and I

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.910 
to their tank could run properly and I
added<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.940> sponge<00:00:59.239> filter<00:00:59.660> because<00:01:00.620> at<00:01:00.770> 2

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
added the sponge filter because at 2

into this tank and it is there's their
little<00:01:43.609> sponge<00:01:43.880> filter<00:01:44.319> but<00:01:45.319> every<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:46.179> think

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
little sponge filter but every I think

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.629 
little sponge filter but every I think
every<00:01:47.659> three<00:01:47.929> days<00:01:48.049> or<00:01:48.289> so<00:01:48.499> I'll<00:01:49.189> add<00:01:49.399> a<00:01:49.429> little

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
every three days or so I'll add a little

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:51.550 
every three days or so I'll add a little
bit<00:01:49.819> more<00:01:50.029> water<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.539> this<00:01:50.749> tank<00:01:51.049> until<00:01:51.259> it's

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
bit more water to this tank until it's

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.919 
bit more water to this tank until it's
full<00:01:51.969> but<00:01:52.969> I<00:01:53.149> don't<00:01:53.359> think<00:01:53.569> I'm<00:01:53.630> going<00:01:53.749> to<00:01:53.779> do

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
full but I don't think I'm going to do

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.800 
full but I don't think I'm going to do
that<00:01:54.079> for<00:01:54.619> another<00:01:54.799> two<00:01:55.069> weeks<00:01:55.099> because

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
that for another two weeks because

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.999 
that for another two weeks because
they've<00:01:56.810> gotten<00:01:57.109> from<00:01:57.349> about<00:01:57.590> two<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:57.889> a<00:01:57.950> half

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
they've gotten from about two and a half

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.099 
they've gotten from about two and a half
gallons<00:01:58.459> of<00:01:58.520> water<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.819> five<00:01:59.179> so<00:01:59.840> it's<00:01:59.959> already

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
gallons of water to five so it's already

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.159 
gallons of water to five so it's already
doubled<00:02:00.639> so<00:02:01.639> we're<00:02:01.759> not<00:02:01.909> going<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.240> increase

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:03.169 
doubled so we're not going to increase

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:07.390 
doubled so we're not going to increase
their<00:02:03.499> water<00:02:04.389> gallons<00:02:05.799> anytime<00:02:06.799> soon

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
their water gallons anytime soon

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.999 
their water gallons anytime soon
but<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.660> what<00:02:08.840> I've<00:02:08.960> added<00:02:09.170> full<00:02:09.560> fleex

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
but this is what I've added full fleex

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.950 
but this is what I've added full fleex
and<00:02:10.450> what<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:13.390> started<00:02:14.390> at<00:02:14.510> two<00:02:14.750> weeks

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
and what I do is I started at two weeks

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.440 
and what I do is I started at two weeks
and<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.440> they're<00:02:15.590> going<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.770> six<00:02:16.220> rounds<00:02:16.670> so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
and then they're going to six rounds so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.380 
and then they're going to six rounds so
today<00:02:18.020> they<00:02:18.320> got<00:02:18.440> their<00:02:18.650> third<00:02:18.860> round<00:02:19.390> so

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
today they got their third round so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.600 
today they got their third round so
every<00:02:20.780> Tuesday<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.040> next<00:02:22.370> three<00:02:22.520> weeks

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
every Tuesday for the next three weeks

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.900 
every Tuesday for the next three weeks
they'll<00:02:22.970> get<00:02:23.120> one<00:02:23.300> more<00:02:23.420> round<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:25.430> you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
they'll get one more round and as you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.140 
they'll get one more round and as you
can<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.120> right<00:02:27.080> now<00:02:27.140> they're<00:02:27.410> eating<00:02:28.150> they're

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
can see right now they're eating they're

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.900 
can see right now they're eating they're
eating<00:02:29.180> baby<00:02:29.690> brine<00:02:30.020> shrimp<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:31.370> started

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
eating baby brine shrimp and I started

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.360 
eating baby brine shrimp and I started
that<00:02:32.440> as<00:02:33.440> soon<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:35.020> they<00:02:36.020> hatched<00:02:36.290> all<00:02:37.280> right

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
that as soon as they hatched all right

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.640 
that as soon as they hatched all right
it<00:02:37.910> was<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> little<00:02:38.720> early<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.260> will<00:02:39.410> admit

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
it was a little early I will admit

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.170 
it was a little early I will admit
because<00:02:39.860> I<00:02:40.160> wanted<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.580> make<00:02:40.730> sure<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
because I wanted to make sure that the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.820 
because I wanted to make sure that the
brine<00:02:41.390> shrimp<00:02:41.420> eggs<00:02:41.840> they<00:02:42.230> had<00:02:42.440> were<00:02:42.590> still

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
brine shrimp eggs they had were still

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.920 
brine shrimp eggs they had were still
good<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.820> hadn't<00:02:44.090> used<00:02:44.180> them<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.630> couple

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
good so I hadn't used them for a couple

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.030 
good so I hadn't used them for a couple
years<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:46.270> then<00:02:47.270> if<00:02:47.540> you're<00:02:47.720> new<00:02:48.170> with<00:02:48.800> brine

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
years and then if you're new with brine

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.400 
years and then if you're new with brine
shrimp<00:02:49.070> eggs<00:02:49.490> and<00:02:50.060> hatching<00:02:50.390> them<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:51.230> want

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
shrimp eggs and hatching them you want

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.199 
shrimp eggs and hatching them you want
to<00:02:51.470> do<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.620> couple<00:02:52.010> trial<00:02:52.280> runs<00:02:52.550> make<00:02:52.910> sure<00:02:53.090> you

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
to do a couple trial runs make sure you

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.480 
to do a couple trial runs make sure you
get<00:02:53.300> it<00:02:53.420> right<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.470> don't<00:02:54.680> end<00:02:55.340> up

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
get it right so that you don't end up

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.400 
get it right so that you don't end up
with<00:02:55.550> nothing<00:02:56.500> some<00:02:57.500> people<00:02:57.770> do<00:02:58.630> do<00:02:59.630> like

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
with nothing some people do do like

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.840 
with nothing some people do do like
liquid<00:03:00.800> fry<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:02.180> first<00:03:02.959> bites<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.680> egg<00:03:04.370> yolks

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
liquid fry and first bites and egg yolks

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.480 
liquid fry and first bites and egg yolks
I<00:03:04.940> even<00:03:05.090> never<00:03:05.390> tried<00:03:05.720> those<00:03:06.220> because<00:03:07.220> the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
I even never tried those because the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.960 
I even never tried those because the
brine<00:03:07.700> shrimp<00:03:07.730> eggs<00:03:08.150> in<00:03:08.530> brine<00:03:09.530> shrimp<00:03:09.970> have

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
brine shrimp eggs in brine shrimp have

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.790 
brine shrimp eggs in brine shrimp have
worked<00:03:11.630> really<00:03:11.900> well<00:03:12.019> for<00:03:12.320> me<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.590> past

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
worked really well for me in the past

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.420 
worked really well for me in the past
and<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.330> their<00:03:14.800> food<00:03:15.800> right<00:03:16.040> there<00:03:16.070> in

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
and this is their food right there in

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.280 
and this is their food right there in
that<00:03:16.580> jar<00:03:16.930> all<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:18.019> do<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:19.040> fill<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.760> up<00:03:20.290> to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
that jar all I do is I fill it up to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.340 
that jar all I do is I fill it up to
around<00:03:21.590> where<00:03:21.830> this<00:03:21.950> water<00:03:22.190> level<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.670> there

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
around where this water level is there

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.850 
around where this water level is there
with<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.380> fish<00:03:25.010> water<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.810> tried<00:03:26.810> just<00:03:27.170> straight

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
with a fish water I tried just straight

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.710 
with a fish water I tried just straight
tap<00:03:28.070> water<00:03:28.340> which<00:03:28.550> Prime<00:03:28.850> added<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.390> it

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
tap water which Prime added to it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.690 
tap water which Prime added to it
for<00:03:30.170> some<00:03:30.350> reason<00:03:30.680> just<00:03:30.709> as<00:03:31.040> an<00:03:31.160> hatch<00:03:31.310> as<00:03:31.519> well

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
for some reason just as an hatch as well

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.750 
for some reason just as an hatch as well
is<00:03:32.000> if<00:03:32.360> you<00:03:32.450> just<00:03:32.480> take<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:34.010> couple<00:03:34.489> cups<00:03:34.640> of

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
is if you just take a couple cups of

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.150 
is if you just take a couple cups of
water<00:03:34.940> out<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.360> tank<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.890> then<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:36.980> add

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
water out of the tank and then you add

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.770 
water out of the tank and then you add
salt<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.959> is<00:03:39.140> what<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.350> use<00:03:40.600> there's<00:03:41.600> no

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
salt this is what I use there's no

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.860 
salt this is what I use there's no
specific<00:03:42.080> measurements<00:03:43.269> because<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.480> found

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
specific measurements because I found

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.180 
specific measurements because I found
out<00:03:45.140> you<00:03:45.440> know<00:03:45.470> if<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.769> do<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.040> same

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
out you know if you do the same

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.920 
out you know if you do the same
measurements<00:03:46.640> all<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.850> time<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.810> might

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
measurements all the time you might

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.770 
measurements all the time you might
still<00:03:48.230> have<00:03:48.470> something<00:03:49.600> it's<00:03:50.600> not<00:03:50.720> going

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
still have something it's not going

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.380 
still have something it's not going
right<00:03:51.019> and<00:03:53.110> it's<00:03:54.110> just

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
right and it's just

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.340 
right and it's just
it<00:03:55.990> doesn't<00:03:56.290> always<00:03:56.380> work<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.819> just<00:03:58.060> do

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
it doesn't always work so I just do

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.050 
it doesn't always work so I just do
however<00:03:59.350> much<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.830> want<00:04:00.069> of<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.490> salt<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.880> there

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
however much I want of a salt in there

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.780 
however much I want of a salt in there
just<00:04:01.600> make<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.990> nice<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.140> salty<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:03.310> salty<00:04:03.670> or

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
just make it nice and salty the salty or

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.490 
just make it nice and salty the salty or
the<00:04:03.910> better<00:04:04.090> kind<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:05.110> you<00:04:05.200> don't<00:04:05.380> put

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
the better kind of so you don't put

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.690 
the better kind of so you don't put
enough<00:04:05.530> in<00:04:05.890> you're<00:04:06.069> not<00:04:06.190> going<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.430> get<00:04:06.520> a<00:04:06.550> good

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
enough in you're not going to get a good

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.870 
enough in you're not going to get a good
hatch<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.440> then<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:09.010> just<00:04:09.459> add<00:04:10.620> maybe<00:04:11.620> I'd<00:04:12.550> say

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
hatch and then I just add maybe I'd say

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.449 
hatch and then I just add maybe I'd say
it's<00:04:13.060> about<00:04:13.300> an<00:04:13.900> eighth<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.830> teaspoon<00:04:14.980> maybe

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
it's about an eighth of a teaspoon maybe

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.060 
it's about an eighth of a teaspoon maybe
a<00:04:15.520> fourth<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.630> brine<00:04:16.840> shrimp<00:04:16.870> eggs<00:04:17.260> and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
a fourth of the brine shrimp eggs and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.900 
a fourth of the brine shrimp eggs and
then<00:04:18.910> just<00:04:19.269> put<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.810> air<00:04:20.440> stone<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.070> that's

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
then just put the air stone in it that's

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.760 
then just put the air stone in it that's
why<00:04:22.090> all<00:04:22.270> all<00:04:22.540> these<00:04:22.870> are<00:04:23.080> appears<00:04:23.500> because

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
why all all these are appears because

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.440 
why all all these are appears because
that's<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.100> air<00:04:24.220> stone<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:27.240> usually<00:04:28.240> have

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
that's the air stone and I usually have

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.190 
that's the air stone and I usually have
hatch<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:29.169> really<00:04:29.470> good<00:04:29.590> hatch<00:04:29.800> rate<00:04:30.070> within<00:04:31.200> 24

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
hatch a really good hatch rate within 24

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.290 
hatch a really good hatch rate within 24
hours<00:04:32.230> like<00:04:33.190> this<00:04:33.340> one<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.640> started<00:04:34.090> yesterday

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
hours like this one I started yesterday

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.430 
hours like this one I started yesterday
and<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:36.370> got<00:04:36.580> all<00:04:36.910> those<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.510> there<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:38.260> hatch

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
and I got all those in there to hatch

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.150 
and I got all those in there to hatch
within<00:04:38.710> 24<00:04:39.250> hours<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:40.200> that's<00:04:41.200> probably<00:04:41.890> due

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
within 24 hours and that's probably due

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.740 
within 24 hours and that's probably due
to<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.400> brine<00:04:42.610> shrimp<00:04:42.640> eggs<00:04:43.120> brand<00:04:43.510> that<00:04:43.690> I

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
you'll probably think I'm crazy but it's

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.830 
you'll probably think I'm crazy but it's
this<00:04:56.560> huge<00:04:56.830> jar<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.090> keep<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.450> the<00:04:58.540> freezer

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
this huge jar and I keep in the freezer

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.000 
this huge jar and I keep in the freezer
and<00:04:59.729> it's<00:05:00.729> been<00:05:01.240> blasting<00:05:02.169> me<00:05:02.350> for<00:05:02.560> about<00:05:02.710> four

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
and it's been blasting me for about four

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.280 
and it's been blasting me for about four
or<00:05:03.070> five<00:05:03.220> years<00:05:03.520> now<00:05:03.660> since<00:05:04.660> I<00:05:04.870> was<00:05:04.900> grading

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
or five years now since I was grading

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:16.260 
or five years now since I was grading
angelfish<00:05:09.060> so<00:05:10.470> that's<00:05:11.470> their<00:05:11.770> food<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:15.270> even

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
angelfish so that's their food and even

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.580 
angelfish so that's their food and even
though<00:05:16.390> they're<00:05:16.570> in<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.690> basement<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.410> don't

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
though they're in the basement I don't

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.800

have a heater on here they do have a

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.170 
have a heater on here they do have a
couple<00:05:23.050> live<00:05:23.380> plants<00:05:23.800> in<00:05:23.890> here<00:05:24.070> from<00:05:24.970> the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
couple live plants in here from the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.640 
couple live plants in here from the
angelfish<00:05:25.780> tank<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.500> that's<00:05:26.710> just<00:05:27.100> to<00:05:27.340> help

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
angelfish tank and that's just to help

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.070 
angelfish tank and that's just to help
supplement<00:05:29.650> them<00:05:30.160> when<00:05:30.310> they<00:05:30.430> were<00:05:30.490> little

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
supplement them when they were little

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.860 
supplement them when they were little
babies<00:05:32.080> before<00:05:32.560> food

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.250 

I<00:05:37.880> don't<00:05:38.880> really<00:05:39.090> think<00:05:39.180> there's<00:05:39.810> much<00:05:40.050> more

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
I don't really think there's much more

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.430 
I don't really think there's much more
to<00:05:40.410> cover<00:05:40.590> other<00:05:40.800> than<00:05:41.070> that<00:05:42.080> if<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.260> do<00:05:43.410> have

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
to cover other than that if you do have

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.180 
to cover other than that if you do have
the<00:05:44.040> larger<00:05:44.520> batches<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.690> frying<00:05:45.960> you<00:05:46.860> want

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
the larger batches of frying you want

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.630 
the larger batches of frying you want
bigger<00:05:48.000> tanks<00:05:48.390> of<00:05:48.540> course<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.340> this<00:05:50.340> more

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
bigger tanks of course and this more

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.070 
bigger tanks of course and this more
shallow<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.300> tanks<00:05:51.600> the<00:05:51.750> better<00:05:52.400> so<00:05:53.400> this<00:05:53.580> big

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
shallow the tanks the better so this big

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.840 
shallow the tanks the better so this big
Rubbermaid<00:05:55.280> things<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:56.490> you<00:05:56.580> would<00:05:56.700> roll
