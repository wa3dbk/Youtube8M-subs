00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.839
 very cool information here for 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.850
 bring you about the new 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.859
 update that came out another of these four 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.660
 and one more I'm going to tell you 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.830
 here at the end of the beauty video as 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.029
 then start with the information from the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.250
 authorization. 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.490
 brought April update on her 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.750
 brought three new clothes from 64 hard 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.590
 celebrating the day of the star wars not 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 knows 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.840
 yesterday on May 4 is celebrated the day 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.360
 Star wars galeras are talking about the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.430
 star wars everything and did not decide how many 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 Sometimes they added this is the one that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.210
 You see he also brought a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.460
 new loading screen that many 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.289
 are saying that apparently she 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 lets you load faster 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.559
 lots and everything else 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.510
 it looks like the other screen will take a while 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.829
 more to be able to load right 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.260
 but I do not know, I did not feel much 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.969
 difference in this payment only to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.890
 me that is more beautiful and simpler I 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.960
 I liked 10 more than the other but 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.330
 sincerely in this matter of delay 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.549
 more than you faster these things I 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.990
 I did not feel any difference of a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.030
 to another and was also 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.950
 added a new emotion that is the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.509
 jealousy guy exactly our movies 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 may be jealous of your interest 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.450
 romantic 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.939
 the z does not necessarily result in 3 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.020
 really married more difficult girlfriend 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.670
 know what this is right? 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.740
 and this is very interesting because now 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.409
 We know they can be included. 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 more emotions in the game as is 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.650
 passing updates even 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.259
 triggering expansions for game type 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.170
 the more we've already had this idea 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.090
 that they could cause 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.650
 through updates other things 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.780
 could add new emotions 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.549
 I think this is just a proof that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.920
 they are wanting to add more 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.320
 making game emotions more real 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.300
 game still moves 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.040
 Well cool, I have not seen it yet. 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.510
 it is running this month four and 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.520
 now you can also manipulate the 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.750
 gender of their children if they so right 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.210
 you are pregnant right? 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.130
 Are you eating more strawberries than you? 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.869
 people of their unborn baby girls if you 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.250
 eating more carrots is more likely to 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.960
 born boy you can then manipulate 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.750
 the gender of their children as well as 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.720
 happened in 2003 when you ate more 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.300
 not so anyway there is same in the sims 3 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.070
 and now we can do it in 2004 and 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.150
 now that we've talked about the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.160
 information here 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.440
 yesterday's update let's talk about 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.770
 which may happen in the next 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.390
 registered as James and that the 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.770
 twitter link it will have in the description 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.600
 of the video for you 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.910
 He sent me that picture because 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.160
 he found the 2004 internal files 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.170
 after the update of yesterday this 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.150
 The phrase you are looking at indicates 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.850
 a possible collection of objects that will 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.590
 if you call it a luxury party and also said 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.250
 who will take the test in the week that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.040
 come on 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.989
 and this may be very true even because 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.850
 if you open the internal files you 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.800
 You will be able to find that and moreover 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.500
 happened the same thing with the air retreat 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.330
 free they posted a week ago 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.310
 speaking that to launch one give a package 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.870
 with more and brought some things well 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.299
 interesting the galera ended up finding the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.940
 internal files is also about shooting 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.410
 free then it's turned custom said 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.720
 has an update the guys start to 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.850
 search the internal files from the 4 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.890
 Something, but I honestly do not 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.380
 wanted a collection of objects in fact 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.090
 I do not want to create objects because it's 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.890
 We already have a game pack for 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.930
 To buy people already has functions and now 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.880
 It has as objects is a lot and I 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.310
 I find this very ridiculous but what I 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.510
 I had already spoken to you before 2004 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.910
 cast right 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.010
 is the cycle that we could have one of the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.989
 four was his game package that 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.230
 a game package was announced in the future 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.750
 nes expansions and with that object then 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.150
 this seems to be our cycle of 64 is 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.560
 that will happen to launch should be him 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.780
 because in this expansion 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.310
 then we eat objects then we 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.440
 You have to buy three things I do not 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.500
 I wanted this to happen unfortunately. 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.350
 it is not because the game package already brings a 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.239
 Interesting thing I thought it was 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.069
 price of an object position and the 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.769
 replace replaced something 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.810
 the object but it seems that not it is not too 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.239
 remember that only when the object can 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.609
 have a slightly lower value it can 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.950
 cost less for us then I believe 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.950
 that it will cost in the vicinity of 20 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.079
 real out there depending on how much 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.359
 objects that he will come is that it can be 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.759
 It's worth it but I do not think it will. 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.139
 worth as much only if a noise only 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.370
 some things there right? 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.530
 but anyway it's something else for us 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.150
 buy one by one the things that 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.340
 to me they could add in shape 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.199
 update bringing a need 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.870
 object condition charging for money 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.970
 For this, but we'll wait and on the week. 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.410
 that comes to see about this condition of 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.060
 object, we'll wait and see if we can 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.680
 after this collection of objects they 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.169
 announce something more interesting 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.139
 is a game pack or an expansion 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.550
 That way we can save money is 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.539
 for more interesting things too 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.150
 in the future 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.520
 So how have the rumors of the pet being 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.770
 with a role of play asks to be like a 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.060
 The next expansion is believed that people 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.889
 has more interesting things than 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.360
 that 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.490
 this condition of object for life 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.930
 So let's wait and we'll wait for the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.710
 week to see what will 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.120
 to happen 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.680
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.780
 You liked this video was very fast. 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.460
 only release information even and not 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.930
 forget to check out a video from yesterday 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.630
 because you had a very interesting video 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.789
 on modifying the super crazy crazy way 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.289
 crazy that shows our teams going 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.360
 for school we can interact there 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.430
 and everything else was the book did then 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.289
 very top very little even was already 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.150
 giving more time to give a check 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.009
 here on my channel and download the mod 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.509
 remembering that the mold must have a 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.099
 of these four work to run if 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.509
 you have not since you work you 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.789
 will not be able to run because it works 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.740
 with the same mechanics that come with 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.090
 responsible for the beauty space then it is 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.470
 this commits the comments that you 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.909
 they found this condition of object that 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.810
 Did you find the April update 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.699
 which I thought was very interesting 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.469
 pretty pretty cool stuff 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.969
 so that's it guys until the next video 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:48.969
 so I went
