00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.020
 naturally talking about what 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.340
 the best buy is in the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.359

 price-quality ratio per platform 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 in addition, still have tablet category and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.129
 a category for smartphones that still 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.449
 are not on the market 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.520
 they will all go through close 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.020
 of course every day one comes 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.070
 new category around and the end of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.060
 that week will be like you from us 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.710
 to be used to 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.809
 the full video on our youtube channel 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.610
 we turn to look for the best 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.280
 value for money and 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.899
 is the we g510 patient of your we already 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.820
 their fate category ended up 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.660
 the best smartphone in our opinion 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.219
 android area can 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.170
 value for money 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.270
 as said it's a phone with a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.219
 reasonable dual-core processor four and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.670
 half inch screen with design 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.979
 so just yes everything to a good android 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.450
 he has experience to offer 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.549
 and that for a very low price 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.799
 nothing less than the 50 euros so well that 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.299
 is just very neat and achab looking 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.770
 to an android device that still 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.299
 offers a good experience for a low 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 price then this give them around 10 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.950
 just the places to be 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.630
 winners of field it is a bit 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.340
 awkward and we have the ativs 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.780
 selected as the phone with the best 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.970
 value for money 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.659
 simply because it offers a lot more 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.000
 for 200 euros than the nokia lumia 520 that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.070
 also that we are 520 is eligible 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.390
 with 120 euros a lot cheaper and still 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.220
 always a good windows phone so if 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.900
 you really for the least money a whole 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.210
 good binders from the start 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.340
 those 25 are only the a fast the beat 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.930
 80 euros more than so much more 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.040
 that they still find better in terms of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.810
 value for money 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.290
 he much too much better screen much 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.180
 better camera faster processor it is 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.920
 just basically a samsung galaxy s3 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.729
 but with peanuts from licorice and before 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.040
 little money 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.180
 so that will be very nice hello 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.470
 tyler is the best in terms of area 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.030
 value for money is what us 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.040
 concerns the iphone 5 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 he five, of course, actually 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.680
 replaced on the market by the iphone 5c 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.700
 but for now there is just still 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.249
 available 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.959
 so yes it's still just one 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.760
 better deal than the iphone 5c has us 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.830
 concerns 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.300
 the device is just as expensive or expensive 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.920
 maybe even something cheaper does 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.580
 much better build quality and is internal 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.250
 actually exactly the same so the iphone 5 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.190
 is just a much better deal 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.680
 unless your ltd supports all lt bands 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.209
 iphone 5c iphone 5 not on but then would 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.250
 I really the only advantage of the iPhone 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.780
 5c versus the iphone 5 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.730
 so if you don't like those lt tires 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.440
 find important and kpn 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.050
 which is also possible with lt of the iphone 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.550
 5 handle so yes then that iphone is 5 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.260
 just a much better choice 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.480
 and if you don't have the money for it 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.310
 iphone 5s is just iphone mail then 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.510
 The iPhone 5 was a very good choice 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.170
 another new category from ours 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.550
