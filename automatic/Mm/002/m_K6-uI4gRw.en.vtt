position<00:00:39.980> we<00:00:40.070> want<00:00:40.219> to<00:00:40.280> look<00:00:40.399> at<00:00:40.579> is<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.820> down

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
position we want to look at is the down

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.580 
position we want to look at is the down
the<00:00:41.120> line<00:00:41.270> recovery<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:42.170> can<00:00:42.320> see<00:00:42.469> that

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
the line recovery so you can see that

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.139 
the line recovery so you can see that
char<00:00:42.890> DS<00:00:43.010> gonna<00:00:43.100> go<00:00:43.309> down<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.700> line<00:00:43.850> with<00:00:43.910> his

char DS gonna go down the line with his

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.209 
char DS gonna go down the line with his
backhand<00:00:44.660> slice<00:00:44.930> here<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:45.710> we<00:00:45.800> want<00:00:46.010> to<00:00:46.070> look

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
backhand slice here and we want to look

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.010 
backhand slice here and we want to look
at<00:00:46.370> where<00:00:46.520> he<00:00:46.550> recovers<00:00:47.180> -<00:00:47.360> based<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:47.870> his

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
at where he recovers - based on his

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.720 
at where he recovers - based on his
slice<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:48.590> he<00:00:48.710> actually<00:00:49.039> hits<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.250> shot<00:00:49.489> here

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
slice so he actually hits the shot here

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.910 
slice so he actually hits the shot here
-<00:00:49.820> dimitrov<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.539> then<00:00:50.989> as<00:00:51.110> dimitrov<00:00:51.680> gets

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
- dimitrov and then as dimitrov gets

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.920 
- dimitrov and then as dimitrov gets
ready<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.219> set<00:00:52.430> up<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.670> hit<00:00:52.879> we<00:00:53.300> can<00:00:53.480> see<00:00:53.690> that

center of the court so Chartier up at

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.680 
center of the court so Chartier up at
the<00:01:42.860> top<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.340> screen<00:01:43.670> ends<00:01:44.450> up<00:01:44.570> hitting

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
the top of the screen ends up hitting

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.320 
the top of the screen ends up hitting
this<00:01:44.960> forehand<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.700> middle<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.060> court

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
this forehand to the middle of the court

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.000 
this forehand to the middle of the court
with<00:01:47.480> some<00:01:47.660> angle<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.620> when<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.800> hit

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
with some angle on it and when you hit

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.920 
with some angle on it and when you hit
with<00:01:49.100> some<00:01:49.280> angle<00:01:49.610> on<00:01:49.790> your<00:01:50.000> shot<00:01:50.300> your

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
with some angle on your shot your

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.350 
with some angle on your shot your
recovery<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.770> factored<00:01:52.490> into<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:52.910> angle<00:01:53.330> so

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
recovery is factored into that angle so

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.820 
recovery is factored into that angle so
what<00:01:53.630> we're<00:01:53.780> looking<00:01:53.810> at<00:01:54.080> here<00:01:54.140> is<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.590> green

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
what we're looking at here is the green

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.040 
what we're looking at here is the green
circle<00:01:55.520> position<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.390> yellow<00:01:56.660> circle

position and the red and char DS gonna

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.990 
position and the red and char DS gonna
recover<00:01:59.450> more<00:01:59.990> towards<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.160> green<00:02:01.490> position

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
recover more towards the green position

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.270 
recover more towards the green position
here<00:02:02.330> because<00:02:02.660> he<00:02:02.750> provided<00:02:03.110> some<00:02:03.500> angle<00:02:04.100> on

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
here because he provided some angle on

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.800 
here because he provided some angle on
his<00:02:04.580> shot<00:02:04.850> even<00:02:05.270> though<00:02:05.360> he<00:02:05.450> hit<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.690> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
his shot even though he hit to the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.540 
his shot even though he hit to the
center<00:02:06.050> of<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.200> court<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:06.710> when<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.340> hit<00:02:07.430> to

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
center of the court so when you hit to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.559 
center of the court so when you hit to
the<00:02:07.670> middle<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:07.970> court<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.239> should<00:02:08.330> not

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
the middle of the court you should not

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.690 
the middle of the court you should not
recover<00:02:08.959> exactly<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.770> center<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.310> should

recover exactly to the center you should

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.370 
recover exactly to the center you should
still<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.090> slightly<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.840> half<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.230> you

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
still be slightly on the half that you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.280 
still be slightly on the half that you
hit<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.710> ball<00:02:12.740> from<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.930> as<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.080> review

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
hit the ball from so just as a review

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.450 
hit the ball from so just as a review
when<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:15.890> go<00:02:16.070> down

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
when you go down

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.740 
when you go down
the<00:02:16.520> line<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.850> want<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.060> make<00:02:17.180> sure<00:02:17.210> that<00:02:17.600> you

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the line you want to make sure that you

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.020 
the line you want to make sure that you
recover<00:02:18.110> towards<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.190> center<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.700> court

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
recover towards the center of the court

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.270 
recover towards the center of the court
or<00:02:20.900> on<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.260> same<00:02:21.470> side<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.010> court<00:02:22.220> that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
or on the same side of the court that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.950 
or on the same side of the court that
you<00:02:22.490> hit<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> ball<00:02:22.940> from<00:02:23.150> most<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.690> time

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
you hit the ball from most of the time

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.810 
you hit the ball from most of the time
and<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.350> reason<00:02:24.530> for<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.550> your

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
and the reason for this is that your

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.550 
and the reason for this is that your
opponent<00:02:26.210> can<00:02:26.330> easily<00:02:26.750> go<00:02:26.900> back<00:02:26.930> down<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
opponent can easily go back down the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.260 
opponent can easily go back down the
line<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:28.040> not<00:02:28.400> change<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> direction<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.150> the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
line and not change the direction of the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.390 
line and not change the direction of the
ball<00:02:29.420> or<00:02:29.570> they<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.200> also<00:02:30.470> go<00:02:30.770> cross-court

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
ball or they can also go cross-court

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.490 
ball or they can also go cross-court
which<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.640> high<00:02:31.850> percentage<00:02:32.090> shot<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.410> they

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
which is a high percentage shot so they

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.870 
which is a high percentage shot so they
can<00:02:33.620> go<00:02:33.710> in<00:02:33.800> either<00:02:33.980> direction<00:02:34.100> on<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.760> when

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
can go in either direction on you when

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.420 
can go in either direction on you when
you<00:02:34.970> go<00:02:35.060> down<00:02:35.270> line<00:02:36.160> when<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.250> hit

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
you go down line when you hit

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.890 
you go down line when you hit
cross-court<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.120> should<00:02:38.270> recover<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
cross-court you should recover to the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.570 
cross-court you should recover to the
same<00:02:39.200> half<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.650> court<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.280> hit<00:02:40.460> the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
same half of the court that you hit the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.700 
same half of the court that you hit the
ball<00:02:40.610> from<00:02:41.030> because<00:02:41.570> you're<00:02:42.080> providing<00:02:42.320> an

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
ball from because you're providing an

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.200 
ball from because you're providing an
angle<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.280> your<00:02:43.460> shot<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.030> your<00:02:44.180> opponent

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
angle on your shot so if your opponent

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.850 
angle on your shot so if your opponent
goes<00:02:44.660> down<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.050> line<00:02:45.230> he's<00:02:45.410> gonna<00:02:45.530> have<00:02:45.740> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
goes down the line he's gonna have to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.100 
goes down the line he's gonna have to
change<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.340> incoming<00:02:46.880> angle<00:02:47.210> so<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:47.870> less

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
change that incoming angle so it's less

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.570 
change that incoming angle so it's less
likely<00:02:48.500> he<00:02:48.530> goes<00:02:48.800> down<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.250> line<00:02:49.370> on<00:02:49.550> that

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
likely he goes down the line on that

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.970 
likely he goes down the line on that
shot<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:50.660> he<00:02:50.780> does<00:02:51.020> you<00:02:51.350> run<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.800> ball

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
shot and if he does you run that ball

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.730 
shot and if he does you run that ball
down<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.400> hit<00:02:52.550> back<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.000> court<00:02:53.410> he's<00:02:54.410> very

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
down and hit back in the court he's very

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.620 
down and hit back in the court he's very
likely<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.250> hit<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.460> ball<00:02:55.700> back<00:02:55.970> cross-court

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
likely to hit that ball back cross-court

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.120 
likely to hit that ball back cross-court
against<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:57.500> why<00:02:57.710> you<00:02:57.770> go<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
against you so that's why you go to the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.310 
against you so that's why you go to the
green<00:02:58.370> position<00:02:58.850> instead<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.600> either<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.110> the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
green position instead of either of the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.020 
green position instead of either of the
red<00:03:00.470> positions<00:03:00.980> when<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.280> go<00:03:01.400> cross-court

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
red positions when you go cross-court

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.850 
red positions when you go cross-court
when<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:02.990> hit<00:03:03.140> down<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.500> middle<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.770> the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
when you hit down the middle of the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.890 
when you hit down the middle of the
court<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.310> should<00:03:04.760> recover<00:03:05.030> slightly<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.870> the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
court you should recover slightly to the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.990 
court you should recover slightly to the
