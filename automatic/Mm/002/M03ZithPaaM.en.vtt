know it's really short hair and I really

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.300 
know it's really short hair and I really
like<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.290> look<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.590> fact<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:08.830> want<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.040> use<00:03:09.160> it

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
like that look in fact I want to use it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.830 
like that look in fact I want to use it
in<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.490> film<00:03:09.640> obviously<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.390> has<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.570> be<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
in a film obviously it has to be the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.810 
in a film obviously it has to be the
right<00:03:10.960> role<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.890> when<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.190> kind<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.640> role

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
right role so when that kind of role

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.940 
right role so when that kind of role
comes<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.209> think<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.420> would<00:03:13.510> be<00:03:13.600> very<00:03:13.750> exciting

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.410 

whatever<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.040> mean<00:03:18.220> if<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.640> director<00:03:19.030> feels<00:03:19.239> that

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
whatever I mean if a director feels that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.360 
whatever I mean if a director feels that
that<00:03:19.600> that's<00:03:19.810> what<00:03:20.110> will<00:03:20.620> work<00:03:20.830> then<00:03:21.070> I'd<00:03:21.220> be

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that that's what will work then I'd be

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.830 
that that's what will work then I'd be
very<00:03:21.489> happy<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.850> try<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.090> actually<00:03:22.420> last

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
very happy to try it actually last

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.440 
very happy to try it actually last
