 and what 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.330
 what you have to do is worth now 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.990
 subscribed to the screen is worth it because 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.709

 we will start on this bridge but good 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.810
 what you have to do is first 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.129
 first you have to be level 30 is what 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:39.830
 basic is 30 and you have to have it 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.860
 you have to have a fishing rod and you must 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.239
 have worms or syndic if you want 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.459
 play all night bought so 

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:48.619
 minus 1200 worms worth they bought themselves is 

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:50.959
 science in science in the 50 50 

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:54.589
 working it counts and creates you as 

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:56.440
 from here here full of worms is worth 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:58.840

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.180
 so that you have fishing just good 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.730

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.520

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.910
 here to see 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.460
 that this site did not indicate it knows that 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.250
 I prefer that you do it preferably 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.729
 I do anywhere else you'd better the 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.490
 I will indicate the same to the island worth 1 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.620
 819 315 here on the island in the part 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.780
 little girl here I put myself okay because 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.699
 there comes absolutely no one here 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.190
 you can see one record yourself or something like that 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.620
 I stayed there fishing alone and good 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.800
 indicates that the rifle is worth this so that 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.750
 when we catch you burn that kill 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.960
 that to kill the fish it's worth it 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.930
 then what are you thinking this is what 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.190
 basic I always give you open keys that 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.470
 if you want to change that if you want 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.090
 let's open the clams, I will not open them 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.120
 I gave him when they have all clams already 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.440
 yes I want to open them but see them 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.770
 it's already going to your liking where they film 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.800
 drop the dead fish if I 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.569
 true that if you want us to throw the 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.060
 dye I always threw it the truth 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.830
 because when you've had a good time with 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.389
 the with the cane chain you have it 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.310
 hot starts to have taken 30 and 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.500
 ink and ink and ink and already 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.930
 I'm running out of inventory not dye 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.580
 and what I do is throw it away and be the one 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.650
 this to sell fish 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.490
 this does not have anything better than that 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.470
 do this when there is a gm or something 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.710
 lockout this physical kuyt look or I'm going to 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.930
 indicate the best slogan, but I do not 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.030
 I did it then we have more 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:45.169
 better possibilities when a game is 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:48.240
 connects the health that comes from within 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.889
 to fish stop fishing log out and 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.010
 Take care of the guitar you have to follow the game 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.320
 of the pull and good I, I always 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.419
 log out and start them and once you have 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.190
 start the uncle if he has the cane then you 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.320
 give what they use here or here where 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.360
 they are in the inventory starts 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.760
 to fish only starts fishing only at 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.500
 to fish only fishing then 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.540

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:28.670
