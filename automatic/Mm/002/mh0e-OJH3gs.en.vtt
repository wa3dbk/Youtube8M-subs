00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.260 
of a land party designed to show gamers
so<00:00:14.880> then<00:00:15.000> if<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.299> five-minute<00:00:15.920> excellent

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
so then if it's a five-minute excellent

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.970 
so then if it's a five-minute excellent
and<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.359> started<00:00:18.720> off<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> side<00:00:19.770> with

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and we started off on on the side with

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.099 
and we started off on on the side with
single<00:00:20.310> panel<00:00:20.609> over<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.570> they<00:00:21.810> play<00:00:21.990> on

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
single panel over here and they play on

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.300 
single panel over here and they play on
single<00:00:22.500> panel<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.830> they<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
single panel and they kind of get the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.710 
single panel and they kind of get the
feel<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.789> normal<00:00:24.090> way<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.180> playing<00:00:24.539> games

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
feel for the normal way of playing games

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
feel for the normal way of playing games
we've<00:00:25.019> been<00:00:25.140> doing<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.500> years<00:00:25.619> then<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.310> move

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
we've been doing for years then we move

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.189 
we've been doing for years then we move
them<00:00:26.640> over<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.599> other<00:00:27.630> side<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
them over to the other side the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.410 
them over to the other side the
eyefinity<00:00:28.680> side<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.670> farm<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.150> I've<00:00:30.300> been

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
eyefinity side so farm like I've been

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.600 
eyefinity side so farm like I've been
pretty<00:00:30.779> much<00:00:30.990> shock<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> awe<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:32.160> not<00:00:32.340> just

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
pretty much shock and awe it's not just

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.950 
pretty much shock and awe it's not just
zooming<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> picture<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.450> making<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.840> bigger

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
zooming the picture and making it bigger

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.450 
zooming the picture and making it bigger
like<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> might<00:00:34.530> expect<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> actually<00:00:35.280> adds

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
like you might expect it actually adds

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
like you might expect it actually adds
additional<00:00:35.760> resolution<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.170> you're<00:00:37.260> getting

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
additional resolution so you're getting

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.110 
additional resolution so you're getting
three<00:00:37.860> times<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.399> resolution<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
three times the resolution that you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.790 
three times the resolution that you
would<00:00:39.210> typically<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.840> which<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.559> case

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
would typically see which in this case

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.670 
would typically see which in this case
means<00:00:40.860> three<00:00:41.399> times<00:00:41.430> blu-ray<00:00:42.239> HD<00:00:42.719> quality<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
means three times blu-ray HD quality it

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
means three times blu-ray HD quality it
gives<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.100> much<00:00:44.460> larger<00:00:45.030> field<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> vision

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
gives you a much larger field of vision

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
gives you a much larger field of vision
so<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.379> addition<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.739> making<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.280> game<00:00:47.460> feel

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
so in addition to making the game feel

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.520 
so in addition to making the game feel
more<00:00:48.030> immersive<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.660> more<00:00:48.840> engulfing<00:00:49.289> it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
more immersive and more engulfing it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.080 
more immersive and more engulfing it
also<00:00:49.800> gives<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.280> advantages<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.000> your

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
also gives you advantages in your

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
also gives you advantages in your
gameplay<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> eye<00:00:52.469> affinity<00:00:52.920> set<00:00:53.129> up

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
gameplay this is the eye affinity set up

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.080 
gameplay this is the eye affinity set up
three<00:00:53.820> projectors<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:56.309> massive

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
three projectors and a just massive

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.720 
three projectors and a just massive
resolution<00:00:57.780> not<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> mention<00:00:58.730> clearly

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
resolution not to mention clearly

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.410 
resolution not to mention clearly
gigantic<00:01:00.390> screens<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.829> noticed<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
gigantic screens here I noticed that you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.119 
gigantic screens here I noticed that you
get<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.809> real<00:01:04.080> sense<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.409> peripheral<00:01:04.830> vision

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
get a real sense of peripheral vision

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.080 
get a real sense of peripheral vision
which<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.280> something<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.640> don't<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
which is something you don't get in a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.149 
which is something you don't get in a
single<00:01:06.360> monitor<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:07.290> gamers<00:01:07.650> transitioning

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
single monitor with gamers transitioning

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.440 
single monitor with gamers transitioning
from<00:01:08.369> standard<00:01:08.729> four<00:01:08.909> by<00:01:09.030> three<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
from standard four by three to

from standard four by three to
widescreen<00:01:09.930> 16:9<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.890> everybody<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.400> know

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
widescreen 16:9 and everybody you know

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
widescreen 16:9 and everybody you know
really<00:01:11.729> liked<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> difference<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
really liked the difference when you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.000 
really liked the difference when you
play<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> Eyefinity<00:01:13.439> system<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> gives

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
play on the Eyefinity system it gives

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.920 
play on the Eyefinity system it gives
you<00:01:14.130> even<00:01:14.760> more<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.270> experience<00:01:15.810> it's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you even more of that experience it's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.030 
you even more of that experience it's
something<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.350> can't<00:01:16.439> achieve<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
something you just can't achieve with a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.560 
something you just can't achieve with a
single<00:01:17.490> screen

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
single screen

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.750 
single screen
that<00:01:20.110> one<00:01:20.290> looks<00:01:20.440> really<00:01:20.620> interested<00:01:21.160> is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
that one looks really interested is

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.460 
that one looks really interested is
being<00:01:22.030> able<00:01:22.120> to<00:01:22.270> have<00:01:22.480> multiple<00:01:23.020> huts<00:01:23.260> like

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
being able to have multiple huts like

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.070 
being able to have multiple huts like
that<00:01:23.710> it's<00:01:24.130> nice<00:01:24.340> it's<00:01:24.970> really<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.630> substantial

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
that it's nice it's really a substantial

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.660 
that it's nice it's really a substantial
difference<00:01:26.590> from<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.950> single<00:01:27.280> monitor

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
difference from the single monitor

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.120 
difference from the single monitor
playing<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:29.350> thing<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.680> I<00:01:29.740> didn't<00:01:30.010> realize

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
playing one thing that I didn't realize

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.940 
playing one thing that I didn't realize
when<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:30.700> was<00:01:30.820> playing<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.240> think<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.960> was<00:01:32.500> able<00:01:32.650> to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
when I was playing I think I was able to

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.150 
when I was playing I think I was able to
actually<00:01:33.130> see<00:01:33.700> belfs<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.420> team<00:01:34.770> had<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:36.040> a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
actually see belfs a team had just a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.050 
actually see belfs a team had just a
single<00:01:36.520> one

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
single one

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.360 
single one
I<00:01:37.090> actually<00:01:37.990> went<00:01:38.320> right<00:01:38.650> past<00:01:38.680> each<00:01:39.100> other

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
I actually went right past each other

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.050 
I actually went right past each other
that's<00:01:40.060> someone<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> feel<00:01:40.660> of<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:40.900> know

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that's someone the feel of you know

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.690 
that's someone the feel of you know
so<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.510> true<00:01:42.750> around<00:01:43.280> amenities<00:01:44.280> walking

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
somewhere not just sweep of cotton I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
somewhere not just sweep of cotton I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
definitely I got more kills because of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.499 
definitely I got more kills because of
it<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.630> helped<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:53.210> little<00:01:54.210> bit<00:01:54.390> more

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
it it helped a little bit more

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
it it helped a little bit more
fast-paced<00:01:54.840> sexy<00:01:55.409> around<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.860> the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.120 
right
the<00:02:07.700> three<00:02:08.060> monitor<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.570> like<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:09.410> makes<00:02:09.710> it<00:02:09.890> so

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
the three monitor is like it makes it so

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.220 
the three monitor is like it makes it so
you<00:02:10.190> can<00:02:10.520> see<00:02:10.729> everything<00:02:11.270> so<00:02:11.510> much<00:02:11.960> better

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
you can see everything so much better

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.280 
you can see everything so much better
and<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.650> one<00:02:12.800> monitor<00:02:13.160> should<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.820> condense

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
and the one monitor should so condense

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.710 
and the one monitor should so condense
it<00:02:15.290> did<00:02:15.920> seem<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.160> move<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.580> lot<00:02:16.760> faster

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720
