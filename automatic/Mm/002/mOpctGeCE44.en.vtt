00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.230
 The most basic 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.350
 We also become your child for-like title we want to make pickles with strong Ano yogurt and salt 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:19.410
 I will 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:19.410
 I am also preparing it in a sealed bag and here 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:30.029
 As we put yogurt, it is yogurt 50g for one boiled cucumber 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.779
 8 20 It's about two and a half cups 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.779
 It is really small 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.520
 It is only such a mon 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:45.250
 That salt here 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:50.610
 Castle than a little strong name that return It is what 5 percent in the case of that vegetables are put 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.180
 That's 50g roughly 1/2 tsp 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.150
 I put this 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.480
 It is quite hard to use if you give up 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:06.090
 I will put that cut kelp here 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.420
 It is fine if you do not put the kelp as it is, but the taste is better if you put it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420
 that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:21.810
 We will mix and I in where firm have become more like bran floor 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:27.570
 Dissolve the salt carried out because it is less soluble than that miso, but I do that hard 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:34.229
 Even if you don't use your mind in particular, you can do it in a sense that you already sell it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.930
 Ok it is but I was, but I think with the brain to be attached to such less okay with voice 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.320
 By distance 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.000
 That and I kinda put the muscle of Koa today 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.900
 It is easy to permeate the yogurt and burn it, of course. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.320
 The more 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.820
 That penetration is fast and it gets faster 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.820
 Just put it in here 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.800
 That same as the other side of that 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:04.440
 It is that yogurt Toko to Gufo or around 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.420
 5 Let's make it come together 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:17.340
 After that, it's okay to reduce this amount by only removing the air . 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:21.180
 More economical and that taste will be firmly stained from here and when there is air here that dispersed 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.430
 I 'm not going to use it often, because it has unevenness 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.109
 That really is by doing this 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.109
 You can easily attach it 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:37.200
 If it is vegetables with this 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:42.530
 That's right I think that about 2 days yuan is good and it is just the sense of the pickles of the Japanese 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:47.390
 If it is only one day, it also depends on the material, but it will be fairly pickled 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.260
 It just is something when you say Wow are in a hurry a little today and may be anything, not with a single 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.920
 Is it 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:57.410
 Make a stick like that pickle and so on 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.900
 Or some people that are ah Well pickled and decided to your favorite vegetables done everyone's 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.520
 Or the Rangiri with you But such a sense I think 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.780
 I If you put another as it is to stick 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.840
 It will taste like you put on 2 days by date 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.840
 eh 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:17.510
 You or were hard when you take a result or go off quite so in that way Nukadoko 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:24.400
 But in this case 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:27.230
 I think that such convenience is one of the attractiveness because it can be cut and put out as it is 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.760
 It is quite easy to say that red paprika 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.659
 It is difficult to use on the floor 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:41.250
 I think though, so I'm refreshing with that child- like tool 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:48.599
 In that aspect I think that goes well with that very red paprika Amami 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.349
 Materials that are used in Western style also change to that Western style food by this addition 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.780
 so 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.400
 Ummm 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.400
 I think that's an interesting place
