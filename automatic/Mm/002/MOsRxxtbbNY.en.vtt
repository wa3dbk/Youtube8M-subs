what I like about that play is if you

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.950 
what I like about that play is if you
see<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.509> the<00:01:12.600> ball<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
air you can do that but if in case he's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.390 
air you can do that but if in case he's
really<00:01:16.200> quick<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.590> he<00:01:16.650> manages<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
right you see the power of that play

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.300 
right you see the power of that play
because<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.720> puts<00:01:43.020> him<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.679> totally<00:01:44.130> out

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.740 
of play and then you're able to either
open<00:01:47.550> up<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> core<00:01:47.940> for<00:01:48.090> yourself<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.630> he

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
open up the core for yourself or he

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
open up the core for yourself or he
won't<00:01:48.929> even<00:01:49.020> get<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> ball<00:01:56.060> that's<00:01:57.060> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
won't even get to the ball that's it

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.419 
won't even get to the ball that's it
move<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.950> you've<00:01:59.100> got<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> whole

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
move in and then you've got the whole

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.740 
move in and then you've got the whole
core<00:01:59.819> open<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.300> yourself

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
core open for yourself

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.320 
core open for yourself
very<00:02:01.200> good<00:02:01.470> let's<00:02:02.369> try<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.640> same<00:02:02.880> thing<00:02:02.940> off

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
very good let's try the same thing off
