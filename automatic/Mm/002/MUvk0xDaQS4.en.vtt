00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
gotta use our thinking just increase the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.830 
gotta use our thinking just increase the
pressure<00:04:20.459> really<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.450> we're<00:04:21.540> going<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.720> do

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
pressure really and we're going to do

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.320 
pressure really and we're going to do
that<00:04:22.050> with<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.230> bit<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.410> evasion<00:04:23.030> okay<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:24.090> then

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
that with a bit of evasion okay so then

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.610 
that with a bit of evasion okay so then
we're<00:04:24.420> going<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.600> get<00:04:24.690> dice<00:04:24.930> moving<00:04:25.380> still

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
we're going to get dice moving still

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.940 
we're going to get dice moving still
passively<00:04:26.270> still<00:04:27.270> relatively<00:04:27.660> slow<00:04:28.020> moving

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
passively still relatively slow moving

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:45.070 
passively still relatively slow moving
side<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.310> side

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.180 

so<00:04:46.080> that's<00:04:46.260> want<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.680> be<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> bit<00:04:46.920> of<00:04:47.010> step

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
so that's want to be a bit of step

00:04:47.190 --> 00:05:11.090 
so that's want to be a bit of step
against<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.240> tide<00:04:52.670> so<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:10.650> reason<00:05:10.920> when<00:05:11.040> I

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
against the tide so the reason when I

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
and dies and get to the inside then they

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.450 
and dies and get to the inside then they
get<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.700> big<00:05:17.850> feet

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460

responsibility to the whole thing about

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.759 
responsibility to the whole thing about
the<00:06:35.399> breakdown<00:06:35.929> okay<00:06:36.929> so<00:06:37.110> that's<00:06:37.379> how<00:06:37.529> I<00:06:37.559> want

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:37.769

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:40.549 
the breakdown okay so that's how I want
your<00:06:37.919> thinking<00:06:38.509> and<00:06:39.509> we're<00:06:40.229> going<00:06:40.349> to<00:06:40.379> grow

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
confidence we're going to get us through

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.569 
confidence we're going to get us through
the<00:06:43.409> context<00:06:43.829> I'm<00:06:44.009> gonna<00:06:44.159> start<00:06:44.399> it<00:06:44.459> off<00:06:44.519> with

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:44.579 
the context I'm gonna start it off with

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:51.059 
mindset so make a tackle chop them on

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:52.309 
mindset so make a tackle chop them on
the<00:06:51.149> ground<00:06:51.329> get<00:06:51.509> up<00:06:51.539> on<00:06:51.719> the<00:06:51.809> ground<00:06:51.959> and

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:17.099 
here the guy on the outside doesn't get

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.290 
here the guy on the outside doesn't get
involved<00:07:17.459> in<00:07:17.550> all<00:07:17.669> what<00:07:17.879> do<00:07:17.939> you<00:07:17.999> think<00:07:18.179> it's

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 
involved in all what do you think it's

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:26.059 
involved in all what do you think it's
important<00:07:18.659> to<00:07:18.749> us<00:07:21.259> watch<00:07:22.259> on<00:07:22.439> please<00:07:24.829> give<00:07:25.829> so

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:28.309 
important to us watch on please give so
I<00:07:26.099> thought<00:07:26.809> focus<00:07:27.809> on<00:07:27.959> stopping<00:07:28.139> the

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 
I thought focus on stopping the

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:34.100 
I thought focus on stopping the
beginning<00:07:28.679> one<00:07:28.800> band<00:07:32.269> and<00:07:33.269> the<00:07:33.629> first<00:07:33.869> volume

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
beginning one band and the first volume

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.019 
beginning one band and the first volume
coming<00:07:34.469> from<00:07:34.589> the<00:07:34.739> inside<00:07:35.009> and<00:07:35.699> this<00:07:35.849> guy

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:36.029 
coming from the inside and this guy

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:38.719 
coming from the inside and this guy
doesn't<00:07:36.329> get<00:07:36.389> involved<00:07:36.979> so<00:07:37.979> they<00:07:38.099> sit<00:07:38.309> rongzi

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729 
doesn't get involved so they sit rongzi

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.519 
doesn't get involved so they sit rongzi
so<00:07:38.909> it's<00:07:39.179> a<00:07:39.239> breakdown<00:07:39.659> is<00:07:39.809> a<00:07:39.839> big<00:07:40.019> piece<00:07:40.139> most

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:40.529 
so it's a breakdown is a big piece most

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:41.970 
so it's a breakdown is a big piece most
fun

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:41.980 
fun

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.260 
fun
but<00:07:42.980> there<00:07:43.130> is<00:07:43.280> there<00:07:43.640> is<00:07:43.670> a<00:07:43.760> bit<00:07:43.910> of<00:07:43.940> structure

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270 
but there is there is a bit of structure

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.090 
but there is there is a bit of structure
around<00:07:44.480> it<00:07:44.660> look<00:07:45.410> like<00:07:45.590> this<00:07:45.740> coming<00:07:46.010> in

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.100 
around it look like this coming in

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.100 
around it look like this coming in
between<00:07:46.220> step<00:07:46.790> in<00:07:46.910> to<00:07:46.970> the<00:07:47.030> inside<00:07:47.360> there<00:07:47.990> will

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.110 
between step in to the inside there will

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.080 
between step in to the inside there will
be<00:07:48.140> a<00:07:48.200> lie<00:07:48.380> detector<00:07:48.770> now<00:07:49.310> if<00:07:49.460> the<00:07:49.610> spies<00:07:49.880> on

be a lie detector now if the spies on

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.970 
be a lie detector now if the spies on
the<00:07:50.210> outside<00:07:50.630> and<00:07:50.870> can<00:07:51.080> finish<00:07:51.320> him<00:07:51.530> off
