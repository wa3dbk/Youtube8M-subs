00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.699 

hey<00:00:00.210> everyone<00:00:00.630> I've<00:00:00.750> got<00:00:00.870> another<00:00:01.079> food<00:00:01.410> hack

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey everyone I've got another food hack

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.820 
hey everyone I've got another food hack
for<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.190> this<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.939> whipped<00:00:03.330> chocolate<00:00:04.049> so<00:00:04.589> let

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
for you this is whipped chocolate so let

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.120 
for you this is whipped chocolate so let
me<00:00:04.890> show<00:00:05.040> you<00:00:05.130> how<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.279> made<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:05.640> one<00:00:07.130> whipped

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
me show you how I made this one whipped

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.129 
me show you how I made this one whipped
chocolate<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.820> just<00:00:09.090> plain<00:00:09.360> old<00:00:09.570> chocolate

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
chocolate is just plain old chocolate

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.830 
chocolate is just plain old chocolate
that's<00:00:10.500> been<00:00:10.679> melted<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.509> pumped<00:00:12.509> up<00:00:12.660> with

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
that's been melted and pumped up with

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.099 
that's been melted and pumped up with
nitrous<00:00:13.679> oxide<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.549> then<00:00:15.240> cooled<00:00:15.630> while<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
nitrous oxide and then cooled while it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.990 
nitrous oxide and then cooled while it
still<00:00:16.289> has<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.590> nitrous<00:00:16.890> oxide<00:00:17.340> dissolved<00:00:17.880> in

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
still has the nitrous oxide dissolved in

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.230 
still has the nitrous oxide dissolved in
it<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.720> when<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.960> cools<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.350> hardens<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.830> has<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
it so when it cools and hardens it has a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.410 
it so when it cools and hardens it has a
bubble<00:00:21.240> structure<00:00:21.920> frozen<00:00:22.920> into<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:24.240> why

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
bubble structure frozen into it so why

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
bubble structure frozen into it so why
would<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.660> use<00:00:24.689> nitrous<00:00:25.230> oxide<00:00:25.650> instead<00:00:26.099> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
would we use nitrous oxide instead of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.779 
would we use nitrous oxide instead of
co2<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.510> argon<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.080> any<00:00:28.199> other<00:00:28.349> gas<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.580> reason

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
co2 or argon or any other gas the reason

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.970 
co2 or argon or any other gas the reason
is<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:29.939> nitrous<00:00:30.390> oxide<00:00:30.869> which<00:00:31.560> comes<00:00:31.830> in

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
is that nitrous oxide which comes in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.160 
is that nitrous oxide which comes in
these<00:00:32.149> great<00:00:33.149> little<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> cartridges

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
these great little with it cartridges

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.060 
these great little with it cartridges
here<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.890> very<00:00:35.160> soluble<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.000> fat<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:37.350> argon<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
here is very soluble in fat so argon and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.950 
here is very soluble in fat so argon and
co2<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.879> all<00:00:38.940> those<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.629> dissolve

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
co2 and all those don't really dissolve

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.979 
co2 and all those don't really dissolve
that<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.559> fat<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.879> nitrous<00:00:42.210> oxide<00:00:42.629> does

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that well in fat but nitrous oxide does

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
that well in fat but nitrous oxide does
and<00:00:43.290> since<00:00:43.980> chocolate<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.520> mostly<00:00:44.989> fat<00:00:45.989> oil<00:00:47.059> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and since chocolate is mostly fat oil it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.639 
and since chocolate is mostly fat oil it
does<00:00:48.600> best<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:50.960> started<00:00:51.960> by<00:00:52.110> melting

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
does best here I started by melting

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.970 
does best here I started by melting
about<00:00:52.770> 200<00:00:53.399> grams<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:54.030> Tollhouse<00:00:54.980> morsels

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
about 200 grams of Tollhouse morsels

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.189 
about 200 grams of Tollhouse morsels
along<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.850> some<00:00:57.059> oil<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.809> used<00:00:57.960> about

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
along with some oil I think I used about

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.819 
along with some oil I think I used about
25<00:00:59.190> grams<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.730> oil<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:01.260> stainless<00:01:01.649> steel

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
25 grams of oil in a stainless steel

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.030 
25 grams of oil in a stainless steel
canister<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:04.140> canister<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.710> part<00:01:04.949> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
canister and the canister is part of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 
canister and the canister is part of
like<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> commercial<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.090> commercial<00:01:06.960> whipped

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
like a commercial a commercial whipped

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.100 
like a commercial a commercial whipped
cream<00:01:07.619> dispenser<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.970> looks<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:15.110> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
cream dispenser it looks like this and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.710 
cream dispenser it looks like this and
after<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.909> chocolate<00:01:17.909> had<00:01:18.030> melted<00:01:18.330> inside

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
after the chocolate had melted inside

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.440 
after the chocolate had melted inside
there<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.310> charged<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.790> two

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
there I charged it up with two

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.480 
there I charged it up with two
cartridges<00:01:21.810> not<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.040> that's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
cartridges not just one because that's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.020 
cartridges not just one because that's
how<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> roll

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
how I roll

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.899 
how I roll
at<00:01:24.990> first<00:01:25.259> while<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:25.830> working<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
at first while I was working on this I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.530 
at first while I was working on this I
did<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.570> math<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> figure<00:01:28.229> out

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
did a little bit of math to figure out

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.120 
did a little bit of math to figure out
what<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> pressure<00:01:30.930> was<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.680> inside

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
what the pressure was going to be inside

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.859 
what the pressure was going to be inside
there<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> wanted<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> rough<00:01:36.240> idea<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
there so I wanted to get a rough idea of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.810 
there so I wanted to get a rough idea of
what<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> pressure<00:01:37.380> inside<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.979> whipped

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
what the pressure inside the whipped

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.450 
what the pressure inside the whipped
cream<00:01:39.119> vessel<00:01:39.659> would<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:40.020> had<00:01:40.530> depending<00:01:41.340> how

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
cream vessel would be had depending how

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
cream vessel would be had depending how
many<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.729> these<00:01:41.850> little<00:01:41.970> cartridges<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.689> used

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
many of these little cartridges I used

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.950 
many of these little cartridges I used
on<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> started<00:01:44.850> off<00:01:45.090> by<00:01:45.149> measuring<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
on it so I started off by measuring the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.719 
on it so I started off by measuring the
full<00:01:46.170> cartridge<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:46.979> discharged<00:01:47.549> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
full cartridge and then discharged it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
full cartridge and then discharged it
into<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> mixing<00:01:48.570> chamber<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.290> then<00:01:49.619> waited

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
into the mixing chamber and then waited

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.859 
into the mixing chamber and then waited
again<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:51.119> looked<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.570> had<00:01:51.600> about

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
again and it looked like we had about

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.649 
again and it looked like we had about
seven<00:01:52.229> point<00:01:52.470> seven<00:01:52.649> grams<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.490> gas<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.360> came

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
seven point seven grams of gas that came

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.929 
seven point seven grams of gas that came
out<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.579> we<00:01:56.579> know<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> molecular

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
out of here and we know the molecular

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.840 
out of here and we know the molecular
mass<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.719> nitrous<00:01:58.200> oxide<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.740> 44<00:01:59.219> grams<00:01:59.490> per

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
mass of nitrous oxide is 44 grams per

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.340 
mass of nitrous oxide is 44 grams per
mole<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:01.020> used<00:02:01.380> PV<00:02:01.829> equals<00:02:02.159> NRT<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
mole so I used PV equals NRT and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.270 
mole so I used PV equals NRT and
originally<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.409> wanted<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.680> find<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
originally I wanted to find out what the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.620 
originally I wanted to find out what the
pressure<00:02:05.579> was<00:02:05.820> inside<00:02:06.240> one<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> these

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
pressure was inside one of these

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.240 
pressure was inside one of these
cartridges<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> went<00:02:08.039> through<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
cartridges so I went through the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.309 
cartridges so I went through the
equation<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.910> came<00:02:09.060> up<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.300> about<00:02:09.479> 6,000

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
equation and came up with about 6,000

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.690 
equation and came up with about 6,000
psi<00:02:10.890> which<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:11.790> correct

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
psi which is not correct

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.000 
psi which is not correct
so<00:02:13.000> at<00:02:13.959> first<00:02:14.140> blush<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.620> would<00:02:14.709> say<00:02:14.860> well

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
so at first blush you would say well

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.130 
so at first blush you would say well
that's<00:02:15.099> not<00:02:15.220> right<00:02:15.550> because<00:02:15.730> 6000<00:02:16.450> psi<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:16.930> an

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that's not right because 6000 psi is an

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.110 
that's not right because 6000 psi is an
awful<00:02:17.470> lot<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.590> pressure<00:02:17.920> for<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.400> consumer

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
awful lot of pressure for a consumer

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.930 
awful lot of pressure for a consumer
product<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.459> also<00:02:21.459> if<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.700> check

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
product like this and also if you check

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.760 
product like this and also if you check
with<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.150> vapor<00:02:22.420> pressure<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:23.020> nitrous<00:02:23.349> oxide

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
with the vapor pressure of nitrous oxide

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.199 
with the vapor pressure of nitrous oxide
is<00:02:23.950> it's<00:02:24.099> actually<00:02:24.400> quite<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> bit<00:02:24.819> lower<00:02:24.970> than

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
is it's actually quite a bit lower than

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.160 
is it's actually quite a bit lower than
6000<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.560> only<00:02:26.830> about<00:02:26.980> 700<00:02:27.930> psi<00:02:28.930> at

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
6000 it's it's only about 700 psi at

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.710 
6000 it's it's only about 700 psi at
room<00:02:29.350> temperature<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:31.060> what's<00:02:31.360> happening

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
room temperature so what's happening

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.910 
room temperature so what's happening
what<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:31.989> indicates<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.650> there's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
what this indicates is that there's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.800 
what this indicates is that there's
actually<00:02:33.190> liquid<00:02:33.550> nitrous<00:02:33.910> oxide<00:02:34.360> inside

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
actually liquid nitrous oxide inside

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.960 
actually liquid nitrous oxide inside
here<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.250> true<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.459> there's<00:02:36.700> seven

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
here so it's true that there's seven

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.930 
here so it's true that there's seven
point<00:02:37.209> seven<00:02:37.360> grams<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:38.020> n2o<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:39.790> but

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
point seven grams of n2o in here but

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.860 
point seven grams of n2o in here but
it's<00:02:40.060> not<00:02:40.180> gas<00:02:40.480> most<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.590> its<00:02:41.709> liquid<00:02:42.040> actually

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
it's not gas most of its liquid actually

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.750 
it's not gas most of its liquid actually
so<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.830> volume<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.640> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
so the volume of the of the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.250 
so the volume of the of the
whipped-cream<00:02:45.940> dispensing<00:02:46.750> chamber<00:02:47.170> is

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
whipped-cream dispensing chamber is

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.500 
whipped-cream dispensing chamber is
about<00:02:47.290> half<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.830> liter<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.760> did<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.060> formula

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
about half a liter so I did the formula

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.250 
about half a liter so I did the formula
again<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.200> came<00:02:50.440> up<00:02:50.560> with<00:02:50.590> about<00:02:50.830> 126<00:02:51.700> psi<00:02:52.299> so

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
again and came up with about 126 psi so

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.470 
again and came up with about 126 psi so
when<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:53.890> little<00:02:54.040> cartridge<00:02:54.480> discharges

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
when this little cartridge discharges

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.660 
when this little cartridge discharges
into<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.840> chamber<00:02:56.380> here<00:02:56.769> you're<00:02:57.340> left<00:02:57.549> with

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
into the chamber here you're left with

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.509 
into the chamber here you're left with
about<00:02:57.760> 126<00:02:58.660> psi<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.560> since<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.130> did<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.400> twice

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
about 126 psi and since I did it twice

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.920 
about 126 psi and since I did it twice
there<00:03:00.850> is<00:03:00.940> probably<00:03:01.209> about<00:03:01.390> 250<00:03:01.959> in<00:03:02.350> there<00:03:03.930> so

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
there is probably about 250 in there so

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.660 
there is probably about 250 in there so
after<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.410> after<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:05.890> had<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.310> pressure

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
after the after I had the pressure

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.750 
after the after I had the pressure
chamber<00:03:07.030> full<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.660> 250<00:03:08.380> psi<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:09.069> nitrous<00:03:09.519> I

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
chamber full of a 250 psi of nitrous I

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.789 
chamber full of a 250 psi of nitrous I
shook<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.630> as<00:03:10.840> well<00:03:11.049> as<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.290> could<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.709> make

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
shook it up as well as I could to make

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.470 
shook it up as well as I could to make
sure<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.310> nitrous<00:03:12.640> had<00:03:12.819> dissolved<00:03:13.299> into

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
sure that the nitrous had dissolved into

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.809 
sure that the nitrous had dissolved into
the<00:03:13.630> chocolate<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.319> then<00:03:15.069> dispensed<00:03:15.640> the

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
the chocolate and then dispensed the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.170 
the chocolate and then dispensed the
chocolate<00:03:16.269> into<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.690> pre<00:03:17.170> chilled<00:03:18.180> vacuum

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
chocolate into a pre chilled vacuum

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.270 
chocolate into a pre chilled vacuum
chamber<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.650> actually<00:03:20.980> part<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.220> my

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
chamber so this is actually part of my

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.190 
chamber so this is actually part of my
vacuum<00:03:21.579> cold<00:03:22.060> trap<00:03:22.329> that<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.600> used<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:22.989> another

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
vacuum cold trap that I used in another

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.080 
vacuum cold trap that I used in another
experiment<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.489> just<00:03:24.700> put<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:24.910> in<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
experiment and I just put it in the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.110 
experiment and I just put it in the
freezer<00:03:25.269> to<00:03:25.540> chill<00:03:25.570> for<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:26.049> while<00:03:27.000> then<00:03:28.000> I

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
freezer to chill for a while then I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.940 
freezer to chill for a while then I
applied<00:03:28.450> vacuum<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.140> what<00:03:29.230> this<00:03:29.380> does<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.799> it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
applied vacuum and what this does is it

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.400 
applied vacuum and what this does is it
increases<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.269> size<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.840> bubbles<00:03:32.230> and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
increases the size of the bubbles and

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.289 
increases the size of the bubbles and
encourages<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:32.950> lot<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.370> nitrous<00:03:33.670> oxide<00:03:34.090> to

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
encourages a lot of the nitrous oxide to

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.270 
encourages a lot of the nitrous oxide to
come<00:03:34.510> out<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.840> solution<00:03:35.769> out<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
come out of solution out of the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.920 
come out of solution out of the
chocolate<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.329> end<00:03:37.480> up<00:03:37.570> with<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:37.750> very

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
chocolate so you end up with this very

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.690 
chocolate so you end up with this very
bubbly<00:03:38.530> very<00:03:39.100> light<00:03:40.230> mixture<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.700> we're

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
bubbly very light mixture and we're

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.009 
bubbly very light mixture and we're
trying<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.030> cool<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.299> down<00:03:43.329> really<00:03:43.690> quickly

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
trying to cool it down really quickly

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.780 
trying to cool it down really quickly
here<00:03:44.320> so<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.739> bubbles<00:03:44.920> will<00:03:45.220> be<00:03:45.340> frozen

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
here so that the bubbles will be frozen

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.360 
here so that the bubbles will be frozen
so<00:03:46.359> you<00:03:46.440> suck<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.620> air<00:03:47.739> out<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
so you suck the air out so that the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.979 
so you suck the air out so that the
bubbles<00:03:48.670> enlarge<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.269> then<00:03:49.359> try<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.570> cool<00:03:49.840> it

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
bubbles enlarge and then try to cool it

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.630 
bubbles enlarge and then try to cool it
down<00:03:50.019> as<00:03:50.320> quickly<00:03:50.530> as<00:03:50.709> possible<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:51.310> make<00:03:51.430> sure

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
down as quickly as possible to make sure

although<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.120> guess<00:04:25.750> you're<00:04:25.930> still<00:04:26.080> nitrous<00:04:26.440> in

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
although I guess you're still nitrous in

although I guess you're still nitrous in
there<00:04:26.800> all<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:26.919> way<00:04:27.009> filling<00:04:27.460> those<00:04:27.580> with<00:04:27.759> the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
there all the way filling those with the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.580 
there all the way filling those with the
gas<00:04:28.030> will<00:04:28.270> dissipate<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.350> just<00:04:29.470> going

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
gas will dissipate and it's just going

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.310 
gas will dissipate and it's just going
to<00:04:29.680> become<00:04:29.800> air<00:04:30.160> as<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.460> sits<00:04:30.880> around<00:04:31.320> alright

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
to become air as it sits around alright

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.610 
to become air as it sits around alright
see<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.740> next<00:04:32.770> time<00:04:33.070> bye
