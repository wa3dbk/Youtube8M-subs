00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.840 

one<00:00:00.450> of<00:00:00.570> my<00:00:00.659> favorite<00:00:01.050> things<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.350> do<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.890> Wells

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
one of my favorite things to do is Wells

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.600 
one of my favorite things to do is Wells
and<00:00:03.570> so<00:00:03.899> doing<00:00:04.290> swells<00:00:04.920> I'd<00:00:05.700> like<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:07.610> layer

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
and so doing swells I'd like to layer

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.919 
and so doing swells I'd like to layer
petals<00:00:09.090> but<00:00:09.269> I'll<00:00:09.420> show<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.660> kind<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.349> basic

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
petals but I'll show you kind of a basic

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.589 
petals but I'll show you kind of a basic
form<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.049> doing<00:00:13.920> some<00:00:14.099> swells<00:00:14.370> with<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
form of doing some swells with just a

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.380 
form of doing some swells with just a
delay<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.230> reverb<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.850> your<00:00:18.000> volume<00:00:18.240> pedal

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
delay and reverb and your volume pedal

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.099 
delay and reverb and your volume pedal
so<00:00:19.320> obviously<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:20.359> big<00:00:21.359> part<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.869> going

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
so obviously a big part of this is going

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.859 
so obviously a big part of this is going
to<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.439> having<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:23.130> volume<00:00:23.730> pedal<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.510> if<00:00:24.720> you're

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
to be having a volume pedal or if you're

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.810 
to be having a volume pedal or if you're
quick<00:00:25.080> enough<00:00:25.199> or<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.220> strat<00:00:26.609> or

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
quick enough or have your like strat or

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.519 
quick enough or have your like strat or
something<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.390> kind<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.289> one<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
something you can kind of do one of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.610 
something you can kind of do one of
these<00:00:31.880> smell<00:00:32.880> smell<00:00:33.469> because<00:00:34.469> you're

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
these smell smell because you're

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.850 
these smell smell because you're
swelling<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> volume<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.630> what<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> want

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
swelling up the volume but what you want

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.080 
swelling up the volume but what you want
to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.960> you're<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> hit<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.320> chord

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
to do is you're going to hit your chord

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.220 
to do is you're going to hit your chord
and<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.329> soon<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.750> you're<00:00:42.840> done<00:00:42.989> hitting

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and then as soon as you're done hitting

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.360 
and then as soon as you're done hitting
record<00:00:44.000> bring<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.120> volume<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.250> I'm

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
record bring your volume up and all I'm

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
record bring your volume up and all I'm
using<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.760> an<00:00:47.850> analog<00:00:48.270> delay<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.579> a<00:00:51.079> reverb

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
using is an analog delay and a reverb

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.670 
using is an analog delay and a reverb
and<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.460> cheaper<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> T<00:00:54.059> reverb

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.259 

again<00:01:02.680> using<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.010> lot<00:01:03.160> of<00:01:03.309> Chris's

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
again using a lot of Chris's

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.499 
again using a lot of Chris's
instructions<00:01:05.199> from<00:01:05.440> from<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:07.240> chord

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
instructions from from the chord

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:15.240 
instructions from from the chord
structures<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.140> stuff

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.150 

so<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.000> cool<00:01:16.180> trick<00:01:16.570> behind<00:01:16.720> doing<00:01:17.710> custom

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
so the cool trick behind doing custom

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.090 
so the cool trick behind doing custom
some<00:01:18.490> cool<00:01:18.670> swells<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.270> longer<00:01:20.050> decays<00:01:20.440> so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
some cool swells is longer decays so

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.510 
some cool swells is longer decays so
longer<00:01:21.370> decays<00:01:21.760> from<00:01:21.940> your<00:01:22.120> reverb<00:01:22.480> and<00:01:22.750> then

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
longer decays from your reverb and then

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.840 
longer decays from your reverb and then
longer<00:01:24.520> repeats<00:01:24.940> from<00:01:25.480> your<00:01:25.630> delay<00:01:26.850> be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
longer repeats from your delay be

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.390 
longer repeats from your delay be
careful<00:01:28.800> because<00:01:29.800> there's<00:01:30.040> been<00:01:30.160> way<00:01:30.370> too

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
careful because there's been way too

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.210 
careful because there's been way too
many<00:01:31.120> times<00:01:31.390> where<00:01:32.230> I<00:01:32.260> thought<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:32.770> was<00:01:32.950> coming

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
many times where I thought I was coming

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.010 
many times where I thought I was coming
in<00:01:33.280> on<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.460> right<00:01:33.580> note<00:01:33.790> stages<00:01:34.630> dark<00:01:34.840> and

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
in on the right note stages dark and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
in on the right note stages dark and
everything<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.620> it's<00:01:36.310> just<00:01:36.370> like<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
everything and it's just like and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.320 
everything and it's just like and
everyone's<00:01:39.040> like<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.430> whole<00:01:39.820> different<00:01:39.970> key

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
everyone's like a whole different key

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.590 
everyone's like a whole different key
and<00:01:40.980> there's<00:01:41.980> no<00:01:42.130> stopping<00:01:42.490> them<00:01:42.580> it<00:01:43.570> just

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
and there's no stopping them it just

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.670 
and there's no stopping them it just
goes<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:44.890> goes<00:01:45.210> goes<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:50.350> kind<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
goes it goes goes so that's kind of the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.210 
goes it goes goes so that's kind of the
basics<00:01:51.010> behind<00:01:51.130> as<00:01:51.369> well<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.619> can<00:01:53.770> use<00:01:53.950> bigger

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
basics behind as well you can use bigger

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.030 
basics behind as well you can use bigger
chords<00:01:54.700> if<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:54.940> want<00:01:55.180> but<00:01:55.479> again<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.830> bigger

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
chords if you want but again the bigger

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.040 
chords if you want but again the bigger
the<00:01:57.490> chords<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:57.910> use<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.570> money<00:01:58.690> it's<00:01:58.930> going

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
the chords you use the money it's going

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:16.730 
the chords you use the money it's going
to<00:01:59.110> sound

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.690 

it's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.300 

you<00:02:22.690> lie<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:28.590> what<00:02:29.590> else<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.069> do<00:02:30.250> is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
you lie so what else I like to do is

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.580 
you lie so what else I like to do is
called<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.030> advanced<00:02:31.660> well<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.380> call<00:02:32.560> it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
called it advanced well I call it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.990 
called it advanced well I call it
advanced<00:02:33.099> well<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.520> not<00:02:33.610> really<00:02:33.819> called

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
advanced well it's not really called

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.910 
advanced well it's not really called
advanced<00:02:34.270> smells<00:02:34.569> but<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.680> when<00:02:35.830> you're

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
advanced smells but this is when you're

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.790 
advanced smells but this is when you're
taking<00:02:36.310> like<00:02:36.580> everything<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.800> you're

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
taking like everything and you're

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.460 
taking like everything and you're
throwing<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.940> in<00:02:40.060> there<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:41.020> what<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.170> like<00:02:41.380> to

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
throwing it in there so what I like to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.990 
throwing it in there so what I like to
do<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.920> lot<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.550> times<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:43.030> take<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:44.250> an<00:02:45.250> analog

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
do a lot of times is take a an analog

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.259 
do a lot of times is take a an analog
delay<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:50.170> dual<00:02:50.590> delay<00:02:50.980> which<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.880> like<00:02:52.090> that

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
delay a a dual delay which is like that

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.630 
delay a a dual delay which is like that
dotted<00:02:52.569> eighth<00:02:53.080> note<00:02:53.110> quarter<00:02:54.100> note<00:02:54.220> mix<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
dotted eighth note quarter note mix a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.380 
dotted eighth note quarter note mix a
super<00:02:57.750> washy<00:03:01.830> reverb<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.060> then<00:03:04.060> another

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
super washy reverb and then another

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.850 
super washy reverb and then another
reverb<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.049> reverberate<00:03:05.410> all<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:07.860> it

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
reverb to reverberate all of that so it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.180 
reverb to reverberate all of that so it
gets<00:03:09.280> kind<00:03:09.549> of<00:03:09.640> crazy<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.650> kind<00:03:12.130> of

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
gets kind of crazy and that kind of

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:35.740 
gets kind of crazy and that kind of
sounds<00:03:12.519> like

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.320 

and<00:03:36.750> then<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.140> add<00:03:37.290> more<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:39.030> can<00:03:39.180> add

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
and then you just add more you can add

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.740 
and then you just add more you can add
another<00:03:39.720> delay<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:41.459> el<00:03:41.610> capistan<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.420> tape

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
another delay the el capistan is a tape

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.440 
another delay the el capistan is a tape
delay<00:03:43.230> simulator<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.190> tape<00:03:44.819> delay<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.269> just

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
delay simulator and tape delay is just

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.509 
delay simulator and tape delay is just
kind<00:03:45.659> of<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.840> halfway<00:03:46.680> between<00:03:46.860> analog

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
kind of like a halfway between analog

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.910 
kind of like a halfway between analog
and<00:03:47.580> digital<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:49.470> sounds<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.709> little<00:03:49.769> bit

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
and digital it sounds a little bit

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.140 
and digital it sounds a little bit
cleaner<00:03:50.159> but<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.610> make<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.849> do<00:03:51.000> some

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
cleaner but you can make it do some

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.390 
cleaner but you can make it do some
really<00:03:51.390> cool<00:03:51.599> stuff<00:03:51.900> for<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.319> then<00:03:53.129> I'll

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
really cool stuff for you and then I'll

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.490 
really cool stuff for you and then I'll
throw<00:03:53.610> in<00:03:53.849> again<00:03:54.629> with<00:03:54.810> like<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.110> octave

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
throw in again with like the octave

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.400 
throw in again with like the octave
stuff<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:57.120> I'll<00:03:57.299> have<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.870> right<00:03:58.049> now<00:03:58.200> what<00:03:58.379> I

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
stuff so I'll have so right now what I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.210 
stuff so I'll have so right now what I
have<00:03:58.620> on<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.569> lot<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.690> pedals<00:04:00.930> um<00:04:01.200> an<00:04:01.739> analog

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
have on is a lot of pedals um an analog

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.970 
have on is a lot of pedals um an analog
delay<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.849> digital<00:04:03.569> delay<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:04.049> taint<00:04:04.379> delay<00:04:04.680> and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
delay a digital delay a taint delay and

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.410 
delay a digital delay a taint delay and
two<00:04:05.610> reverbs<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.390> an<00:04:07.349> octave<00:04:07.739> pedal<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:09.120> it

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
two reverbs and an octave pedal and it

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:22.210 
two reverbs and an octave pedal and it
sounds<00:04:09.660> like

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.230 

so<00:04:22.280> you've<00:04:22.400> kind<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.670> left<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:22.940> realm<00:04:23.150> of

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
so you've kind of left the realm of

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:37.510 
so you've kind of left the realm of
guitar<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:24.470> you're<00:04:24.950> into<00:04:25.340> like<00:04:25.480> heaven

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.860 

a<00:04:37.550> lot<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:37.970> times<00:04:38.240> when<00:04:38.389> you're<00:04:38.509> doing<00:04:38.600> that

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
a lot of times when you're doing that

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.050 
a lot of times when you're doing that
type<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.110> stuff<00:04:39.440> you'll<00:04:40.160> stick<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.580> like<00:04:40.729> your

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
type of stuff you'll stick to like your

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.490 
type of stuff you'll stick to like your
if<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.419> have<00:04:41.569> like<00:04:41.720> a<00:04:41.750> telly<00:04:42.020> or<00:04:42.229> something

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
if you have like a telly or something

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.809 
if you have like a telly or something
like<00:04:42.560> that<00:04:42.650> you<00:04:42.860> stick<00:04:43.069> to<00:04:43.220> like<00:04:43.340> your<00:04:43.490> middle

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
like that you stick to like your middle

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.749 
like that you stick to like your middle
to<00:04:44.419> third<00:04:44.930> position<00:04:45.110> which<00:04:45.620> would<00:04:45.740> be<00:04:45.919> either

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
to third position which would be either

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.320 
to third position which would be either
both<00:04:47.000> pickups<00:04:47.419> or<00:04:47.630> your<00:04:47.900> neck<00:04:48.050> pickup<00:04:49.240> if<00:04:50.240> you

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
both pickups or your neck pickup if you

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.330 
both pickups or your neck pickup if you
have<00:04:50.449> a<00:04:50.479> strat<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:51.139> can<00:04:51.289> do<00:04:51.410> all<00:04:51.560> kinds<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:51.949> fun

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
have a strat you can do all kinds of fun

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.529 
have a strat you can do all kinds of fun
stuff<00:04:52.490> with<00:04:52.729> that<00:04:52.849> because<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.270> have<00:04:53.419> all

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
stuff with that because you have all

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.010 
stuff with that because you have all
kinds<00:04:53.720> of<00:04:53.900> in-betweens<00:04:54.349> but<00:04:55.870> normally<00:04:56.870> the

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
kinds of in-betweens but normally the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.270 
kinds of in-betweens but normally the
the<00:04:57.259> bridge<00:04:57.500> would<00:04:57.650> sound<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:57.979> little<00:04:58.069> too

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
the bridge would sound a little too

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:09.350 
the bridge would sound a little too
harsh

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.280 

so<00:05:10.360> kind<00:05:10.600> of<00:05:10.630> doesn't<00:05:10.810> lay<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.260> that<00:05:11.800> pad

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
so kind of doesn't lay that that pad

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:22.579 
so kind of doesn't lay that that pad
like<00:05:14.290> a<00:05:14.380> technical<00:05:14.830> would

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:22.589 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.259 

then<00:05:22.829> you<00:05:22.889> can<00:05:23.009> have<00:05:23.099> some<00:05:23.279> modulation<00:05:23.699> -<00:05:24.029> I

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:24.269 
then you can have some modulation - I

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:27.289 
then you can have some modulation - I
have<00:05:24.809> a<00:05:24.839> this<00:05:25.739> is<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.009> new<00:05:26.159> visual<00:05:26.429> sound<00:05:26.819> h2o

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:27.299 
have a this is the new visual sound h2o

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:30.589 
have a this is the new visual sound h2o
v3<00:05:27.839> so<00:05:28.709> it's<00:05:28.979> pretty<00:05:29.219> cool<00:05:29.459> it's<00:05:30.029> like<00:05:30.299> two

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
v3 so it's pretty cool it's like two

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.309 
v3 so it's pretty cool it's like two
petals<00:05:30.839> in<00:05:31.019> one<00:05:31.519> and<00:05:32.519> right<00:05:33.389> now<00:05:33.509> I<00:05:33.569> have<00:05:33.839> like

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 
petals in one and right now I have like

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.059 
petals in one and right now I have like
the<00:05:34.499> vibrato<00:05:34.949> enabled<00:05:35.789> and<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:37.229> depth<00:05:37.559> of<00:05:37.799> the

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069 
the vibrato enabled and the depth of the

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.059 
the vibrato enabled and the depth of the
vibrato<00:05:38.459> is<00:05:38.839> really<00:05:39.839> deep<00:05:40.109> but<00:05:40.739> it's<00:05:40.919> moving

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
vibrato is really deep but it's moving

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.639 
vibrato is really deep but it's moving
really<00:05:41.459> slow<00:05:41.999> so<00:05:42.719> there's<00:05:43.019> going<00:05:43.199> to<00:05:43.259> be<00:05:43.349> like

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:43.649 
really slow so there's going to be like

00:05:43.649 --> 00:06:13.929 
really slow so there's going to be like
an<00:05:43.739> almost<00:05:43.979> swirling<00:05:45.079> feature

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:13.939 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:20.960 

that's<00:06:16.129> basic<00:06:17.129> swells<00:06:17.400> and<00:06:18.180> advance<00:06:18.629> once
