 I But I now was examined whether or not can not be Japanese localization was better 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.099
 What you can see is a google search with a word to say that it is H. pylori Japanese 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.630
 It is a result 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.030

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.010
 It is not 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:47.870

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:53.570
 Different app field Tsukuru app that has been Japanese-languageized ? 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.309
 It is a result, I can not translate it into Japanese. I say it. I explained Feedley in Japanese. 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.020
 I think 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.260
 I will explain from where Elder something 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.860
 Among the rss services, it is one of the top services 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.960
 There are many other mountains in Hyogo that you will see 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.800

 I Is not share destination are also many 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.960
 You see, there are only so many by default in the pain account 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.580
 Some things can not be used without 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.780
 I would like to use if and this which I would like to use as a joint association to recommend p Birds are this 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.159
 Even though it is surrounded by the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.850
 Hey you out escort and say all it I can feel to see all also around a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.370
 But 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.740
 For example, if you like feed favorite, it will be listed 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.390
