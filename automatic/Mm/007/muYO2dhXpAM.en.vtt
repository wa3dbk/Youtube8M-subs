00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
you how I put it over here and try to

00:00:44.780 --> 00:01:40.890 
you how I put it over here and try to
watch<00:01:29.260> still<00:01:30.260> I<00:01:30.320> use<00:01:30.770> just<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.340> little

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.020 

okay<00:01:42.159> now<00:01:43.159> I<00:01:43.190> don't<00:01:43.610> see<00:01:44.030> any<00:01:44.240> curls<00:01:44.630> yet

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030

okay now I don't see any curls yet
hopefully<00:01:47.030> in<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.299> front<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.380> think<00:01:51.710> I

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
hopefully in the front and I think I

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.430 
hopefully in the front and I think I
might<00:01:52.159> meet<00:01:52.460> gel<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:54.140> lay<00:01:54.440> my<00:01:54.710> hands<00:01:54.950> down<00:01:56.440> cuz

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
might meet gel to lay my hands down cuz

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:09.729 
might meet gel to lay my hands down cuz
this<00:01:59.050> it's<00:02:00.050> not<00:02:00.440> holding<00:02:00.890> like<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:08.709> okay<00:02:09.709> I

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
this it's not holding like that okay I

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.979 
this it's not holding like that okay I
will<00:02:10.220> be<00:02:10.399> back<00:02:11.709> once<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.950> starts<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.730> dry<00:02:14.030> so

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
will be back once it starts to dry so

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.740 
will be back once it starts to dry so
you<00:02:15.050> can<00:02:15.290> see<00:02:15.650> whether<00:02:15.980> or<00:02:16.280> not<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:17.360> looks<00:02:17.390> like

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
you can see whether or not it looks like

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.430 
you can see whether or not it looks like
a<00:02:17.780> washing<00:02:18.140> though<00:02:18.670> but<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.880> says<00:02:20.239> that<00:02:20.690> it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
a washing though but it says that it

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.150 
a washing though but it says that it
will<00:02:21.590> work<00:02:21.860> for<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:23.510> wash<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.019> go<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.560> I'll<00:02:24.739> see

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
will work for a wash and go so I'll see

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.610

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
you - I am back this is the result of

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.570 
you - I am back this is the result of
the<00:02:33.620> washing<00:02:34.040> go

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
the washing go

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:46.120 
the washing go
and<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:38.750> seems<00:02:39.560> more<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.230> noticed<00:02:45.829> under

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
and this seems more but I noticed under

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.100 
and this seems more but I noticed under
here<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.640> didn't<00:02:47.090> get<00:02:47.239> much<00:02:47.540> definition<00:02:49.060> but

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
here I didn't get much definition but

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.259 
here I didn't get much definition but
maybe<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.290> should<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.769> had<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.250> maybe<00:02:53.120> a

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
maybe I should have had it maybe a

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.140 
maybe I should have had it maybe a
little<00:02:53.540> bit<00:02:53.810> more<00:02:54.140> wet<00:02:54.500> but<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.750> didn't<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:58.150> knew

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
little bit more wet but I didn't I knew

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.190 
little bit more wet but I didn't I knew
it<00:02:59.329> wouldn't<00:02:59.570> dry<00:02:59.870> if<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.380> had<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.769> too<00:03:00.980> wet<00:03:01.280> so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it wouldn't dry if I had it too wet so

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.520 
it wouldn't dry if I had it too wet so
this<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.590> result<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:05.120> very<00:03:05.630> soft

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
this is the result and it's very soft

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.920 
this is the result and it's very soft
it's<00:03:09.100> not<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.519> hard<00:03:10.910> hole<00:03:11.269> like<00:03:11.660> gel<00:03:12.220> but<00:03:13.930> and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
it's not a hard hole like gel but and

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
in the back it looks like this

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.530

this<00:05:12.590> is<00:05:12.680> one<00:05:12.860> thing<00:05:13.100> I<00:05:13.220> like<00:05:13.430> it's<00:05:13.640> still<00:05:13.970> soft

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.920 
this is one thing I like it's still soft
and<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.710> back<00:05:15.950> where<00:05:16.310> it<00:05:16.430> rubs<00:05:16.730> up<00:05:16.970> against<00:05:17.720> my

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930

it's<00:05:26.090> not<00:05:26.210> that<00:05:26.360> quickly<00:05:27.640> its<00:05:28.640> entangled

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
it's not that quickly its entangled

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.440
