Revell<00:00:15.209> and<00:00:16.209> this<00:00:16.450> is<00:00:16.599> the<00:00:16.720> Finnish<00:00:17.020> model

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
Revell and this is the Finnish model

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.050 
Revell and this is the Finnish model
it's<00:00:19.150> pretty<00:00:19.540> good<00:00:19.720> in<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:19.960> end<00:00:20.110> actually<00:00:20.320> I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
it's pretty good in the end actually I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.940 
it's pretty good in the end actually I
was<00:00:22.060> expecting<00:00:22.180> it<00:00:22.599> to<00:00:22.689> be<00:00:22.720> let's<00:00:23.140> go<00:00:23.349> turned

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
was expecting it to be let's go turned

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.760 
was expecting it to be let's go turned
out<00:00:24.099> that<00:00:24.310> I<00:00:24.369> thought<00:00:25.020> so<00:00:26.020> here<00:00:26.230> we<00:00:26.349> have<00:00:26.470> the

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
out that I thought so here we have the

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.660 
out that I thought so here we have the
deck<00:00:29.770> down<00:00:30.750> transfer<00:00:32.250> we're<00:00:33.250> going<00:00:33.489> to<00:00:33.550> call

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
deck down transfer we're going to call

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:44.510 
deck down transfer we're going to call
it<00:00:33.820> on<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.000> mast<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:36.030> shields<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:40.890> pause

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.950 

that<00:00:45.520> says<00:00:45.730> can't<00:00:46.270> see<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.510> here<00:00:46.660> cuz<00:00:46.870> this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
that says can't see it here cuz this

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
that says can't see it here cuz this
counter<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:47.290> terrible<00:00:48.420> Viking<00:00:49.420> ship<00:00:50.640> 980

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.560 

overall<00:00:55.180> it's<00:00:55.540> pretty<00:00:55.660> good<00:00:55.870> model<00:00:56.140> but<00:00:57.570> I'd

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
overall it's pretty good model but I'd

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.450 
overall it's pretty good model but I'd
say<00:00:58.810> I<00:00:59.079> don't<00:00:59.320> think<00:00:59.590> it's<00:00:59.739> a<00:00:59.800> skill<00:00:59.980> level<00:01:00.250> 3

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
say I don't think it's a skill level 3

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.400 
say I don't think it's a skill level 3
in<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.700> end<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:00.970> day<00:01:01.150> I<00:01:01.420> mean<00:01:02.079> you<00:01:02.290> just

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
in the end of the day I mean you just

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.170 
in the end of the day I mean you just
have<00:01:02.620> very<00:01:02.649> little<00:01:02.920> parts<00:01:03.310> well<00:01:03.460> did<00:01:03.640> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
have very little parts well did the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.139 
have very little parts well did the
transfer<00:01:04.570> is<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.750> they've<00:01:05.049> given<00:01:05.379> yeah<00:01:06.149> very

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
transfer is that they've given yeah very

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.410 
transfer is that they've given yeah very
very<00:01:07.329> difficult<00:01:07.990> for<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.680> shields<00:01:09.190> some<00:01:10.180> boat

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
very difficult for the shields some boat

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.940 
very difficult for the shields some boat
and<00:01:10.690> that's<00:01:10.750> why<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:10.960> have<00:01:11.170> gaps<00:01:11.470> here<00:01:11.890> and

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
and that's why I have gaps here and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.260 
and that's why I have gaps here and
there<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.960> sort<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:14.020> make<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.170> symmetrical<00:01:15.270> on

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
there I sort of make it symmetrical on

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.610 
there I sort of make it symmetrical on
the<00:01:16.450> whole<00:01:16.600> though<00:01:16.810> everything<00:01:17.350> else<00:01:17.470> is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
the whole though everything else is

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.170 
the whole though everything else is
pretty<00:01:17.800> simple<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.430> build<00:01:18.580> I<00:01:18.760> mean<00:01:18.909> this<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.150> a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
pretty simple to build I mean this is a

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.310 
pretty simple to build I mean this is a
hole<00:01:19.600> here<00:01:19.630> only<00:01:20.170> in<00:01:20.260> two<00:01:20.440> bits<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:22.320> then

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
hole here only in two bits and then

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.340 
hole here only in two bits and then
you've<00:01:23.530> got<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.799> oars<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.460> lot<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.330> wars<00:01:25.600> you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
you've got the oars a lot of wars you

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.480 
you've got the oars a lot of wars you
have<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.500> be<00:01:26.590> careful<00:01:26.979> of<00:01:27.010> these<00:01:27.130> because

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
have to be careful of these because

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.820 
have to be careful of these because
they're<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.670> bit<00:01:27.940> weak<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:29.290> you're<00:01:29.500> gonna<00:01:29.680> buy

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
they're a bit weak if you're gonna buy

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.380 
they're a bit weak if you're gonna buy
the<00:01:29.890> model<00:01:30.190> anyway<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.750> we<00:01:32.530> have<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:33.390> sail

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
the model anyway the we have the sail

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.250 
the model anyway the we have the sail
why<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:35.110> yep<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:37.570> bit<00:01:37.810> pretty<00:01:38.049> difficult

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
why is it yep this bit pretty difficult

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.550 
why is it yep this bit pretty difficult
again<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.979> lot<00:01:39.369> of<00:01:39.460> knots<00:01:39.960> rotten<00:01:40.960> things<00:01:41.320> to

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
again a lot of knots rotten things to

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.940 
again a lot of knots rotten things to
not<00:01:42.540> I'm<00:01:43.540> pretty<00:01:43.869> easy<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.229> paint<00:01:44.440> it's<00:01:44.830> all

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
not I'm pretty easy to paint it's all

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.130 
not I'm pretty easy to paint it's all
wooden<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.400> other<00:01:45.640> day<00:01:45.820> paint<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.900> sail<00:01:47.110> a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
wooden the other day paint the sail a

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.030 
wooden the other day paint the sail a
bit<00:01:48.299> master<00:01:49.299> transfer<00:01:49.689> quite<00:01:50.590> difficult<00:01:50.830> to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
bit master transfer quite difficult to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.179 
bit master transfer quite difficult to
put<00:01:51.220> on<00:01:51.340> but<00:01:51.670> did<00:01:52.420> in<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.689> end<00:01:52.780> they're<00:01:53.740> all<00:01:53.979> I

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
put on but did in the end they're all I

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.550 
put on but did in the end they're all I
think<00:01:54.250> I'd<00:01:54.700> recommend<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.180> model<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:56.170> anyone

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
think I'd recommend this model to anyone

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.480 
think I'd recommend this model to anyone
who<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:57.040> interested<00:01:57.310> in<00:01:57.880> sailing<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:59.250> I<00:02:00.250> think

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
who is interested in sailing and I think

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.560 
who is interested in sailing and I think
it<00:02:00.610> makes<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.790> pretty<00:02:01.000> good<00:02:01.119> model<00:02:01.270> when

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
it makes a pretty good model when

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.450 
it makes a pretty good model when
displayed<00:02:02.229> or<00:02:02.439> maybe<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:03.009> could<00:02:03.130> display<00:02:03.430> it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
displayed or maybe you could display it

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.609 
displayed or maybe you could display it
in<00:02:03.580> water<00:02:03.759> more<00:02:04.060> cause<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:05.320> don't<00:02:05.500> ever

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
in water more cause you you don't ever

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.830 
in water more cause you you don't ever
you<00:02:05.680> want<00:02:05.799> with<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.040> well<00:02:06.820> yeah<00:02:06.939> it's<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.299> 1:50
