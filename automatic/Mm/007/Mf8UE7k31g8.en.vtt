00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.760
 best moments you can create with 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.220
 dancing 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:34.139
 chobani must honestly say this is your 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.090
 best performance ever that I have 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.620

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.419

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.750
 the right one for every dance partner 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.750
 connection 'right angle to find right 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.380
 right ways to approach him so this 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:08.250
 is your strength again and I think it's fair 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.900
 you surpass yourself because pain is dancing 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.090
