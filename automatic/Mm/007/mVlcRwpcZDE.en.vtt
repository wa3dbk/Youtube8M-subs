maybe near the top of the 10 terabyte
clusters<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.710> red<00:01:28.920> anymore

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
clusters will we not be in red anymore

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
clusters will we not be in red anymore
cuz<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.000> would<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.210> nice<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.720> sorry<00:01:31.049> we've

been riding the red line for like months
uh<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:34.020> been<00:01:34.170> relatively<00:01:34.560> ok<00:01:34.950> lately<00:01:35.250> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
uh it's been relatively ok lately I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.100 
uh it's been relatively ok lately I
expanded<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.850> 21<00:01:36.180> terabytes<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.020> we

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
expanded it to 21 terabytes and we

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.600 
expanded it to 21 terabytes and we
offloaded<00:01:37.500> 4<00:01:37.799> terabytes<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> other<00:01:38.490> day

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
offloaded 4 terabytes the other day

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.780 
offloaded 4 terabytes the other day
through<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.909> guys<00:01:39.320> alright<00:01:40.430> Wow

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
through you guys alright Wow

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.080 
through you guys alright Wow
so<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> looks<00:01:42.479> extremely<00:01:43.439> similar<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
so it looks extremely similar to the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.270 
so it looks extremely similar to the
Nvidia<00:01:45.570> disk<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.229> went<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.619> yeah

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
Nvidia disk that we went to go see yeah

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.990 
Nvidia disk that we went to go see yeah
that's<00:01:47.549> true

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that's true

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.149 
that's true
not<00:01:48.240> exactly<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> same<00:01:48.930> at<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.409> ya<00:01:49.619> know<00:01:49.890> but

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
not exactly the same at all ya know but

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.359 
not exactly the same at all ya know but
the<00:01:50.399> horizontal<00:01:51.409> reservoirs<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> Nvidia

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the horizontal reservoirs at the Nvidia

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
the horizontal reservoirs at the Nvidia
one<00:01:53.549> had<00:01:53.759> two<00:01:54.030> completely<00:01:54.479> separate<00:01:55.140> pcs<00:01:55.590> one

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
one had two completely separate pcs one

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.200 
one had two completely separate pcs one
on<00:01:56.009> either<00:01:56.159> side<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.880> kind<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.090> know

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
on either side we just kind of know

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.870 
on either side we just kind of know
didn't<00:01:57.479> make<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> ton<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> sense<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> me<00:01:58.290> but

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
didn't make a ton of sense to me but

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.209 
didn't make a ton of sense to me but
whatever<00:02:00.530> they're<00:02:01.530> Nvidia<00:02:01.829> they<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.040> what

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
whatever they're Nvidia they do what

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.130 
whatever they're Nvidia they do what
they<00:02:02.310> want<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.670> guess<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:03.689> dual<00:02:03.930> power

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
they want I guess these dual power

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.690 
they want I guess these dual power
supplies<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:04.920> pretty<00:02:05.280> sick<00:02:05.460> looking

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
supplies in there pretty sick looking

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.699 
supplies in there pretty sick looking
system<00:02:06.119> oh<00:02:07.399> yeah<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.509> super<00:02:09.929> cool<00:02:10.110> gets<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
system oh yeah that is super cool gets a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.650 
system oh yeah that is super cool gets a
lot<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:10.920> sick<00:02:11.489> than<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:12.239> had<00:02:12.450> originally

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
lot more sick than we had originally

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.520
