had<00:03:46.680> him<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:48.240> probably<00:03:48.450> should<00:03:48.720> have

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
had him and I probably should have

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.270 
had him and I probably should have
shipped<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.410> he<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:49.650> got<00:03:49.830> really<00:03:49.980> lucky

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
shipped it and he just got really lucky

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.130 
shipped it and he just got really lucky
and<00:03:50.520> flopped<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.850> flush<00:03:51.090> draw<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:52.020> it's

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and flopped the flush draw so it's

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.720 
and flopped the flush draw so it's
harder<00:03:52.470> for<00:03:52.500> me<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.770> read<00:03:53.040> him<00:03:53.250> when<00:03:53.400> he<00:03:53.490> ships

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
harder for me to read him when he ships

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.030 
harder for me to read him when he ships
it<00:03:53.910> if<00:03:54.240> it<00:03:54.390> comes<00:03:54.510> Queen<00:03:54.840> four<00:03:55.110> deuce<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.620> he
