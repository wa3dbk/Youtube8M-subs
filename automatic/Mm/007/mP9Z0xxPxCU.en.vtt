 hello friends in this video I love you 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:09.099
 share that I won a skateboard with 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.679
 doritos in my previous videos I've 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.379
 open four bags of doritos in two 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.720
 I got strips and in two not apart from 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.480
 your help has opened some I think that 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.600
 about 4 or 5 bags of doritos more and I do not 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.400
 has come out absolutely nothing was very 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.290
 annoyed with myself because there was no 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.220
 answered the questions well the first 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.010
 it was that what he was doing to jarvis in 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.510
 ironman this I put the first 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.730
 answer because I could not read the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.670
 others for recording the video was 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.550
 incorrect the second question that does not 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.920
 right and not serious but I tell you by 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.140
 if it serves you was that to what 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.339
 the American captain was engaged before 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.109
 be captain america this the answers 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.659
 the answers that I remember was a 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.460
 option cook another option something military 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.889
 which is what I had put another 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.350
 Chile recruiter and the other one does not 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:04.839
 agreement and because I have not been buying 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.869
 Doritos I did not find 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.329
 this more codes but right now I was 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.340
 here picking up the desk where 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.039
 recorded I realized that in a strip 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.789
 two codes came in then I entered the 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:20.950
 second code let me participate 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.630
 select a door he told me he was 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.729
 empty gives you the option to choose a 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.579
 second door but they have to do it 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.729
 in less than 15 seconds he chose another and 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.799
 I was this skateboard was not what I 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.649
 I would have preferred, I really wanted 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:39.189
 to earn a captain's horn 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.560
 america or hulk but well this is 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.829
 it was the only option he had and the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.010
 question they asked me was that it was 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.930
 the shield of the captain america 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.610

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.480

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.360
