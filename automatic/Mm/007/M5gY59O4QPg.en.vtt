00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
get all over and I know some of the same

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.200 
get all over and I know some of the same
hairs<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.770> thinking<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.280> yeah<00:01:53.549> yeah<00:01:53.939> yeah

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
hairs of thinking like yeah yeah yeah

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.300 
hairs of thinking like yeah yeah yeah
this<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.659> great<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.500> great<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.130> this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
this is great this is great but this

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.969 
this is great this is great but this
could<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.600> bad<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.259> i'd

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
could actually be bad because i'd

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.179 
could actually be bad because i'd
imagine<00:01:59.579> NC<00:01:59.880> double-a<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.680> lot<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> people<00:02:02.009> said

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
imagine NC double-a a lot of people said

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.940 
imagine NC double-a a lot of people said
for<00:02:02.399> years<00:02:02.549> NC<00:02:03.149> double-a<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.170> better<00:02:04.680> of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
for years NC double-a was the better of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.410 
for years NC double-a was the better of
the<00:02:05.159> two<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.200> might<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.710> crushing<00:02:08.129> blow

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
the two so this might be a crushing blow

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.540 
the two so this might be a crushing blow
because<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.599> might<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:10.080> stuck<00:02:10.289> with<00:02:10.770> only

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
because we might be stuck with only

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
graphics are way more detail so it's

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.580 
graphics are way more detail so it's
like<00:05:07.150> how<00:05:08.150> can<00:05:08.180> they<00:05:08.540> advance<00:05:08.960> their<00:05:09.200> game<00:05:09.410> so

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
like how can they advance their game so

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.520 
like how can they advance their game so
much<00:05:09.770> i<00:05:09.890> think<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:11.240> devs<00:05:11.540> will<00:05:11.810> finally<00:05:12.200> learn

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
much i think the devs will finally learn

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.050 
much i think the devs will finally learn
how<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:13.570> operate<00:05:14.570> around<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.770> system<00:05:16.100> like

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
how to operate around the system like

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.870 
how to operate around the system like
right<00:05:17.270> now<00:05:17.300> this<00:05:17.630> NC<00:05:17.960> double-a<00:05:18.380> i<00:05:18.760> think<00:05:19.760> they

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
right now this NC double-a i think they

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.460 
right now this NC double-a i think they
finally<00:05:20.120> figured<00:05:20.660> out<00:05:20.720> how<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:20.960> do<00:05:21.200> some<00:05:21.410> of

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
finally figured out how to do some of

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.620 
finally figured out how to do some of
the<00:05:21.530> things<00:05:21.560> they<00:05:21.830> want<00:05:22.040> to<00:05:22.100> do<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.820> so<00:05:23.450> that's

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
the things they want to do and so that's

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.940 
the things they want to do and so that's
why<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.870> games<00:05:24.139> are<00:05:24.320> starting<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.590> get<00:05:24.710> better

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
why the games are starting to get better

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.800 
why the games are starting to get better
and<00:05:25.280> now<00:05:25.760> we<00:05:25.820> get<00:05:26.090> ready<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.360> go<00:05:26.450> to<00:05:26.510> another

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
and now we get ready to go to another

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.969 
and now we get ready to go to another
gin<00:05:27.669> new<00:05:28.669> console<00:05:29.360> when<00:05:30.200> we<00:05:30.290> run<00:05:30.440> to<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.740> same

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
gin new console when we run to the same

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.610 
gin new console when we run to the same
kind<00:05:31.160> of<00:05:31.280> problems<00:05:32.210> again<00:05:32.510> with<00:05:32.780> a<00:05:32.810> learning

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
kind of problems again with a learning

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.070 
kind of problems again with a learning
curve<00:05:33.979> with<00:05:34.310> depths<00:05:34.880> so<00:05:35.419> we<00:05:35.570> would<00:05:35.720> be<00:05:35.840> stuck

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
curve with depths so we would be stuck

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.380 
curve with depths so we would be stuck
with<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:36.290> same<00:05:36.460> kind<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.580> games<00:05:37.820> for<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.120> next

with the same kind of games for the next

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.380 
with the same kind of games for the next
two<00:05:38.660> or<00:05:38.690> three<00:05:38.810> years<00:05:39.910> now<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:40.940> lot<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.330> these
