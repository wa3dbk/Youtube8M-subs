00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.970
 a solid one for many years 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.140
 facility and almost one 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.170
 tradition of the adac child also sits 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.660
 In 2012, 33 models were opened again 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.710
 safety ergonomics and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.359
 Pollutant analyzed for each 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.099
 child, there are good children put that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.539
 means independent of age 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.619
 the parents between different 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.409
 select products 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.780
 we have some outliers with us 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.710
 poor security 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.210
 especially gratifying is that this time 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.579
 no child seat by the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.680
 pollutant testing falls unfortunately it is 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.930
 But very often mistakes when installing the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.180
 seats are made by the users 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.430
 which in serious case have blatant consequences 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.019
 can 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.090
 a common mistake when installing 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.050
 baby bowls is the shoulder and basin 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.989
 well reversed 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.839
 So that means the belly strap is being changed 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.359
 put the school around and the 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.510
 shoulder strap runs over the leg end 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.009
 the shell in the accident can be the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 baby seat so out of the belt turn provided 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.630
 the vehicle via so-called isofix 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.860
 Attachment points is this 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.049
 Danger not given 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.210
 in the following test is the one 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.670
 baby seat with isofix mounted the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.130
 others fastened with reversed straps 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 in slow motion is clearly visible 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.340
 like the wrongly installed shell too 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.740
 a plaything of the forces 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.570
 isofix child seats are very stable in the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.649
 car anchored 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.570
 In addition, the baby bowl can be very 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.009
 simply mounted on the isofix base 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.530
 or be taken down again 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.179
 It is very fast and a baubehler 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.710
 are virtually excluded 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.509
 So that means shoulder and belly belt 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.829
 can not be reversed and 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.630
 The baby bowl also can not fit in 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.420
 the direction of travel is one 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.399
 very safe thing in the group 0 plus 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.850
 for children up to 13 kilograms 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:02.360
 he kept the ibex aton 2 fixed with onbase 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.369
 a good in the group 0 1 for children up 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.050
 18 kilograms cut the peg perego 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.610
 viaggio convertible with poor 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.740
 O 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.440
 in group 1 for children from nine to 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.760
 18 kilograms , it was a good for the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.760
 sybase juno fix 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.050
 in group 1 2 3 for children from 9 to 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.420
 36 kilograms became the kiddy guardian 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.420
 fxpro rated poorly 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.140
 in group 2 3 15 to 36 kilograms 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.840
 From four to twelve years old, there was a good one 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.569
 for the maxi cosi rodi fix next to the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.430
 easy ks looks inflatable cut in 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.680
 This group has two more models 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.140
 lacking mainly because of 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.140
 defects in the side impact 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.060
 so was the grazer junior 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.060
 maxi here a poor 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.830
 and also for the geological 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.190
 there are still some products here 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.140
 where for older children the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.210
 backrest can be removed or 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.770
 these seats must be removed 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.810
 then provide no protection when 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.970
 Side impact and such seats fall 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.580
 in our test by also in the future 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.470
 the adac does not just want to do it with their tests 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.180
 the safety of our children in the car 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.650
 increase but also the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.600
 Purchase decision for the parents 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.010
 facilitate 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.020
 as a demand to the manufacturer one can 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.700
 say that all children's seats one 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.170
 side impact protection that means 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.780
 So also child seats for the older ones 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.280
 need children side bolsters it 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.480
 important that the pollutants from the 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.860
 child sets come out 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.900
 Here we are on a relatively good 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.030
 away we have a lot less now 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.600
 pollutants found in the seats as 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.600
 still in the last year
