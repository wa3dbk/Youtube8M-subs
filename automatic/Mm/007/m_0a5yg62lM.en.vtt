well<00:01:37.990> one<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.350> don't<00:01:38.470> know<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.040> actual<00:01:39.720> top

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
well one you don't know the actual top

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.109 
well one you don't know the actual top
bit<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.920> only<00:01:42.040> know<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.340> lowest<00:01:42.670> but<00:01:42.880> which

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
bit you only know the lowest but which

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.900 
bit you only know the lowest but which
is<00:01:43.300> different<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.690> Adwords<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.340> you've<00:01:45.550> got<00:01:45.580> to

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
is different to Adwords so you've got to

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.580 
is different to Adwords so you've got to
really<00:01:46.090> play<00:01:46.300> around<00:01:46.330> with<00:01:46.690> it<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:46.990> take<00:01:47.350> some

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
really play around with it and take some

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.280 
really play around with it and take some
take<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.460> risk<00:01:48.640> really<00:01:48.970> as<00:01:49.750> long<00:01:49.930> as<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.140> works

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
take the risk really as long as it works

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.639 
take the risk really as long as it works
in<00:01:50.470> with<00:01:50.590> your<00:01:50.680> budget<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.750> end<00:01:53.110> profit

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
in with your budget with the end profit

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.760 
in with your budget with the end profit
you<00:01:53.950> know<00:01:54.070> from<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.399> results<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.509> as<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.680> can

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
you know from the results so as you can

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.960 
you know from the results so as you can
see<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.430> clicks<00:01:57.700> are<00:01:57.790> coming<00:01:58.060> through<00:01:58.360> and

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
see the clicks are coming through and

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.250 
see the clicks are coming through and
the<00:02:00.970> key<00:02:01.180> now<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.540> obviously<00:02:01.870> isn't<00:02:02.080> working

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
the key now is obviously isn't working

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.980 
the key now is obviously isn't working
on<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.650> other<00:02:02.770> end<00:02:03.300> so<00:02:04.300> let's<00:02:04.690> have<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.840> quick

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.970 
most of the money was made in these days
I<00:02:21.910> paused<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.840> pretty<00:02:23.380> quickly<00:02:23.620> here

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.070 

and<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.959> no<00:02:28.170> idea<00:02:28.379> why<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.760> click-through

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
and I have no idea why the click-through

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.170 
and I have no idea why the click-through
amount<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.379> higher<00:02:31.700> then<00:02:32.700> what<00:02:32.909> it<00:02:33.000> shows

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
amount here is higher then what it shows

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.140 
amount here is higher then what it shows
an<00:02:33.330> AdMob<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.220> I've<00:02:35.400> never<00:02:35.610> seen<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.000> at

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
an AdMob and if I've never seen it at

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.770 
an AdMob and if I've never seen it at
any<00:02:36.599> any<00:02:37.019> time<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.409> it<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.830> either<00:02:38.040> equaled

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
any any time of it is it either equaled

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.539 
any any time of it is it either equaled
so<00:02:39.780> anyway<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.379> see<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:41.519> know
