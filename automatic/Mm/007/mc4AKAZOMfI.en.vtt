almost<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.729> year<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> half<00:01:15.270> ago<00:01:15.450> believe<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
almost a year and a half ago believe it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.910 
almost a year and a half ago believe it
or<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:18.540> always<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.930> two<00:01:19.170> cables<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
or not and you always have two cables I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.969 
or not and you always have two cables I
suppose<00:01:21.229> well<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:22.770> ahead

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
suppose well we can actually go ahead

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.609 
suppose well we can actually go ahead
and<00:01:23.130> open<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.020> basically<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and open this so here it basically is

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499 
and open this so here it basically is
you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.130> plug<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.820> directly<00:01:27.270> via<00:01:27.420> the
