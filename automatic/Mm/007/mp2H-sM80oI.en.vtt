important in the production of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700 
important in the production of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
glutathione in the body glutathione is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190 
glutathione in the body glutathione is
produced<00:01:20.219> by<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> liver<00:01:20.819> it's<00:01:21.600> also<00:01:21.780> into

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
produced by the liver it's also into

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.590 
produced by the liver it's also into
produced<00:01:23.130> by<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.399> intestines<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
produced by the intestines and the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.649 
produced by the intestines and the
kidneys<00:01:24.990> alright<00:01:25.789> when<00:01:26.789> when<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.179> body<00:01:27.390> gets

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
kidneys alright when when the body gets

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.480 
kidneys alright when when the body gets
disease<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> stuff<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> glutathione<00:01:29.069> levels

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
disease and stuff the glutathione levels

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.779 
disease and stuff the glutathione levels
in<00:01:29.999> the<00:01:30.149> blood<00:01:30.679> decreases<00:01:31.789> glutathione

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
in the blood decreases glutathione

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.730 
in the blood decreases glutathione
protects<00:01:33.359> liver<00:01:33.960> cells<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.079> super

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
protects liver cells so this is a super

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.569 
protects liver cells so this is a super
antioxidant<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.649> just<00:01:40.679> by<00:01:41.310> taking

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
antioxidant and you know just by taking

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.999 
antioxidant and you know just by taking
the<00:01:41.939> glutathione<00:01:42.539> supplement<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.770> been

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the glutathione supplement it's been

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.699 
the glutathione supplement it's been
found<00:01:44.310> through<00:01:44.850> studies<00:01:45.359> that<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:46.170> doesn't

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
found through studies that it doesn't

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.919 
found through studies that it doesn't
increase<00:01:47.639> the<00:01:47.819> glutathione<00:01:48.149> levels<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
increase the glutathione levels in the

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.840 
increase the glutathione levels in the
body<00:01:49.109> the<00:01:49.619> best<00:01:50.369> way<00:01:50.639> to<00:01:51.770> get<00:01:52.770> glutathione<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
body the best way to get glutathione is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.779 
body the best way to get glutathione is
through<00:01:54.090> these<00:01:54.240> natural<00:01:54.780> foods<00:01:55.579> spinach<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
through these natural foods spinach and

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.779 
through these natural foods spinach and
tomatoes<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.539> two<00:01:57.779> top<00:01:58.079> also<00:01:58.529> walnuts<00:01:59.520> and

glutathione is low levels and all cells
in<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.939> body<00:02:54.090> have<00:02:54.480> lots<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.590> glutathione

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
in the body have lots of glutathione

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.280 
in the body have lots of glutathione
glutathione<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.360> one<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.049> main
