00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260

face cams but the way I did it before it
took<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:08.329> think<00:04:09.329> something<00:04:09.780> stupid<00:04:10.319> like<00:04:10.470> six

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
took I think something stupid like six

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.380 
took I think something stupid like six
hours<00:04:11.270> to

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
hours to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.320 
hours to
render<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.500> last<00:04:13.830> video<00:04:14.040> when<00:04:14.910> normally

something<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:15.930> length<00:04:16.290> would<00:04:16.560> only<00:04:16.739> take

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
something of that length would only take

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.180 
something of that length would only take
like<00:04:17.060> 20<00:04:18.060> minutes<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.350> must<00:04:19.769> be<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.010> way<00:04:20.160> it

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
like 20 minutes so it must be the way it

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.700 
like 20 minutes so it must be the way it
was<00:04:20.549> encoded<00:04:20.970> or<00:04:21.299> something<00:04:21.690> but<00:04:21.930> right<00:04:22.530> now<00:04:22.680> I

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
just don't see that as being worth it
