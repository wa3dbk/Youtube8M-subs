00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.490
 once I bring you a video in which we are going to 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.469
 talk a little about the news of 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.930
 minecraft from the 360 to the news 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.640

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.680
 studies at the company that carries everything 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.840
 the theme of minecraft in those 360 has 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.060
 confirmed the things he has been saying 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.950
 all that the truth that I do believe that 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.630
 at least like a month that we do not talk about 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.190
 these things and the truth that I already did 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.410
 missing because 4j studies has been 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.730
 commenting things lately for 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.350
 make a brief summary of what we are going 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.210
 to speak in this video it will be 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.850
 about the twelfth update that happens 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.920
 there are dates confirm something that says 4j 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.929
 studies lately all that about the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.670
 twelfth update we will also talk 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.499
 of a new image that this time instead 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.179
 of giving her 4j studies has given 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.640
 microsoft but on the twelfth 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.249
 update and finally we'll talk 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.829
 also a possible new skin pack 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.019
 number 5 that has confirmed 4j studies 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.670
 so after this brief summary 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.789
 What have I done to you? 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.350
 let's start let's talk about the 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.060
 twelfth update that is the last 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.040
 who has said four jota studies and that 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.230
 there is confirmed worth four jota studies 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.570
 a few days ago he has been commenting a 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.159
 little information too much 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.320
 some subscribers have left 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.909
 comments saying that the twelfth 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.010
 update was already in test I os 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.479
 I'm going to say and I'm going to deny this and 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.250
 you know that the updates of 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.740
 minecraft before the boss 360 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.800
 update the finally pass a small 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.119
 test that is roughly like 15 days that 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.440
 is the mandan 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.360
 all the versions and all that to 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.820
 microsoft and then after 15 days 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.770
 microsoft the okay and our 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.710
 minecraft is updated worth say that 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.479
 if the twelfth update was already 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.850
 there would be 15 days left in the test 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.369
 come out thing that as I say is not 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.080
 true even if there is some tweet or some 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.180
 little thing that has commented 4j studies that 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.470
 can confuse the first tweet 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.240
 that I am going to show you is this that you will see 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.160
 right now on screen that what we 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.170
 comes to tell is that 4j studies 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.149
 is currently working on the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.729
 twelfth update they say there 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.530
 many errors to be corrected yet 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.060
 the version this means I think that 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.739
 they have already implemented everything that will come 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.570
 but that there have been a series of errors 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.070
 that they still have to work on them and 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.890
 they also tell us that they will let us know 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.690
 soon as I go to the microsoft share 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.610
 test that is this that I spoke to you then 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.819
 about 15 days so microsoft's 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.859
 approval 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.510
 4 j studies republished a tweet 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.819
 that I'm not going to put it here in 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.290
 screen in which they said they will give what 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.879
 which is the official list of changes of the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.560
 twelfth update once it is in the 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.389
 test that we were talking about before 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.879
 that microsoft 's okay so 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:37.340
 So far we do not know how 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.959
 you know guys on that official list is 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.370
 where they give all the content that comes in 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.319
 the twelfth update at the moment 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.090
 we officially know that there will be 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.560
 things that have been commenting that 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.209
 we have already analyzed in other videos but 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 for now until we have that 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.409
 official list we can not know to science 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.659
 true that will enter do not worry 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.519
 anyway for these things of the 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.049
 official list and that because as soon as 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.639
 it will surely come out that we will analyze it 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.439
 quietly in a video and we'll see 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.719
 all the content that is going to enter like this 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.879
 that's why do not worry for the moment 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.169
 this is all four jot study 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.819
 it has been commented since the twelfth 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.349
 update from the last video that 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.419
 we saw that I think I was analyzing a 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.969
 little some images and have not given more 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:17.629
 information take like a month or a little 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:19.609
 more without any additional information from 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.780
 no I think four Jota 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.370
 study is surely gone 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.750
 vacations have gone to the beach to all or 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.209
 something like that because I can not understand how 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.870
 in minecraft of pc have already got the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.190
 update of 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.720
 horses and we are here 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.760
 waiting for us to put the language of 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.349
 jungle but good anyway guys we are going to 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.720
 leave this topic let's be positive and 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.819
 think that since they are commenting so much 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.489
 about the twelfth update will come 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.510
 soon now we are going to go with other 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.329
 things 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.040
 we will continue now for example with the 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.900
 image that I was telling you that they have 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.120
 published from the twelfth update the 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.250
 Microsoft people and here is one thing 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.230
 that does not fit me and is that as 4j said 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.760
 studies the twelfth version 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 update has not yet sent it to 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.120
 test but they do have access to 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.250
 Microsoft people therefore I believe 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.530
 that there is very little left for him to come and 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.060
 in the image they have published is a 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.010
 what are you going to see now what to say to you 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.549
 what they did was publish a 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.720
 tweet saying that if I had 200 retweets 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.310
 would publish in the image and that's how it was because 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.290
 obviously everyone has 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.639
 want to see a new image and it is this 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.859
 I 'm going to put you here that we're going to 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.570
 talk a little about her now that she looks 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.910
 guys, you see nothing a player in 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.130
 creative with a basic skin by 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.050
 there so obviously the biome of 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.020
 jungle that is just opposite and that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.550
 it is clearly observed that we have already analyzed 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.860
 in other images that also published 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.780
 and above all what you see 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.639
 quite to see them are the ocelots that 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.219
 has just in front the player and 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.319
 if t is also seen as there are some spawn 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:45.259
 ex specials for ocelots in the 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.969
 image that I see right now I do not know 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.159
 nothing else happens that may be out there 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.840
 hidden like I hope you find 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.219
 something else you know guys if you see 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.930
 something else in the image leave it in the 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.759
 comments but as I tell you the biome 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.370
 jungle and ocelots's all me 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.990
 has attracted the attention of this image and 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.909
 as had been said in that little 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.650
 summary of the beginning of the video now 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.139
 let's talk about the skin pack number 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.909
 5 of our minecraft of the 360 4j 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.189
 studies through this tweet that you go 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.050
 to see now on screen have said have 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.879
 answered a user that the artists 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.949
 of four jota studies have already finished 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:18.560
 with the skin pack number 5 and they will give 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.719
 information very soon also in addition to 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.789
 this tweet have answered that good 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:24.860
 they will post very early images of what 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.319
 that would be the skin pack number 5 to me in 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.150
 personal I think that in those 360 ​​already 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.069
 we have too many skin packs and I 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.960
 I would love you to stop following 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.550
 making skin packs and putting on the 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.529
 texture pack so that when the 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.029
 twelfth update that we already saw in 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.039
 another video that had confirmed the subject 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.120
 of the testour pack supports in 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.100
 As you step out the twelfth 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.350
 I think they should put the 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.930
 amount of possible texture pack that 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.000
 I may not know 5 or 6 although they are worth 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.650
 microsoft points or whatever I prefer 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.240
 that focus on texture packs and on 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.340
 little things of the updates that 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.199
 new skin packs that as I tell you already 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.750
 we have too many special halloween 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.940
 special one year good the truth that 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.260
 there's been a lot of skin packs me 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.270
 I think we already have enough to 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.490
 choose the same I do not know if I 'll buy it from 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.500
 see what images show us and what 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.870
 little things goes into the skin pack but of 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.460
 moment does not catch my attention and 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.750
 there are no more guys that will comment on the 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.699
 news about our main boss crater 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.169
 360 updates and so on what 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.760
 only one that is surprising me 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.900
 is that four jacks studies is 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.880
 taking so long with the twelfth 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.550
 update expecting that when 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.320
 the ninth came out the tenth and the eleventh 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.389
 they left because I do not know with two weeks of 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.310
 difference or something like that anyway 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.020
 I tell you not to worry about the subject 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.510
 of news and things like that you already know that a 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.370
 I like to be quite informed with 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.800
