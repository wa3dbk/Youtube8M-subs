00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.800
 boys today I propose this 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.509
 makeup that is a smoked towards the 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.370
 quantity that I did not leave a smoked like that 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.559
 I was crazy for doing one and 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.019
 I decided to turn on the camera and record this 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.190
 because I think that a very 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.930
 very sexy and glamorous female is a 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.730
 The makeup you need is a little 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.070
 time and patience because you have to 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.260
 blur very well but I think more 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.420
 I leave the veins with and tutorial with 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.580
 this creamy mix pencil I will create 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.290
 a base on which to place after 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.820
 the shadows in dust because as I already 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.140
 I said in other videos this is going to do 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.560
 that the makeup lasts longer 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.570
 with these brushes he blew this 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.730
 basis for us to be great and I'm going to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.130
 darkening above all pegadito to the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.800
 eyelashes then took a white pencil 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.630
 this also aniseed and is creamy like 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.970
 the previous one and I'll place it in the 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.530
 areas that we should illuminate ie dry 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.160
 of the silk and in the internal angle of the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.320
 eye blew it with your finger and now I take 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.920
 my palette of the 88 colors 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.660
 start applying this dark brown 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.760
 well attached to the eyelashes in 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.280
 little touches with this brush of his 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.310
 then with this brooch of realtech and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.260
 I'm going to take this salmon color and come 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.810
 a diffused application of color 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.910
 now change brush and I take this brown 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.890
 a little bit darker I put it right 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.510
 under the salmon but very important 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.120
 without climbing completely on top of 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.420
 salmon took a darker brown and what 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.890
 placed in the basin what we are 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.930
 building a smooth transition of a 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.270
 color to another and finally a whole 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.680
 little tip of black with this little brush 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.920
 finish in tip to have more 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.770
 precision blurred it well in that this 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.330
 secret of the smoked in blur 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.580
 Apply a little color at a time and 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.200
 blur here I went back to the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.990
 brochita with which I placed the color 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.610
 salmon and blurs the edges well that 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.650
 It is also very important to have a 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.020
 brush for each color or if it will not 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.630
 cleaning now I'm going to take the color more 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.970
 I'm clear about this policy of him and I'm going 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.800
 to put a pegadito to the eyebrows and in the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.570
 Internal angle of the eye with a pencil 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.330
 black I'm going to delineate the eyelid 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.340
 superior than the inferior trying to 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.010
 keep me as close as possible to the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.940
 lashes and then I'm going to blur that 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.000
 stroke 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.460
 blur diffuse blur 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.560
 now let's touch up of course the 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.780
 eyebrows and for that I'm going to take this pencil 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.610
 brown which is a lighter shade than the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.340
 hair color of my eyebrows that's very 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.590
 important so that they are natural I go 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.690
 to blur the stroke and then I'll 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.600
 take this brown shadow from the palette of 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.820
 the 88 colors to seal the pencil to 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.750
 that lasts me and now I'm going to take the pencil 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.750
 He cited black 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.200
 I'm going to delineate the upper water line 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.200
 and the lower one 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.890
 now I'm going to put false eyelashes 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.650
 this step is of course optional but 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.900
 I think it completes the look I'm going to curl 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.879
 the tabs to join my lashes to 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.159
 the false eyelashes and then I'll 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.920
 place mascara for 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.299
 merge them even more because the idea is that 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.910
 do not notice that we have tabs 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.549
 False now I will take this policy 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.590
 of correctors saint saint and I'm going to 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.049
 correct the external angle of then this 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.200
 to clean the makeup the stamps 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.510
 with a little bit of dust and now I take back the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.269
 more policy clarito color 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.269
 to illuminate the top of the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.459
 cheekbone and now flush moment I'm going to 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.410
 place this blush that I love from 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.810
 now and at the same time I'm going to make a 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.780
 little of touring we went to the lips 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.480
 and I'm going to outline it with this pencil that is 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.879
 skin color is a hyundai even profile or 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.190
 be the edges of the lip that I give 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.170
 little touches also in the corner for 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.230
 give dimension after I will take my 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.180
 he believed my favorite lipstick new that is the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.950
 my attitude of revlon and we're going to 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.220
 place a little bit of gloss on top 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.080
 to make it more glamorous 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.820
 in this would be our final result 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.740
 with super intense eyes and yes 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.980
 have not yet learned to perform 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.160
 smoked I urge you to taste 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.190
 try and practice because I believe that 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.300
 It's a look we should not give up 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.770
 I hope you liked it and that you 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.760
 cheer up to try it see you in the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.760
 next video
