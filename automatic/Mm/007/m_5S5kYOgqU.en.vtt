00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the intensities I know I could probably

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.500 
the intensities I know I could probably
do<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.809> 365<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:46.950> something<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.030> upper

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
do like 365 or something like that upper

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.139 
do like 365 or something like that upper
threes<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.289> eight<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.910> want<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
threes for eight but I just want to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.400 
threes for eight but I just want to
maintain<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.719> kind<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.960> speed<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
maintain that kind of speed and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.619 
maintain that kind of speed and
explosiveness<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.910> my<00:00:54.210> high

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
explosiveness that you see with my high

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.139 
explosiveness that you see with my high
bar<00:00:54.840> squat<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.340> did<00:00:56.520> yesterday<00:00:56.699> I've

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
bar squat and like I did yesterday I've

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
bar squat and like I did yesterday I've
warmed<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.719> some<00:00:57.870> overhead<00:00:58.170> squats<00:00:58.530> than

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
warmed up with some overhead squats than

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.340 
warmed up with some overhead squats than
i<00:00:58.920> did<00:00:58.980> my<00:00:59.340> my<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> rep<00:01:00.359> max<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:00.960> today<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
i did my my a rep max and then today I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.900 
i did my my a rep max and then today I
moved<00:01:01.680> back<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> overhead<00:01:02.430> squat<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
moved back to the overhead squat and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329 
moved back to the overhead squat and
this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.629> 95<00:01:04.199> pounds<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.619> used<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.010> my<00:01:05.040> 3

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this is 95 pounds this used to be my 3

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609 
this is 95 pounds this used to be my 3
rep<00:01:05.519> max<00:01:05.670> I've<00:01:06.659> only<00:01:06.840> logged<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> few

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
rep max I've only logged this a few

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
rep max I've only logged this a few
times<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.549> squat<00:01:08.850> rack<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.720> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
times on the squat rack so I think this

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.920 
times on the squat rack so I think this
is<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> fourth<00:01:10.260> time<00:01:10.320> I've<00:01:10.560> ever<00:01:10.590> done<00:01:11.490> this

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
is the fourth time I've ever done this

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.410 
is the fourth time I've ever done this
movement<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:14.310> I'm<00:01:14.400> pretty<00:01:14.640> diligent<00:01:15.060> about

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
movement and I'm pretty diligent about

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.780 
movement and I'm pretty diligent about
logging<00:01:15.810> what<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.830> sure<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> practice<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
logging what I do I'm sure I practice it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.609 
logging what I do I'm sure I practice it
before<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> PVC<00:01:18.810> pipe<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.560> of

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
before the PVC pipe and that kind of

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.800 
before the PVC pipe and that kind of
stuff<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> movement

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
stuff but I think this is a movement

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
stuff but I think this is a movement
that<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> keep<00:01:22.560> trying<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.250> develop

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that was going to keep trying to develop

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.149 
that was going to keep trying to develop
simply<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.020> fun<00:01:25.320> not

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
simply just because it's fun not

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.800 
simply just because it's fun not
necessarily<00:01:26.549> programming<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.540> try<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
necessarily programming that just try to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.840 
necessarily programming that just try to
get<00:01:27.990> better<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> feel<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.520> doing

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
get better at it when I feel like doing

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.520 
get better at it when I feel like doing

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
not doing any program I'm just trying to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.230 
not doing any program I'm just trying to
push<00:01:44.790> myself<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.810> sustainable<00:01:46.799> manner

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
push myself in a sustainable manner

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
really been pushing myself on a written

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
really been pushing myself on a written
program<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.729> an<00:02:00.180> excel<00:02:00.540> file<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.140> like

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
program on an excel file and like

of just like in this limbo zone before i
go<00:02:10.259> back<00:02:10.410> stateside

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.699 
have fun so after I did my squats moved
order<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.930> bench<00:02:21.080> because<00:02:21.200> my<00:02:21.379> elbow<00:02:21.590> is

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
order the bench because my elbow is

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.130 
order the bench because my elbow is
feeling<00:02:21.830> good<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.430> 275<00:02:23.090> was<00:02:23.390> really<00:02:23.959> really

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
feeling good the 275 was really really

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.490 
feeling good the 275 was really really
fast<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.580> felt<00:02:25.940> no<00:02:26.120> pain<00:02:26.300> 275<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.379> that

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
fast and so I felt no pain 275 and that

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.680 
fast and so I felt no pain 275 and that
made<00:02:27.739> me<00:02:27.769> pretty<00:02:28.099> excited<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.519> bench<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:28.849> 295

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
made me pretty excited the bench so 295

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.009 
made me pretty excited the bench so 295
got<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:29.989> clean<00:02:30.290> pause<00:02:30.560> on<00:02:30.769> 295<00:02:31.370> went<00:02:32.269> up<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.420> 3<00:02:32.599> 15

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
got a clean pause on 295 went up to 3 15

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.070 
got a clean pause on 295 went up to 3 15
I<00:02:33.049> feel<00:02:33.410> pretty<00:02:33.650> good<00:02:33.769> about<00:02:33.830> Paul's<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.430> 315

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
I feel pretty good about Paul's on 315

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.160 
I feel pretty good about Paul's on 315
so<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.110> made<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.739> jump<00:02:36.920> up<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.220> 3<00:02:37.489> 35<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.360> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
so I made the jump up to 3 35 and the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.830 
so I made the jump up to 3 35 and the
pause<00:02:39.379> was<00:02:39.620> ok<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.099> little<00:02:40.280> bit<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.549> bounce

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
pause was ok a little bit of a bounce

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.059 
pause was ok a little bit of a bounce
but<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:41.870> made<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.140> lift<00:02:42.379> and<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.739> feel<00:02:42.890> pretty

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
but I made the lift and I feel pretty

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.890 
but I made the lift and I feel pretty
good<00:02:43.160> about<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.640> jumped<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:43.940> 345<00:02:44.510> just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
good about that so I jumped a 345 just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.620 
good about that so I jumped a 345 just
to<00:02:45.049> try<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.950> get<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.819> times<00:02:46.849> body<00:02:47.450> weight

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
to try to get this to times body weight

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.900 
to try to get this to times body weight
bench<00:02:48.049> in<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.380> bag<00:02:48.590> because<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:49.610> was<00:02:49.730> really

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
bench in the bag because I was really

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.030 
bench in the bag because I was really
close<00:02:50.060> last<00:02:50.360> month<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.470> see<00:02:51.739> on<00:02:51.920> that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
close last month but you see on that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.460 
close last month but you see on that
bench<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.610> last<00:02:52.819> two<00:02:53.630> inches<00:02:53.989> my<00:02:54.140> elbow

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
bench like the last two inches my elbow

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.750 
bench like the last two inches my elbow
just<00:02:54.620> gave<00:02:54.799> out<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.130> bar<00:02:55.340> just<00:02:55.519> dropped

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
just gave out and the bar just dropped

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.600 
just gave out and the bar just dropped
onto<00:02:55.910> my<00:02:56.060> chest<00:02:56.319> didn't<00:02:57.319> really<00:02:57.680> work<00:02:57.980> work

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
onto my chest didn't really work work

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.990 
onto my chest didn't really work work
out<00:02:58.760> too<00:02:58.940> well<00:02:58.970> for<00:02:59.209> me<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.940> going<00:03:01.940> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
out too well for me and so going to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.789 
out too well for me and so going to
continue<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.480> try<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.810> train<00:03:03.200> around<00:03:03.410> this

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
continue to try to train around this

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.339 
continue to try to train around this
elbow<00:03:04.220> pain<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:04.640> I'm<00:03:04.730> having<00:03:04.910> and<00:03:05.299> at<00:03:06.170> least

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
elbow pain that I'm having and at least

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.430 
elbow pain that I'm having and at least
try<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.739> sustain<00:03:07.129> some<00:03:07.819> of<00:03:07.970> my<00:03:08.239> my<00:03:09.019> strength

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
try to sustain some of my my strength

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.009 
try to sustain some of my my strength
that<00:03:09.590> I've<00:03:09.739> developed<00:03:09.920> in<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.670> bench<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.510> so

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
that I've developed in the bench so so

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.380 
that I've developed in the bench so so
much<00:03:12.230> out<00:03:12.379> here<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.680> mean<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.069> don't<00:03:13.760> know<00:03:13.849> how

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
much out here I mean I don't know how

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.809 
much out here I mean I don't know how
close<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.900> can<00:03:14.959> get<00:03:15.110> back<00:03:15.290> up<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.500> 365<00:03:16.190> but

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
close I can get back up to 365 but

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.460 
close I can get back up to 365 but
hopefully<00:03:17.480> I'll<00:03:17.569> be<00:03:17.600> able<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.959> get<00:03:18.139> somewhere

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
hopefully I'll be able to get somewhere

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.770 
hopefully I'll be able to get somewhere
close<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.639> competition<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.600> would<00:03:20.720> be

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
close to that in competition I would be
