nice<00:01:51.539> okay<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.950> Zoo<00:01:53.840> carry<00:01:54.840> on

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.199 

here<00:02:08.450> we<00:02:08.539> go<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:09.739> wasn't<00:02:10.099> long<00:02:10.250> any<00:02:10.910> edge

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
here we go it wasn't long any edge

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.240 
here we go it wasn't long any edge
damage

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.559 

so<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.280> bet<00:02:17.640> right<00:02:17.849> here

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.880

okay yeah good

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.479 
okay yeah good
he's<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.640> edges<00:02:28.000> very<00:02:28.030> thin<00:02:28.659> I<00:02:28.689> guess

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
he's the edges very thin I guess

00:02:29.489 --> 00:03:14.500 
he's the edges very thin I guess

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
down the length of the of the edge

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.020 
down the length of the of the edge
however<00:04:13.380> they<00:04:13.860> do<00:04:13.920> talk<00:04:14.160> about<00:04:14.220> chopping<00:04:14.760> to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
good shape so we're going to attempt

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.390 
good shape so we're going to attempt
this<00:04:55.730> same<00:04:56.570> test<00:04:56.900> on<00:04:57.080> this<00:04:57.170> pine<00:04:57.710> board<00:04:58.070> again

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
this same test on this pine board again

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:18.490 
this same test on this pine board again
here<00:05:16.480> might<00:05:17.480> have<00:05:17.600> just<00:05:17.630> been<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.870> fluke<00:05:18.140> in<00:05:18.320> the
