00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 good josÃ© carlos writes about the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.099
 following situation and has a mare of six 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.070
 For years I've shown the glue. 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.950
 when it is trotting or required in the race 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.560
 of lace he already said ended animal and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.880
 yet it still shows the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.670
 Cup 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 with the word man from the field 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.680
 sponsorship evil face and boutique boots 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.230
 sky the higher the rustic with the measure 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.609
 of the sophisticated good josÃ© carlos 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.050
 Let's do it by steps 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.510
 the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.149
 to understand is that glue is part of the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.300
 extension of the horse's body can not be 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.030
 taken in isolation in situations such as 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.850
 that bring in that the animal only 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.579
 react when it is required and if 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.129
 sign of pain of discomfort and there the people 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.219
 I could cite numerous factors like a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.640
 maladjusted cell Overweight 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.329
 lumbar pain and very often 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.949
 problems in the animal's mouth 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.809
 we take the message from joseph carlos to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 veterinarian rosalina who at the moment 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.890
 attends a case similar to his 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.290
 the complaint is that the animal of a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.750
 time for another began to react 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.150
 I show the glue shakes my head and it seems 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.460
 the suspicion that the cause of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.530
 be in the mouth in the evaluation 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 veterinarian notes that some teeth 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.409
 They are hurting the mouth and tongue. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.509
 are the so-called teeth tips like 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.460
 two to three day old 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.159
 millimeters per year 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.270
 there will be a formation of 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.490
 tooth and it will hurt the cheek will 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.340
 to form a cyrus on these animals is not 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.479
 as if it were a bigger sore only she 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.600
 does not heal 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.329
 the recommendation is to reduce the excesses 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 in this case nothing very complicated but neither 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.280
 always any excess can be withdrawn 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.610
 in a single session because the animal can 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 become very sensitive in the other 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.380
 aggravating a wolf's tooth 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.390
 he is not the same size as the others 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.950
 it is a well same format 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.340
 us and it usually occurs in the arcades 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.490
 superior 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.310
 it is a first home but it can 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.680
 also occur a year in the lower arch 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.480
 a prime less popular home cousin 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.970
 it may occur that it is immediately identified 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.160
 lower region and where such 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.400
 incidents are observed is in 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.380
 each station because they normally 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.770
 they will interfere with the commands of the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.260
 trainer odinete or is it the animal goes 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.989
 have a certain difficulty in obeying the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.570
 commands will have a reaction embouchure 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.810
 due to the presence of this new one then 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.720
 there is always a need for extraction 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.850
 of these teeth in the case of this mare 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.280
 sure but another oral problem that 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.370
 also generates a lot of pain is an abscess 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.440
 up call an inflammation at the root of the tooth 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.660
 In these cases the indication is always 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.720
 Car Extraction Suddenly 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.489
 none of these situations fit into the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.160
 Yours is good, but we do not 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.920
 can examine the animal our role 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.989
 is to bring possibilities that can 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.989
 elucidate the treatment
