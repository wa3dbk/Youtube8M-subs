a fire hazard but I thought that was a

a fire hazard but I thought that was a
really<00:01:56.549> cool<00:01:57.030> idea<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:58.680> repurpose

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
really cool idea to you know repurpose

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.639 
really cool idea to you know repurpose
something<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> big<00:02:00.540> windows<00:02:00.930> XP<00:02:01.320> box<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
something like a big windows XP box you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
TK's number for the whiskey bottle PC I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.750 
TK's number for the whiskey bottle PC I
got<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> impression<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.069> this<00:02:18.340> was<00:02:18.550> made

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
got the impression that this was made

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.870 
got the impression that this was made
from<00:02:19.000> glass<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.780> could<00:02:20.770> be<00:02:20.920> wrong<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.520> mean<00:02:21.760> if

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
from glass I could be wrong I mean if

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.270 
from glass I could be wrong I mean if
it's<00:02:22.030> not<00:02:22.090> fair<00:02:22.600> enough<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.380> wouldn't

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
it's not fair enough but I wouldn't

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.740 
it's not fair enough but I wouldn't
imagine<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.850> if<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.090> was<00:02:25.270> made<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.569> plastic

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
imagine that if it was made of plastic

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.320 
imagine that if it was made of plastic
that<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.350> would<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.740> best<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:28.209> know

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
that that would be the best you know

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.900 
that that would be the best you know
type<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:29.020> case<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:30.010> put<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.459> computer<00:02:30.760> in

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
type of case to put a computer in

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.449 
type of case to put a computer in
because<00:02:31.360> for<00:02:31.660> heat<00:02:31.780> reasons<00:02:32.170> again<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:33.370> if

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
because for heat reasons again but if

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.979 
because for heat reasons again but if
it's<00:02:33.580> made<00:02:33.790> out<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:33.940> glass<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:34.690> really

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
it's made out of glass then you really

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.750 
it's made out of glass then you really
don't<00:02:35.170> want<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.590> drop<00:02:35.950> this<00:02:36.190> things<00:02:36.520> it's
