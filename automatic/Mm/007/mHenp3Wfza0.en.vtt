 Hello everyone, Anchik Martynova 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.290
 and we will do very light and 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.389
 beautiful rainbow bracelet for his 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.000
 we will need crystal creations 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.440
 beads 8 to 6 millimeters since i 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.720
 decided to make a smoother gradient 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 I did not get the color transition seven 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.470
 colors 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.410
 and 11 and each color I took 9 beads 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.099
 pins with caps chain for the base 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.230
 lock and tool will get everything very 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.510
 simply and uniformly on pin wear 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.180
 one bead and bend it at an angle 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.190
 focus on the eye about leaving 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840
 all millimeter cell its extra 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.670
 wire 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 then take the round pliers clamp 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 end pin and start spinning it in 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.800
 back side to the end of the ear not 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.800
 closed up 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.290
 chains i take 20 centimeters 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.810
 be sure to take with a good margin for 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.990
 Help my bouquet size 17 centimeters 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.560
 but the bracelet comes out very voluminous and this 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.320
 we must consider now retreat 23 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.869
 Centimeter from the beginning of the chain start 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.170
 detach our beads on one link 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.770
 chains I cling 3 beads one on top 2 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.740
 below 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.100
 the next link I connect the opposite 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.409
 2 on top and one on bottom constantly in succession 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.960
 much depends on the size of the rings 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.539
 chains if they allow you to connect 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.929
 only two pin on the sides means you need 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.929
 do 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.200
 as i said earlier one color i 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.050
 connect 9 beads 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.190
 I fill in with 3 7 on the chain further 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.190
 take the next color 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.139
 at the end you can connect the iron 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:48.179
 ringlet can not connect anything 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.360
 depends again on the size of the links 

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:50.360
 chains 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.080
 carbine I cling to the link chain 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.659
 because how well did I get 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.590
 the chain is stronger than any rings it 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.719
 me from the store 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.090
 remember this care in general is still 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:15.069
 crystal beads but here's a chain of me 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.069
 pleased especially with advice 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.710
