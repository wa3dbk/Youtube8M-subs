00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.500
 I want to share with you a recipe 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.029
 yeast free buns 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 when our family began to question 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:16.320
 to completely abandon 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.230
 yeast baking I began to look in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.120
 Online a good recipe since it was 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.039
 intentionally in the bread oven itself but all that i 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.460
 revised this recipe dust on 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.810
 ferment they are of course wonderful but 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.819
 very laborious 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.120
 as for baking the most taught long 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:41.629
 on time so their cooking dough 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.019
 I was looking for long recipes finally found 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:49.710
 very successful very fast and most importantly 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.549
 very tasty dough is very simple for 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.850
 the test will need only 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:59.940
 kefir 1 cup or sour milk from me 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.449
 was sour milk vegetable oil in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.930
 the recipe was half a cup but by experience 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.479
 the glass is a lot of dough is obtained 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.759
 too oily and a quarter glass 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.469
 I always took enough 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.420
 olive oil but odorless and of course 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:21.740
 unrefined good oil also 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.149
 you need to add half a spoonful of salt 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.549
 half a teaspoon of soda and sugar is all 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.039
 need to mix in a cup in some sort 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.649
 so roomy and after that 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.189
 add flour the exact amount of flour i 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.009
 I can not say it needs to be added to 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.149
 an eye to get this dough 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.630
 it is quite soft while absolutely 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.450
 sticks to neither cup nor to his hands 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.369
 no need to knead very much 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.130
 such a nice dough to the touch and very 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.249
 it is convenient to use absolutely no 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.770
 does not stay there cleaning after that then 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:07.979
 eat it kneaded immediately in a cup of flour 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.070
 I added not only wheat I took 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.790
 a mixture of three types of rye flour and wheat 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.810
 and multigrain especially for bread 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.540
 it contained all the seeds of flax seed 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.870
 wonderful seed but if there is no special flour 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.269
 you can add different seeds yourself 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.790
 the same sesame can be right half a glass 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.230
 you can add bran to it 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.829
 or fiber or sunflower seeds 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.819
 Well, in general , something that will increase let's say 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:44.569
 the value of this bread of these buns 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.900
 but then you can leave of course 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.400
 pastry for thirty minutes so she 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.319
 rested so to speak before baking 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.620
 cover with a napkin but i'm honest 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.010
 saying did not I immediately divided it 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.310
 on 12 parts it turns out very much 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.680
 convenient volume of 12 buns just volume 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.169
 baking tray 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.889
 I anointed the top buns with the same sour 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:17.810
 whose milk was in the dough and on top 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:20.419
 sprinkled with sesame can continue to put 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.280
 for example in a warm oven at 50 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.349
 degrees there for a while to 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.139
 they somehow came to their senses again 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.750
 got up a little but again i'm not 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:34.190
 did and immediately put in hot 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.629
 oven 200 degrees for baking I will say 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.299
 you immediately that as soon as you put them 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.430
 bake you don't have to go far because 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.690
 buns are baked very quickly well 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.019
 literally there 20-30 minutes and they will 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.909
 ready well though of course depends on 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.479
 the oven which you use because 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.459
 what do you know how every hostess 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:02.000
 knows that every oven has its own 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.169
 features and there somewhere you need to add 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.459
 there to subtract what is interpreted here is the top 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.040
 baked bottom not baked well in 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.889
 In general, you need to consider these 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.509
 features but keep in mind 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.919
 but pretty quickly that's all 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:21.370
 and you will soon smell 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.280
 freshly baked bread in your kitchen 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.370
 check 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.150
 you can in the usual way readiness 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.000
 to pierce 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:35.160
 match skin does not seem to crust match 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.340
 and see if it stays wet 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.430
 dough for matches if the match is dry 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:47.520
 that buns are ready can you get them and 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.510
 treat your home so fragrant 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.120
 fresh baked 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.430
 The products are really very convenient. 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.950
 tried to make them look like a bar 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.400
 This to cut but in the form of fingers 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.340
 it is much more convenient but we do not eat 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.030
 such volume at one time they are very good 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.610
 in fresh form and then what 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.180
 It remains I usually cut into small 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.120
 cubes and dried as crackers and then 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.800
 they are already therefore as needed 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:25.020
 like that yes and are given between the cases of croutons 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.169
 then life is good, you can even 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.290
 there some sprinkle with spices well 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:35.430
 Here's a recipe for luck in terms of what 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:38.070
 always it turns out all of course they are different 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:42.510
 barrels are obtained because the composition of the flour 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.140
 always different here and here as 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.600
 overall always looks new somehow 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.600
 well, that's probably all 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:55.020

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.479
