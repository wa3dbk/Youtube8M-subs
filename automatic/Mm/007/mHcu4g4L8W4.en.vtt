00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.820
 i'm michael cook trumpeter and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.740
 instrumental teacher and i want them 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.060
 here the newly developed and the patent 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 imagine registered flexible piece 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.730
 open sound height flexibility are 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 all things in which a brass player 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.320
 to celebrate every day has one in addition 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.559
 relaxed breathing, this is one too 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 thing of the right use the flexi 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.489
 Pass mouthpiece speeds up the process 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.190
 for a correct use 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.210
 and that is how the flexi lock stands 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.219
 is divided into two parts 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 through a flexible middle piece 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 connected why most of us 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 Above all, sheet metal becomes natural 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 Trumpeters fight as the problem too 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.199
 a lot of pressure on the lips 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.639
 in particular to the upper and 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.639
 this is where flexibility comes into play 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.869
 because by the split it is almost 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.969
 impossible upper and lower lip unequal 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.200
 is allowed to play the pressure 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.719
 top or bottom 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240
 the desire moves the pillows strongly 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.130
 away from this job and the less 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 burden details for being forced 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.030
 to become more active in most 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 as well as me offers 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 the wish with the boiler 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.820
 increasing thurnheer after this 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
 point is the practice as far as 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.780
 possible postpone 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.549
 for the weaker as in my case the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.500
 muscles of the lower part too 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.750
 work out 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.060
 because for a good approach should the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.399
 upper lip should be as little as possible 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.740
 to swing as free as possible 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.320
 can 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.659
 the great thing about this flexible is that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.509
 Mouthpiece can feel which one 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.899
 partie too much burdened and which 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.729
 too little is what many great 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890
 explanation of us music emptying 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.600
 superfluous makes important to me 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.329
 however, to point out that 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.220
 flexible not in proven methodical 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.869
 content intervenes but only 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.299
 should support 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.219
 princes and applications are simple and 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.560
 success with regular use 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.129
 guaranteed 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.129
 they have become curious
