lightning<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.460> northwestern<00:00:36.180> during<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
lightning you know northwestern during a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.810 
lightning you know northwestern during a
50-yard<00:00:37.320> indoor<00:00:37.710> i<00:00:37.950> think<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:38.640> have

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
50-yard indoor i think is what they have

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
50-yard indoor i think is what they have
right<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.540> whether<00:00:40.410> they<00:00:40.590> got<00:00:40.710> bad

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
right now so whether they got bad

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.080 
right now so whether they got bad
weather<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.280> not<00:00:41.430> they<00:00:41.640> were<00:00:41.700> able<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
weather or not they were able to get to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.700 
weather or not they were able to get to
practice<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:42.690> i<00:00:42.719> thought<00:00:42.930> our<00:00:43.200> coaches

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
practice it but i thought our coaches

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.670 
practice it but i thought our coaches
and<00:00:43.739> our<00:00:43.890> players<00:00:44.219> did<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.700> good<00:00:44.850> job<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
and our players did a really good job of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
and our players did a really good job of
maximizing<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.399> situation<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.180> did

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
maximizing the situation that we did

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
maximizing the situation that we did
have<00:00:48.390> take<00:00:48.960> advantage<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.710> making<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
have take advantage of it and making the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
have take advantage of it and making the
best<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.579> probably<00:00:51.480> sitting<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.230> not

first<00:05:00.410> game<00:05:00.530> our<00:05:00.980> philosophy<00:05:01.340> around<00:05:01.820> here<00:05:02.150> is

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
first game our philosophy around here is

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.360 
first game our philosophy around here is
special<00:05:02.660> teams<00:05:02.870> is<00:05:03.140> number<00:05:03.710> one<00:05:03.920> so<00:05:04.190> if<00:05:04.250> you

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
special teams is number one so if you

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.640 
special teams is number one so if you
get<00:05:04.490> fatigued<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.480> come<00:05:05.720> off<00:05:05.900> on<00:05:06.110> offense<00:05:06.530> and

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
get fatigued you come off on offense and

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.410 
get fatigued you come off on offense and
defense<00:05:07.010> you<00:05:07.100> don't<00:05:07.250> come<00:05:07.370> on<00:05:07.490> off<00:05:07.940> on<00:05:07.970> defense

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
defense you don't come on off on defense

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.810 
defense you don't come on off on defense
we<00:05:09.140> fence<00:05:09.440> what<00:05:09.680> we<00:05:09.800> call<00:05:09.980> special<00:05:10.280> teams<00:05:10.640> is

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820

an<00:05:36.800> emphasis<00:05:37.250> this<00:05:37.610> week<00:05:37.820> if<00:05:37.940> I'm<00:05:38.210> points<00:05:38.630> off

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
an emphasis this week if I'm points off

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.010 
an emphasis this week if I'm points off
turnovers<00:05:39.250> sir<00:05:40.250> points<00:05:40.970> off<00:05:41.060> turnovers<00:05:41.240> maybe

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
turnovers sir points off turnovers maybe

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.360

the<00:05:42.140> two<00:05:42.290> turnovers<00:05:42.500> last<00:05:42.860> week<00:05:43.070> they<00:05:43.220> need

the two turnovers last week they need

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.860 
the two turnovers last week they need
anything<00:05:43.670> offered<00:05:43.820> at<00:05:44.030> how<00:05:44.120> much<00:05:44.270> an<00:05:44.390> emphasis

anything offered at how much an emphasis
more<00:05:45.470> emphasis<00:05:45.890> I<00:05:46.010> guess<00:05:46.160> is<00:05:46.340> they're<00:05:46.550> just

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
more emphasis I guess is they're just

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.260 
more emphasis I guess is they're just
because<00:05:47.360> we<00:05:47.720> don't<00:05:47.840> really<00:05:48.170> we<00:05:48.920> never<00:05:49.730> really

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
because we don't really we never really

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.060 
because we don't really we never really
put<00:05:51.140> more<00:05:51.500> emphasis<00:05:52.250> on<00:05:52.460> something<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:54.680> week

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
put more emphasis on something the week

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.250 
put more emphasis on something the week
after<00:05:55.340> we<00:05:55.820> don't<00:05:56.030> have<00:05:56.180> success<00:05:56.630> at<00:05:56.840> something

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
has to do with the fact that maybe some

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.360 
has to do with the fact that maybe some
of<00:06:56.480> them<00:06:56.660> didn't<00:06:56.900> play<00:06:57.050> last<00:06:57.260> week<00:06:57.500> and<00:06:57.860> it's

of them didn't play last week and it's
amazing<00:06:58.640> how<00:06:59.000> that<00:06:59.060> will<00:06:59.450> motivate<00:06:59.660> people<00:07:00.140> to

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
amazing how that will motivate people to

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.030 
amazing how that will motivate people to
practice<00:07:01.010> harder<00:07:01.640> and<00:07:01.790> better<00:07:02.169> so<00:07:03.169> I<00:07:03.470> feel
