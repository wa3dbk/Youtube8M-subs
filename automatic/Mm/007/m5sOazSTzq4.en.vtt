00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.320 

there's<00:00:05.689> my<00:00:05.870> hanging<00:00:06.200> guns<00:00:06.410> I've<00:00:06.769> just<00:00:07.330> just

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
there's my hanging guns I've just just

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.060 
there's my hanging guns I've just just
watered<00:00:08.719> them<00:00:08.870> in<00:00:09.050> the<00:00:09.170> top<00:00:09.440> there<00:00:09.710> in<00:00:09.860> there

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
watered them in the top there in there

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.259 
watered them in the top there in there
in<00:00:10.280> the<00:00:10.969> feeders<00:00:11.420> and<00:00:12.610> takes<00:00:13.610> about<00:00:13.760> two

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
in the feeders and takes about two

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.359 
in the feeders and takes about two
minutes<00:00:14.870> for<00:00:15.500> it<00:00:15.620> to<00:00:15.920> soak<00:00:16.730> all<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.210> way<00:00:17.330> down

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
minutes for it to soak all the way down

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.300 
minutes for it to soak all the way down
and<00:00:19.960> basically<00:00:20.960> how<00:00:21.349> I<00:00:21.380> measure<00:00:22.689> how<00:00:23.689> much

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
and basically how I measure how much

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.370 
and basically how I measure how much
feed<00:00:25.310> to<00:00:25.489> give<00:00:25.669> them<00:00:25.819> is<00:00:26.029> just<00:00:26.239> you<00:00:27.079> know<00:00:27.109> you

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
feed to give them is just you know you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.550 
feed to give them is just you know you
can<00:00:27.589> tell<00:00:27.800> how<00:00:28.039> dry<00:00:28.669> the<00:00:28.960> growing<00:00:29.960> medium<00:00:30.380> is

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
can tell how dry the growing medium is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.830 
can tell how dry the growing medium is
you<00:00:31.489> don't<00:00:31.699> want<00:00:31.819> to<00:00:31.880> soak<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:32.329> every<00:00:32.630> day

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
you don't want to soak it every day

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.910 
you don't want to soak it every day
obviously<00:00:33.829> as<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.430> warmer<00:00:35.239> weather<00:00:35.420> comes

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
obviously as the warmer weather comes

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.840 
obviously as the warmer weather comes
they're<00:00:36.920> going<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.190> need<00:00:37.340> a<00:00:37.370> lot<00:00:37.640> more<00:00:37.670> than

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
they're going to need a lot more than

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.910 
they're going to need a lot more than
they<00:00:38.090> do<00:00:38.240> in<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:38.450> winter<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.110> there's<00:00:39.860> a

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
they do in the winter and there's a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.440 
they do in the winter and there's a
collection<00:00:40.340> bottles<00:00:40.670> at<00:00:40.880> the<00:00:40.970> bottom<00:00:41.240> there

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
collection bottles at the bottom there

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.210 
collection bottles at the bottom there
you<00:00:41.930> can<00:00:42.080> see<00:00:42.440> there's<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:42.680> bit<00:00:42.800> of<00:00:42.890> algae

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
you can see there's a bit of algae

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.350 
you can see there's a bit of algae
growing<00:00:43.460> in<00:00:43.700> them<00:00:43.850> because<00:00:44.150> obviously

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
growing in them because obviously

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.480 
growing in them because obviously
they're<00:00:44.690> hanging<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.080> the<00:00:45.200> light<00:00:45.380> so<00:00:45.830> they

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
they're hanging in the light so they

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.840 
they're hanging in the light so they
will<00:00:46.700> pick<00:00:46.940> up<00:00:47.120> that<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:49.040> algae<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:49.790> the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
will pick up that that algae in the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.240 
will pick up that that algae in the
bottle<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.870> think<00:00:51.290> in<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.440> painting<00:00:51.950> in<00:00:52.100> the

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
bottle I think in a painting in the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.600 
bottle I think in a painting in the
bottom<00:00:52.960> bottles<00:00:53.960> green<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:54.950> they<00:00:55.100> just<00:00:55.370> look<00:00:55.520> a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
bottom bottles green so they just look a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.280 
bottom bottles green so they just look a
little<00:00:55.760> bit<00:00:55.910> nicer<00:00:56.060> you<00:00:56.450> don't<00:00:56.630> see<00:00:56.810> the<00:00:56.930> algae

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
little bit nicer you don't see the algae

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.220 
little bit nicer you don't see the algae
then<00:00:57.820> this<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:58.970> my<00:00:59.120> new<00:00:59.300> one<00:00:59.510> not<00:00:59.690> just<00:00:59.750> home

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
then this is my new one not just home

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.319 
then this is my new one not just home
and<00:01:00.530> this<00:01:01.310> one's<00:01:01.550> going<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.700> be<00:01:01.820> different<00:01:02.210> to

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
and this one's going to be different to

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.660 
and this one's going to be different to
all<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.450> others<00:01:02.989> because<00:01:03.200> I've<00:01:04.100> decided<00:01:04.460> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
all the others because I've decided to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.809 
all the others because I've decided to
do<00:01:04.939> a<00:01:05.689> whole<00:01:06.650> either<00:01:07.520> side<00:01:09.189> the<00:01:10.189> reason<00:01:10.369> for

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
do a whole either side the reason for

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:12.550 
do a whole either side the reason for
that<00:01:10.880> as<00:01:11.719> you<00:01:11.840> can<00:01:11.990> see<00:01:12.109> these<00:01:12.319> are<00:01:12.469> all

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
that as you can see these are all

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.200 
that as you can see these are all
growing<00:01:12.799> very<00:01:13.009> successful<00:01:13.670> but<00:01:13.759> if<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:13.969> look

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
growing very successful but if you look

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.179 
growing very successful but if you look
at<00:01:14.359> this<00:01:14.479> lettuce<00:01:14.929> here<00:01:15.460> is<00:01:17.200> bunched<00:01:18.200> out<00:01:18.409> so

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
at this lettuce here is bunched out so

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.950 
at this lettuce here is bunched out so
humongously<00:01:19.969> all<00:01:20.719> the<00:01:21.259> way<00:01:21.380> down<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.929> so<00:01:23.929> I

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
humongously all the way down and so I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.849 
humongously all the way down and so I
figured<00:01:24.289> if<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:25.659> cut<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.780> hole<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.319> back

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
figured if I cut the hole in the back

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.169 
figured if I cut the hole in the back
I<00:01:27.889> can<00:01:28.219> spread<00:01:29.020> half<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.319> growth<00:01:30.679> on<00:01:31.179> each

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
I can spread half of that growth on each

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:34.120 
I can spread half of that growth on each
side<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.719> the<00:01:32.840> bottle<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.439> just<00:01:33.709> might<00:01:33.889> make<00:01:34.069> it

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
side of the bottle it just might make it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.580 
side of the bottle it just might make it
more<00:01:34.399> balanced<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.060> give<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.229> bit<00:01:36.409> more

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
more balanced and give it a bit more

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.249 
more balanced and give it a bit more
production<00:01:37.130> than<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.429> is<00:01:37.549> right<00:01:37.759> now<00:01:37.990> but<00:01:38.990> um

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
production than it is right now but um

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.330 
production than it is right now but um
yeah<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.340> there<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.639> is<00:01:40.670> there's<00:01:41.090> my<00:01:41.979> my<00:01:42.979> six

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
yeah so there it is there's my my six

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.539 
yeah so there it is there's my my six
rows<00:01:43.639> of<00:01:44.139> Hanging<00:01:45.139> Gardens<00:01:45.170> plant<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:46.159> over

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
rows of Hanging Gardens plant it over

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.289 
rows of Hanging Gardens plant it over
out<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.909> last<00:01:47.090> five<00:01:47.689> or<00:01:47.899> six<00:01:48.079> weeks<00:01:49.299> newest

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
out the last five or six weeks newest
