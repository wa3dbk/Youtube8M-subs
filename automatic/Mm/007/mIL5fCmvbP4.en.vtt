00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.520
 The Netherlands does have an inflammation but what should you do if that inflammation 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.579
 keeps coming back 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.929
 I myself am a sinking log in to the animal medical center in 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.159
 Amsterdam 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.590
 throw on our eyes but also on our angie bulls of dogs 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.679
 we see many countries with the largest inflammation 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.650
 I want to show you but the ignition comes from 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.349
 and what to do about it 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.669
 with inflammation the skin of the ear canal is inflamed 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.309
 the ear canal is actually no more or less than a buzzard that is covered 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.030
 with skin up to the eardrum 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.220
 if the skin of the ear canal becomes inflamed, it will go swimming 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.079
 where is it getting closer and closer until he finally does not sit in anyone 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.750
 and course more that the unions occupy that can no longer go out all in all 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.870
 origin of cancer great breeding ground for all kinds of bacteria 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.030
 fermentation and making the inflammation worse 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.350
 so you get the vicious circle 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.380
 most they always mandela only the bacteria and sometimes the ghosts 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.960
 then it usually goes a little better but the igniter comes back when you 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.090
 nothing to the press 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.400
 so if you want the problem to be top then you have to look for the real cause 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920
 of the ear infection 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 what can cause the asser inflammation 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.860
 To start with, some countries are much more sensitive to others 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.460
 for example, because they make excessive amounts of moor lake 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.000
 such as the lower dollar 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.330
 or because they play their role in the suitcases by e-mail 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.700
 there are also dogs that have very nasty consequences of their own 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.050
 for example a sharpei 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.549
 and of course there are monde just going to have it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.110
 like the poles 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.969
 but also among whom a lot of swimming 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.140
 for that reason have over zealous owner who cleans the ears too much 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 they are much more sensitive to ear infections than others 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.710
 but that is not enough to get an eye infection 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.979
 for that there must be more going on for that, the skin must be borre 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.090
 become inflamed, for example, by a foreign object and not in it at home 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.300
 hears like a parasite 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.760
 or maybe grass matters or in some cases a tumor but in the vast majority 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.500
 skin from the ear canal became stalker due to an allergy 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.969
 that can be a food allergy or don't go that is an allergy 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.960
 environment you recognize these complaints 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.869
 then go to a vet 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.819
 in the whole outstanding look in the first place to see if there is something in it 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.269
 does not belong in it 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.730
 he can take a material decrease to see which bacteria and spirit are in it and 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.340
 I could possibly do bacteria, but the most important thing is that 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.659
 Mr. H also causing the victim to underlying cause 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.759
 and that means in most cases allergy examination with a dietician 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.179
 with a skin test 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.179
 or with a blood test can try to figure it out 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.999
 for which the man is exactly about sensitive 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.320
 bulb region this is not nice for union he is in pain 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.439
 he is often depressed by youth and young people 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.919
 fortunately it is not necessary for the global union to hope with this inflammation 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.729
 but we can do something about it 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.389
 these you recognize these complaints go to the vet
