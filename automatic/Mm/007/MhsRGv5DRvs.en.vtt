00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this for like a month then I had it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.400 
this for like a month then I had it
through<00:00:29.910> freshman<00:00:30.449> year<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.630> college<00:00:32.059> then<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
through freshman year at college then I

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
through freshman year at college then I
gave<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.559> Shawn<00:00:34.920> over<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> summer<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
gave it to Shawn over the summer and I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.950 
gave it to Shawn over the summer and I
bought<00:00:37.200> back<00:00:37.410> from<00:00:37.620> him<00:00:37.770> recently<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.960> what

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
bought back from him recently so what

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.569 
bought back from him recently so what
this<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.860> replace<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.399> mac

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
this is going to do is replace the mac

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.810 
this is going to do is replace the mac
mini<00:00:41.610> as<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> linux<00:00:42.960> server<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:43.820> frankly

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
mini as a linux server because frankly

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.209 
mini as a linux server because frankly
the<00:00:45.000> mat<00:00:45.149> committee<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.600> nice<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.500> want<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the mat committee is nice but I want to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.619 
the mat committee is nice but I want to
be<00:00:47.309> able<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.579> use<00:00:47.700> more<00:00:47.969> than<00:00:48.000> two<00:00:48.120> gigabytes

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
be able to use more than two gigabytes

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.240 
be able to use more than two gigabytes
of<00:00:48.719> RAM<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.379> mac<00:00:49.500> mini<00:00:49.530> doesn't<00:00:50.070> allow

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of RAM and the mac mini doesn't allow

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.240 
of RAM and the mac mini doesn't allow
that<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.969> 32-bit<00:00:51.710> processor<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that because it's a 32-bit processor and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.360 
that because it's a 32-bit processor and
that's<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.449> designed<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
that's just the way it was designed so

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.560 
that's just the way it was designed so
essentially<00:00:56.370> essentially<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.120> Shawn<00:00:57.360> did

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
essentially essentially what Shawn did

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.760 
essentially essentially what Shawn did
when<00:00:57.750> he<00:00:57.780> had<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.469> he<00:00:58.620> upgraded

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
when he had this thing was he upgraded

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.180 
when he had this thing was he upgraded
he<00:00:59.250> changed<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> board<00:01:00.120> from<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> atom

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
he changed at the board from the atom

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.529 
he changed at the board from the atom
330<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> dual-core<00:01:03.030> hyperthreaded

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
330 which was a dual-core hyperthreaded

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.859 
330 which was a dual-core hyperthreaded
processor<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.860> board<00:01:05.189> itself<00:01:05.580> since<00:01:06.390> since

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
processor that board itself since since

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570 
processor that board itself since since
these<00:01:07.049> Adam<00:01:07.350> processes<00:01:07.830> aren't<00:01:08.010> socketed<00:01:08.490> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
these Adam processes aren't socketed you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.390 
these Adam processes aren't socketed you
have<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.920> he<00:01:10.920> changed<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
have to do it that way and he changed it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
have to do it that way and he changed it
to<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.880> board<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.420> an<00:01:12.630> atom<00:01:12.869> d510<00:01:13.560> knit<00:01:13.799> which

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
to a board with an atom d510 knit which

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.410 
to a board with an atom d510 knit which
is<00:01:14.100> dual<00:01:14.280> core<00:01:14.490> hyperthreaded<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.180> very

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
is dual core hyperthreaded it's very

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.880 
is dual core hyperthreaded it's very
similar<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.920> what's<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:18.229> that<00:01:19.229> server<00:01:19.590> over

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
similar to what's in that server over

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.249 
similar to what's in that server over
there<00:01:20.119> except<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.750> guess<00:01:22.110> it's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
there except that this is I guess it's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.749 
there except that this is I guess it's
the<00:01:22.290> previous<00:01:22.619> generation<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> 500

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the previous generation of the 500

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.120 
the previous generation of the 500
series<00:01:24.150> processors<00:01:26.479> point<00:01:27.829> now<00:01:28.829> what<00:01:29.009> i've

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
series processors point now what i've

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.440 
series processors point now what i've
done<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.549> i<00:01:30.150> opened<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:31.610> he<00:01:32.610> left<00:01:33.090> two<00:01:33.240> gigs

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
done is i opened it up he left two gigs

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.850 
done is i opened it up he left two gigs
of<00:01:33.540> ram<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.110> me<00:01:34.229> Thank<00:01:34.590> You<00:01:34.650> Shawn

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
of ram in here for me Thank You Shawn

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.960 
of ram in here for me Thank You Shawn
and<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:36.530> took<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.860> other<00:01:37.979> one<00:01:38.100> gig<00:01:38.430> stick<00:01:38.670> i<00:01:38.790> had

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and I took the other one gig stick i had

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.249 
and I took the other one gig stick i had
and<00:01:39.150> stuck<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.960> thing<00:01:40.140> will

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and stuck it in here so this thing will

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.590 
and stuck it in here so this thing will
have<00:01:40.380> three<00:01:40.590> gigs<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.950> ram<00:01:41.390> eventually<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
have three gigs of ram eventually on a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
have three gigs of ram eventually on a
four<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.130> have

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
four but for now it's just going to have

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
four but for now it's just going to have
three<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.290> there<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:47.899> this<00:01:48.899> thing

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
three so there you have it this thing

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.069 
three so there you have it this thing

this little fsp group thing just thought

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.920 
this little fsp group thing just thought
I'd<00:02:48.820> give<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.270> look<00:02:49.360> at<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.570> power<00:02:49.780> supply

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
I'd give you a look at the power supply

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.650 
I'd give you a look at the power supply
itself<00:02:50.850> it's<00:02:51.850> pretty<00:02:52.060> little<00:02:52.330> built<00:02:52.480> for

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
was a pile of crap whenever I turn the

was a pile of crap whenever I turn the
computer<00:03:13.840> on<00:03:13.989> we<00:03:14.110> go<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:15.370> was<00:03:15.520> because<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.760> this

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
computer on we go it was because of this

computer on we go it was because of this
little<00:03:16.209> fan<00:03:16.360> here<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.380> as<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:17.800> I've

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
little fan here so as you can see I've

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.420 
little fan here so as you can see I've
cut<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.220> out<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:19.540> fan<00:03:19.780> was<00:03:19.959> made<00:03:20.170> by<00:03:20.430> yate

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
cut it out this fan was made by yate

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.280 
cut it out this fan was made by yate
loon<00:03:21.959> electronics<00:03:22.959> presumably<00:03:23.830> China<00:03:25.020> so<00:03:26.020> I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
loon electronics presumably China so I

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.490 
loon electronics presumably China so I
stuck<00:03:26.620> an<00:03:26.770> old<00:03:26.890> cooler<00:03:27.100> master<00:03:27.489> fan<00:03:27.700> in<00:03:28.120> here

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
stuck an old cooler master fan in here

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.690 
stuck an old cooler master fan in here
and<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.590> didn't<00:03:29.800> feel<00:03:29.920> like<00:03:29.980> really<00:03:30.340> soldering

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
and I didn't feel like really soldering

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.870 
and I didn't feel like really soldering
so<00:03:31.030> what<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.209> did<00:03:31.330> is<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.750> literally<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:33.190> cut<00:03:33.730> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
so what I did is I literally I cut the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.300 
so what I did is I literally I cut the
wires<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.510> cut<00:03:35.140> that<00:03:35.170> fan<00:03:35.530> out<00:03:35.709> with<00:03:36.190> these

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
wires I cut that fan out with these

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.170 
wires I cut that fan out with these
wires<00:03:36.550> still<00:03:36.820> here<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:38.670> then<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.790> strip<00:03:40.060> the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
wires still here I then I strip the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.479 
wires still here I then I strip the
wires<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.420> little<00:03:40.600> bit<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.840> expose<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.489> actual

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
wires a little bit to expose the actual

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.760 
wires a little bit to expose the actual
you<00:03:42.730> know<00:03:42.850> copper<00:03:43.780> wire<00:03:43.959> or<00:03:44.230> whatever<00:03:44.650> the

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
you know copper wire or whatever the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.220 
you know copper wire or whatever the
hell<00:03:44.860> type<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.370> wire<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.690> twisted

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
hell type of wire it is and I twisted

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.229 
hell type of wire it is and I twisted
and<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.650> did<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:47.830> same<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.400> cooler<00:03:48.910> master

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
and I did the same to the cooler master

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.990 
and I did the same to the cooler master
fan<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:49.450> cut<00:03:49.810> off<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.290> molex<00:03:51.280> part<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.820> I

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
fan I cut off the molex part of it I

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.820 
fan I cut off the molex part of it I
used<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.660> molex<00:03:52.930> fan<00:03:53.140> because<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.530> has<00:03:53.620> two

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
used a molex fan because it has two

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.590 
used a molex fan because it has two
connectors<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.459> that's<00:03:54.580> what<00:03:54.790> in<00:03:55.180> most<00:03:55.360> power

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
connectors and that's what in most power

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.530 
connectors and that's what in most power
supply<00:03:55.900> fans<00:03:56.550> so<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:57.580> twist<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.180> literally<00:03:58.420> just

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
supply fans so I twist I literally just

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.259 
supply fans so I twist I literally just
twisted<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.050> wires<00:03:59.230> together<00:03:59.850> at<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.239> right

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
twisted the wires together at the right

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.410 
twisted the wires together at the right
negative<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.200> positive<00:04:02.290> contacts<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.420> took

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
negative and positive contacts and took

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.670 
negative and positive contacts and took
some<00:04:04.720> heat<00:04:05.320> shrink<00:04:05.650> tubing<00:04:07.440> put<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.530> around

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
some heat shrink tubing put it around

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.280 
some heat shrink tubing put it around
where<00:04:09.519> they<00:04:09.700> are<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.180> took<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.690> barbecue

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
where they are and took a barbecue

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.479 
where they are and took a barbecue
lighter<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:14.380> know<00:04:14.470> heat<00:04:15.040> shrunk<00:04:15.340> the

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
lighter and you know heat shrunk the

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.759 
lighter and you know heat shrunk the
tubes

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
tubes

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.819 
tubes
so<00:04:17.769> there<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.129> have<00:04:18.219> it<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.900> that's<00:04:20.079> an<00:04:20.439> easy

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
so there you have it and that's an easy

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.730 
so there you have it and that's an easy
way<00:04:21.009> to<00:04:21.039> stick<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.340> new<00:04:21.459> fan<00:04:21.669> in<00:04:21.819> here<00:04:22.740> without

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
way to stick a new fan in here without

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.399 
way to stick a new fan in here without
having<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.340> resolder<00:04:24.699> the<00:04:24.969> board<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:26.110> there

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
having to resolder the board so there

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.649 
having to resolder the board so there
you<00:04:26.439> have<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.939> hopefully<00:04:27.939> this<00:04:28.090> will<00:04:28.240> work<00:04:28.389> I

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
you have it hopefully this will work I

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.249 
you have it hopefully this will work I
think<00:04:29.229> it<00:04:29.319> will<00:04:29.439> but<00:04:29.800> we'll<00:04:30.189> find<00:04:30.400> out<00:04:31.259> all

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
think it will but we'll find out all

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.040 
think it will but we'll find out all
right<00:04:32.469> so<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:32.830> ended<00:04:33.099> up<00:04:33.189> playing<00:04:33.400> around<00:04:33.610> that

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
right so I ended up playing around that

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.920 
right so I ended up playing around that
net<00:04:35.050> top<00:04:35.259> I've<00:04:35.860> got<00:04:36.669> Debbie<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.599> installing

about<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.110> ram<00:05:20.259> as<00:05:20.409> much<00:05:23.069> so<00:05:24.069> essentially

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
about the ram as much so essentially

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.200 
about the ram as much so essentially
what<00:05:25.509> we've<00:05:25.690> got<00:05:25.900> here<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.759> another<00:05:27.759> debian

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
what we've got here is another debian

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.170 
what we've got here is another debian
box<00:05:28.419> it's<00:05:28.779> very<00:05:28.990> similar<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.469> this<00:05:29.710> one<00:05:29.919> to<00:05:30.879> the

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
box it's very similar to this one to the

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.980 
box it's very similar to this one to the
silver<00:05:31.990> one<00:05:32.610> but<00:05:33.610> it's<00:05:34.120> more<00:05:34.270> compact<00:05:34.629> I<00:05:34.839> can

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
silver one but it's more compact I can

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.809 
silver one but it's more compact I can
put<00:05:35.110> my<00:05:35.139> router<00:05:35.409> on<00:05:35.589> top<00:05:35.770> of<00:05:35.949> that<00:05:36.069> and<00:05:36.669> it<00:05:36.729> will

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
put my router on top of that and it will

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.550 
put my router on top of that and it will
work<00:05:37.029> fine<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:39.779> I'll<00:05:40.779> take<00:05:40.930> a<00:05:41.020> debian<00:05:41.349> up<00:05:41.409> and

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
work fine and I'll take a debian up and

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.119 
work fine and I'll take a debian up and
running<00:05:41.740> it'll<00:05:41.860> be<00:05:42.009> running<00:05:42.599> probably<00:05:44.129> 22

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
completed and here I have it sit my

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.800 
completed and here I have it sit my
router<00:06:52.770> sitting<00:06:53.100> on<00:06:53.190> top<00:06:53.370> of<00:06:53.400> it<00:06:53.610> now<00:06:54.510> there's

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
router sitting on top of it now there's

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.930 
router sitting on top of it now there's
a<00:06:54.900> speaker<00:06:55.140> right<00:06:55.440> here<00:06:55.470> and<00:06:55.890> this<00:06:56.700> has<00:06:56.910> a

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
a speaker right here and this has a

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.760 
a speaker right here and this has a
magnet<00:06:57.330> in<00:06:57.420> it<00:06:57.450> so<00:06:57.810> I<00:06:57.840> pointed<00:06:58.290> the<00:06:58.350> hard<00:06:58.530> drive

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
magnet in it so I pointed the hard drive

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.290 
magnet in it so I pointed the hard drive
the<00:06:58.980> hard<00:06:59.160> drive<00:06:59.310> sits<00:06:59.520> right<00:06:59.670> there<00:06:59.730> so<00:07:00.150> it's

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
the hard drive sits right there so it's

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.590 
the hard drive sits right there so it's
not<00:07:00.420> very<00:07:00.570> close<00:07:00.840> to<00:07:00.990> the<00:07:01.110> speaker<00:07:02.150> so<00:07:03.150> this<00:07:03.480> is

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
not very close to the speaker so this is

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.710 
not very close to the speaker so this is
why<00:07:03.720> I<00:07:03.750> have<00:07:03.990> this<00:07:04.200> thing<00:07:04.380> facing<00:07:04.830> that<00:07:05.010> way

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
why I have this thing facing that way

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.840 
why I have this thing facing that way
but<00:07:06.720> of<00:07:06.780> course<00:07:07.670> it's<00:07:08.670> still<00:07:09.000> a<00:07:09.030> computer<00:07:09.600> so<00:07:10.350> I

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 
be pretty productive and yeah so now

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.830 
be pretty productive and yeah so now
that<00:07:45.330> he's<00:07:45.660> complete<00:07:46.110> I<00:07:47.450> guess<00:07:48.450> that's<00:07:48.600> it<00:07:48.780> for

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 
that he's complete I guess that's it for

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:55.070 
that he's complete I guess that's it for
now<00:07:49.140> I<00:07:49.169> mean<00:07:52.820> yeah<00:07:53.820> there's<00:07:54.570> not<00:07:54.690> much<00:07:54.810> else<00:07:54.990> to

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 
now I mean yeah there's not much else to

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.720 
now I mean yeah there's not much else to
say<00:07:55.140> I<00:07:55.320> guess<00:07:55.470> until<00:07:55.860> a<00:07:55.919> different<00:07:56.190> video<00:07:56.310> so

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:56.730 
say I guess until a different video so

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.560 
say I guess until a different video so
have<00:07:57.390> a<00:07:57.450> good<00:07:57.570> one<00:07:57.630> everybody<00:07:57.960> Joe
