00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
I'm all alone and I'm just gonna have

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750

to just really see everything in a
positive<00:01:02.550> way<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> think<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.439> of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
positive way I think that a lot of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
positive way I think that a lot of
sports<00:01:04.890> psychologists<00:01:05.610> really<00:01:07.490> emphasize

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
sports psychologists really emphasize

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.580 
sports psychologists really emphasize
that<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.000> need<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.390> visualize<00:01:09.510> these<00:01:10.290> things

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that you need to visualize these things

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.530 
that you need to visualize these things

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
before you go into a very high-stress

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
before you go into a very high-stress
situation<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.409> course<00:01:13.710> there's<00:01:13.979> always<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
situation of course there's always the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
situation of course there's always the
preparation<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.869> need<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> do

they're looking at what the composer

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
wrote on the page those are all really

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.800 
wrote on the page those are all really
important<00:03:53.550> things<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.940> pay<00:03:53.970> attention<00:03:54.480> to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
important things to pay attention to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.640 
important things to pay attention to
because<00:03:55.080> so<00:03:55.769> often<00:03:55.980> people<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:56.940> play

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
because so often people just play

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.070 
because so often people just play
something<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.130> monotone<00:03:59.730> and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
something and it's just monotone and

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.030 
something and it's just monotone and
again<00:04:01.080> that's<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.470> idea<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.860> phrase

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
again that's the idea of the phrase

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.430 
again that's the idea of the phrase
mapping<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.700> really<00:04:03.180> practice<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
mapping is to really practice the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.380 
mapping is to really practice the
dynamics<00:04:05.010> practice<00:04:05.760> your<00:04:06.120> inflections<00:04:06.750> and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
dynamics practice your inflections and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.260 
dynamics practice your inflections and
practice<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:07.810> phrasing<00:04:08.500> quality<00:04:09.069> I<00:04:09.270> think

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
practice that phrasing quality I think

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.940 
practice that phrasing quality I think
somebody<00:04:10.630> who<00:04:10.810> comes<00:04:10.960> in<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.500> really

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
somebody who comes in and is really

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.130 
somebody who comes in and is really
nervous<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.090> walks<00:04:13.450> in<00:04:13.690> I'm<00:04:13.900> always

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
nervous and and walks in I'm always

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.410 
nervous and and walks in I'm always
rooting<00:04:14.530> for<00:04:14.890> them<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.459> that's<00:04:16.180> another

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
rooting for them and that's another

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.840 
rooting for them and that's another
thing<00:04:16.540> to<00:04:16.840> keep<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.079> mind<00:04:17.350> is<00:04:17.739> you<00:04:18.609> know<00:04:18.700> people

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
thing to keep in mind is you know people

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.190 
thing to keep in mind is you know people
say<00:04:19.180> don't<00:04:19.570> be<00:04:19.690> nervous

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
say don't be nervous

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.990 
say don't be nervous
think<00:04:20.410> of<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:21.310> audience<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:21.910> their

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000

who comes in is really nervous and

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.090

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
and so we're all human I think that when

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.730 
and so we're all human I think that when
somebody<00:04:46.690> comes<00:04:46.780> in<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.230> actually<00:04:47.350> smiles

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
somebody comes in and actually smiles

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.600 
somebody comes in and actually smiles
and<00:04:48.040> looks<00:04:48.280> relaxed<00:04:48.850> they<00:04:49.060> play<00:04:49.450> relaxed<00:04:50.080> and

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.850 
and looks relaxed they play relaxed and
that's<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.760> idea<00:04:52.120> of<00:04:52.390> the<00:04:53.050> mental<00:04:53.410> imaging

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860

and that you really have to imagine

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.100 
and that you really have to imagine
yourself<00:04:57.210> relaxed<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.390> having<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.810> good<00:04:58.930> time

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110
