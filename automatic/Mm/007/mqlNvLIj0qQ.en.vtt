00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.970

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.939
 we are going to need kiwi 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:36.069
 chocolate to melt the eye that is 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:38.790
 for strawberries or after any fruit and 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.790
 sticks 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.710
 yes 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.870
 the first thing to do is infect 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:53.940
 well our fruits so that then not 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:56.010
 we get sick of the belly since between 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.980
 all clean disinfected let's start 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.690
 from sliced kiwi but eye 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:10.470
 that are not too thin to be able 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:13.610
 put on that stick and you have to do what 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.610
 same with strawberries 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.000
 now let's melt the chocolate in 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.680
 the microwave you have to put the time 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.140
 little by little so that you do not 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.459
 burn us because if you burn us you can 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.459
 and launch the challenge 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.190
 there must be something like chocolate 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.350
 and here everything is ready you have to put the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.950
 stick in the fruits and put the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:57.550
 chocolate this the truth is super 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:59.620
 delicious and apart its the good part 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.750
 domain paper kitchen on a plate for 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.000
 that chocolate is not tale and then with 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.310
 the pallets there and put them in the freezer 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.440
 for 5 minutes 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.020
 Since your pallets are ready, put them 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.220
 in a nice container so they are 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.220
 ready to be served 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:26.590
 and you are so finished 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.450
 and now I'm going to teach you how to be 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.800
 banana bites that are super easy 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.800
 fast and rich 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.340
 We are going to need a nut 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.340
 chocolate to melt 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:51.820
 peanut butter 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:59.110
 and bananas theme that needs to be done is 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:06.100
 grind a month then you have to split the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.990
 sliced â€‹â€‹banana in this also by 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.180
 aluminum on the plate so that your 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.680
 chocolate does not stick and so good what 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.020
 The only thing you have to do is take a 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.390
 banana piece put butter 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.670
 of peanuts and with another one close it like a 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.670
 sandwich and that must be done with all 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.680
 Now you have to put on them the 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.680
 chocolate and the mind 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.480
 you have to adapt them to the freezer for 5 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:06:01.950
 minutes and ready is super super fascitas 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:06:03.780
 6 are super rich for the third idea 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:09.500
 I'm going to teach you to do something that I 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.500
 I call sweet mango and it 's from my children or 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:24.330
 all you need is to say dairy 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.330
 mango in cubes and solid biscuits 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:35.340
 The first thing we are going to do is very well 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:38.069
 the oreo cookie but without frying now 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.740
 Serve the mango in nice plates or 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:43.439
 where are you going to serve the dessert and then 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.189
 you put a little good what you want from 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:47.400
 dairy 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:07:01.409
 and at the end you put them on sale orio 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:07:03.689
 over this the truth as you saw 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:07.069
 It's super easy to do and how it works 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.069

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.720
