this<00:00:47.570> community<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> football<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.200> think<00:00:49.739> I'd

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
this community of football I think I'd

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220 
this community of football I think I'd
be<00:00:50.039> amazed<00:00:50.489> at<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:51.329> much<00:00:51.510> people<00:00:51.750> care<00:00:52.079> about

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
be amazed at how much people care about

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.299 
be amazed at how much people care about
football<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.100> area<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.899> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:54.989> with

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
football in this area and you know with

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.430 
football in this area and you know with
12,500<00:00:56.309> people<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.000> TD<00:00:57.570> place<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
12,500 people at the TD place for the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.439 
12,500 people at the TD place for the
vandy<00:00:59.160> game<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.820> shows<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.059> there

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
vandy game I think it shows that there

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.990 
vandy game I think it shows that there
is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> massive<00:01:00.989> support<00:01:01.649> here

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.150 

well<00:01:05.660> you<00:01:05.840> consider<00:01:06.230> an<00:01:06.320> amount<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.650> time<00:01:06.860> our

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
well you consider an amount of time our

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.010 
well you consider an amount of time our
young<00:01:07.400> boys<00:01:07.670> put<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.450> dedicating

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
young boys put in to dedicating

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.140

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.940 
themselves to their team to their sport
if<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:11.690> come<00:01:11.840> greater<00:01:12.140> than<00:01:12.560> what<00:01:12.740> they<00:01:12.890> were

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
if you come greater than what they were

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.280 
if you come greater than what they were
when<00:01:13.220> they<00:01:13.340> started<00:01:13.370> it's<00:01:14.210> phenomenal<00:01:14.840> they

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
when they started it's phenomenal they

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.110 
when they started it's phenomenal they

they see the ball and cures out there so

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.710

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
something else and but I think that's

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.820 
something else and but I think that's
teaching<00:02:26.420> those<00:02:26.750> those<00:02:27.230> qualities<00:02:27.799> that

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
teaching those those qualities that

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.800 
teaching those those qualities that
football<00:02:28.370> can<00:02:28.580> do<00:02:28.700> that's<00:02:29.299> what<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.540> strive<00:02:29.690> to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
football can do that's what we strive to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.610 
football can do that's what we strive to
do<00:02:30.049> here

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.680
