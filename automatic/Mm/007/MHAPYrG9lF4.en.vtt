 to end up in a field that it's not such a mission 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.640
 these are safety bliss missions 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.529
 but monitoring 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.529
 we have special formations 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.089
 from various services 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.409
 we are particularly high of montreux know-how in France 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.020
 concerning the no longer specified 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.710
 we try every time to innovate 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.940
 and to present something different in the spirit and the union 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.780
 while putting himself in 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.400

 montreux at the equestrian center 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.620

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.870
 not what are completely different 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.870
 a benefit

 the passage of the novel in the essonne 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 gerard martinez 2nd part is a number 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.470
 finally the handover 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.390
 much more dynamic 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
 big state affair 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.990

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.630

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.130
 leading especially when watching the balloon world cup 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.090
 announced in lyon today 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.300
 none of these flights 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.240
 at the parking 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.530
 the color of the services of the French formations allows us 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.530
 to evolve outside barrels 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.810
 how is their day evolving they have made us 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.810
