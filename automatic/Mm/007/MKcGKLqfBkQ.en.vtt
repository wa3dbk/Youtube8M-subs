00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:28.809 
a plastic tire lever step number one it

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:30.869 
a plastic tire lever step number one it
gets<00:00:28.989> you<00:00:29.169> 50<00:00:29.349> millimeter<00:00:29.980> socket<00:00:30.369> set<00:00:30.610> and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:30.879 
gets you 50 millimeter socket set and

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:57.830 
gets you 50 millimeter socket set and
you<00:00:31.270> take<00:00:31.509> off<00:00:31.719> your<00:00:31.869> wheels
