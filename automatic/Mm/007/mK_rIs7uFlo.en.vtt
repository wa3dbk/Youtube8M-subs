this<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.740> my<00:00:02.240> modified<00:00:03.410> computer<00:00:04.410> power

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
this is my modified computer power

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.299 
this is my modified computer power
supply<00:00:05.569> it's<00:00:06.569> an<00:00:06.810> 80<00:00:06.990> X<00:00:07.259> 120<00:00:07.890> watt<00:00:08.069> power

supply it's an 80 X 120 watt power
supply<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:10.160> I've<00:00:11.160> taken<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.639> cover<00:00:11.849> off<00:00:12.090> and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
supply and I've taken the cover off and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.620 
supply and I've taken the cover off and
remove<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.929> fan<00:00:14.030> plugged<00:00:15.030> into<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.389> range

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
remove the fan plugged into the range

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.310 
remove the fan plugged into the range
right<00:00:15.990> now<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:17.090> normally<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.240> 4<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> 12<00:00:18.840> volts

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
right now and normally out 4 to 12 volts

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.620 
right now and normally out 4 to 12 volts
at<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.859> moment<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.340> flowing<00:00:20.550> 10.7<00:00:21.390> because

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
at the moment out flowing 10.7 because

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.800 
at the moment out flowing 10.7 because
I've<00:00:21.779> performed<00:00:22.189> if<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.519> were<00:00:23.810> modifications

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
I've performed if you were modifications

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:34.310 
I've performed if you were modifications
to<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.550> will<00:00:26.609> go<00:00:26.789> even<00:00:27.119> higher

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.569 

as<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.130> hear<00:00:35.400> the<00:00:35.760> fans<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.480> much<00:00:37.579> much

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
as you can hear the fans get much much

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:55.349 
as you can hear the fans get much much
faster<00:00:40.370> they<00:00:41.370> run<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.970> 12<00:00:42.239> volt<00:00:42.480> line

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.250 

and<00:00:55.899> it<00:00:56.019> is<00:00:56.140> that<00:00:56.350> he<00:00:56.530> save<00:00:56.829> left<00:00:57.190> one<00:00:57.550> voltage

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and it is that he save left one voltage

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
and it is that he save left one voltage
once<00:00:59.260> it's<00:00:59.469> settled

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
once it's settled

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.630 
once it's settled

it's why don't we set it you always have
