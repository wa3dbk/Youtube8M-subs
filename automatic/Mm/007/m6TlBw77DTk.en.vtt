00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
all right today is January 25th 2012

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.870 
all right today is January 25th 2012
this<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.799> freedom<00:00:05.870> and<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.610> hay

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
this is freedom and this is the hay

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.720 
this is freedom and this is the hay
feeder<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.599> built<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.200> fall<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:12.139> found<00:00:13.139> a

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
feeder that I built this fall I found a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.750 
feeder that I built this fall I found a
couple<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:15.030> examples<00:00:15.599> online<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.800> natural

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
couple of examples online it's a natural

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.050 
couple of examples online it's a natural
type<00:00:17.970> hay<00:00:18.210> feeder<00:00:18.510> where<00:00:19.310> the<00:00:20.310> horses<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.939> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
type hay feeder where the horses have to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.420 
type hay feeder where the horses have to
eat<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> little<00:00:21.510> slower<00:00:21.920> because<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
eat a little slower because I have a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.380 
eat a little slower because I have a
metal<00:00:23.670> grate<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:25.130> that<00:00:26.130> doesn't<00:00:27.060> allow

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
metal grate in here that doesn't allow

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.110 
metal grate in here that doesn't allow
them<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.949> just<00:00:28.949> shout<00:00:31.850> uncontrollably<00:00:32.850> they

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
them to just shout uncontrollably they

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.610 
them to just shout uncontrollably they
have<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> kind<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.750> nibble<00:00:34.079> through<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> grate

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
have to kind of nibble through the grate

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.690 
have to kind of nibble through the grate
so<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.329> simulates<00:00:37.370> eating<00:00:38.370> out<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
so it simulates eating out in the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.970 
so it simulates eating out in the
pasture

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
pasture

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.030 
pasture
it<00:00:41.300> helps<00:00:42.300> their<00:00:42.540> hay<00:00:42.719> last<00:00:43.050> longer<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
it helps their hay last longer it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.260 
it helps their hay last longer it
eliminates<00:00:45.500> 99%<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> waste<00:00:47.149> because<00:00:48.149> they

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
eliminates 99% of the waste because they

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
eliminates 99% of the waste because they
don't<00:00:48.450> throw<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.289> stomp<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.860> over<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
don't throw it out and stomp all over it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.600 
don't throw it out and stomp all over it
as<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.640> boy<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.180> famous<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:51.899> doing<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
as this boy is famous for doing so I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.349 
as this boy is famous for doing so I
think<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:56.760> pretty<00:00:56.969> happy<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.629> it

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
think I'm pretty happy with it

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.060 
think I'm pretty happy with it
these<00:01:00.359> guys<00:01:01.820> get<00:01:02.820> hay<00:01:03.180> all<00:01:03.570> day<00:01:04.049> long<00:01:04.379> instead

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
these guys get hay all day long instead

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.190 
these guys get hay all day long instead
of<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.640> simple<00:01:06.270> times<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of just a simple times but they have a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.480 
of just a simple times but they have a
tendency<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.650> gain<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> weight<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
tendency to gain a lot of weight that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.120 
tendency to gain a lot of weight that
way<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.409> helps<00:01:10.409> slow<00:01:10.710> them<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
way so this helps slow them down a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.149 
way so this helps slow them down a
little<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.290> makes<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.530> same<00:01:13.740> amount<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
little bit and makes the same amount of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.570 
little bit and makes the same amount of
hay<00:01:14.369> lasts<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.750> longer<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.500> eliminates<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
hay lasts for longer and eliminates a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.390 
hay lasts for longer and eliminates a
lot<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> waste<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.799> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.979> my<00:01:20.130> first

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
lot of the waste so this is my first

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.060 
lot of the waste so this is my first
prototype<00:01:20.790> you'll<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> might<00:01:22.049> adjust<00:01:22.590> it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
prototype you'll see I might adjust it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.940 
prototype you'll see I might adjust it
as<00:01:23.220> time<00:01:23.460> goes<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.850> but<00:01:24.150> I'm<00:01:24.530> decently<00:01:25.530> happy

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
as time goes on but I'm decently happy

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940 
as time goes on but I'm decently happy
with<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> first<00:01:26.820> time<00:01:27.619> here's<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
with it for the first time here's the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.140 
with it for the first time here's the
grading<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.790> did<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> smaller<00:01:30.689> grate<00:01:32.150> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
grading I did have a smaller grate the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
grading I did have a smaller grate the
inches<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.990> squares<00:01:34.530> were<00:01:34.799> probably<00:01:35.280> two<00:01:35.490> by

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
inches the squares were probably two by

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.710 
inches the squares were probably two by
two<00:01:36.710> inches<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.310> proved<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.509> too

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
two inches and it proved to just be too

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.780 
two inches and it proved to just be too
small<00:01:40.079> they<00:01:40.320> weren't<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.890> getting<00:01:41.040> hardly

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
small they weren't really getting hardly

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.460 
small they weren't really getting hardly
anything<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.280> this<00:01:44.689> seems<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> work<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.350> little

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
anything so this seems to work a little

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.139 
anything so this seems to work a little
bit<00:01:46.590> better<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:47.100> still<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
bit better they still can get it but it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.469 
bit better they still can get it but it
slows<00:01:48.450> them<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.600> enough<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:50.090> make<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.299> last

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
slows them down enough to make it last

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.650 
slows them down enough to make it last
and<00:01:51.960> eliminate<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> waste<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> same<00:01:53.340> time

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
and eliminate the waste at the same time

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.010 
and eliminate the waste at the same time
so<00:01:55.660> thought<00:01:56.080> I'd<00:01:56.260> share<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:56.980> pretty

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so thought I'd share it it's pretty

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.570 
so thought I'd share it it's pretty
pretty<00:01:59.020> cool<00:01:59.350> thing<00:01:59.620> I<00:01:59.770> found<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.400> thought

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
pretty cool thing I found and thought

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580 
pretty cool thing I found and thought
I'd<00:02:00.730> try<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.000> myself<00:02:01.240> but<00:02:01.690> I'm<00:02:01.870> pretty<00:02:02.350> happy

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
I'd try it myself but I'm pretty happy

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.130 
I'd try it myself but I'm pretty happy
with<00:02:02.800> it<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:02.980> far
