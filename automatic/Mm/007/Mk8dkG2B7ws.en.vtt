00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
this one abandoned half-step but when I

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.990 
this one abandoned half-step but when I
play<00:02:01.289> it<00:02:01.350> faster<00:02:01.800> its<00:02:01.950> way<00:02:02.369> easier<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.819> use

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
play it faster its way easier to use

play it faster its way easier to use
pull<00:02:03.299> off<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.720> then<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.899> usually<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:05.179> pull<00:02:06.179> off

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
pull off so then I usually do pull off

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:14.509 
pull off so then I usually do pull off
here<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.759> then<00:02:08.840> from<00:02:09.840> here<00:02:09.869> pull<00:02:10.530> off<00:02:13.519> so

from here most of the time the kind of

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:09.550 
from here most of the time the kind of
