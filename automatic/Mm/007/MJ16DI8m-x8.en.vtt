 ares 

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.970
 for that just stay on the percentages that is tagged 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.620
 except when you do mountain biking it's true that sometimes it's a bit complicated 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.719
 to actually find oneself in the woods and to 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.639
 and what is the path that is marked which is the one that is not said 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.949
 rather it was complicated because today it is not so 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.880
 finally it only takes a few mouse clicks to find the best 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.660
 cdd contracts 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.329

 pedestrian eric estrade cyclotourists an original initiative 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.800
 and ambitious born of an observation 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.460
 we pass to join our good course 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.510
 and then when we found a little for 109 world points 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.920
 los angeles the myth on the course is sometimes more than three kilometers 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.090
 I was stuck because it was missing a video store tag 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.980
 surely beautiful sizes 750 tracks are already listed 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.580
 this site is accessible to all for free for that we find the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.610
 trail directory for mountain biking is currently one can do a search 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 by municipality 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.820
 for its part possible distance and then more this time when we made the 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.420
 course 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.080
 we can put the comment on the circuit and see precisely it's good 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.420
 serviced% and if the directors no it's really about having a talk talk 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.159
 1 by the user that he who can put his comments his pictures if 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.850
 we have and should see something I'm the victim of an accident 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.630
 work in coding but also in the field 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.369
 to carry out his project the hiking team regularly takes on 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.720
 contact with the tourist office for a common inventory by commune 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.100
 a real work of Benedictine has already been harvested so that the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 information on the net 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.020
 and going on the full anderson field 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.300
 the training and it makes us know that also it allows to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.490
 of data show that rebel attacks 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.040

 christophe benoit put on the helmet of the shoes en route for a tracking 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.980
 careful about doing it 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.359
 at the crossroads they can readjust the shot if necessary 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.859
 I am attacking the tests 29 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:42.939

 faure afp golf club 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.819
 on the plane purely it should be a right right 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.999
 not even we can conclude a beautiful climb 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.369
 no way to recover this little Arab world to take 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.459
 mentally that a landscape without markup my side all right 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.359

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.609
 master word of this call 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.789
 the words of the president of the tourist office 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:13.820
 the action of rebels is meant above all to positivate the members 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.929
 consider an intervention as everywhere 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.019
 story to make a positive service positivism 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.199
 Here are the attacks can find its fruits 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.469
