00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 not everything is what it seems 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.860
 and how is it so strange 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
 I am rasta gu and you are watching culture 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.179
 In addition to being very pleasant, 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.310
 music has a marked influence on 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 the nervous system because it affects the field 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.880
 perceptual of the person who listens 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.769
 can make changes in the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.599
 brain structures and enhance 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.800
 cognitive skills in people from 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.660
 all ages 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 today I invite you to find out about four 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.650
 things that make music to your 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.420
 brain music and background noises 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.309
 when we are young we can distinguish 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.870
 easily the sounds that come to us 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 through the background noises 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.649
 However, as we age, this 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.210
 ability seems to miss the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 scientists have discovered that the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 music helps keep the gift of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.300
 auditory differentiation people 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.460
 who study music or those who are 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.320
 regular listeners of this demonstration 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 artistic show a great capacity 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.739
 to hear the sound waves that they 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.739
 they come through noisy environments 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.260
 the music helps the memories 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.270
 return as extraordinary as it seems 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.700
 Studies indicate that music helps 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.740
 that memories return in people 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.720
 that have impacted memory patients 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.310
 who have experienced important traumas that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.440
 they have made him lose the ability to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.790
 remember they can recover many of their 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.650
 memories if you like therapies 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.930
 musicals how to learn a language 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.670
 using music to listen to songs in 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.140
 another language and repeat the sound 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.060
 rhythmically they offer and 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.800
 after that go to investigate in 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.690
 the dictionary the words that you are 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.550
 saying will surely help you 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.560
 very much so that you can learn another 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.510
 language this is not a coincidence 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.650
 precisely using music is one of 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.990
 the ways that experts recommend 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.550
 so you can learn another language 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.890
 has proven that singing the lyrics of 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.410
 a text helps to fix the words and the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.550
 phonetics much more than if you read said 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.170
 phrases 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.730
 and music and emotions for anyone 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.620
 it's news that music makes us 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.030
 feel more emotional but the 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.710
 scientists have gone much further 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.920
 they have discovered that the sounds 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.600
 musicals affect brain waves 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 causing greater sensitivity to 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.530
 the reality with which we are 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.330
 interacting even it seems that 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.680
 both the musicians and those people 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.020
 who spend their lives listening to music 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.670
 they have a greater capacity to perceive 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.680
 the emotions of their peers 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.630
 these four effects of music 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.850
 in the brain suggests the importance 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.170
 that this artistic expression has for 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.780
 the education of future generations 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.730
 on a planet every day more in danger 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.070
 for social and natural issues 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.840
 we will need human beings who can 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.730
 take care of human memory learn to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.770
 communicate in all languages have 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.780
 a great sensitivity and especially being 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.340
 joyful and optimistic the music is without 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.900
 doubt the best of the tools for 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.600
 strengthen our brain and our 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.650
 spirit something that science 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 has definitely confirmed that you 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950
 you seem to think these four points 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.200
 that to you the music that influences this 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.730
 way you feel when listening to music 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.930
