00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.469
 the scheme that has fm to deliver the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.779
 drinking water from the catchment from 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.300
 identify a source of water that 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:20.449
 meets some characteristics for 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.929
 to be able to bring it into processes 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.099
 and then deliver it as drinking water 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.339
 we have 11 plants of 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.499
 purification we have a capacity 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.050
 installed production 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.649
 about 15 cubic meters per 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.150
 second and the purification plants 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.730
 they are located 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.340
 throughout the metropolitan area with all 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.090
 these plants we cover all the need 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.090
 from the valley of bored 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.780
 to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.210
 we are in the plant 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.990
 potabilization springs is one of the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.330
 11 plants that has ep m to deliver 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.970
 drinking water here we do all the 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.370
 transformation process a process of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.800
 purification to deliver it as water 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.810
 potable suitable for human consumption in this 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.550
 moment for example here in springs 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.130
 the water is reaching the river reservoir 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.800
 big then there are some sources that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.310
 They supply the reservoir of the dam to 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.770
 through a tunnel reaches the water reaches 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.380
 a generation of energy and then by 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.160
 half of a driving enters here to the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.160
 potabilization plant 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.150
 the water that reaches the plant here 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.700
 springs comes to a structure of 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.770
 initially you have to see what 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.410
 characteristics has and according to 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.320
 those physical and chemical characteristics and 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.290
 microbiological we make a 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.540
 absorption process which is a process 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.820
 with removal and we do it with charcoal 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.360
 activated we do a process of 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.640
 coagulation then the procurement that what 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.290
 we can see then in each of the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.910
 the tanks of the plant the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.640
 sedimentation a filtration process 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.860
 finally the filtered water is 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.590
 disinfected and the pH is adjusted to 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.470
 that there are some more 5 conditions 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.130
 chemical and microbiological suitable for 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.130
 human consumption 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.900
 the plant springs belongs to what 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.880
 we have as interconnected systems 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.550
 with the plant to help have some 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.190
 circuits some areas shared with 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.860
 the purpose that at a certain moment by 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.990
 maintenance or work 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.120
 operations that are required the one 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.730
 supports the production of the other 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.910
 springs is supplying in this 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.220
 moment the north of what is the area 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.060
 metropolitan deliver dota copacabana 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.340
 of it the northeastern part and part of the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.230
 center of the city of Medellin is more or 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.840
 minus the plant springs 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.250
 we could say around 40 per 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.250
 one hundred percent of the supply 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.180
 the effort that is made from the company 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.799
 to deliver clean water is great 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.629
 then a fortiori if the product 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.180
 comes good, you have to take care of it in the 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.060
 housing must be stored in exchanges 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.640
 that they are clean tanks with a 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.900
 good maintenance and also be very 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:33.370
 conscious when we have sources of 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.650
 water near the water you have to take care of it 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.720
 and not make ill-disposed disposition of 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.720
 waste from dumping
