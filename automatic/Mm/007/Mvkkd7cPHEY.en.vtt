so<00:00:00.450> let's<00:00:00.960> say<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.530> here<00:00:01.979> and<00:00:02.360> we're<00:00:03.360> flying

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
so let's say we're here and we're flying

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.710 
so let's say we're here and we're flying
towards<00:00:04.350> Big<00:00:04.620> B<00:00:04.970> we're<00:00:05.970> going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.180> cross<00:00:06.420> over

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
towards Big B we're going to cross over

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.220 
towards Big B we're going to cross over
the<00:00:07.379> vor<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.540> we're<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> use<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the vor and we're going to use the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.280 
the vor and we're going to use the
navigation<00:00:10.410> one<00:00:11.190> radio<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:12.030> fly<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.690> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
navigation one radio to fly on the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.349 
navigation one radio to fly on the
outbound<00:00:14.599> radial<00:00:16.160> 016<00:00:17.160> or<00:00:17.640> raid<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.090> course

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
outbound radial 016 or raid on course

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.700 
outbound radial 016 or raid on course
this<00:00:19.279> right<00:00:20.279> here<00:00:20.460> tells<00:00:20.699> us<00:00:21.529> flight<00:00:22.529> level

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
this right here tells us flight level

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.820 
this right here tells us flight level
240<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.910> we're<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.650> 24,000<00:00:25.650> feet

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
240 so we're going to be 24,000 feet

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.780 
240 so we're going to be 24,000 feet
flying<00:00:26.699> away<00:00:26.880> from<00:00:27.330> Big<00:00:27.539> B<00:00:28.369> on<00:00:29.369> heading<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.090> 016

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
flying away from Big B on heading of 016

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.100 
flying away from Big B on heading of 016
we're<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> keep<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.719> keep<00:00:33.960> on

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
we're going to keep on going keep on

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.740 
we're going to keep on going keep on
going<00:00:34.500> keep<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.480> we<00:00:36.600> got

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
going keep on going and what do we got

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
going keep on going and what do we got
here<00:00:39.020> this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.890> Graham<00:00:42.379> VOR<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> while

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
here this is the Graham VOR so while

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
here this is the Graham VOR so while
we're<00:00:45.270> heading<00:00:45.510> towards<00:00:45.660> Graham<00:00:46.260> we're<00:00:46.890> going

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
we're heading towards Graham we're going

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
we're heading towards Graham we're going
to<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:48.020> intercepting<00:00:49.020> also<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:51.300> 11.6

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
to be intercepting also the one 11.6

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.420 
to be intercepting also the one 11.6
Graham<00:00:54.059> vor<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.160> we're<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.309> be

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
Graham vor and we're going to be

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.110 
Graham vor and we're going to be
intersecting<00:00:57.180> we're<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> intercepting

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
intersecting we're going to intercepting

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
intersecting we're going to intercepting
Graham<00:01:00.410> VOR<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.390> 198<00:01:03.390> radial<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
Graham VOR on the 198 radial which is

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.039 
Graham VOR on the 198 radial which is
basically<00:01:05.129> coming<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.610> from<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> south<00:01:06.119> 180

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
basically coming in from the south 180

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.520 
basically coming in from the south 180
degrees<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.650> due<00:01:07.799> south<00:01:08.070> 198<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:10.140> 200

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
degrees is due south 198 is about 200

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.980 
degrees is due south 198 is about 200
degrees<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.420> go<00:01:12.450> we're<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
degrees so there we go we're going to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.670 
degrees so there we go we're going to
cross<00:01:13.140> over<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:15.140> by<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> time<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.590> get

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
cross over there and by the time we get

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.890 
cross over there and by the time we get
to<00:01:16.740> hear<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.580> want<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.090> close<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> about

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to hear we want to be close to about

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.179 
to hear we want to be close to about
4,000<00:01:19.680> feet<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.619> we're<00:01:22.619> descending

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
4,000 feet so we're descending

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
4,000 feet so we're descending
descending<00:01:23.490> descending<00:01:23.970> we're<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.509> 4,000

descending descending we're at 4,000

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440 
descending descending we're at 4,000
feet<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.950> crossed<00:01:26.070> over<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> Graham<00:01:26.820> vor

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
feet we just crossed over the Graham vor

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.230 
feet we just crossed over the Graham vor
and<00:01:29.780> we're<00:01:30.780> pretty<00:01:31.049> close<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> Nashville<00:01:32.240> so

and we're pretty close to Nashville so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.920 
and we're pretty close to Nashville so
now<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.509> want<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.990> head<00:01:35.210> outbound<00:01:36.210> from<00:01:36.600> Graham

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
now we want a head outbound from Graham

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.880 
now we want a head outbound from Graham

when you have the course set incorrect
and<00:06:32.610> you're<00:06:32.640> at<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:32.940> right<00:06:33.150> altitude<00:06:33.470> this

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
and you're at the right altitude this

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.159 
and you're at the right altitude this
makes<00:06:34.710> it<00:06:34.830> a<00:06:34.919> lot<00:06:35.039> easier<00:06:35.100> for<00:06:35.940> the<00:06:36.780> autopilot

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
makes it a lot easier for the autopilot

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:37.700 
makes it a lot easier for the autopilot

and you're flying over there is no way

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.090 
and you're flying over there is no way
that<00:06:46.950> your<00:06:47.370> autopilot<00:06:47.640> would<00:06:48.090> be<00:06:48.300> able<00:06:48.480> to

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
that your autopilot would be able to

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.460 
that your autopilot would be able to
guide<00:06:50.100> your<00:06:50.420> airplane<00:06:51.420> on<00:06:51.630> to<00:06:51.840> the<00:06:51.960> runway<00:06:52.140> you

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
guide your airplane on to the runway you

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.130 
guide your airplane on to the runway you
would<00:06:52.620> overshoot<00:06:53.040> the<00:06:53.220> runway<00:06:53.570> and<00:06:54.570> that's

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140 
would overshoot the runway and that's

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.750 
would overshoot the runway and that's
why<00:06:55.320> you<00:06:55.380> actually<00:06:55.980> have<00:06:56.130> to<00:06:56.250> follow<00:06:56.490> these

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
why you actually have to follow these

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.970 
why you actually have to follow these
charts<00:06:57.150> precisely<00:06:57.650> with<00:06:58.650> the<00:06:58.680> correct

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
charts precisely with the correct

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.870 
charts precisely with the correct
heading<00:06:59.370> the<00:06:59.520> correct<00:06:59.760> altitude<00:06:59.970> and<00:07:01.880> that's

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
heading the correct altitude and that's

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.200 
heading the correct altitude and that's
how<00:07:03.090> it<00:07:03.210> works<00:07:03.420> that's<00:07:03.960> why<00:07:04.200> every<00:07:05.210> every

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
how it works that's why every every

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.150 
how it works that's why every every
approach<00:07:06.540> in<00:07:06.840> every<00:07:07.080> landing<00:07:07.440> using<00:07:08.040> the

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
approach in every landing using the

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:16.040 
approach in every landing using the
autopilot<00:07:08.580> is<00:07:08.940> is<00:07:09.300> smooth<00:07:10.520> so<00:07:14.840> going<00:07:15.840> back<00:07:15.990> to

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
autopilot is is smooth so going back to

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.560 
autopilot is is smooth so going back to
the<00:07:16.260> time<00:07:16.440> when<00:07:16.680> you<00:07:16.800> were<00:07:16.950> actually<00:07:17.570> really

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
the time when you were actually really

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.410 
the time when you were actually really
learning<00:07:18.750> about<00:07:19.080> aviation<00:07:19.410> of<00:07:19.800> flying<00:07:20.420> this

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
learning about aviation of flying this

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.850 
learning about aviation of flying this
goes<00:07:21.630> to<00:07:21.840> show<00:07:21.990> you<00:07:22.050> that<00:07:22.200> you<00:07:22.350> really<00:07:22.680> don't

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
goes to show you that you really don't

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.230 
goes to show you that you really don't
have<00:07:22.980> to<00:07:23.130> look<00:07:23.220> out<00:07:23.400> the<00:07:23.520> window<00:07:23.820> to<00:07:23.880> be<00:07:24.180> able

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
have to look out the window to be able

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.450 
have to look out the window to be able
to<00:07:24.450> know<00:07:24.600> how<00:07:24.780> to<00:07:24.870> fly<00:07:25.050> the<00:07:25.110> plane<00:07:25.410> and<00:07:25.620> it<00:07:26.370> will

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
to know how to fly the plane and it will

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.680 
to know how to fly the plane and it will
actually<00:07:26.610> land<00:07:26.910> right<00:07:27.150> on<00:07:27.180> the<00:07:27.360> runway

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.690 
actually land right on the runway

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.620 
actually land right on the runway
without<00:07:27.840> even<00:07:28.230> looking<00:07:28.440> out<00:07:28.560> the<00:07:28.650> window

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
without even looking out the window

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.400 
without even looking out the window
generally<00:07:30.770> so<00:07:31.770> follow<00:07:32.370> the<00:07:32.640> charts<00:07:33.410> follow

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.410 
generally so follow the charts follow

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.110 
generally so follow the charts follow
the<00:07:34.650> checklists<00:07:35.070> and<00:07:35.460> you<00:07:35.760> should<00:07:35.940> have<00:07:36.090> a

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 
the checklists and you should have a

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.200 
the checklists and you should have a
smooth<00:07:36.390> landing<00:07:36.630> every<00:07:37.020> time
