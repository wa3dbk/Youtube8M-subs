be fitting the vinyl wrapping this

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.590 
be fitting the vinyl wrapping this
scooter<00:00:30.700> today

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.660 

as<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.810> can<00:00:36.900> see<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.320> warm<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.950> film<00:00:38.400> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
as you can see we warm the film to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.140 
as you can see we warm the film to
stretch<00:00:38.970> it<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.290> PVC<00:00:41.070> film<00:00:41.340> comes<00:00:41.700> warm

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
stretch it as when PVC film comes warm

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.860 
stretch it as when PVC film comes warm
up<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.630> becomes<00:00:42.840> more<00:00:43.020> pliable<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.640> can

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
up and it becomes more pliable so we can

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
up and it becomes more pliable so we can
conform<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.170> around<00:00:46.559> these<00:00:46.739> compound<00:00:47.340> curves

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
conform it around these compound curves

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670 
conform it around these compound curves
all<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.540> want<00:00:48.720> to<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.900> aware<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.559> not

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
all we want to be aware of we're not

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560 
all we want to be aware of we're not
from<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.860> fitting<00:00:50.220> point<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.610> view<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.330> that<00:00:51.390> we

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
from a fitting point of view is that we

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.119 
from a fitting point of view is that we
don't<00:00:51.750> over<00:00:52.050> stretch<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.470> film<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> more<00:00:52.980> we

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
don't over stretch the film the more we

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.070 
don't over stretch the film the more we
stretch<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.580> less<00:00:53.850> adhesive<00:00:54.059> behind<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
stretch the less adhesive behind the

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.740 
stretch the less adhesive behind the
film<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.559> make<00:00:55.860> sure<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.309> maintain<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:57.629> high

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
film I make sure we maintain a very high

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.500 
film I make sure we maintain a very high
collar<00:00:58.199> straight<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.489> also<00:00:59.910> not<00:01:00.180> over

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
collar straight and also not over

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.609 
collar straight and also not over
distorting<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:02.070> graphic

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.609 

Latex<00:01:11.520> inks<00:01:11.729> are<00:01:12.180> very<00:01:12.479> conformable<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
Latex inks are very conformable so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.710 
Latex inks are very conformable so
there's<00:01:13.799> no<00:01:13.920> issue<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.390> inks

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
there's no issue with the the inks

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.450 
there's no issue with the the inks
distorting<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:16.920> trying<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
distorting like you get with trying to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.279 
distorting like you get with trying to
do<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> rack<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> UV<00:01:18.479> ink<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.960> something

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
do a rack with a UV ink or something

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.190 
do a rack with a UV ink or something
like<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> also<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> airflow

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
like that and also we have the airflow

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.010 
like that and also we have the airflow
technology<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.329> small<00:01:24.630> bubble<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
technology so if I get a small bubble in

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.169 
technology so if I get a small bubble in
the<00:01:25.110> film<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> means<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.039> have<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
the film all it means I have to do is

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:28.789 
the film all it means I have to do is
put<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.420> finger<00:01:27.869> over<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.259> push<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> air<00:01:28.770> out

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
put my finger over and push the air out

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.990 
put my finger over and push the air out
because<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.729> film<00:01:29.970> has<00:01:30.320> hundreds<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.470> tiny

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
because the film has hundreds of tiny

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.210 
because the film has hundreds of tiny
honeycomb<00:01:33.000> effect<00:01:33.450> pillories<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.950> glue

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
honeycomb effect pillories in the glue

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.940 
honeycomb effect pillories in the glue
to<00:01:36.179> prevent<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.960> trapping<00:01:37.409> air<00:01:37.560> beneath<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to prevent it trapping air beneath the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.350 
to prevent it trapping air beneath the
film<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.920> relatively<00:01:44.429> low<00:01:44.700> grabs<00:01:45.090> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
film it's relatively low grabs that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
film it's relatively low grabs that
enables<00:01:45.720> me<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.619> material<00:01:47.039> if<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
enables me to do this the material if I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.359 
enables me to do this the material if I
make<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.429> mistake<00:01:48.380> or<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> reposition<00:01:50.069> it<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
make a mistake or to reposition it and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.080 
make a mistake or to reposition it and
then<00:01:51.179> I'll<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.420> simply<00:01:51.810> reapply<00:01:52.909> we<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
then I'll just simply reapply we have a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
then I'll just simply reapply we have a
complete<00:01:54.509> solution<00:01:54.929> for<00:01:55.229> vehicle<00:01:55.770> wrapping
