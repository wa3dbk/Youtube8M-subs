00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.090 
gun but as you guys will see with some
of<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.780> gameplay<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.829> almost

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of the gameplay here it's got almost

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
of the gameplay here it's got almost
zero<00:00:38.670> recoil<00:00:39.269> even<00:00:39.629> long<00:00:39.809> range<00:00:40.199> this<00:00:40.469> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
zero recoil even long range this is

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.619 
zero recoil even long range this is
definitely<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> hundred<00:00:41.940> percent<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.390> gun<00:00:42.539> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
definitely a hundred percent the gun you

definitely a hundred percent the gun you
want<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.870> use<00:00:43.019> if<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.379> playing<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.739> beta

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.419 
want to use if you're playing the beta
in<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:46.109> opinion<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.710> don't<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.160> need<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
in my opinion you don't really need a

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.630 
in my opinion you don't really need a
red<00:00:47.609> dot<00:00:47.789> sight<00:00:48.120> uh<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.859> use<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.429> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
red dot sight uh you can use one I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
red dot sight uh you can use one I
wouldn't<00:00:50.969> suggest<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.839> the<00:00:51.960> iron

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
wouldn't suggest it because the iron

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.560 
wouldn't suggest it because the iron
sights<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.589> pretty<00:00:52.859> good<00:00:53.510> quick-draw<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
sights are pretty good quick-draw is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.840 
sights are pretty good quick-draw is
definitely<00:00:55.140> super<00:00:55.589> important<00:00:56.070> definitely<00:00:56.820> I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
definitely super important definitely I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.329 
definitely super important definitely I
must<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.359> in<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:58.230> opinion<00:00:58.559> extended<00:00:59.160> mags

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
must have in my opinion extended mags

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.819 
must have in my opinion extended mags
also<00:00:59.879> typically<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.960> only<00:01:01.109> carries<00:01:01.469> 30

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
also typically it only carries 30

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.739 
also typically it only carries 30
bullets<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> magazine<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.359> extended

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.760 
bullets actually do make a pretty big
difference<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.180> my<00:01:09.300> opinion<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.410> guys<00:01:10.650> will

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
coal duty other than maybe black ops 2

coal duty other than maybe black ops 2
c4<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.330> would<00:01:15.900> say<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.530> need<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> lethal

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
c4 I would say you don't need a lethal

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.920 
c4 I would say you don't need a lethal
but<00:01:19.130> grenades<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> game<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:20.850> super<00:01:21.510> opie

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
but grenades in this game are super opie

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
but grenades in this game are super opie
and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> fact<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.650> flak<00:01:23.040> jacket<00:01:23.610> isn't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and the fact that flak jacket isn't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.990 
and the fact that flak jacket isn't
unlocked<00:01:24.630> until<00:01:25.290> level<00:01:25.830> 28<00:01:26.340> i<00:01:26.520> believe<00:01:26.880> which

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
unlocked until level 28 i believe which

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
unlocked until level 28 i believe which
is<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.240> max<00:01:27.420> level<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> beta<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
is the max level for the beta you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530 
is the max level for the beta you
definitely<00:01:29.220> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.520> using<00:01:29.790> grenades<00:01:29.940> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
definitely want to be using grenades I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.010 
definitely want to be using grenades I
think<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> frag<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.770> super<00:01:32.190> good<00:01:32.340> especially

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
think the frag is super good especially

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
think the frag is super good especially
because<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.230> know<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.890> ability<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
because you know you have the ability to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
because you know you have the ability to
cook<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.200> throw<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.530> long<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:38.010> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
cook it or just throw it long if you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
cook it or just throw it long if you
want<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.550> so<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.910> definitely<00:01:38.940> suggest<00:01:39.480> that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
want to so I definitely suggest that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.560 
want to so I definitely suggest that
stuns<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.770> super<00:01:41.550> opie<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.330> game<00:01:42.540> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
stuns are also super opie in this game I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
stuns are also super opie in this game I
don't<00:01:42.870> even<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.260> can<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.680> tagged<00:01:43.950> no

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
don't even think you can get tagged no

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
don't even think you can get tagged no
you<00:01:44.370> can't<00:01:44.730> get<00:01:44.970> tactical<00:01:45.360> mask<00:01:45.660> in<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:45.960> beta

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you can't get tactical mask in the beta

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.250 
you can't get tactical mask in the beta
is<00:01:46.290> level<00:01:46.500> 32<00:01:46.800> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.300> only<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> 28<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
is level 32 and you can only go to 28 so

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.530 
is level 32 and you can only go to 28 so
both<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.580> think<00:01:51.150> they're<00:01:51.330> definitely

on another story above you don't alert
you<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.960> think<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.800> is

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
you of that so I think this is

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
definitely a good / to start off with

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.000 
definitely a good / to start off with
next<00:02:32.820> up<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.120> fast<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.750> swap<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.230> ya

listen<00:03:35.310> kind<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.090> loudly<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.540> would<00:03:36.810> definitely

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
listen kind of loudly I would definitely

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.570 
listen kind of loudly I would definitely
use<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.769> think<00:03:37.830> it'll<00:03:38.070> definitely<00:03:38.340> get

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
use this I think it'll definitely get

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.580 
use this I think it'll definitely get
you<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> lot<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.000> kills<00:03:39.209> also<00:03:40.019> considering<00:03:40.500> you

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you a lot of kills also considering you

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.050 
you a lot of kills also considering you
can't<00:03:40.769> even<00:03:40.890> get<00:03:41.130> dead<00:03:41.280> silent<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:41.880> there's

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
can't even get dead silent so there's

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.759 
can't even get dead silent so there's
almost<00:03:42.180> no<00:03:42.540> counter<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.230> right<00:03:43.380> now<00:03:43.410> which

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
almost no counter to it right now which

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.030 
almost no counter to it right now which
is<00:03:44.000> kind<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.239> all<00:03:45.600> right<00:03:46.110> if<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.410> don't<00:03:46.709> use<00:03:47.010> it

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
is kind of all right if you don't use it

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.830 
is kind of all right if you don't use it
it's<00:03:47.580> like<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.150> you're<00:03:48.269> not<00:03:48.299> really<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.630> big

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
it's like if you're not really a big

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.390 
it's like if you're not really a big
sound<00:03:49.140> whore<00:03:49.440> then<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> might<00:03:49.950> use<00:03:50.100> blast

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
sound whore then I might use blast

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.870
