file<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:04.710> explain<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.280> monetary

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
file and explain the monetary

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.050 
file and explain the monetary
transmission<00:00:06.330> mechanism<00:00:07.580> now<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.820> question

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.060 
transmission mechanism now this question

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.700 
transmission mechanism now this question
consists<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.870> two<00:00:10.170> parts

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
consists of two parts

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.039 
consists of two parts
firstly<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.730> have<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.000> define<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> monetary

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
firstly we have to define the monetary

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.350 
firstly we have to define the monetary
transmission<00:00:13.530> mechanism<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.240> have

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
transmission mechanism and then we have

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.800 
transmission mechanism and then we have
to<00:00:15.540> explain<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.430> that<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.640> definition<00:00:18.540> layoffs

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to explain it that in definition layoffs

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.849 
to explain it that in definition layoffs
is<00:00:19.320> simple<00:00:20.180> it<00:00:21.180> indicates<00:00:21.840> how<00:00:22.050> changes<00:00:22.650> in

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
is simple it indicates how changes in

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
is simple it indicates how changes in
the<00:00:22.980> financial<00:00:23.519> sector<00:00:23.699> are<00:00:24.170> transmitted<00:00:25.170> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the financial sector are transmitted to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.339 
the financial sector are transmitted to
the<00:00:25.470> real<00:00:25.650> sector<00:00:26.869> changes<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> money

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the real sector changes in the money

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.880 
the real sector changes in the money
market<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:29.810> transmitted<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.470> production

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
market are transmitted to the production

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
market are transmitted to the production
of<00:00:32.189> goods<00:00:33.060> and<00:00:33.240> services<00:00:34.910> how<00:00:35.910> does<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
of goods and services how does this

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.530 
of goods and services how does this
process<00:00:36.570> work<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.270> explanation

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
process work and that is the explanation

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.209 
process work and that is the explanation
that<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.559> transmission<00:00:41.550> mechanism<00:00:42.000> gives<00:00:42.660> us

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
that the transmission mechanism gives us

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.389 
that the transmission mechanism gives us
start<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.700> x<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> interest<00:00:45.780> rate<00:00:46.399> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
start with a x in the interest rate the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.459 
start with a x in the interest rate the
interest<00:00:47.640> rate<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.329> determined<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.289> money

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
interest rate is determined in the money

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.650 
interest rate is determined in the money
market<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.489> where<00:00:50.699> we<00:00:50.850> start<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
market so that's where we start it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.610 
market so that's where we start it
change<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.350> interest<00:00:52.590> rate<00:00:54.350> chosen<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
change in the interest rate chosen it is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.479 
change in the interest rate chosen it is
right<00:00:55.800> leads<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.000> change<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:58.489> investment

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
right leads to a change in investment

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.900 
right leads to a change in investment
spending<00:01:00.590> now<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.920> investment<00:01:02.489> spinning

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
spending now we know investment spinning

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.270 
spending now we know investment spinning
is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> component<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.199> aggregate<00:01:04.710> demand<00:01:04.860> so

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
is a component of aggregate demand so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
is a component of aggregate demand so
change<00:01:05.580> investment<00:01:06.300> spinning<00:01:06.690> leads<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
change investment spinning leads to a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.950 
change investment spinning leads to a
change<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.220> aggregate<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.480> month<00:01:11.360> if<00:01:12.360> aggregate

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
change in aggregate a month if aggregate

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.760 
change in aggregate a month if aggregate
amount<00:01:13.260> times<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.940> affect<00:01:15.320> income<00:01:16.320> as

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
amount times it will affect income as

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
amount times it will affect income as
the<00:01:16.920> price<00:01:17.160> level<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.690> change<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the price level so the change the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.530 
the price level so the change the
negative<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.770> month<00:01:19.980> will<00:01:20.820> lead<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> change

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
negative the month will lead to change

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.290 
negative the month will lead to change
in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.870> price<00:01:22.110> level<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.770> also<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
in the price level and also to the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.320 
in the price level and also to the
change<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:26.660> income<00:01:27.660> level<00:01:28.670> now<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:30.270> are

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
change in the income level now there are

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.420 
change in the income level now there are
two<00:01:30.540> important<00:01:32.480> parts<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.290> sign<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
two important parts to this sign of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.140 
two important parts to this sign of
causality<00:01:35.970> firstly<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.350> link<00:01:37.620> between

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
causality firstly the link between

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
causality firstly the link between
inter-site<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.470> investment<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.900> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
inter-site and investment this is the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.490 
inter-site and investment this is the
inverse<00:01:43.530> relationship<00:01:44.190> in<00:01:45.090> other<00:01:45.270> words<00:01:45.540> if

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
inverse relationship in other words if

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.440 
inverse relationship in other words if
industry<00:01:47.040> comes<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:49.010> investment<00:01:50.010> will

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
industry comes up investment will

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.960 
industry comes up investment will
decrease<00:01:53.840> secondly<00:01:54.950> once<00:01:55.950> investment<00:01:56.640> trains

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
decrease secondly once investment trains

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.540 
decrease secondly once investment trains
it<00:01:57.510> leads<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:58.260> a<00:01:58.620> change<00:01:59.010> in<00:01:59.250> price<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.900> income

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
it leads to a change in price and income

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.900 
it leads to a change in price and income
this<00:02:02.550> then<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:04.020> explanation<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
this then is the explanation for of the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.900 
this then is the explanation for of the
transmission<00:02:06.570> mechanism<00:02:07.700> change<00:02:08.700> in

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
transmission mechanism change in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460 
transmission mechanism change in
interest<00:02:09.149> rate<00:02:09.390> leads<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> change

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
interest rate leads to the change

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.010 
interest rate leads to the change
investment<00:02:11.220> these<00:02:11.820> two<00:02:12.090> change<00:02:12.450> an<00:02:12.630> aggregate

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
investment these two change an aggregate

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.210 
investment these two change an aggregate
amount<00:02:13.350> which<00:02:13.830> effect<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.630> prices<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.010> income
