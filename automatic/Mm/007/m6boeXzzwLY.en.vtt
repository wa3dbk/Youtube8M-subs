00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
the current time so I think it's a great

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.759 
the current time so I think it's a great
thing<00:02:50.920> but<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.640> don't<00:02:51.880> believe<00:02:51.940> there<00:02:52.269> was<00:02:52.330> any

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
thing but I don't believe there was any

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
necessarily any brokerage deal I think

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.300 
necessarily any brokerage deal I think
