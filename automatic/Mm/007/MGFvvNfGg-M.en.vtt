button<00:00:06.089> if<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.049> don't<00:00:07.230> know<00:00:07.290> what<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.589> it

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
button if you don't know what that is it

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.009 
button if you don't know what that is it
is<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.280> button<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.760> two<00:00:09.120> blocks<00:00:09.300> above<00:00:09.599> and

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
is a button that is two blocks above and

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.839 
is a button that is two blocks above and
you<00:00:10.170> push<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.740> then<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.099> activates<00:00:11.580> and

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
you push it and then it activates and

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.789 
you push it and then it activates and
then<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.179> also<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> block<00:00:13.620> right

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
then you can also have a block right

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.310 
then you can also have a block right
there<00:00:13.830> let's<00:00:14.700> say<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:14.969> wanted<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
there let's say you wanted to have the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.760 
there let's say you wanted to have the
ground<00:00:16.800> be<00:00:17.490> around<00:00:18.170> so<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> ground<00:00:19.650> is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
ground be around so like the ground is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
ground be around so like the ground is
at<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.039> level<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.520> button<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
at this level the button is to up and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.630 
at this level the button is to up and
you<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.170> still<00:00:22.410> activate<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.980> piston<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
you can still activate the piston and it

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.939 
you can still activate the piston and it
still<00:00:23.880> turns<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.480> off<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
still turns it on and off this is the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.790 
still turns it on and off this is the
design<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> made<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.300> based<00:00:27.570> off<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:28.170> we

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
design that I made it's based off of we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.630 
design that I made it's based off of we
fly<00:00:29.160> over<00:00:29.369> meow<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.980> looked<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.099> YouTube<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
fly over meow I looked on YouTube and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.080 
fly over meow I looked on YouTube and
saw<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.329> design<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.200> uses<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
saw that this design but this one uses a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.040 
saw that this design but this one uses a
torch<00:00:36.090> clock<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:38.239> I<00:00:39.239> don't<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:39.930> they

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
torch clock and I don't know if they

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.260 
torch clock and I don't know if they
fixed<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> possibility<00:00:41.730> that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
fixed it but there is a possibility that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.400 
fixed it but there is a possibility that
this<00:00:42.360> could<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.660> stuck<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> stuff

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
this could get stuck like a stuff

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.220 
this could get stuck like a stuff
repeater<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> burned-out<00:00:44.670> torch<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.750> i<00:00:45.780> made

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
repeater or a burned-out torch so i made

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
repeater or a burned-out torch so i made
the<00:00:46.469> design<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.039> hoppers<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:47.969> it's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the design with the hoppers because it's

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.729 
the design with the hoppers because it's
much<00:00:48.510> easier<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> don't<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> worry

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
much easier and you don't have to worry

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.189 
much easier and you don't have to worry
about<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.309> whole<00:00:50.820> clock<00:00:51.420> thing<00:00:51.690> lagging<00:00:52.079> at

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
about the whole clock thing lagging at

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
about the whole clock thing lagging at
your<00:00:52.320> computer<00:00:52.829> or<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.640> server<00:00:54.000> whatever

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
your computer or the server whatever

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
your computer or the server whatever
you're<00:00:54.510> playing<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.980> very<00:00:56.129> very<00:00:56.430> nice

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you have the button to up so if you're

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.330 
you have the button to up so if you're
riding<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.170> horse<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.559> much<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:58.949> acceptable

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

just<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> floating<00:01:05.189> button<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
just a floating button and then if you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.109 
just a floating button and then if you
have<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.360> piston<00:01:06.720> floor<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:08.119> dispenser

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
have like piston floor or a dispenser

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.399 
have like piston floor or a dispenser
floor<00:01:09.330> furnace<00:01:09.720> floor<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.380> just

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
floor furnace floor so it all just

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.469 
floor furnace floor so it all just
blends<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.520> looks<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:12.150> cool<00:01:12.270> so

blends in it looks very very cool so
let's<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.810> ahead<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> build<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> real<00:01:14.130> quick

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
let's go ahead and build it real quick

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.460 
let's go ahead and build it real quick
what<00:01:15.509> you're<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.290> have

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
what you're going to want to do is have

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.060 
what you're going to want to do is have
a<00:01:16.770> block<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.330> just<00:01:18.330> put<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> compared

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
a block here just put a compared

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.770 
a block here just put a compared
comparator<00:01:20.070> facing<00:01:20.460> outwards<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
comparator facing outwards and then you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.170 
comparator facing outwards and then you
want<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.710> hoppers<00:01:23.159> facing<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:24.090> each

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
want to have to hoppers facing into each

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.620 
want to have to hoppers facing into each
other<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:25.549> two<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.450> want

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
other so one two and then you just want

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.120 
other so one two and then you just want
to<00:01:27.689> put<00:01:27.840> an<00:01:27.960> item<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.380> there<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.920> we'll<00:01:29.100> just

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to put an item into there so we'll just

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.640 
to put an item into there so we'll just
do<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> piece<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.909> lime<00:01:30.420> bowl<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.500> just

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
do a piece of lime bowl so then it just

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.649 
do a piece of lime bowl so then it just
clocks<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.250> turns<00:01:32.430> us<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.119> off<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.540> then

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
clocks and turns us on and off and then

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.499 
clocks and turns us on and off and then
we<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.079> put<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:35.000> up<00:01:36.000> here<00:01:38.060> want<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
we want to put a up here want to have a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
we want to put a up here want to have a
sticky<00:01:39.900> piston<00:01:40.079> facing<00:01:40.500> downwards<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.310> then

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
sticky piston facing downwards and then

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.340 
sticky piston facing downwards and then
you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.670> put<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> block<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.329> redstone<00:01:42.960> right

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you can put a block of redstone right

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.630 
you can put a block of redstone right
there<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.070> used<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.399> power

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
there that's going to be used to power

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480 
there that's going to be used to power
the<00:01:44.790> stuff<00:01:45.509> below<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.310> have

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the stuff below it and then you can have

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969 
the stuff below it and then you can have
a<00:01:47.700> button<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.710> rid<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
a button up here and get rid of the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.260 
a button up here and get rid of the
middle<00:01:50.159> block<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.090> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
middle block if you want or have it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.870 
middle block if you want or have it
there<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.320> push<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> down<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
there and then just push it down and it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.280 
there and then just push it down and it
turns<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> reason<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.020> works<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
turns on and the reason it works is

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
turns on and the reason it works is
because<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:56.130> keeps<00:01:56.430> updating<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.270> block

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
because this keeps updating this block

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
because this keeps updating this block
which<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.899> below<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.140> piston<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.770> it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
which is below the piston so it

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160 
which is below the piston so it
technically<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> keeps<00:01:59.759> updating<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.600> piston

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
technically it keeps updating the piston

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.399 
technically it keeps updating the piston
to<00:02:01.890> power<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.390> Java<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
to power it and then because Java is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.560 
to power it and then because Java is
weird<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.030> push<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.540> button

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
weird like that then you push the button

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
weird like that then you push the button
then<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.079> updates<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> piston<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.160> down<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
then it updates the piston and down it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.250 
then it updates the piston and down it
goes<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.860> quick<00:02:11.120> very<00:02:12.120> compact<00:02:12.510> lag

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
goes so that is a quick very compact lag

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.030 
goes so that is a quick very compact lag
