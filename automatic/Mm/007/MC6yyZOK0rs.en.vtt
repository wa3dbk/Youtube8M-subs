00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
time and get into the review now the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.420 
time and get into the review now the
first<00:00:16.170> thing<00:00:16.379> about<00:00:16.410> these<00:00:16.710> speakers<00:00:16.980> design

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
first thing about these speakers design

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.070 
first thing about these speakers design
is<00:00:17.640> how<00:00:17.760> they're<00:00:17.970> actually<00:00:18.390> both<00:00:18.630> raised

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
is how they're actually both raised

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.929 
is how they're actually both raised
they're<00:00:19.560> pointing<00:00:20.070> at<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.699> believe

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
they're pointing at you and I believe

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.220 
they're pointing at you and I believe
that<00:00:21.090> makes<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.359> great<00:00:21.570> deal<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> difference

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
that makes a great deal of difference

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.410 
that makes a great deal of difference
when<00:00:22.380> outputting<00:00:22.980> audio<00:00:23.340> there<00:00:23.910> really<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.390> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
when outputting audio there really is a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.849 
when outputting audio there really is a
canny<00:00:24.779> bit<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.080> weight<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.439> them<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.680> well<00:00:25.830> so

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
canny bit of weight to them as well so

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.259 
canny bit of weight to them as well so
they'll<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.430> setting<00:00:26.699> very<00:00:26.939> pretty

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
they'll be setting very pretty
