there<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> background<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.729> case

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
there in the background just in case

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.370 
there in the background just in case
there<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.210> anything<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.689> need<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:57.990> take<00:01:58.200> off

there is anything I need to take off
with<00:01:58.590> tape<00:01:59.509> because<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.810> will<00:02:00.960> create<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
with tape because that will create a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.420 
with tape because that will create a
bubble<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.070> those<00:02:02.430> are<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.790> annoying

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
bubble and those are really annoying

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.760 
so I'm just lining it up first before I
apply<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.539> can<00:02:08.929> get<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.860> grasp<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.600> the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770
