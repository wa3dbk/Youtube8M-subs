00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
necessarily just use whips and stops but

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.729 
necessarily just use whips and stops but
that<00:03:02.700> brings<00:03:02.850> me<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.330> another<00:03:03.360> point<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:04.140> yes

in<00:03:09.569> PvP<00:03:10.410> by<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.370> couple<00:03:11.510> specs<00:03:12.510> or<00:03:12.660> let

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
in PvP by just a couple specs or let

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.080 
in PvP by just a couple specs or let
alone<00:03:13.080> one<00:03:13.500> spec<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.130> if<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.489> got<00:03:14.640> killed<00:03:14.880> by

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
alone one spec so if you got killed by

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.449 
alone one spec so if you got killed by
one<00:03:15.360> spec<00:03:15.720> then<00:03:15.989> things<00:03:16.470> are<00:03:16.709> kind<00:03:17.310> of

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
one spec then things are kind of

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.910 
one spec then things are kind of
powerful<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.330> little<00:03:18.569> bit<00:03:18.660> over<00:03:18.900> powerful<00:03:19.410> but

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
powerful a little bit over powerful but

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.890 
powerful a little bit over powerful but
then<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.640> basically<00:03:20.910> say<00:03:21.390> we'll<00:03:21.720> get

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
then you can basically say we'll get

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.090 
then you can basically say we'll get
your<00:03:21.989> hit<00:03:22.170> points<00:03:22.319> level<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.859> or

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
your hit points level up or

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.530 
your hit points level up or
constitutional<00:03:23.850> level<00:03:23.940> whatever<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.359> hell

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
constitutional level whatever the hell

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.210 
constitutional level whatever the hell
it's<00:03:24.720> called<00:03:24.959> whatever<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.500> want<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.950> call<00:03:26.160> it

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
it's called whatever you want to call it

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.280 
it's called whatever you want to call it
but<00:03:26.489> then<00:03:26.880> again<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.239> really<00:03:27.900> shouldn't<00:03:28.200> have

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
but then again you really shouldn't have

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.220 
but then again you really shouldn't have
to<00:03:28.799> get<00:03:28.980> your<00:03:29.130> HP<00:03:29.700> level<00:03:30.390> up<00:03:30.510> because<00:03:30.900> things

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
to get your HP level up because things

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.190 
to get your HP level up because things
really<00:03:31.650> shouldn't<00:03:32.160> be<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:33.030> power<00:03:33.690> but<00:03:33.930> there

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
really shouldn't be that power but there

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.860 
really shouldn't be that power but there
is<00:03:34.440> one<00:03:35.100> sword<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.630> get<00:03:36.840> from

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
is one sword that you get from

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
basically like this do you like that

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.469

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
her HP is only like 86 like mine is then

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.270 
her HP is only like 86 like mine is then
you<00:04:27.360> kind<00:04:27.659> of<00:04:27.780> need<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.990> press<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.800> eat<00:04:28.979> food

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
you kind of need to press the eat food

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.610 
you kind of need to press the eat food
like

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
like

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.010 
like
two<00:04:29.800> times<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.520> you're<00:04:30.820> already<00:04:31.120> down<00:04:31.479> two

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
two times and you're already down two

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.580 
two times and you're already down two
pieces<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.620> food<00:04:32.949> so<00:04:33.460> therefore<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.510> not<00:04:35.139> so

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
pieces of food so therefore it's not so

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.700 
pieces of food so therefore it's not so
good<00:04:36.070> sometimes<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:37.300> then<00:04:37.419> again<00:04:37.710> having

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
good sometimes but then again having

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.040 
good sometimes but then again having
over<00:04:39.070> power<00:04:39.280> weapons<00:04:39.850> could<00:04:40.389> have<00:04:40.660> its<00:04:40.900> ups

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
over power weapons could have its ups

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.260 
over power weapons could have its ups
and<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.860> could<00:04:41.979> have<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.220> sounds<00:04:42.760> like<00:04:43.030> for

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
and it could have it sounds like for

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.780 
and it could have it sounds like for
example<00:04:43.419> new<00:04:44.260> boss<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.800> on<00:04:44.919> runescape<00:04:45.520> and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
example new boss is on runescape and

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.879 
example new boss is on runescape and
harder<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.449> kill<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:47.110> therefore<00:04:47.500> they<00:04:47.650> have<00:04:47.770> to

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
harder to kill so therefore they have to

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.500 
harder to kill so therefore they have to
come<00:04:48.040> out<00:04:48.160> with<00:04:48.280> better<00:04:48.520> weapons<00:04:48.790> but<00:04:49.389> then

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
come out with better weapons but then

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.469 
come out with better weapons but then
again<00:04:49.660> it<00:04:50.290> would<00:04:50.530> be<00:04:50.710> really<00:04:51.190> funny<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.940> see

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
again it would be really funny to see

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.590 
again it would be really funny to see
people<00:04:53.169> just<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:53.979> know<00:04:54.160> kill<00:04:54.820> bosses<00:04:55.150> with

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
still being overpowered and I pretty

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.910 
still being overpowered and I pretty
sure<00:06:39.490> runescape<00:06:40.090> lowered

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
sure runescape lowered

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.340 
sure runescape lowered
this<00:06:41.220> spec<00:06:41.640> on<00:06:41.820> dragon<00:06:42.240> claws<00:06:42.450> is<00:06:42.750> just<00:06:42.960> one

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
this spec on dragon claws is just one

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.980 
this spec on dragon claws is just one
speck<00:06:43.770> on<00:06:43.800> the<00:06:43.980> bar<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.670> special<00:06:45.120> bar<00:06:45.300> is<00:06:45.540> just

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
speck on the bar the special bar is just

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.350 
speck on the bar the special bar is just
one<00:06:46.260> speck<00:06:46.620> it<00:06:46.890> used<00:06:47.160> to<00:06:47.250> be<00:06:47.430> two<00:06:47.700> specs<00:06:48.060> or<00:06:48.270> I

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
one speck it used to be two specs or I

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.990 
one speck it used to be two specs or I
pretty<00:06:49.290> sure<00:06:49.560> used<00:06:49.950> to<00:06:50.100> be<00:06:50.220> two<00:06:50.430> specs<00:06:50.760> when<00:06:50.940> I

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
pretty sure used to be two specs when I

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.610 
pretty sure used to be two specs when I
had<00:06:51.390> them<00:06:51.570> when<00:06:51.660> they<00:06:51.780> first<00:06:52.020> came<00:06:52.200> out<00:06:52.260> but

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
had them when they first came out but

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.440 
had them when they first came out but
now<00:06:52.950> i'm<00:06:53.190> pretty<00:06:53.430> sure<00:06:53.670> they<00:06:53.910> lowered<00:06:54.300> it<00:06:54.420> to

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
now i'm pretty sure they lowered it to

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.930 
now i'm pretty sure they lowered it to
one<00:06:54.810> speck<00:06:55.140> and<00:06:55.350> to<00:06:55.830> be<00:06:55.980> honest<00:06:56.370> they<00:06:56.700> can't

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
one speck and to be honest they can't

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.760 
one speck and to be honest they can't
really<00:06:57.120> lower<00:06:57.570> any<00:06:57.870> more<00:06:58.110> stuff<00:06:58.350> but<00:06:58.650> there

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
really lower any more stuff but there

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.740 
really lower any more stuff but there
are<00:06:58.980> going<00:06:59.310> to<00:06:59.430> be<00:06:59.550> new<00:06:59.820> weapons<00:07:00.300> coming<00:07:00.540> out

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
are going to be new weapons coming out

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.050 
are going to be new weapons coming out
in<00:07:00.900> the<00:07:00.990> future<00:07:01.380> so<00:07:01.920> does<00:07:02.220> that<00:07:02.250> mean<00:07:02.580> they

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
in the future so does that mean they

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.930 
in the future so does that mean they
might<00:07:03.330> have<00:07:03.600> to<00:07:03.810> increase<00:07:04.560> uh<00:07:04.920> hit<00:07:05.490> points

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
might have to increase uh hit points

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.570 
might have to increase uh hit points
maybe<00:07:06.210> to<00:07:06.510> like<00:07:06.740> 120<00:07:07.740> or<00:07:08.010> something<00:07:08.400> like<00:07:08.520> that
