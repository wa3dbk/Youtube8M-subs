at one point we make up is the camera at
the<00:00:40.860> top<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.879> microphone<00:00:42.360> is

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the top and I think the microphone is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.450 
the top and I think the microphone is
right<00:00:42.660> next<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.010> see<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
right next to it here we can see the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.270 
right next to it here we can see the
nice<00:00:45.090> chiclet<00:00:45.600> keyboard<00:00:45.780> which<00:00:46.350> feels<00:00:46.590> really

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
nice chiclet keyboard which feels really

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
nice chiclet keyboard which feels really
good<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.760> bending<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.539> little<00:00:48.570> bit<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:48.960> you

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
good it's bending a little bit but you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.439 
good it's bending a little bit but you
can't<00:00:49.379> actually<00:00:49.770> hear<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> difference<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.270> if

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
can't actually hear the difference so if

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.630 
can't actually hear the difference so if
you're<00:00:51.600> not<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.170> strong<00:00:52.530> type<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
you're not a really strong type that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000 
you're not a really strong type that
doesn't<00:00:54.030> matter<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.620> buttons
