00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
now to my knowledge I believe this

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.320 
now to my knowledge I believe this
lipstick<00:00:24.300> collection<00:00:24.539> line<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.880> permanent<00:00:26.880> on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
lipstick collection line is permanent on

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.000 
lipstick collection line is permanent on
the<00:00:27.570> display<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.230> does<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.529> say<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the display it does not say that the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.529 
the display it does not say that the
limited<00:00:29.310> edition<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:29.760> anything<00:00:29.939> Maybelline

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
limited edition or anything Maybelline

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.240 
limited edition or anything Maybelline
hasn't<00:00:30.929> stated<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.710> limited<00:00:32.130> edition

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
hasn't stated that it's limited edition

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.479 
hasn't stated that it's limited edition
so<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:33.450> assuming<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.170> permanent<00:00:34.710> if

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.310 
so I'm assuming that it's permanent if
there's<00:00:35.730> any<00:00:35.940> update<00:00:36.360> or<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.899> guys<00:00:37.050> know

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and I'll do this swatch here so that

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.370 
and I'll do this swatch here so that
one's<00:02:08.879> right<00:02:09.060> there<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
one's right there you can see that

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.950 
one's right there you can see that
a<00:02:10.530> shade<00:02:11.010> or<00:02:11.250> two<00:02:11.280> deeper<00:02:11.940> but<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> still<00:02:12.720> has<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
a shade or two deeper but it still has a

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.650 
a shade or two deeper but it still has a
pink<00:02:13.470> undertone<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.400> again<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> think<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.480> like

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
pink undertone but again I think I like

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.150 
pink undertone but again I think I like
it<00:02:15.690> because<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.260> deeper<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.740> one<00:02:16.950> again

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
it because it's deeper this one again

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.820 
it because it's deeper this one again

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
was too pale 915 is too pale for me but

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.900 
was too pale 915 is too pale for me but
920<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.460> like<00:02:20.820> probably<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:22.070> my<00:02:23.070> skin<00:02:23.670> tone

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
920 is like probably like my skin tone

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.690 
920 is like probably like my skin tone
but<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.180> little<00:02:24.390> bit<00:02:24.540> more<00:02:24.570> pink<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.520> it's<00:02:26.520> very

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
but a little bit more pink so it's very

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.760 
but a little bit more pink so it's very
nice<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.240> really<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.590> how

it's<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.040> deeper<00:02:29.400> shade<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:30.090> my<00:02:30.210> medium<00:02:30.720> skin

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
it's a deeper shade for my medium skin

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.630 
it's a deeper shade for my medium skin
tone<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.320> find<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.860> deeper<00:02:32.160> shades<00:02:32.370> work

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
tone I find that the deeper shades work

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.870 
tone I find that the deeper shades work

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
guys can see how it pulls a little bit

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.760 
guys can see how it pulls a little bit
more<00:02:57.990> Brown<00:02:58.910> compared<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.030> these<00:03:00.180> two<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.410> do

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
more Brown compared to these two so I do

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.860 
more Brown compared to these two so I do
like<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.430> shade<00:03:02.820> but<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.360> don't<00:03:03.600> know<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:03.780> I

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
like the shade but I don't know if I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.750 
like the shade but I don't know if I
like<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.260> tone<00:03:04.470> like<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> undertone<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.580> I

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
like the tone like the undertone of it I

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.490 
like the tone like the undertone of it I
guess<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.270> little<00:03:06.480> more<00:03:06.600> Brown<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.110> usually

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
guess a little more Brown and usually

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.300 
guess a little more Brown and usually
for<00:03:07.680> me<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.430> more<00:03:08.820> Brown<00:03:09.350> um<00:03:10.410> shades

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
for me I like the more Brown um shades

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.000 
for me I like the more Brown um shades
but<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.060> don't<00:03:12.780> know<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.470> can't<00:03:13.680> lay<00:03:13.770> decide

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
but I don't know I just can't lay decide

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.550 
but I don't know I just can't lay decide
if<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.460> do<00:03:14.610> like<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.910> one<00:03:14.970> or<00:03:15.240> not

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
if I really do like this one or not

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.920

that's that I mean you guys can judge as

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.780 
that's that I mean you guys can judge as
if<00:03:19.170> -<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.650> would<00:03:19.740> work<00:03:19.920> for<00:03:20.100> your<00:03:20.250> skin<00:03:20.460> tone<00:03:20.640> or

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
not but the next one here is 935 and as

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.930 
not but the next one here is 935 and as
the<00:03:24.660> shades<00:03:24.960> go<00:03:25.260> up<00:03:25.770> in<00:03:26.040> number<00:03:26.430> they<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
the shades go up in number they get a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.220 
the shades go up in number they get a
little<00:03:27.300> bit<00:03:27.420> darker<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.810> they<00:03:28.080> definitely

little bit darker and they definitely

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.580 
little bit darker and they definitely
change<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.860> tone<00:03:29.070> also<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.210> this<00:03:30.750> one<00:03:31.020> here

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
change in tone also so this one here

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.230 
change in tone also so this one here
looks<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.800> this<00:03:34.800> one<00:03:34.980> pulls<00:03:35.220> pink<00:03:35.670> but

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
looks like that this one pulls pink but

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.360 
looks like that this one pulls pink but
it's<00:03:36.420> darker<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:37.860> hard

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
it's darker so it's so hard

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.330
