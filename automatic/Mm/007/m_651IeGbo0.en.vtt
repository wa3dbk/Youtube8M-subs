every five to six days um when i first

every five to six days um when i first
began<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:17.789> hard

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
began to that it was really really hard

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.090 
began to that it was really really hard
for<00:00:18.240> me<00:00:18.300> because<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:19.080> hungry<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.710> weak<00:00:19.920> all

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
for me because I was hungry and weak all

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.370 
for me because I was hungry and weak all
the<00:00:20.279> time<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.520> was<00:00:20.820> even<00:00:20.970> sleeping<00:00:21.539> during<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the time I was even sleeping during the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.310 
the time I was even sleeping during the
day<00:00:22.560> sometimes<00:00:23.130> but<00:00:23.810> after<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> while<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.080> got

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
day sometimes but after a while I got

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.870 
day sometimes but after a while I got
used<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.189> think<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.580> really

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
used to it and I think it's really

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.210 
used to it and I think it's really
really<00:00:27.090> working<00:00:27.449> I've<00:00:27.630> never<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:28.220> lost

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
really working I've never really lost

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.260 
really working I've never really lost
weight<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.550> fast<00:00:29.939> before<00:00:30.060> um<00:00:31.910> I'm<00:00:32.910> using

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
weight this fast before um I'm using

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.290 
weight this fast before um I'm using
something<00:00:33.630> called<00:00:33.989> keto<00:00:34.739> sticks<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:35.460> this

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
something called keto sticks well this

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.700 
something called keto sticks well this
brand<00:00:36.570> doesn't<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:37.020> call<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.559> but

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
brand doesn't really call it that but

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.360 
brand doesn't really call it that but
it's<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.360> it's<00:00:39.980> basically<00:00:40.980> lets<00:00:41.250> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it's like this it's basically lets you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.729 
it's like this it's basically lets you
know<00:00:41.550> how<00:00:41.579> much<00:00:41.820> ketones<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> urine

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
know how much ketones are in the urine

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
know how much ketones are in the urine
so<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.149> losing<00:00:45.450> weight

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
so you can know if you're losing weight

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150 
so you can know if you're losing weight
or<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.110> i<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.379> got<00:00:46.530> these<00:00:46.680> yesterday<00:00:47.129> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
or not so i just got these yesterday I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.470

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
think there's an irk with every day out

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.889 
think there's an irk with every day out
you<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.809> stay<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.410> track<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.300> I<00:00:51.300> also<00:00:51.629> use

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
you to stay on track and I also use

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.529 
you to stay on track and I also use
psyllium<00:00:52.440> husks<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.280> look<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.820> it's

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
psyllium husks which look like this it's

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
psyllium husks which look like this it's
supposed<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.899> keep<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.289> regular<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> that

supposed to keep your regular on to that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
supposed to keep your regular on to that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
well I don't really get that because i

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.929 
well I don't really get that because i
use<00:01:00.390> these<00:01:02.600> my<00:01:03.600> goal<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> lose<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:05.339> forty

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
a difference in the mirror I'm very

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.770 
a difference in the mirror I'm very
happy<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.509> only<00:01:30.659> been

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
happy because you know it's only been

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
happy because you know it's only been
six<00:01:31.110> days<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> Atkins<00:01:32.549> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
six days now I think the Atkins is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.990 
six days now I think the Atkins is
pretty<00:01:32.880> good<00:01:33.060> um<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:35.070> reason<00:01:35.250> why<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> began

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
pretty good um the reason why I began

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.719 
pretty good um the reason why I began
with<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.290> my<00:01:37.439> father<00:01:37.729> he

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
with that is because of my father he

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.310 
with that is because of my father he
told<00:01:39.030> me<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.360> back<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> eighties<00:01:40.140> he

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
told me that back in the eighties he

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.560 
told me that back in the eighties he
went<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.250> he<00:01:41.700> lost<00:01:41.880> 70<00:01:42.329> homes

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
went on with that and he lost 70 homes

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.260 
went on with that and he lost 70 homes
so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.170> figure<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.009> he<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.369> lose<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.970> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so I figure if he can lose that much I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.109 
so I figure if he can lose that much I
can<00:01:45.750> lose<00:01:46.200> 40<00:01:46.890> pounds<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.399> sure<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.030> really

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
can lose 40 pounds for sure if I really

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.510

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
really hope so because I don't like to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.760 
really hope so because I don't like to
work<00:02:05.700> hard<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.150> not<00:02:06.330> use<00:02:06.870> any<00:02:07.050> weight<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.560> I'm

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
work hard and not use any weight so I'm

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.330 
work hard and not use any weight so I'm
going<00:02:07.980> to<00:02:08.090> stick<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:10.470> like<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.920> find<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
going to stick to it's like I find the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.210 
going to stick to it's like I find the
hardest<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.240> sticking<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.320> 20

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
hardest thing is sticking to the 20

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.340 
hardest thing is sticking to the 20
grams<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.580> carbs<00:02:14.940> per<00:02:15.210> day<00:02:15.450> which<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.900> boots

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
grams of carbs per day which is boots

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.310 
grams of carbs per day which is boots
for<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.770> induction<00:02:17.570> it's<00:02:18.570> very<00:02:18.870> hard<00:02:19.170> because

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
for the induction it's very hard because

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.590 
for the induction it's very hard because
I<00:02:19.770> used<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.340> having<00:02:20.580> lots<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.880> bread<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.360> chips

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
I used to having lots of bread and chips

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.780 
I used to having lots of bread and chips
and<00:02:21.810> all<00:02:21.960> those<00:02:22.170> things<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.920> love<00:02:23.580> sugar

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
and all those things that I love sugar

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.330 
and all those things that I love sugar
so<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.450> very<00:02:24.600> hard<00:02:24.900> when<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:26.310> a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
so it's very hard when I can have like a

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.040 
so it's very hard when I can have like a
little<00:02:26.580> sugar<00:02:26.910> free<00:02:27.150> jello<00:02:27.180> sometimes<00:02:27.900> I

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
little sugar free jello sometimes I

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.210 
little sugar free jello sometimes I
think<00:02:28.110> I'm<00:02:28.410> not<00:02:28.590> sure<00:02:28.740> if<00:02:28.830> he<00:02:28.920> said<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.190> should

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
think I'm not sure if he said I should

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.699 
think I'm not sure if he said I should
put<00:02:29.580> how<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.150> find<00:02:30.450> there's<00:02:30.750> no<00:02:30.900> real<00:02:31.200> carbs<00:02:31.590> in

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
put how we find there's no real carbs in

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.490 
put how we find there's no real carbs in
there<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.010> i<00:02:32.070> think<00:02:32.160> it's<00:02:32.400> okay<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.290> i<00:02:34.320> have

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
there so i think it's okay so i have

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.280 
there so i think it's okay so i have
that<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.160> i<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.120> okay<00:02:36.420> because<00:02:37.020> I've

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
that and i think it's okay because I've

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.160 
that and i think it's okay because I've
stable<00:02:37.560> losing<00:02:37.770> weight<00:02:38.750> it's<00:02:39.750> not<00:02:39.990> really

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
stable losing weight it's not really

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.740 
stable losing weight it's not really
that<00:02:40.350> satisfying<00:02:40.920> because<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.640> want<00:02:42.030> something

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that satisfying because I want something

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.110 
that satisfying because I want something
more<00:02:42.780> important<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.620> think<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:44.970> can

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
more important I think that I can

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.090 
more important I think that I can
definitely<00:02:45.390> stick<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.140> because<00:02:46.470> I'm

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
definitely stick to it because I'm

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.699 
definitely stick to it because I'm
losing<00:02:47.730> weight<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:52.110> know<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.350> else<00:02:52.470> really

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
losing weight you know what else really

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.890 
losing weight you know what else really
