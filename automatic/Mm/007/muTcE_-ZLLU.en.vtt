00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.160
 but to all and beni is a new video in 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.469
 my channel I am meca krauser and as 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.570
 always bringing them a new video and 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.250
 good people in this case are going to have 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.880
 background gameplay a part of the software 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.680
 3 that they are going to see a bitch like that is a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.230
 bitch this time we did not put the 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.050
 Putiza put us the putiza and the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.660
 problem here is that you do not use the problem 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.770
 it is not that it has happened, not that it is not 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.370
 that really won us but as 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.949
 they did it the truth is that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.899
 I think they went away if they went over 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.650
 because they were also a clan they were a clan 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.910
 this called tour that if I'm not wrong 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.070
 and it was not the only game that touched me 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 so in fact I played I had to play several 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.220
 games with this clan was playing 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.830
 Equal games doing it by teams 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.070
 and now see that the whole team has 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:05.370
 cropped and retro lancer 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.620
 I do not know if it's because they play like this or if 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.479
 it was just for trolling or whatever 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.080
 but the truth is that not only they 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.240
 they were like that 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.690
 I played several games and they were 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.350
 playing equipment for if not and I do not know is 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.450
 like to be alerted to say wow care 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.800
 because go software 3 are making it 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.700
 To take 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.500
 to a place where we do not want this 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.480
 strong course or if it was in its infancy 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.990
 there were many cut out there was a lot 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.780
 retro lancer and it was not like that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.170
 I really do not know what is due I want 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.570
 think now that george min 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.850
 this one went completely to the shit and 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 no one is playing it and then all the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.610
 people who play gift software by fashion 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.100
 because I played the last game I do not know what 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.810
 that is in gears of war 3 went to 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.670
 george mind that are generally the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.040
 people who do not like to play well leave 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.650
 because those of us who are truly fans 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.570
 we are followers of the saga since 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.390
 previous games we do not always have a 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.000
 different game style but I do not know 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.850
 it's this kind of people who like to play 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.250
 and a software by fashion already got bored of 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.980
 georg well let's go back to 3 and that 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.560
 people started to migrate and that 's it 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.300
 coming back I do not know if that's happening 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.850
 but but be careful not 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.030
 the truth and strong verse was super 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.920
 nice to play it a few months ago this 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.260
 comes from recently to I do not play a no 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.820
 I was playing a lot of software 3 so 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.230
 I would like comments to come and 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.680
 you have touched many 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.130
 games like that or what wave 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.160
 because this is extremely unpleasant 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.160
 I say they are weapons in the game you can not 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.800
 understand what good that say use 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.420
 everyone is free to play as he wants 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.580
 but here the whole team was like 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.930
 that the army of retro lancer the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.750
 reported army 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.670
 and well obviously I was playing alone 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.629
 we were separated the whole team if you 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.219
 you have a good team a good 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.439
 organization so good sometimes you can 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.980
 like to face this kind of 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.980
 situations 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.010
 but this time not then it was something 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.580
 extremely castrating unpleasant 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.030
 and I do not know people the truth I hope that 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.180
 that for three do not pass it like this because 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.819
 she the game was pretty good is 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.890
 pretty quiet it was like the gears 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.659
 of war that we all wanted 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.430
 when it came out gears of war 3 remember 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.640
 that was criticized a lot was criticized a lot 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.769
 for this aspect and the last moment 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.690
 like everything is calmer when 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.870
 came out george men we told you cock 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.609
 we had a game that we criticized and 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.530
 it really was very good then all 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.720
 it's like we really saw what it was 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.209
 software 3 and we were playing and 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.400
 the software 3 so that suddenly 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.519
 start to pass this kind of thing I do not know 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.139
 that's what makes me out of the blue and the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.700
 indexes people who want to come to harm 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.370
 the game does not 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.019
 everyone was already watching in epics 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.790
 although what we wanted as 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.989
 we liked the games and everything like to 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.709
 they start coming to be doing 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.629
 this kind of actions hopefully and has 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.040
 also to troll for things for 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.600
 issues that the trolley have 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.930
 already have wanted as well as that 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.669
 It's like laughing a bit but it's a bit 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.100
 worrying because nothing else to be this 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.920
 team no no nothing else was this game or 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.240
 be with this clan I played three games 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.449
 and they were all the same 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.160
 there were other people who like 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.889
 They are like that and the problem is that they do not 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.569
 it's only in fast games this is in 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.610
 Ranked matches in fast games 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.689
 by not doing it by teams that was the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.739
 only way I played 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:49.620
 so people already know hopefully hopefully this 

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:52.350
 so be it 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.970
 temporarily, do not leave the 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.780
 comments please if you guys 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.430
 have played a little more in these in 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.650
 these days if the games actually 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.419
 the nanas and I got a bad luck one 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.950
 terrible night and I had fun playing with 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.500
 pure pure bastard retro lancer or 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.060

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.980
 subscribed for more videos of this type 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.550
 there are people who forgave bone 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.410
 really the truth if not no longer 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.400
 like the yoyo and mayÃ¡ns another game if 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.550
 you but are your players 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.230
 temporary in the saga of going but not 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.600
 they let ruin a game that the truth 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.470
 the real fans were already very 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.270
 happy with how they were but good 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.200
 Needless to say we are people up 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.200
