 Gomez lobbing the goalkeeper
and<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.489> thought<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:22.970> game<00:03:23.209> was<00:03:23.540> going<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.959> be

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
and I thought this game was going to be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.620 
and I thought this game was going to be
very<00:03:24.470> very<00:03:25.160> safe<00:03:25.670> for<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.120> second<00:03:26.450> half

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
very very safe for in the second half

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.259
