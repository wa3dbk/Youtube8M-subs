00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
of people have been asking why the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.190 
of people have been asking why the
reason<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.700> camera<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:54.420> capable<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
reason is this camera is not capable of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.309 
reason is this camera is not capable of
outputting<00:01:55.679> full<00:01:56.490> 1080p<00:01:57.170> while<00:01:58.170> are

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
outputting full 1080p while are

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.990 
outputting full 1080p while are
recording<00:01:59.599> 1080p<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.159> SD<00:02:02.520> card<00:02:02.549> over<00:02:02.909> the

recording 1080p to the SD card over the
compact<00:02:03.360> flash<00:02:03.539> card<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.709> can't<00:02:05.069> output

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
compact flash card so you can't output

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.809 
compact flash card so you can't output
1080p<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.929> only<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:08.250> recording
