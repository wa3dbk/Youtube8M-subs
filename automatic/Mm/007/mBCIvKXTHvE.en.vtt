here<00:01:17.479> we<00:01:17.570> got<00:01:17.689> something

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.020 

let's<00:01:22.600> get<00:01:22.780> inside<00:01:23.549> bring<00:01:24.549> over

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.110 

we've<00:01:28.390> got<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.750> be<00:01:28.870> able<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:30.520> gotta<00:01:30.850> be

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
we've got to be able to just gotta be

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:50.100 
we've got to be able to just gotta be
they<00:01:31.810> use<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.700> had<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:48.910> use<00:01:49.210> bottommost<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.900> left

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
they use you had a use bottommost a left

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.470 
they use you had a use bottommost a left
mouse<00:01:50.350> button<00:01:50.410> I<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:57.070> I'll<00:01:57.160> skip<00:01:57.450> some<00:01:58.450> of

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
mouse button I think I'll skip some of

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.090 
mouse button I think I'll skip some of
the<00:01:58.750> parts<00:01:59.050> very<00:01:59.200> much<00:01:59.440> yes<00:01:59.620> running<00:01:59.979> around

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
the parts very much yes running around

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.280 
the parts very much yes running around
so<00:02:00.850> might<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.060> just<00:02:01.360> skipped<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:02.020> didn't

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
so might you just skipped it you didn't

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.889 
so might you just skipped it you didn't
know<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.250> show<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.580> inside

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.350 

maybe<00:02:11.350> here<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> shake<00:02:11.920> your<00:02:12.160> mouth<00:02:12.520> could<00:02:13.270> have

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
maybe here I shake your mouth could have

00:02:13.360 --> 00:03:06.210 
maybe here I shake your mouth could have
been<00:02:13.510> something<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:13.900> there

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:18.750 

so<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.280> think<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:08.650> taking<00:03:09.650> inspiration<00:03:09.950> from

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.520 

I've<00:03:19.760> seen<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.940> looks<00:03:23.210> similar<00:03:24.250> certain<00:03:25.250> ways

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
I've seen it looks similar certain ways

00:03:26.530 --> 00:04:00.730

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
stick figures can't start getting

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.100
