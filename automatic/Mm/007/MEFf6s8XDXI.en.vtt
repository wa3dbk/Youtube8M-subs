really<00:00:39.470> good<00:00:39.650> and<00:00:40.550> that's<00:00:40.790> definitely<00:00:40.970> what

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
really good and that's definitely what

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.740 
really good and that's definitely what
you<00:00:41.330> learn<00:00:41.650> working<00:00:42.650> on<00:00:42.739> a<00:00:42.770> counter

I<00:00:45.070> can<00:00:46.070> kind<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.430> see<00:00:46.700> that<00:00:46.940> a<00:00:46.970> 50s<00:00:47.720> winged

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
I can kind of see that a 50s winged

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.170 
I can kind of see that a 50s winged
eyeliner<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:48.590> coming<00:00:48.860> back<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.910> think<00:00:50.000> it's

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
eyeliner is coming back and I think it's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.310 
eyeliner is coming back and I think it's
going<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.360> come<00:00:50.480> back<00:00:50.600> full<00:00:50.810> force<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.200> it's

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
going to come back full force and it's

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.960 
going to come back full force and it's
going<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.500> be<00:00:51.560> quite<00:00:51.739> graphic<00:00:51.950> as<00:00:52.430> graphic

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
going to be quite graphic as graphic

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.549 
going to be quite graphic as graphic
there<00:00:53.210> was<00:00:53.300> graphic<00:00:53.600> brows<00:00:53.840> last<00:00:54.080> season<00:00:54.410> I

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
there was graphic brows last season I

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.810 
there was graphic brows last season I
think<00:00:54.980> now<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:55.309> going<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.489> be<00:00:55.580> a<00:00:55.610> graphic

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
think now it's going to be a graphic

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.810 
think now it's going to be a graphic
winged<00:00:56.239> eyeliner<00:00:56.830> and<00:00:57.830> I<00:00:58.040> also<00:00:58.280> think<00:00:58.640> for<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
winged eyeliner and I also think for the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.680 
winged eyeliner and I also think for the
people<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.180> don't<00:00:59.330> want<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.510> wear<00:00:59.660> that

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
people that don't want to wear that

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.600 
people that don't want to wear that
there's<00:01:00.380> going<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.559> be<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.710> really<00:01:01.129> nice<00:01:01.250> sort

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
there's going to be a really nice sort

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.180 
there's going to be a really nice sort
of<00:01:01.730> tone-on-tone<00:01:02.690> kind<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.440> trend<00:01:03.739> where<00:01:04.040> it's

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
of tone-on-tone kind of trend where it's

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.270 
of tone-on-tone kind of trend where it's
like<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:05.449> beige<00:01:06.020> eye<00:01:06.260> with<00:01:06.500> a<00:01:06.530> beige<00:01:06.770> lip<00:01:07.070> and

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
especially it'll work well with

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.500 
especially it'll work well with
contouring<00:01:11.840> if<00:01:11.990> that's<00:01:12.170> your<00:01:12.350> thing

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.870 
victim of this is dark foundation
thinking<00:01:20.330> I'm<00:01:20.420> gonna<00:01:20.570> get<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:20.960> tan<00:01:21.200> from<00:01:21.440> it<00:01:21.650> or

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
thinking I'm gonna get a tan from it or

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.620 
thinking I'm gonna get a tan from it or
thinking<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.000> it's<00:01:23.120> going<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.270> make<00:01:23.420> me<00:01:23.540> look

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630

a bit orange and I think you should just
use<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> bronzer<00:01:31.460> instead

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
use a bronzer instead

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.260 
use a bronzer instead
