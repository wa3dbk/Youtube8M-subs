00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.880 
terms and i agree i think first of all i
think<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> point<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> being<00:00:52.170> lost<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.590> much<00:00:52.620> as

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
think the point is being lost as much as

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.799 
think the point is being lost as much as
this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.489> possibly<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.180> bridge<00:00:54.390> back<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
this is is possibly a bridge back to the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.389 
this is is possibly a bridge back to the
National<00:00:55.170> Hockey<00:00:55.320> League<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.680> think<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
National Hockey League I think the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.830
