00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.299
 with these wonderful prawns because 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.080
 they are literally wonderful we do 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.480
 of the very simple pepper prawns la 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.250
 recipe of an incredible difficulty no 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.960
 I'm just kidding 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:29.519
 go to clean them detach the head 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.519
 then we remove the carapace so we take off 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.810
 until the end 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.140
 here we repeat the operation also 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.140
 for others 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.640
 here it is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.449
 our shrimp are ready now let's go 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.219
 to remove the intestine so let's take 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.960
 a small knife 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.299
 we do as it will hold engraving 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.729
 especially practically using 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:14.680
 we do this little knife 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:17.350
 I know we see it in a delicate way and 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.330
 straiano here we are taking one 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.780
 iron pan 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.780
 we light a round of oil 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.880
 as you can see, no rome is voting 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.210
 no seasoning must be the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.640
 pure shrimp we take an orange a 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:42.159
 grapefruit and online on which it is already smoking 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 so it's perfect we take away slightly 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.569
 fire because now it's really too much 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.549
 too hot from the lives like crackling 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.619
 let's cool a second but I'd say 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.009
 which in any case is fine and we put it 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.009
 in the legs 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.880
 feel like popping here 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.620
 We prepare our grapefruit 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.800
 we'll cut to live like this 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.520
 here it is called alive precisely because 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.230
 we do not use in the skin in 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.920
 here are three slices of grapefruit 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.200
 rose 3 wedges 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.580
 here we have to get to make one 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.820
 crust above over the shrimp but not 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.710
 cook it too much otherwise it becomes done 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.420
 we take the salt not so much 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.820
 perfect 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.710
 our shrimp are perfect there 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.950
 move slightly of the pan that 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:03:00.800
 pans and very hot and let's go to 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:05.650
 take the guinea pepper you see 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.720
 this pepper this form slightly 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:14.900
 elongated extremely fragrant it 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:20.300
 let's put it in. press well here 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.440
 whoever is abundant is not as strong as the 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:28.040
 extremely aromatic normal pepper 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.660
 we leave virtually no heat in 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.920
 so that they do not continue to cook 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.640
 but they keep warm and we prepare in the meantime 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.640
 our orange 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.130
 the opel I call alive as we did 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.130
 with grapefruit 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:59.280
 the two segments and we get the third 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:08.569
 spicchietto that's when we put the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:10.879
 our prawns here and now we put 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:18.750
 our citrus fruits 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:22.280
 then the grapefruit a little oil over it 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.949
 our oranges so a little bit of salt 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.550
 our campers are on the orange 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.940
 guinea pepper with citrus fruits are 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.940
 ready
