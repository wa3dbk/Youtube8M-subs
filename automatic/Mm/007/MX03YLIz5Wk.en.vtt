00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
breast intact let that rest and then you

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.650 
breast intact let that rest and then you
put<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.980> legs<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.519> thighs<00:03:50.580> back<00:03:51.150> into

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
put the legs and the thighs back into

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.970 
put the legs and the thighs back into
that<00:03:51.780> sort<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.140> broth<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.530> you've<00:03:52.680> created

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
that sort of broth that you've created

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.770 
that sort of broth that you've created
with<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.760> chicken<00:03:54.120> stock<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.570> butter

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
with the chicken stock and the butter

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.479

and<00:03:54.900> cover<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.590> then<00:03:55.830> basically<00:03:56.220> you'd<00:03:56.370> be

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
and cover it and then basically you'd be

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.280 
and cover it and then basically you'd be
braising<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.000> legs<00:03:57.239> so<00:03:57.810> they<00:03:57.959> get<00:03:58.080> really

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
braising the legs so they get really

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.440 
braising the legs so they get really
tender<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:58.950> dark<00:03:59.190> meat<00:03:59.340> will<00:03:59.459> get<00:03:59.670> cooked
