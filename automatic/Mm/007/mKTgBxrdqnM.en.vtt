00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 to make our soup of 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 french onion 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.599
 What we're going to need will need 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.660
 onions already without the shells that we're 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:18.080
 Let's hit the butter a little. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:24.090
 flour cheese gruyere bread olive oil 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:26.340
 pepper and our onion broth which 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.699
 the full recipe is just entering this 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.449
 link here or in the video description on 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.809
 youtube 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.670
 So let's start chopping onion. 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.350
 how are we going to cut these and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.350
 bodó in half 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.219
 if it is too big you have to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 cut in 4 because we will not 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.829
 To decrease this week too much will be 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:57.780
 it will have a certain consistency and there 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:59.160
 It also does not have to be so 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.620
 finally it's 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.500
 so here I am going to cut through 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.110
 this good to the onion all cut first 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.060
 next thing we're gonna do is like 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.340
 the bread then I have to how bread goes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.400
 above ours with search I have to 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.439
 see if it will fit kiyota not like 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.939
 to put an end he will here so then 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.960
 first thing in this case I'll post 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.960
 two little olive oil on bread 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:38.670
 Let's get it on the bottom too. 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:40.680
 he quoted them again in the pot where I 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.430
 I'll make it good 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.430
 our bread I already liked both sides 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:58.280
 in the same frying pan now go there 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.280
 butter olive oil 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:09.710
 and the and bororó do not forget oven on 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.570
 because we're going to have to gratin 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.240
 This can not be slow in the oven. 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.110
 then it is then while you go 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.770
 repeal the onions 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:24.400
 and be sure to warm be tissue is 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.400
 by onion serve 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.890
 just call 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.790
 15 minutes gave a pull on the onion 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.550
 our onion here already gave a pull on the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.349
 area does not need just pk do not burn 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.000
 it has to be sweetened but with the 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:00.209
 slight consistency 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.140
 It's time for flour to stir well 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.660
 flour we made it here now 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.480
 has a base of butter and olive oil with 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.730
 the flour that we are going to give one 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.880
 what she did and absorbed 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.799
 all the juices he had inside 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:27.720
 immediately there is an agglomeration 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:35.030
 for the flour will have to give this 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:47.130
 fritadinha there're the hour of our Calbo 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:53.070
 to be good here will come with a lot of 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:57.030
 color and lots of flavor for a 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:04.310
 it has been cool moves and backed body 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.310
 We have a little jump here 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:19.079
 There's nothing salt left yet to have. 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:22.549
 the pepper replaces the consistency of the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.549
 for a little more calm 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:44.740
 so moved again here now I 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:48.039
 let cooking and two minutes there 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.529
 the little lid 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:58.080
 In the meantime I'll get our cheese 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:58.080
 gruyére and I will grate in the thick drain 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.150
 And here she is in this beautiful creamy spot here. 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.520
 the spectacle that was here 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:19.599
 first we'll put her in a 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:32.279
 pot that can be baked on top 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:32.279
 the bread roll over the bread to gratin 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.080
 already on the edge line here not to burn right 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:49.060
 This is going to the oven only for serious 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.560
 on ahb a nice finish on our 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.680
 cheese that happens here 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.600
 the bread holds the cheese to the 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.850
 cheese do not mix do not mix do not come 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.800
 that fat that separates okay then 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.680
 people have the cheese gratin over 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.110
 extremely tasty bubbling soup 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.750
 with the knife and toast with which you go 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.380
 pick up with the spoon will break and go 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.230
 eat 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.570
 this will greatly improve your 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.450
 cold nights because what we want is 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:20.850
