00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.950
 I have a new poster and a new one 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.309
 movie and they told me to do a 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.700
 video and if I do not do it they kill me so 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.700
 let's do this 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.779
 the new animated movie that can be 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.970
 very good or very bad but no longer knows 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.430
 these days of really highlight your here 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.279
 and how to train your dragon and suddenly 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.840
 they draw the origin of the guardians one does not 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.400
 he really knows what he is facing 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.110
 I really wanted to see the colts of 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.210
 dreamworks did not know with a very good 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.340
 movie the trailers were none 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.170
 jokes really made me laugh and it looked 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.260
 like another one of those ubs movies we are 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.190
 a family and we learn things 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.100
 then of but now this since you are 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.979
 people so let's see the crosses maybe 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.659
 do not be so bad starting with the most 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.519
 obvious the animation is perfect in each 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.530
 sense of that word without any picture 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.659
 in this movie that is more excellent 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.920
 now you focus we have series series 2 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.329
 about the script and the story this 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.339
 movie would not be enough 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.990
 funny original enough is 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.690
 there was like the first ice age but 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.130
 better while this movie shares 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.799
 certain elements with the ice age the 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.720
 family trip the montage and how 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.159
 follow are pretty perseguues of this is 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.110
 just the core of the story to the rest 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.810
 completely different that without counting 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 that funny yellow every joke of the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.899
 movie but at certain times and 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.490
 situations that were pretty hilarious 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.780
 and they made my facial muscles 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.760
 do so 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 now there were certain aspects of the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.479
 address that I like quite had 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.030
 its clichÃ© moments and scenes that are 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.590
 needed in this type of film but 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.090
 visually this story is very well 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.250
 told when there was an action scene 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.659
 the camera was like climbing to great 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.340
 fair speed the characters me 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.399
 they seemed interesting apart from 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.000
 take advantage of the animation with 150% no 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.800
 an extra with this movie that was like 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.350
 Someone who is looking very 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.000
 nailed to the side and looked in his day 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.060
 but the camera was spinning at the same time 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.009
 that the character was 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.049
 if you take favorite of all the movies 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.720
 far at a technical level the models of 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.490
 animation all impeccable crosses 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.229
 but not only has the action and laughter 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.429
 he also has the emotion I have to 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.230
 admit this movie after a bit 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.819
 sad and emotional final something that does not 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.769
 I would have waited for nothing before seeing 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.269
 the crosses if I had to express in a 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.530
 classic when I liked this movie 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.739
 since he left until he finished serious 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.739
 as 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.750
 at first 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.640
 I'm enjoying God they like what 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.030
 they like to hear you feel pretty 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.030
 comfortable 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.500
 and technically my favorite movie of 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.250
 2013 until now 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.330
 the blu-ray convention just comes out 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.520
 it's not at all the progeny I expected 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.500
 it gave me much better than the big one and 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.850
 mighty cg 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.700
 that disappeared the crossings nomination to 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.080
 the best Disney animated film as well 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.630
 that a little early to say but 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.660
 put your bet jane on the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.940
 comments above I say forget 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.560
