00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.510 
pretty sturdy in my opinion the pump is
a<00:00:30.119> track<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.779> mainly<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> stick

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
a track it's mainly actually a stick

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
a track it's mainly actually a stick
pump<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.149> also<00:00:33.540> then<00:00:33.690> tracked<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
pump but it's also then tracked on to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.639 
pump but it's also then tracked on to
the<00:00:34.829> nozzle<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.090> barrel<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.350> makes<00:00:37.530> it

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the nozzle the barrel and it makes it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.920 
the nozzle the barrel and it makes it
quite<00:00:37.829> sturdy<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.280> easy<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.640> use<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.600> nozzle

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
quite sturdy and easy to use the nozzle

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.040 
quite sturdy and easy to use the nozzle
size<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.559> decent<00:00:41.280> actually<00:00:41.600> but<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:42.930> only

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
size is decent actually but that's only

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.229 
size is decent actually but that's only
because<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.590> came<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.920> 1990<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.090> gun

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
not really an all-out gun at the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530 
not really an all-out gun at the
beginning<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.770> mist<00:01:14.010> was<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.939> simply

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
beginning there the mist was just simply

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.929 
beginning there the mist was just simply
because<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.770> bit<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.979> air<00:01:17.280> got<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.670> front

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
because a little bit of air got in front

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.640 
because a little bit of air got in front
of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.150> water<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> gave<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> missed<00:01:19.590> shot

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
of the water so it gave a missed shot

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.270 
of the water so it gave a missed shot
but<00:01:20.210> it<00:01:21.210> ended<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:21.960> shooting<00:01:22.170> well<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.710> there's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
but it ended up shooting well so there's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.270
