00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
the other players I don't think I'm well

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:25.640 
the other players I don't think I'm well
actually<00:03:24.750> maybe<00:03:25.049> they<00:03:25.230> are<00:03:25.319> looking<00:03:25.349> about

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650

yeah I think they are so nice looking

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.289 
yeah I think they are so nice looking
team<00:03:28.319> though<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.829> obviously<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:29.970> someone's

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
team though and obviously if someone's

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.149 
team though and obviously if someone's
got<00:03:30.449> a<00:03:30.480> good-looking<00:03:30.750> team<00:03:31.199> nice<00:03:31.440> hybrid<00:03:31.739> they

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
got a good-looking team nice hybrid they

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.099 
got a good-looking team nice hybrid they
quite<00:03:32.609> interested<00:03:33.000> in<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.180> game<00:03:33.329> think<00:03:33.900> that

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
quite interested in the game think that

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.330 
quite interested in the game think that

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
you might come up against a more

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.250 
you might come up against a more
difficult<00:03:35.579> opponent<00:03:36.239> but<00:03:36.569> fortunately<00:03:37.049> for

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
difficult opponent but fortunately for

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
me I managed to go through and we forced

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.420 
me I managed to go through and we forced
that<00:03:39.030> one<00:03:39.239> in<00:03:39.389> not<00:03:39.629> really<00:03:39.930> sure<00:03:40.109> how<00:03:40.430> Benzema

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
doing alright when it comes to chemistry

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.719 
doing alright when it comes to chemistry
except<00:05:42.750> maybe<00:05:42.870> got<00:05:43.199> in<00:05:43.349> who's<00:05:43.800> also<00:05:44.039> on<00:05:44.340> seven
