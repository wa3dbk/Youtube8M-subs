00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.290
 that a hilger Arabic hello and welcome 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.030
 on nile beat the world episode zero 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 the pilot before starting things 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.470
 serious and as is customary on 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.990
 the Web 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.670
 I will make a small presentation 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 of the workshop where the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.039
 different hospitals 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.660
 various DIY presentations 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.880
 we are here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.590
 in a cellar of about 14 meters 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.719
 squares that's right but enough with 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.170
 a bit of organization and tips for 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.450
 to work properly at least one 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.989
 essential element of the workshop is 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.379
 established here simply realize in 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.309
 rafters and basterds on which he 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.980
 added the act of medium in order to have 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.399
 a flat surface 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.739
 I fixed a second slap wall if you 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.900
 allows me to make hooks for 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.290
 tools and material were skirted 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 need forgiveness the current the falls have 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.170
 well done a few shelves just at 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.390
 above a small infrared heater 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 ob long winter evenings I fixed 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.490
 under the worktop drawers and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.770
 who loses in an old library 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.610
 time we were still looking for 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.470
 books on file in his computer 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.329
 you can see just below the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.340
 welding machine which will be the subject 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.189
 first episode of macbidouille world 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.670
 on the arc welding 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.780
 next door an industrial vacuum cleaner 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.330
 handy to avoid dust 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.600
 lite is 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.090
 at the bench I realized a 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.260
 sky plateau is what allows to 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.230
 work at a little higher height 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.450
 comfortable and above all to have 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.460
 the whole coast is free to 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.510
 place loads Jun to fix the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.710
 feet on which we work 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.140
 which is quite practical the realization 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.220
 again it's simple a board 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.980
 of medium simply nailed to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.020
 falls from work plan but with so 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.650
 a fixed part and lapointe said 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:33.880
 clearly will be able to be taken in 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:36.580
 the vise your little trick save it's 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.680
 that some vetoes already have them 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.100
 but mine being devoid of 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.380
 made myself so by recovering 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.980
 Falls to see in Ukraine I made a 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.200
 notch with scissors both jaws 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.950
 which allows me to greenhouse and the 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.640
 soft materials wood pvc or even 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.459
 the metal sometimes and it avoids him from 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.620
 mark the pieces with the jaw 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:08.830
 concrete metal I present to you in 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.560
 video also the support for 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.600
 smartphones you can see the post of 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.459
 his realization on the blog 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.760
 so little change since this 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.400
 realization I had initially then two 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.070
 sweetheart uncle from simcoe us 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.650
 let's see here I had assembled to have 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.950
 an amplitude of one meter it was revealed 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.250
 that once the two co the assembly 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.310
 he tended to bend himself either 11 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.739
 under their own point young have finished 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.080
 by using only one I fixed a 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.190
 little higher on the workbench what's 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.080
 allows to have more or less the same 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:51.819
 amplitude so the plexiglass part 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.660
 thermoformed and or other small 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.970
 modifications 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.590
 although I made gold holes 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.720
 the different microphone of the smartphone 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.549
 I had problems with her and so 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.040
 just add a lapel microphone 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.810
 it allows frankly earned in 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.980
 quality we will continue the little tour 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:16.600
 horizon with on the right of the workbench 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:21.220
 a part of wood storage and therefore tube 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.690
 steel profiles and wc other just to 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.900
 side 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:30.370
 the cabinet products to treat 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:34.539
 the different materials and then so 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.280
 the portable electrical equipment cabinet then 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.340
 I am for the moment with a so 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.840
 saab my plane paint gun 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.000
 grinder saved eccentric the post 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.770
 to solder and a good pair sauce 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.630
 wired which allows to grill 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:55.690
 jobs requiring more power 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:59.500
 is especially time with a drill 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.330
 battery on the side again a little bit the 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.580
 storage essentially for 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.340
 slaps so we find a lot of 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.810
 wood but also you see various 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.440
 polycarbonate and also plates of 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:15.140
 classic glass just above 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.680
 the little essential pharmacy in a 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:23.290
 workshop so this one performed quite 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.160
 quickly with sheet metal that is 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.370
 some walls inside 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.460
 this is what is needed to heal 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.460
 quickly 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.960
 we continue with kim the English steel 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.620
 I mounted on a room is joe realized 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.890
 bottom of chevron and bastin and I have 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:52.040
 just add a tray in the back 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:54.530
 plexiglas and a cardboard bag 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.570
 trash in order to recover a maximum of 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:02.090
 sweat above the bars storage 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.780
 metal or drink too long could 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.940
 store elsewhere formalized simply 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:13.010
 with a gap profile is welded at an angle 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:15.740
 and hook to the wall right next to 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.000
 oath I would surely have the opportunity to 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.620
 to show you how much these practices 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.110
 when working alone with 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.820
 great lengths we then 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.300
 still a plan that allows especially 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:33.620
 quickly clear one established during 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:35.530
 the work of which is annoying the 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:41.169
 wood storage for winter 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:44.680
 a shelf that for the moment receives 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.940
 tools and what goes out to gardening 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.210
 but I mounted this shelf on 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.760
 casters and that allows me during the 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.400
 works by the house can move 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.060
 all of my plaster tools 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.890
 in one go while rolling 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.300
 shelf 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.210
 just next to a closed cabinet for 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.860
 to conceal dust which fears 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.860
 do not want to clean constantly 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:19.550
 here is where the little tour of the workshop 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.080
 maybe you girls 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.660
 thank you for viewing this entry in 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.750
 matter and we find ourselves quickly 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.750
 for episode 1 the arc welding
