that Sturridge has only managed 14 key

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480

optional<00:03:48.680> can<00:03:48.889> manage<00:03:49.159> a<00:03:49.250> clean<00:03:49.459> sheet<00:03:49.639> this

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
optional can manage a clean sheet this

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.539 
optional can manage a clean sheet this
weekend<00:03:50.239> at<00:03:50.479> home<00:03:50.659> to<00:03:50.840> Sunderland<00:03:51.549> what's

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
weekend at home to Sunderland what's

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.280 
weekend at home to Sunderland what's
also<00:03:52.760> interesting<00:03:52.879> is<00:03:53.599> that<00:03:53.659> over<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.199> last

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
also interesting is that over the last

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.589 
also interesting is that over the last
three<00:03:54.590> seasons<00:03:54.879> kashani<00:03:55.879> has<00:03:56.120> managed<00:03:56.449> two

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
three seasons kashani has managed two

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.509 
three seasons kashani has managed two
goals<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:56.989> each<00:03:57.139> of<00:03:57.319> them<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:58.099> he's<00:03:58.250> yet<00:03:58.489> to

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
goals in each of them and he's yet to

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.490 
goals in each of them and he's yet to
score<00:03:58.729> so<00:03:59.090> far<00:03:59.120> this<00:03:59.419> season<00:03:59.479> so<00:04:00.139> hopefully

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
score so far this season so hopefully

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.050 
score so far this season so hopefully
that's<00:04:00.680> an<00:04:00.799> indication<00:04:01.159> that<00:04:01.519> he<00:04:01.639> might<00:04:01.849> just

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
that's an indication that he might just

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.839 
that's an indication that he might just
grab<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.299> goal<00:04:02.510> sometime<00:04:03.019> soon<00:04:03.519> he<00:04:04.519> has<00:04:04.729> come

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
grab a goal sometime soon he has come

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.280 
grab a goal sometime soon he has come
pretty<00:04:05.239> close<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.629> scoring<00:04:05.810> on<00:04:06.049> numerous

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
pretty close to scoring on numerous

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.920 
pretty close to scoring on numerous
occasions<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:07.430> far<00:04:07.639> this<00:04:07.760> season<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.180> he

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
occasions so far this season and he

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.140 
occasions so far this season and he
nearly<00:04:09.109> got<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.319> goal<00:04:09.530> against<00:04:09.769> United<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:10.970> with

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
nearly got a goal against United so with

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.030 
nearly got a goal against United so with
that<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.479> mind<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.989> with<00:04:12.379> him<00:04:12.590> managing<00:04:12.949> a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
that in mind and with him managing a

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.099 
that in mind and with him managing a
shot<00:04:13.250> on<00:04:13.370> average<00:04:13.699> nearly<00:04:13.970> every<00:04:14.329> two<00:04:14.540> games<00:04:14.810> I

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
shot on average nearly every two games I

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.199 
shot on average nearly every two games I
think<00:04:15.859> he's<00:04:15.979> due<00:04:16.159> some<00:04:16.190> attacking<00:04:16.609> points<00:04:17.000> and

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
think he's due some attacking points and

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.120 
think he's due some attacking points and
I<00:04:17.780> can<00:04:17.959> definitely<00:04:18.049> see<00:04:18.440> him<00:04:18.620> scoring<00:04:18.919> well

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
I can definitely see him scoring well

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.740 
I can definitely see him scoring well
this<00:04:19.280> week

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750

few weeks ago and opted to play 352 for
a<00:04:37.140> while<00:04:37.370> but<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.580> definitely<00:04:38.760> proved<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.630> be

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
a while but that definitely proved to be

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.020 
a while but that definitely proved to be
a<00:04:39.810> bad<00:04:40.020> decision<00:04:40.500> with<00:04:41.400> Erickson<00:04:41.730> looking

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
a bad decision with Erickson looking

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.730 
a bad decision with Erickson looking
less<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.240> less<00:04:42.450> likely<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.050> get<00:04:43.140> consistent

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
less and less likely to get consistent

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.040 
less and less likely to get consistent
minute<00:04:44.010> I've<00:04:44.700> decided<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.210> reverse<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.630> and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
minute I've decided to reverse that and

minute I've decided to reverse that and
I've<00:04:46.320> sword<00:04:46.770> Erickson<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.250> Della<00:04:47.670> Fave

have a game that week and villa don't
however<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.700> don't<00:04:59.820> think<00:05:00.180> Redmond<00:05:00.510> is<00:05:00.600> totally

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050

nailed in the starting lineup Gutierrez

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.270 
nailed in the starting lineup Gutierrez
is<00:05:03.240> back<00:05:03.450> from<00:05:03.600> injury<00:05:03.930> very<00:05:04.200> soon<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.680> he

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
is back from injury very soon and he

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.580 
is back from injury very soon and he
could<00:05:05.460> be<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.610> big<00:05:05.850> threat<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.210> redmond<00:05:06.600> and

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
could be a big threat to redmond and

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.680 
could be a big threat to redmond and
with<00:05:08.100> bacuna<00:05:08.550> getting<00:05:08.850> plenty<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.240> shots<00:05:09.480> per

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
with bacuna getting plenty of shots per

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.420 
with bacuna getting plenty of shots per
game<00:05:09.720> even<00:05:10.560> when<00:05:10.650> he<00:05:10.740> plays<00:05:10.920> it<00:05:11.100> right<00:05:11.280> back

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
game even when he plays it right back

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.730 
game even when he plays it right back
and<00:05:11.730> with<00:05:12.420> him<00:05:12.600> having<00:05:12.840> managed<00:05:13.140> four<00:05:13.470> goals

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
and with him having managed four goals

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.920 
and with him having managed four goals
so<00:05:13.950> far<00:05:13.980> I<00:05:14.430> think<00:05:14.910> he's<00:05:15.270> probably<00:05:15.480> about<00:05:15.810> how

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
so far I think he's probably about how

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.220 
so far I think he's probably about how
long<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.260> in<00:05:16.350> pick<00:05:16.530> in<00:05:17.660> terms<00:05:18.660> of<00:05:18.750> selection

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
lalana is up against the West Ham

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.510 
lalana is up against the West Ham
defense<00:05:34.050> that<00:05:34.290> has<00:05:34.380> managed<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.860> kimchi<00:05:35.340> in

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
defense that has managed to kimchi in

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.030 
defense that has managed to kimchi in
their<00:05:35.670> last<00:05:35.820> four<00:05:36.120> games<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.960> now<00:05:37.650> have<00:05:37.890> the

most<00:05:38.220> clean<00:05:38.460> sheets<00:05:38.700> so<00:05:38.910> far<00:05:39.150> this<00:05:39.300> season<00:05:39.360> so

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
most clean sheets so far this season so

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.140 
most clean sheets so far this season so
I<00:05:40.380> can<00:05:40.620> see<00:05:40.800> him<00:05:41.010> having<00:05:41.250> a<00:05:41.430> low<00:05:41.550> scoring<00:05:41.880> week

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
I can see him having a low scoring week

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.300 
I can see him having a low scoring week
I'm<00:05:42.900> not<00:05:43.080> entirely<00:05:43.380> sure<00:05:43.530> I<00:05:43.680> want<00:05:43.920> to<00:05:44.040> double

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
I'm not entirely sure I want to double

I'm not entirely sure I want to double
up<00:05:44.340> on<00:05:44.490> Cardiff<00:05:44.790> defense<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.450> play<00:05:45.840> Turner<00:05:46.140> as

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
up on Cardiff defense and play Turner as

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.320 
up on Cardiff defense and play Turner as
well<00:05:46.590> as<00:05:46.710> Marshall<00:05:47.130> but<00:05:47.730> Coleman<00:05:48.150> has<00:05:48.300> a

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
well as Marshall but Coleman has a

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.900 
well as Marshall but Coleman has a
tricky<00:05:48.720> fixture<00:05:49.080> away<00:05:49.260> to<00:05:49.320> Chelsea<00:05:49.920> and<00:05:50.430> if

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
tricky fixture away to Chelsea and if

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.880 
tricky fixture away to Chelsea and if
John<00:05:51.090> Terry's<00:05:51.450> back<00:05:51.600> for<00:05:51.780> that<00:05:51.900> game<00:05:52.080> fancy

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
John Terry's back for that game fancy

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.710

Chelsea<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.280> keep<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.460> clean<00:05:53.670> sheet<00:05:53.700> so<00:05:54.600> I'm

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
Chelsea to keep a clean sheet so I'm

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.290 
Chelsea to keep a clean sheet so I'm
probably<00:05:54.900> gonna<00:05:55.140> play<00:05:55.410> Cahill<00:05:56.180> but<00:05:57.180> at<00:05:57.270> the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
probably gonna play Cahill but at the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.120 
probably gonna play Cahill but at the
moment<00:05:57.510> I've<00:05:57.840> gone<00:05:58.020> with<00:05:58.200> keeping<00:05:58.530> Lallana<00:05:58.860> in

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130

him in recent weeks but I'm gonna put

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.980 
him in recent weeks but I'm gonna put
that<00:06:08.520> down<00:06:08.640> to<00:06:08.700> Suarez<00:06:09.060> having<00:06:09.450> a<00:06:09.510> bit<00:06:09.720> of<00:06:09.750> bad

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
that down to Suarez having a bit of bad

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.080 
that down to Suarez having a bit of bad
luck<00:06:10.250> he's<00:06:11.250> managed<00:06:11.520> more<00:06:11.700> shots<00:06:12.000> than

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
luck he's managed more shots than

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.850 
luck he's managed more shots than
storage<00:06:12.480> in<00:06:12.570> every<00:06:12.780> game<00:06:12.930> and<00:06:13.170> created<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:13.650> lot

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
storage in every game and created a lot

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.430 
storage in every game and created a lot
more<00:06:14.010> chances<00:06:14.460> he's<00:06:15.390> also<00:06:15.600> hit<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.110> post<00:06:16.290> a

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
more chances he's also hit the post a

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.290 
more chances he's also hit the post a
couple<00:06:16.590> of<00:06:16.740> times<00:06:16.890> and<00:06:17.370> he's<00:06:17.610> on<00:06:17.760> free<00:06:18.030> kicks

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
couple of times and he's on free kicks

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.570 
couple of times and he's on free kicks
and<00:06:18.570> some<00:06:18.720> corners<00:06:19.170> so<00:06:19.920> he's<00:06:20.040> definitely<00:06:20.220> do

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
and some corners so he's definitely do

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.760 
and some corners so he's definitely do
some<00:06:20.790> points<00:06:21.120> and<00:06:21.300> he's<00:06:22.050> the<00:06:22.200> most<00:06:22.350> explosive

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
some points and he's the most explosive

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.700 
some points and he's the most explosive
of<00:06:23.130> the<00:06:23.220> team<00:06:23.400> as<00:06:23.610> well<00:06:23.760> so<00:06:24.530> Sturridge<00:06:25.530> is

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
of the team as well so Sturridge is

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.530 
of the team as well so Sturridge is
likely<00:06:26.130> to<00:06:26.160> get<00:06:26.430> a<00:06:26.490> goal<00:06:26.700> in<00:06:26.820> each<00:06:26.910> game<00:06:27.150> but

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
likely to get a goal in each game but

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.210 
likely to get a goal in each game but
Suarez<00:06:27.840> is<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.260> war<00:06:28.410> need<00:06:28.560> fancy<00:06:28.770> to<00:06:29.070> get<00:06:29.190> a

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
Suarez is the war need fancy to get a

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.470 
Suarez is the war need fancy to get a
hat<00:06:29.400> trick<00:06:29.550> or<00:06:29.880> a<00:06:29.910> load<00:06:30.180> of<00:06:30.270> us

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
hat trick or a load of us

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.270 
hat trick or a load of us
this<00:06:30.600> so<00:06:31.350> that's<00:06:31.530> the<00:06:31.680> reason<00:06:31.710> I'm<00:06:32.040> going<00:06:32.190> to

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
this so that's the reason I'm going to

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.150 
this so that's the reason I'm going to
stick<00:06:32.430> with<00:06:32.490> him<00:06:33.530> and<00:06:34.530> as<00:06:34.710> always<00:06:34.890> you<00:06:35.130> can

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
stick with him and as always you can

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.100 
stick with him and as always you can
find<00:06:35.280> a<00:06:35.460> predicted<00:06:35.910> lineups<00:06:36.210> and<00:06:36.390> any<00:06:36.660> changes

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
find a predicted lineups and any changes

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.360 
find a predicted lineups and any changes
