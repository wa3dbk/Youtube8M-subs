00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.140 

ice<00:00:13.019> fishing<00:00:13.619> is<00:00:13.799> usually<00:00:14.280> slow<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.730> frozen

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
ice fishing is usually slow a frozen

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.089 
ice fishing is usually slow a frozen
event<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.629> it's<00:00:15.900> not<00:00:16.049> much<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.770> about

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
event and it's not much going on about

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.769 
event and it's not much going on about
ice<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.570> let's<00:00:18.720> go<00:00:18.900> down<00:00:19.080> but<00:00:19.470> action<00:00:19.860> is<00:00:20.779> first

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
ice so let's go down but action is first

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:44.209 
ice so let's go down but action is first
we<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.349> to<00:00:22.470> drill<00:00:22.710> hold<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:44.039> are

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
we have to drill hold and then we are

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:57.619 
we have to drill hold and then we are
tied<00:00:44.460> into<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> water<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.910> visibility<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
tied into the water the visibility in

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
tied into the water the visibility in
the<00:00:57.719> water<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.140> partly<00:00:58.859> due<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> snow<00:00:59.399> melting

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the water is partly due to snow melting

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:20.320 
the water is partly due to snow melting
unfortunately<00:01:00.780> rather<00:01:01.140> poor

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.420 

well<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.630> promised<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> some<00:01:22.590> action<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
well I promised you some action but this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:37.250 
well I promised you some action but this
purchase<00:01:23.730> appeared<00:01:24.300> to<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.510> rather<00:01:24.690> laid-back

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.190 

the<00:01:37.800> solution<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.570> send<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:39.930> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the solution I think it to send down a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:54.800 
the solution I think it to send down a
balance<00:01:40.770> law

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.410 

now<00:01:55.810> let's<00:01:56.320> do<00:01:56.439> some<00:01:56.710> pipe<00:01:56.920> fishing<00:01:57.430> this<00:01:58.119> one

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
now let's do some pipe fishing this one

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:11.040 
now let's do some pipe fishing this one
was<00:01:58.780> fast<00:01:59.049> and<00:01:59.350> furious

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:23.199 

and<00:02:11.140> here<00:02:11.830> comes<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.400> big<00:02:12.700> one

and<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.859> pack<00:02:25.159> seen<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.760> came<00:02:25.939> from<00:02:26.090> out<00:02:26.299> of

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
and this pack seen to came from out of

and this one attacked lure three times
in<00:02:47.360> less<00:02:47.480> than<00:02:47.750> five<00:02:47.930> minutes<00:02:51.340> one<00:02:56.019> two
