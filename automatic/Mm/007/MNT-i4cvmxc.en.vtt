ham needs have from some real slick
movement<00:06:02.330> at<00:06:02.419> this<00:06:02.599> time<00:06:02.809> let's<00:06:03.259> see<00:06:03.379> what<00:06:03.529> he

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
movement at this time let's see what he

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:05.049 
movement at this time let's see what he
could<00:06:03.679> do<00:06:03.860> is<00:06:04.009> he<00:06:04.039> does<00:06:04.369> manage<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.610> find<00:06:04.849> one

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:05.059 
could do is he does manage to find one

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:07.540 
could do is he does manage to find one
on<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:05.479> ground<00:06:05.839> and<00:06:06.139> clock<00:06:06.740> now<00:06:07.039> has<00:06:07.249> to<00:06:07.369> take

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
on the ground and clock now has to take

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.040 
on the ground and clock now has to take
a<00:06:07.580> seat<00:06:07.819> as<00:06:07.999> it's<00:06:08.330> really<00:06:08.629> don't<00:06:08.749> want<00:06:08.899> to<00:06:08.959> be

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
a seat as it's really don't want to be

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.779 
a seat as it's really don't want to be
one<00:06:09.229> but<00:06:09.379> that<00:06:09.649> laser<00:06:10.039> but<00:06:10.249> that's<00:06:10.369> because<00:06:10.520> he

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
one but that laser but that's because he

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.730 
one but that laser but that's because he
gets<00:06:10.999> on<00:06:11.179> that<00:06:11.360> laser<00:06:11.599> pad<00:06:11.899> there<00:06:12.139> and<00:06:12.289> he<00:06:12.619> is

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
gets on that laser pad there and he is

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.980 
gets on that laser pad there and he is
able<00:06:12.949> to<00:06:13.219> do<00:06:13.429> so<00:06:13.669> it's<00:06:13.879> only<00:06:14.089> only<00:06:14.569> way<00:06:14.809> he's

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
able to do so it's only only way he's

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.169 
able to do so it's only only way he's
able<00:06:15.110> to<00:06:15.289> do<00:06:15.499> that<00:06:15.649> but<00:06:15.860> nice<00:06:16.159> shot<00:06:16.459> there<00:06:16.490> as<00:06:16.819> a

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:17.179 
able to do that but nice shot there as a

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:19.089 
able to do that but nice shot there as a
km<00:06:17.479> kill<00:06:17.719> sounded<00:06:18.139> shrink<00:06:18.439> so<00:06:18.619> with<00:06:18.769> the<00:06:18.860> stop

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
km kill sounded shrink so with the stop

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.679 
km kill sounded shrink so with the stop
and<00:06:19.309> we're<00:06:19.550> gonna<00:06:19.639> have<00:06:19.879> 13<00:06:20.209> seconds<00:06:20.599> on<00:06:20.659> the
