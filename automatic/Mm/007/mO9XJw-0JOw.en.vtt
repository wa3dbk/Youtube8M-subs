00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hi everyone then I you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.920
 showed two tweeters that I found 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.940
 on trick 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.050
 so that was a part of that 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.549
 gravity so I want to apologize for 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.320
 report to worst act what I thought 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.510
 that it was him so suddenly I put a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.770
 little with tv on 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.530
 on a pussy while it was not 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.490
 him who was Lord Sinclar and Roman 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:28.050
 then the compliant guardians 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.110
 we will look very quickly at what they 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.020
 will do 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.110
 so their sinclair is a problem 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.370
 it's a British going on a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.260
 aerodrome and three depots so that seems 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.760
 quite normal and the eye on on 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.920
 departure so no problem the problem 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.559
 he may not come from him he comes 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.560
 to get himself romane man who builds 3 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.270
 base of interests more 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.730
 five trucks of 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.270
 it was anything knowing that the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.260
 bazaars stems of drops 45 dollars 45 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.150
 dollars and there he comes out 4 5 going to me 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.860
 feel 5.6 makes 88 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.350
 so we say to ourselves what is wrong 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.160
 played directly on thursday but you're stupid 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.500
 is extremely expensive 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.210
 so we can imagine that he has money 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.960
 unlimited and then we'll see the 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.280
 gentleman's cheats at five o'clock 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.180
 what is his cheap but his 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.180
 title the god mode 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.439
 look at two flext9 the a88 that's it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.270
 my shot 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.619
 the extremely powerful ansm star that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.000
 when he touches a plane the plane is in 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.280
 play mode finally 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.740
 in panic mode and he helped to come back 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.110
 on the basis there not only he touched 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.790
 twice but look at her two more 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.250
 twice but nothing at all 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.460
 the arc separated I pull nothing at all 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.870
 they laugh 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.850
 so here I say there is a fucking 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.670
 problem and here I say that my 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.450
 teacher and there romane gentleman 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.570
 which 5.5 basis of 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.270
 artillery 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.690
 the said yes actually at five there 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.290
 and me before 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.790
 of cheat villa the fashion god loves to create 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.790
 I have money is limited 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.780
 so that's not necessarily cool 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.350
 and there when they wake me up because 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.300
 that he is saying ah yes hey go he has 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.600
 said it's gone to the east I sent the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.210
 sauce 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.160
 the problem is that illiterate people do not 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.940
 feel not necessarily made the basis for 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.280
 from the multi the other look very late there is 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.000
 many trainers who are made for 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.230
 solo 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.060
 normally all the traders we 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.430
 found on shit happens point com and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.600
 so here they send the sauce on 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.600
 sees unlimited money 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.180
 opposite nothing at all since laurent 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.170
 and here we go 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.430
 All have all been blocked since 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.720
 stragglers are not made for fashion 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.180
 multi three quarters of sorters 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.400
 jerk for multi mode and so suddenly 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.730
 that gave that made us all bugger and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.120
 so here is so if you find Lord 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:30.510
 sinclair or romance better on his f18 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.790
 you know they have trainers and that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.790
 Well, that's basically people like that
