00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
 Nothing to do 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.800
 when he finished the first day in which he was 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.800

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.950
 in a beautiful north 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.240

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.240

 next time you have to do the other 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.640
 You have to play a lot more than I say. 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.009
