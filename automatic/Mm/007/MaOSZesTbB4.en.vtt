00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
going to be but we didn't really expect

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
going to be but we didn't really expect
them<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.920> early<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> year<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.000> no

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
them to this early on in the year so no

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
them to this early on in the year so no
great<00:00:39.480> shocks<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> dugong<00:00:40.649> say

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
great shocks there but the dugong say

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
great shocks there but the dugong say
some<00:00:41.280> stuff<00:00:41.520> about<00:00:41.670> our<00:00:41.850> next-gen<00:00:42.480> consoles

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
some stuff about our next-gen consoles

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
some stuff about our next-gen consoles
maybe<00:00:43.079> hinting<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.770> next<00:00:44.010> game<00:00:44.160> will<00:00:44.910> be

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
maybe hinting that the next game will be

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
maybe hinting that the next game will be
using<00:00:45.329> next-gen<00:00:45.719> technology<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> go<00:00:46.530> where

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
using next-gen technology to go where

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.650 
using next-gen technology to go where
there's<00:00:47.129> increased<00:00:47.610> volatility<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.480> year

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
there's increased volatility this year

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.720 
there's increased volatility this year
due<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> ongoing<00:00:49.320> console<00:00:50.039> transition

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
due to the ongoing console transition

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.950 
due to the ongoing console transition
which<00:00:50.879> makes<00:00:51.090> predict<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.510> future<00:00:51.809> more

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
which makes predict in the future more

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.380 
which makes predict in the future more
challenging<00:00:52.469> than<00:00:52.680> usual<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.280> therefore<00:00:54.270> not

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
challenging than usual and therefore not

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.670 
challenging than usual and therefore not
really<00:00:54.660> confirming<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.320> they're<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
really confirming that they're going to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.049 
really confirming that they're going to
be<00:00:55.739> using<00:00:56.010> next-gen<00:00:56.340> technology<00:00:56.910> but

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
be using next-gen technology but

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.970 
be using next-gen technology but
definitely<00:00:57.480> hidden<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.140> might<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.739> but

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
definitely hidden that they might be but

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
definitely hidden that they might be but
now<00:00:59.100> I'm<00:00:59.190> moving<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.520> into<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> second<00:01:00.359> kind

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
now I'm moving on into the second kind

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
now I'm moving on into the second kind
of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.750> video<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.829> wanted<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> talk<00:01:02.370> about

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
theories about whether it's going to be

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
theories about whether it's going to be
modern<00:01:08.400> warfare<00:01:08.549> 4<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:09.960> kind

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
modern warfare 4 and if it is what kind

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.359 
modern warfare 4 and if it is what kind
of<00:01:10.170> storyline<00:01:10.710> they're<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.159> where

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
of storyline they're going to do where

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.590 
of storyline they're going to do where

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
they're going to bring ghosts back or

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.060 
they're going to bring ghosts back or
whether<00:01:12.750> they're<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.080> start<00:01:13.740> fresh

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
whether they're going to start fresh

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.219 
whether they're going to start fresh
with<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.490> new<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.080> engine<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
with this new kind of engine that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.690 
with this new kind of engine that
they've<00:01:16.350> got<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> new<00:01:17.400> fresh

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700

they've got so get to get a new fresh
feel<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> game<00:01:18.360> there's<00:01:19.080> many<00:01:19.290> different

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
feel to the game there's many different

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.630 
feel to the game there's many different
theories<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.220> I'm<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
theories out there but I'm just going to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.100 
theories out there but I'm just going to
talk<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> couple<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> them<00:01:21.750> bring<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
talk about a couple of them bring the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.499 
talk about a couple of them bring the
few<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> facts<00:01:22.740> together<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.270> see<00:01:24.270> which

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
few of the facts together and see which

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.050 
few of the facts together and see which
maybe<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> most<00:01:26.070> likely<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:26.820> at

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
maybe will be the most likely now at

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.580 
maybe will be the most likely now at
this<00:01:27.180> point<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.600> time<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.200> hard<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
this point in time it's really hard to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.870 
this point in time it's really hard to
call<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:28.920> they're<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.189> gonna<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.729> with

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
call what they're actually gonna do with

call what they're actually gonna do with
the<00:01:29.970> storyline<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:30.990> modern

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the storyline if they do do modern

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
the storyline if they do do modern
warfare<00:01:31.409> 4<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.400> whole<00:01:32.579> point<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
warfare 4 because the whole point of the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.609 
warfare 4 because the whole point of the
modern<00:01:33.270> warfare<00:01:33.479> series<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:34.200> has<00:01:34.409> been

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
modern warfare series really has been

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560 
modern warfare series really has been
killing<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.579> ultra-nationalist

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
killing the ultra-nationalist

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.330 
killing the ultra-nationalist
Russians<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> past<00:01:38.100> without

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
Russians you know in the past without

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.580 
Russians you know in the past without
Makarov<00:01:38.880> without<00:01:39.150> kravchenko<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
Makarov without kravchenko and in the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.440 
Makarov without kravchenko and in the
end<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.979> modern<00:01:41.280> warfare<00:01:41.490> 3<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:42.090> actually

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
end of modern warfare 3 they actually

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.030 
end of modern warfare 3 they actually
sign<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> peace<00:01:43.079> treaty<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.680> seems<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
sign a peace treaty so it seems that

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.999 
sign a peace treaty so it seems that
this<00:01:44.310> kind<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.090> US<00:01:45.689> versus<00:01:45.990> Russia<00:01:46.229> war<00:01:46.649> has

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
this kind of US versus Russia war has

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.830 
this kind of US versus Russia war has
finally<00:01:47.490> ended<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.360> where<00:01:48.540> modern

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
finally ended and this is where modern

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
finally ended and this is where modern
warfare<00:01:48.990> 4<00:01:49.140> comes<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> question

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
warfare 4 comes into the question

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889 
warfare 4 comes into the question
because<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> me<00:01:50.880> they've<00:01:51.270> got<00:01:51.509> two<00:01:51.689> different

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
because to me they've got two different

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.289 
because to me they've got two different
options<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> name<00:01:52.920> modern<00:01:53.159> warfare<00:01:53.490> has<00:01:54.119> got

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
options the name modern warfare has got

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060 
options the name modern warfare has got
so<00:01:54.570> big<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.990> such<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> massive<00:01:55.350> franchise<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
so big it's such a massive franchise in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
so big it's such a massive franchise in
itself<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> don't<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.479> need<00:01:57.600> actually

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
itself that I don't think need actually

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
itself that I don't think need actually
start<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.380> new<00:01:58.530> Call<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.799> Duty<00:01:59.189> name<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.670> they

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
start a new Call of Duty name so they

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.550 
start a new Call of Duty name so they
won't<00:01:59.909> name<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.360> something<00:02:00.479> other<00:02:00.810> than<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
won't name it something other than a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160 
won't name it something other than a
modern<00:02:02.040> warfare<00:02:02.219> 4<00:02:02.430> title<00:02:03.090> because<00:02:03.390> it'd<00:02:04.140> be

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
modern warfare 4 title because it'd be

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.690 
modern warfare 4 title because it'd be
like<00:02:04.380> starting<00:02:04.890> afresh<00:02:05.100> people<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.579> familiar

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
like starting afresh people are familiar

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.359 
like starting afresh people are familiar
with<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> modern<00:02:06.360> warfare<00:02:06.600> series<00:02:06.780> and

with the modern warfare series and
whether<00:02:08.369> they<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.030> or<00:02:09.119> loathe<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.780> it's

such<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> massive<00:02:10.649> title<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.430> they<00:02:11.550> get<00:02:11.760> lots

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
such a massive title that they get lots

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.160 
such a massive title that they get lots
more<00:02:12.060> sales<00:02:12.420> doing<00:02:12.690> that

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
more sales doing that

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.680 
more sales doing that
than<00:02:13.349> making<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.160> new<00:02:14.340> call<00:02:14.550> duty<00:02:14.910> name<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.480> that

than making a new call duty name so that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.240 
than making a new call duty name so that

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
a new plot and kind of link in a little

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.839 
a new plot and kind of link in a little
bit<00:02:24.780> with<00:02:24.900> modern<00:02:25.230> warfare<00:02:25.410> 3<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:26.190> make<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.670> in

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
bit with modern warfare 3 but make it in

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.699 
bit with modern warfare 3 but make it in
its<00:02:27.120> own<00:02:27.270> game<00:02:27.599> but<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.319> modern<00:02:28.560> warfare

its own game but with the modern warfare
4<00:02:28.890> title<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.489> little<00:02:29.730> bit<00:02:29.819> confusing<00:02:30.239> but<00:02:30.420> if

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
4 title a little bit confusing but if

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.449 
4 title a little bit confusing but if
you<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:30.870> your<00:02:31.020> head<00:02:31.140> around<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:32.280> I

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
you can get your head around that then I

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.590 
you can get your head around that then I
think<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.760> probably<00:02:32.880> would<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.360> best

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
think that probably would be the best

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.690 
think that probably would be the best
solution<00:02:33.810> start<00:02:34.319> with<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.440> new<00:02:34.680> plot<00:02:34.980> because

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
solution start with a new plot because

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.860 
solution start with a new plot because
then<00:02:35.910> you've<00:02:36.030> still<00:02:36.270> got<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> modern<00:02:36.750> warfare

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
then you've still got the modern warfare

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.449 
then you've still got the modern warfare
title<00:02:37.410> which<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.620> bringing<00:02:37.800> people<00:02:38.010> back<00:02:38.130> who

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
title which is bringing people back who

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.370 
title which is bringing people back who
like<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.790> modern<00:02:39.030> warfare<00:02:39.180> series<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:40.200> then

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
like the modern warfare series but then

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.990 
like the modern warfare series but then
you've<00:02:40.530> also<00:02:40.680> got<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.100> kind<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.430> new<00:02:41.610> feel<00:02:41.850> to

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
you've also got that kind of new feel to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.089 
you've also got that kind of new feel to
the<00:02:42.090> game<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.690> can<00:02:42.900> express<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.890> get

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
the game that you can express and get

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.380 
the game that you can express and get
some<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.580> people<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.849> don't<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.269> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
some of the people that don't like the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.330 
some of the people that don't like the
modern<00:02:45.660> warfare<00:02:45.780> series<00:02:46.080> back<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.950> play<00:02:47.160> it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
modern warfare series back to play it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.530 
modern warfare series back to play it
and<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.670> course<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.090> will<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.390> be

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and of course it will just be

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.910 
and of course it will just be
interesting<00:02:49.080> starting<00:02:49.440> off<00:02:49.560> with<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.709> whole

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
interesting starting off with a whole

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
interesting starting off with a whole
new<00:02:50.040> storyline<00:02:50.519> scene<00:02:50.850> where<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.660> where

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
new storyline scene where it's where

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.509 
new storyline scene where it's where
it's<00:02:52.049> going<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.319> go<00:02:52.470> basically<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.430> is

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
it's going to go basically so that is

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.039 
it's going to go basically so that is
one<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.910> possibilities<00:02:54.269> starting<00:02:54.959> off

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
one of the possibilities starting off

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.809 
one of the possibilities starting off
with<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.230> whole<00:02:55.380> new<00:02:55.530> storyline<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.700> other

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
with a whole new storyline but the other

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.580 
with a whole new storyline but the other
possibility<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.420> trying<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.110> carry<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.500> on

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
possibility is trying to carry it on

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.410 
possibility is trying to carry it on
from<00:02:58.890> modern<00:02:59.130> warfare<00:02:59.280> 3<00:02:59.489> now<00:02:59.850> that<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.150> going

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
from modern warfare 3 now that is going

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.030 
from modern warfare 3 now that is going
to<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.569> hard<00:03:00.750> because<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.260> lot<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.860> main

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
to be hard because a lot of the main

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.820 
to be hard because a lot of the main
characters<00:03:02.519> are<00:03:02.700> now<00:03:02.819> dead<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:04.380> Russians

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
characters are now dead and the Russians

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.400 
characters are now dead and the Russians
seem<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.400> be<00:03:05.640> at<00:03:05.819> peace<00:03:06.030> now<00:03:06.360> with<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.810> US<00:03:07.110> and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
seem to be at peace now with the US and

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.289 
seem to be at peace now with the US and
unless<00:03:08.250> they're<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.700> bring<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.120> some

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
unless they're going to bring in some

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.600 
unless they're going to bring in some
massive<00:03:09.510> turn<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.319> some<00:03:11.010> absolutely

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
massive turn and some absolutely

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.090 
massive turn and some absolutely
incredible<00:03:11.700> plot<00:03:12.390> twists<00:03:12.959> then<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.830> doesn't

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
incredible plot twists then it doesn't

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.979 
incredible plot twists then it doesn't
like<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:14.549> going<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.850> be<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> case<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:15.720> it

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
like this going to be the case but it

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.930 
like this going to be the case but it
could<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.010> know<00:03:17.220> just<00:03:17.459> hear<00:03:17.700> me<00:03:17.820> out<00:03:17.850> on

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
could be so you know just hear me out on

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.699 
could be so you know just hear me out on
what<00:03:18.329> I've<00:03:18.420> got<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.660> say<00:03:18.720> here<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.470> lot<00:03:19.680> of

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
what I've got to say here and a lot of

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.979 
what I've got to say here and a lot of
people<00:03:20.070> thought<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.549> ghosts<00:03:21.239> who<00:03:21.390> died<00:03:21.750> in

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
people thought that ghosts who died in

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.930 
people thought that ghosts who died in
modern<00:03:22.260> warfare<00:03:22.410> 2<00:03:22.590> might<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.489> been<00:03:23.670> coming

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
modern warfare 2 might have been coming

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.550 
modern warfare 2 might have been coming
back<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.299> modern<00:03:24.540> warfare<00:03:24.690> 3<00:03:24.840> some<00:03:25.290> people

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
back in modern warfare 3 some people

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.050 
back in modern warfare 3 some people
thought<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.220> actually<00:03:26.430> didn't<00:03:26.970> die

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
thought that that I actually didn't die

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.759 
thought that that I actually didn't die
and<00:03:27.450> if<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.959> do<00:03:28.109> look<00:03:28.260> at<00:03:28.440> some<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.709> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
and if you do look at some of the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.949 
and if you do look at some of the
footage<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.459> little<00:03:29.910> bit<00:03:30.000> closely<00:03:30.420> then<00:03:30.630> you

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
footage a little bit closely then you

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.539 
footage a little bit closely then you
know<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.290> debatable<00:03:31.769> whether<00:03:31.890> he<00:03:32.160> died<00:03:32.340> or

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
know it is debatable whether he died or

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.640 
know it is debatable whether he died or
not<00:03:32.690> but<00:03:33.690> he<00:03:33.750> didn't<00:03:33.989> come<00:03:34.079> back<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.440> modern

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
not but he didn't come back in modern

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.500 
not but he didn't come back in modern
warfare<00:03:34.799> 3<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.430> now<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> lot<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.120> people<00:03:36.269> have

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
warfare 3 and now a lot of people have

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.240 
warfare 3 and now a lot of people have
speculated<00:03:36.810> again<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.620> he<00:03:37.709> might<00:03:37.890> be<00:03:38.010> coming

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
speculated again that he might be coming

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.099 
speculated again that he might be coming
back<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.640> modern<00:03:39.180> warfare<00:03:39.299> 4<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.840> all

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
back in modern warfare 4 this is all

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.770 
back in modern warfare 4 this is all
providing<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.769> he<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.010> alive<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.579> course<00:03:41.780> he

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
providing that he is alive of course he

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.990 
providing that he is alive of course he
dies<00:03:43.019> in<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.260> scene<00:03:43.620> near<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.310> helicopter

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
dies in that scene near the helicopter

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.840 
dies in that scene near the helicopter
where<00:03:45.239> he<00:03:45.420> seems<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.780> get<00:03:45.900> shot<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.850> gets

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
where he seems to get shot and gets

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.180 
where he seems to get shot and gets
poured<00:03:48.120> gas<00:03:48.359> all<00:03:48.630> over<00:03:48.959> him<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.440> set<00:03:49.920> alight

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
poured gas all over him and set alight

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.830 
poured gas all over him and set alight
but<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.760> interesting<00:03:51.180> thing<00:03:51.359> is<00:03:51.540> he<00:03:51.630> don't

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
but the interesting thing is he don't

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.449 
but the interesting thing is he don't
actually<00:03:52.019> make<00:03:52.290> an<00:03:52.530> appearance<00:03:52.829> in<00:03:53.130> modern

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
you know whether that means that ghost

of Duty or nice hard to tell really but

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.330 
of Duty or nice hard to tell really but
it's<00:04:34.990> definitely<00:04:35.139> food<00:04:35.680> for<00:04:35.860> thought<00:04:36.099> and

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
it's definitely food for thought and

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.089 
it's definitely food for thought and
with<00:04:36.669> him<00:04:36.879> if<00:04:37.120> he<00:04:37.689> was<00:04:38.229> alive<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.860> modern

with him if he was alive and in modern
warfare<00:04:39.280> 4<00:04:39.430> then<00:04:39.789> they<00:04:39.939> could've<00:04:40.270> could<00:04:40.780> link

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
warfare 4 then they could've could link

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.020 
warfare 4 then they could've could link
it<00:04:41.199> back<00:04:41.349> into<00:04:41.650> some<00:04:42.069> of<00:04:42.159> the<00:04:42.280> stories<00:04:43.000> from

it back into some of the stories from
the<00:04:43.300> past<00:04:43.509> you<00:04:43.659> know<00:04:43.750> getting<00:04:43.990> revenge<00:04:44.229> on

the past you know getting revenge on
people<00:04:44.560> maybe<00:04:45.039> and<00:04:45.599> that's<00:04:46.599> how<00:04:46.900> they<00:04:47.080> could

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
people maybe and that's how they could

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.529 
people maybe and that's how they could
perhaps<00:04:47.740> link<00:04:48.099> modern<00:04:48.370> warfare<00:04:48.550> 2<00:04:48.819> &amp;<00:04:49.120> 3<00:04:49.150> in

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
perhaps link modern warfare 2 &amp; 3 in

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.510 
perhaps link modern warfare 2 &amp; 3 in
with<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.020> modern<00:04:50.289> warfare<00:04:50.439> for<00:04:50.860> lots<00:04:51.400> of

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
different possibilities for them I hope

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.749 
different possibilities for them I hope
they<00:04:53.229> picked<00:04:53.409> the<00:04:53.500> right<00:04:53.680> one<00:04:53.889> because<00:04:54.280> it

they picked the right one because it

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.369 
they picked the right one because it
really<00:04:54.789> will<00:04:55.150> be<00:04:55.270> make<00:04:55.479> or<00:04:55.659> break<00:04:55.810> this<00:04:56.139> game
