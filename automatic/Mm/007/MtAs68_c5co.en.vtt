00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.450
 The influence is on Studio Ghibli. 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.800
 Post Ghibli 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.830
 There is a reception desk for emails, but it also arrived there 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.529
 From within the mail 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.509
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.529
 Just another arrival 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.300
 The season is summer 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.810
 Under-season wearing long-sleeved clothes and having which submission 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.489
 Certainly I also thought that 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:29.890
 I'm wondering 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.170
 According to the director, go to this place and listen to the story of that area 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.630
 came 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.590
 According to the director 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.040
 False of this work 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.980
 Even a little more in summer 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.840
 A little refreshing Iki 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.110
 It seems to have assumed about May or June 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.589
 Yeah 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.130
 In this work 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.510
 Sometimes flowers of daisies 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 It comes out, but this is just the story of the best place 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.700
 I guess what 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 It was easy 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.030
 I have a long sleeve, though 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.140
 It seems to come out other than that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
 People are also wearing long sleeves for marriage 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.700
 Yes, this was Korea's milestone but before that 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.090
 Miyazaki has sometimes said that he left the project 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.760
 This is right 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.670
 Yes, change what was going around while going out hunting 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.520
 It is a thing 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 Because we walk in the foliage 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.830
 I have worn long sleeves to avoid shellfish 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.190
 Then clothes 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.610
 Busy and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.100
 It is hard to walk in Fukui City on active day 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 When I went to clothes, I put on clothes that fit my body 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 It seems that tl-52 has been explained 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.540
 Well there is such a circumstance, Arich is that everyone 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.120
 As you saw in the open air 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.840
 Wear long-sleeved cargill clothes 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.960
 Second-hand 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.060
 I was taught 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.060
 Tomorrow is this average again 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.549
 There was one more story about clothes 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.549
 I think I want to stick
