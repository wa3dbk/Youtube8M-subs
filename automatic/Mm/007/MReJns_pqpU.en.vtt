this<00:01:44.640> college<00:01:45.270> playbook<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.259> complex

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
this college playbook just is so complex

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.800 
this college playbook just is so complex
i<00:01:46.890> mean<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.159> basically<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.880> pro<00:01:48.119> system<00:01:48.600> but

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
i mean it's basically a pro system but

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
i mean it's basically a pro system but
um<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.590> know<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> easiest<00:01:49.920> i<00:01:50.280> guess<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:50.610> be

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
um you know the easiest i guess would be

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.700 
um you know the easiest i guess would be
just<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> school<00:01:51.509> work<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.899> because<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
just a school work just because it's so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.960 
just a school work just because it's so
far<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.070> pretty<00:01:53.159> similar<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.579> high<00:01:53.700> school

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
far it's pretty similar to high school

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.630 
far it's pretty similar to high school
and<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:55.979> I'm<00:01:56.100> pretty<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.520> the
