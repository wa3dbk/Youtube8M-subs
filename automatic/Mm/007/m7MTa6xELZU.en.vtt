00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629 

so<00:00:00.630> next<00:00:00.900> we're<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.650> debug<00:00:02.070> it<00:00:02.250> further

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so next we're going to debug it further

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.039 
so next we're going to debug it further
by<00:00:03.510> using<00:00:03.830> Texas<00:00:04.830> display<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.810> anything<00:00:06.810> you

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
by using Texas display and anything you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.480 
by using Texas display and anything you
tie<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:08.040> pd3<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.230> wires<00:00:10.530> pd3

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
tie to pd3 and that wires pd3

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.829 
tie to pd3 and that wires pd3
we<00:00:12.150> can<00:00:12.360> measure<00:00:12.690> both<00:00:13.790> its<00:00:14.790> amplitude<00:00:15.389> and

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
we can measure both its amplitude and

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.010 
we can measure both its amplitude and
its<00:00:16.440> amplitude<00:00:17.010> versus<00:00:17.670> time<00:00:18.000> plot<00:00:18.359> or

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
its amplitude versus time plot or

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.730 
its amplitude versus time plot or
oscilloscope<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.400> line<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.930> turn<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.230> on

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
oscilloscope on that line so turn it on

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.609 
oscilloscope on that line so turn it on
we're<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.180> plug<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.570> into<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.050> output<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
we're on so plug it into the output of

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.859 
we're on so plug it into the output of
the<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.699> LEDs<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> output<00:00:27.660> of

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the of the LEDs this is the output of

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.990 
the of the LEDs this is the output of
the<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> microcontroller<00:00:29.099> we've<00:00:29.699> tied

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the of the microcontroller we've tied

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.420 
the of the microcontroller we've tied
the<00:00:30.689> scope<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.590> into<00:00:32.690> PE<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:34.950> type<00:00:35.160> in

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the scope here into PE for so we type in

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.490 
the scope here into PE for so we type in
III<00:00:35.880> 2<00:00:36.149> PE<00:00:36.360> 4<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.020> here<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> am<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.739> Texas<00:00:38.010> display

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
III 2 PE 4 so here I am in Texas display

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.990 
III 2 PE 4 so here I am in Texas display
we've<00:00:40.500> seen<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.890> before<00:00:40.950> we're<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.879> going

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
we've seen this before we're just going

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.170 
we've seen this before we're just going
to<00:00:42.030> open<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:44.100> connect<00:00:44.700> me<00:00:44.910> I'm

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
to open it up this will connect me I'm

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.040 
to open it up this will connect me I'm
going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.010> Silla<00:00:47.010> scope<00:00:47.309> mode<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
going to go to Silla scope mode and so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.040 
going to go to Silla scope mode and so
now<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.030> output<00:00:51.600> which

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
now we see that we have the output which

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.819 
now we see that we have the output which
is<00:00:52.079> 0<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.460> zoom<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.559> we

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
is 0 I'm going to zoom in so that we

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.939 
is 0 I'm going to zoom in so that we
have<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.370> longer<00:00:57.120> time<00:00:57.390> scale<00:00:57.690> alright<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.440> once

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
have a longer time scale alright so once

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.529 
have a longer time scale alright so once
you<00:00:59.039> arm<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.620> now<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.539> it's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
you arm it and you can see now that it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.289 
you arm it and you can see now that it's
armed<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.530> light<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.890> flashing<00:01:05.299> but

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
armed the light is flashing but

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.179 
armed the light is flashing but
something<00:01:06.720> interesting<00:01:06.900> has<00:01:07.380> happened<00:01:07.409> here

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
something interesting has happened here

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.109 
something interesting has happened here
and<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:10.070> will<00:01:11.070> pause<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.909> can

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and that is I will pause it so we can

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
and that is I will pause it so we can
see<00:01:12.750> pause<00:01:14.479> we<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.650> time

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
see pause we can see here that this time

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
see pause we can see here that this time
right<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:18.470> should<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.500> been<00:01:20.869> 100

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
right here should have been 100

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.890 
right here should have been 100
milliseconds<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.700> time<00:01:24.000> between<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
milliseconds but the time between and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 
milliseconds but the time between and
this<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.250> should<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.549> been<00:01:26.670> 200

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this one here should have been 200

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
this one here should have been 200
milliseconds<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.070> particular

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
milliseconds but in this particular

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.420 
milliseconds but in this particular
system<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:33.200> 236<00:01:34.280> milliseconds<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
system it's actually 236 milliseconds a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.999 
system it's actually 236 milliseconds a
little<00:01:35.820> bit<00:01:35.970> slower<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> rather<00:01:37.710> than

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
little bit slower so rather than

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.249 
little bit slower so rather than
oscillating<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:39.000> 5<00:01:39.390> Hertz<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.930> oscillating

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
oscillating at 5 Hertz it's oscillating

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.679 
oscillating at 5 Hertz it's oscillating
a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.710> bit<00:01:40.829> slower<00:01:41.100> we'll<00:01:42.060> still<00:01:42.390> call<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
a little bit slower we'll still call it

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.780 
a little bit slower we'll still call it
working

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
working

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
working
so<00:01:44.790> now<00:01:45.000> let's<00:01:45.570> test<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.530> make<00:01:46.649> sure<00:01:46.799> Ramesh

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
so now let's test and make sure Ramesh

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.609 
so now let's test and make sure Ramesh
interface<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.180> LED<00:01:48.600> properly<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> we're

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
interface the LED properly and we're

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.630 
interface the LED properly and we're
going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.799> notice<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> actual

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
going to notice that the actual

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.730 
going to notice that the actual
measurements<00:01:51.390> are<00:01:51.540> different<00:01:52.079> than<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
measurements are different than the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.639 
measurements are different than the
theory<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.729> first<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.110> will<00:01:55.259> notice

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
theory the first is if we will notice

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.280 
theory the first is if we will notice
here<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.250> voltage<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.780> output<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
here that the voltage on the output of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.370 
here that the voltage on the output of
the<00:01:58.469> pin<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> actually<00:02:00.540> not<00:02:00.750> three<00:02:01.140> point

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the pin here is actually not three point

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.609 
the pin here is actually not three point
three<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.310> 3<00:02:02.640> volts<00:02:03.030> ok<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.170> move<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
three but it's 3 volts ok so now move it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.399 
three but it's 3 volts ok so now move it
over<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> other<00:02:05.189> side<00:02:05.520> ramesh<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.200> I'm

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
over to the other side ramesh so now I'm

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.910 
over to the other side ramesh so now I'm
moving<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:09.020> check<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.229> voltage<00:02:10.379> between

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
moving it to check the voltage between

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.360 
moving it to check the voltage between
the<00:02:11.250> led

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
the led

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.009 
the led
the<00:02:12.599> resistor<00:02:13.599> alright<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:15.160> we'll<00:02:16.000> pause<00:02:16.269> it<00:02:16.599> F

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
the resistor alright so we'll pause it F

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.470 
the resistor alright so we'll pause it F
okay<00:02:20.019> pause<00:02:20.349> it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
okay pause it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.619 
okay pause it
okay<00:02:22.480> Ramesh<00:02:22.840> let's<00:02:23.650> look<00:02:23.860> at<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.129> circuit

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
okay Ramesh let's look at this circuit

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.420 
okay Ramesh let's look at this circuit
the<00:02:25.629> output<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.769> microcontroller<00:02:29.430> goes

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the output of the microcontroller goes

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.110 
the output of the microcontroller goes
through<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.349> 470<00:02:32.349> ohm<00:02:32.590> resistor<00:02:33.310> right<00:02:33.549> here

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
through the 470 ohm resistor right here

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.780 
through the 470 ohm resistor right here
to<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.230> LED<00:02:37.140> what<00:02:38.140> we<00:02:38.260> were<00:02:38.410> expecting<00:02:39.129> was<00:02:39.610> to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
to the LED what we were expecting was to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.500 
to the LED what we were expecting was to
get<00:02:39.970> 1.8<00:02:40.660> volts<00:02:40.930> across<00:02:41.650> here<00:02:42.549> we<00:02:43.420> were

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
get 1.8 volts across here we were

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.759 
get 1.8 volts across here we were
expecting<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.349> 3.3<00:02:45.220> volts<00:02:45.640> there<00:02:46.079> but<00:02:47.079> you<00:02:47.560> can

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
expecting a 3.3 volts there but you can

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.080 
expecting a 3.3 volts there but you can
see<00:02:48.040> what<00:02:48.280> we<00:02:48.430> got

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
see what we got

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.270 
see what we got
this<00:02:49.630> wasn't<00:02:49.989> 3.3<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:50.950> could<00:02:51.069> actually

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
this wasn't 3.3 you could actually

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.069 
this wasn't 3.3 you could actually
measure<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.970> be<00:02:52.090> 3<00:02:52.390> volts<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:54.130> wasn't

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
measure to be 3 volts and this wasn't

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.160 
measure to be 3 volts and this wasn't
1.8<00:02:56.079> it<00:02:56.440> was<00:02:56.920> one<00:02:57.250> point<00:02:57.519> six<00:02:58.120> eight<00:02:58.329> which

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
1.8 it was one point six eight which

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.270 
1.8 it was one point six eight which
means<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.040> voltage<00:03:00.489> drop<00:03:00.910> across<00:03:01.360> here

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
means that the voltage drop across here

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.500 
means that the voltage drop across here
was<00:03:03.280> one<00:03:04.030> point<00:03:04.829> three<00:03:05.829> two<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.670> if<00:03:07.120> we<00:03:07.269> take

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
was one point three two and if we take

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.690 
was one point three two and if we take
that<00:03:07.569> voltage<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.650> divide<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.190> by<00:03:09.690> 470<00:03:10.690> ohms

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
that voltage and divide it by 470 ohms

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.990 
that voltage and divide it by 470 ohms
rather<00:03:12.700> than<00:03:13.060> getting<00:03:13.390> three<00:03:13.840> milliamps<00:03:18.000> what

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
rather than getting three milliamps what

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.509 
rather than getting three milliamps what
we<00:03:19.150> got<00:03:19.420> was<00:03:20.049> two<00:03:20.319> point<00:03:20.650> eight<00:03:20.799> millionths

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
we got was two point eight millionths

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.420 
we got was two point eight millionths
and<00:03:22.359> now<00:03:22.510> ramesh<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.530> very<00:03:23.829> very<00:03:24.100> close

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
and now ramesh this is very very close

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.150 
and now ramesh this is very very close
but<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.510> illustrates<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.680> difference

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
but it illustrates the difference

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.920 
but it illustrates the difference
between<00:03:27.420> theory<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.739> practice<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.569> I'd<00:03:31.750> have

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
between theory and practice so I'd have

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.220 
between theory and practice so I'd have
to<00:03:31.989> say<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.609> summary<00:03:34.359> what<00:03:34.630> we<00:03:34.780> had<00:03:34.989> is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
to say that in summary what we had is

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.160 
to say that in summary what we had is
our<00:03:35.470> system<00:03:35.980> ran<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> little<00:03:36.519> bit<00:03:36.760> slow<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.959> not

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
our system ran a little bit slow but not

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.379 
our system ran a little bit slow but not
too<00:03:38.410> slow<00:03:38.590> we're<00:03:38.950> still<00:03:39.160> call<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.400> working<00:03:39.730> and

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
too slow we're still call it working and

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.120 
too slow we're still call it working and
it<00:03:40.510> had<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.079> little<00:03:41.380> bit<00:03:41.530> less<00:03:41.739> current

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
it had just a little bit less current

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.220 
it had just a little bit less current
than<00:03:42.220> we<00:03:42.430> expected<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.630> plenty<00:03:43.900> bright

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
than we expected but plenty bright

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.190 
than we expected but plenty bright
enough<00:03:44.440> for<00:03:44.500> us<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.910> that's<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.450> we<00:03:46.720> built<00:03:47.019> it

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
enough for us so that's it we built it

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.530 
enough for us so that's it we built it
and<00:03:47.319> tested<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.829> trying<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.669> ship<00:03:49.359> it<00:03:49.569> yeah
