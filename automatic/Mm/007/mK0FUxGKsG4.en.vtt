hi<00:00:01.140> everyone<00:00:01.560> I'm<00:00:01.860> mr.<00:00:02.460> Fullerton<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.060> today

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hi everyone I'm mr. Fullerton and today

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.240 
hi everyone I'm mr. Fullerton and today
I'd<00:00:03.689> like<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.929> talk<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.589> for<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.890> little<00:00:05.130> bit

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
I'd like to talk to you for a little bit

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.509 
I'd like to talk to you for a little bit
about<00:00:05.520> power<00:00:05.970> our<00:00:06.560> goals<00:00:07.560> are<00:00:07.859> going<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.099> be<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
about power our goals are going to be to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.089 
about power our goals are going to be to
define<00:00:08.970> power<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.719> then<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.290> calculate<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
define power and then to calculate the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.850 
define power and then to calculate the
power<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.670> system<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> begin<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.440> what

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
power of a system so to begin with what

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.609 
power of a system so to begin with what
is<00:00:13.889> power<00:00:14.340> while<00:00:15.179> power<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.049> rate<00:00:16.320> at

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
is power while power is the rate at

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.130 
is power while power is the rate at
which<00:00:16.650> work<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.279> done<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.330> calculate<00:00:18.990> it

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
which work is done and we calculate it

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.980 
which work is done and we calculate it
power<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.279> work<00:00:20.490> done<00:00:20.689> divided<00:00:21.689> by<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
power is the work done divided by the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.170 
power is the work done divided by the
time<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.619> took<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.859> do<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.340> amount<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.000> work

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
time it took to do that amount of work

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.109 
time it took to do that amount of work
so<00:00:24.900> capital<00:00:25.380> P<00:00:25.590> power<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.340> work<00:00:26.550> over<00:00:26.880> time

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
so capital P power is work over time

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.359 
so capital P power is work over time
then<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.109> units<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> units<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.340> work

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
then the units are the units of work

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.720 
then the units are the units of work
over<00:00:29.849> time<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.359> joules<00:00:30.900> per<00:00:31.109> second<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.980> Joule

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
over time or joules per second a Joule

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.510 
over time or joules per second a Joule
per<00:00:32.759> second<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> also<00:00:33.809> known<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.559> watt<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
per second is also known as a watt a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.270 
per second is also known as a watt a
watt<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.540> abbreviated<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> capital<00:00:37.920> W

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
watt is abbreviated with the capital W

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220 
watt is abbreviated with the capital W
so<00:00:38.489> you've<00:00:38.640> got<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.059> careful<00:00:39.329> work<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
so you've got to be careful work is

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.459 
so you've got to be careful work is
capital<00:00:40.860> W<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.879> units<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.600> power<00:00:42.840> watts

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
capital W and the units of power watts

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.520 
capital W and the units of power watts
or<00:00:43.739> capital<00:00:44.219> W<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.539> careful<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
or capital W so be very careful as to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.560 
or capital W so be very careful as to
how<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.950> write<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.730> units<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.360> your

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
how you write your units and your

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.690 
how you write your units and your
formulas<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> mix<00:00:50.160> things<00:00:50.430> up

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
formulas you don't want to mix things up

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.400 
formulas you don't want to mix things up
or<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.000> could<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.329> things<00:00:51.570> confused<00:00:51.750> very

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
or you could get things confused very

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.150 
or you could get things confused very
very<00:00:52.800> easily<00:00:53.899> now<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.230> possible<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
very easily now it is possible to do the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
very easily now it is possible to do the
same<00:00:56.399> amount<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.879> work<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> different

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
same amount of work but have a different

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.930 
same amount of work but have a different
power<00:00:58.170> output<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.100> takes<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> different

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
power output if it takes you a different

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.270 
power output if it takes you a different
amount<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.359> time<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:01.289> people<00:01:01.649> doing<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> same

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
amount of time to people doing the same

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.009 
amount of time to people doing the same
amount<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.640> work<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.300> who<00:01:03.449> does<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.690> work

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
amount of work the one who does the work

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
amount of work the one who does the work
faster<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> higher<00:01:05.580> power<00:01:06.119> output

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
faster will have a higher power output

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
faster will have a higher power output
even<00:01:07.200> though<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> same<00:01:07.799> amount<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.189> work<00:01:08.430> was

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
even though the same amount of work was

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.510 
even though the same amount of work was
completed<00:01:09.740> let's<00:01:10.740> take<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.220> at<00:01:11.340> some

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
completed let's take a look at some

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.570 
completed let's take a look at some
examples<00:01:12.060> Rob<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.110> Peter<00:01:13.409> move<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.830> sofa<00:01:14.040> three

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
examples Rob and Peter move a sofa three

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
examples Rob and Peter move a sofa three
meters<00:01:14.909> across<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.420> floor<00:01:15.659> by<00:01:15.840> applying<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
meters across the floor by applying a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.350 
meters across the floor by applying a
combined<00:01:16.890> force<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.430> 200<00:01:17.670> Newtons

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
combined force of 200 Newtons

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.109 
combined force of 200 Newtons
horizontally<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.799> takes<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.280> six<00:01:20.610> seconds

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
horizontally it takes them six seconds

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
horizontally it takes them six seconds
to<00:01:21.180> move<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> sofa<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.290> amount<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.710> power

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to move the sofa so what amount of power

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.030 
to move the sofa so what amount of power
did<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:23.400> supply<00:01:24.140> well<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.860> we

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
did they supply well to do this we

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.319 
did they supply well to do this we
recognize<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.580> power<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.479> work<00:01:28.290> overtime

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
recognize that power is work overtime

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.730 
recognize that power is work overtime
work<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.710> F<00:01:31.710> cos<00:01:32.640> theta<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.390> force<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
work is F cos theta the force in the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.340 
work is F cos theta the force in the
direction<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.030> displacement<00:01:36.210> divided<00:01:37.200> by

and the displacement are in the same
direction<00:01:41.909> Coast<00:01:42.570> data<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.079> zero<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:44.100> so

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
direction Coast data is zero or one so

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.490 
direction Coast data is zero or one so
we<00:01:45.840> end<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.290> force<00:01:47.009> 200<00:01:47.670> Newton's<00:01:48.500> times

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
we end up with force 200 Newton's times
