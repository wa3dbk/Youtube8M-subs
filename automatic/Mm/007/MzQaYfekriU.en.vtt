00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.940

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.860
 new on island minecraft news for 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.110
 bring the latest news of the 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.640
 new version of minecraft surely 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.460
 this is the last island minecraft news 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.919
 what about the 1.4 that comes out tomorrow 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 Wednesday or not already you will see why I say 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.070
 this so nothing we're going to start 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 he does not do anything he has told us in a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.570
 twitter this morning that the 1.4 is going to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.180
 delay one day is to say that instead 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 Wednesday afternoon the 1.4 will come out 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.980
 Thursday morning but the version 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.309
 that will come out on Thursday will no longer be 1.4 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.839
 but the 1.4 point 1 and this is due to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.699
 that mo yan has solved some bugs 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.019
 of importance and have wanted to do what 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.720
 same as they did if I remember correctly 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.199
 with the 1.3 directly draw a 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.760
 dot version 15 minutes later 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.979
 links nothing else has commented on another 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.379
 tweet more in detail the books that 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.879
 have fixed the first of all is the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.009
 that occurred when we locked 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.780
 many mobs in a room which 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.670
 caused that some many even 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.259
 crossing walls has also been 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.360
 arranged a visual book that had the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.820
 slabs and stairs that I suppose 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.259
 will be the lighting ship finally 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.149
 a bus that did 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.950
 that some moves went through floors and 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.780
 roofs which caused that for example 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.580
 some enemies looked like they were in 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.170
 your room when they were actually 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.170
 several floors below or above 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.950
 and that has been all for the moment 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.159
 finally we will have to wait one day 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.840
 more so that the 1.4 comes out this is going to be 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.220
 today's video I know it is very short 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 but I'm preparing the video 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.210
 of the novelties of the 1.4 that are 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.640
 very many and I do not want to forget 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.270
 nothing and nothing more a greeting and until the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.270
 next video
