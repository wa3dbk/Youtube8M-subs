00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
infections the most common reason kids

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.670 
infections the most common reason kids
go<00:00:20.240> to<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.420> doctor<00:00:20.720> there's<00:00:21.200> about<00:00:21.350> 20

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
go to the doctor there's about 20

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.080 
go to the doctor there's about 20
million<00:00:21.860> visits<00:00:22.310> for<00:00:22.460> your<00:00:22.550> infection<00:00:22.940> per

year<00:00:23.270> in<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.450> US<00:00:23.690> and<00:00:23.960> we're<00:00:24.500> trying<00:00:24.830> to<00:00:24.890> make

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
year in the US and we're trying to make

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.320 
year in the US and we're trying to make
it<00:00:25.130> easier<00:00:25.370> so<00:00:25.520> families<00:00:25.880> can<00:00:25.910> do<00:00:26.120> it<00:00:26.180> from

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
it easier so families can do it from

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.790 
it easier so families can do it from
home<00:00:26.450> so<00:00:27.110> we've<00:00:27.230> got<00:00:27.350> our<00:00:27.470> hardware

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
home so we've got our hardware

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.440 
home so we've got our hardware
attachment<00:00:28.340> that<00:00:28.430> clips<00:00:28.670> onto<00:00:28.850> the<00:00:29.000> phone<00:00:29.210> I

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
attachment that clips onto the phone I

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.740 
attachment that clips onto the phone I
like<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.200> and<00:00:30.470> then<00:00:31.250> our<00:00:31.430> app<00:00:31.580> runs<00:00:32.300> on<00:00:32.509> there

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
like so and then our app runs on there

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.660 
like so and then our app runs on there
and<00:00:32.930> communicates<00:00:33.470> with<00:00:33.740> our<00:00:33.980> secure<00:00:34.520> web

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
and communicates with our secure web

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.819 
and communicates with our secure web
back-end<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:35.750> we<00:00:35.900> can<00:00:36.110> send<00:00:36.350> an<00:00:36.470> image<00:00:36.680> from

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
back-end so we can send an image from

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.590 
back-end so we can send an image from
home<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:37.280> a<00:00:37.310> doctor<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:37.940> help<00:00:38.150> to<00:00:38.300> make<00:00:38.390> that

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
home to a doctor and help to make that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.170 
home to a doctor and help to make that
diagnosis<00:00:39.140> Wow<00:00:39.829> and<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.310> is<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.760> using<00:00:41.030> any

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
diagnosis Wow and and is it using any

class one 510k exempt medical device so

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.520 
class one 510k exempt medical device so
you<00:00:59.420> went<00:00:59.630> through<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.840> FDA<00:01:00.110> approval

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
you went through the FDA approval

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.560 
you went through the FDA approval
process<00:01:00.590> what<00:01:01.370> was<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:01.550> like<00:01:01.730> what<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:02.450> we

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
and web development really it takes a

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.070 
and web development really it takes a
lot<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.650> put<00:01:39.890> all<00:01:39.979> these<00:01:40.070> pieces<00:01:40.280> together<00:01:40.490> and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
lot to put all these pieces together and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.420 
lot to put all these pieces together and

was<00:02:14.620> working<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.069> postdoc<00:02:15.580> initially<00:02:16.180> on

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
was working as a postdoc initially on

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.020 
was working as a postdoc initially on
mobile<00:02:16.989> microscopes<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.220> we<00:02:18.370> developed<00:02:18.819> some

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
mobile microscopes so we developed some

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.610 
mobile microscopes so we developed some
of<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.180> first<00:02:19.209> mobile<00:02:19.629> microscopes<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.440> clip

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
of the first mobile microscopes to clip

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.850 
of the first mobile microscopes to clip
onto<00:02:20.800> phones<00:02:21.099> back<00:02:21.489> in<00:02:21.840> 2005<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.590> took

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
onto phones back in 2005 or so and took

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.440 
onto phones back in 2005 or so and took
it<00:02:23.950> out<00:02:24.069> for<00:02:24.280> developing<00:02:24.640> world<00:02:24.819> diagnosis

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it out for developing world diagnosis

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.030 
it out for developing world diagnosis
and<00:02:25.810> now<00:02:26.049> we're<00:02:26.200> trying<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.440> turn<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.739> into<00:02:26.799> a
