00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.170
 typically autumnal recipe the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.839
 castagnaccio with the characteristic dessert 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.370
 from Tuscany that has now set foot 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.160
 a little throughout northern Italy 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.440
 it is a rather special cake 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.139
 which leaves a taste in the mouth 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.869
 tico pleasantly bitter that can that can 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.670
 pleasure or not exist different 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.410
 variants of castagnaccio such as 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.720
 the child who besides the classics 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.570
 ingredients or chestnut flour 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.689
 sultanas and pine nuts are also found 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.059
 rosemary and walnut kernels today 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.329
 however we will resign in realizing 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:42.030
 the classic castagnaccio we see which 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:46.500
 are the ingredients we find 250 g of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.100
 chestnut flour then still 50 g of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.379
 caster sugar 100 g raisins 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.430
 sultana 30 g of pine nuts a little oil 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.670
 extra virgin olive oil 125 milliliters of 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 milk 125 milliliters of water or 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.740
 we can replace milk and put 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 all water to make the cake a little 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.700
 lighter and finally some 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.700
 powdered sugar for powdering 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.900
 let's see the preparation a lot now 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.200
 simple first we go to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.299
 take the raisins and let's go to a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.950
 let it go then let's add 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.409
 for very hot water boiling so 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.689
 to make it soft and leave it here 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 for a couple of minutes a couple of minutes 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.079
 are enough we take the flour of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.259
 chestnuts and we put it in a boule 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.939
 large sugar that I said 50 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.490
 grams you can also add some 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.790
 more because castagnaccio leaves in 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.220
 mouth a bitter taste and therefore 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.710
 maybe we could go and add one 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.610
 higher amount of sugar per 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.350
 make it a little sweeter then pine nuts 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:12.240
 I put 30 grams then a little more 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.660
 of extra virgin olive oil a couple of 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.660
 tablespoons 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:32.910
 let's add a water and milk 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.590
 the recipe is almost ready now you need to 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.010
 just go and add 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.720
 the sultanas so what to do 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:46.610
 we hydrated it a little with water 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.610
 let's go to Ascoli now like this 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.350
 let's go and put it directly 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.820
 in the dough is enough now 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.730
 simply mix until obtaining 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:07.709
 a compound similar to a thick pudding 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:13.800
 so given the right consistency for 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:16.980
 castagnaccio we are to mix problem 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.270
 the ingredients those who like can add 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.360
 even a spoonful of bitter cocoa 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.519
 just that I almost never add it e 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.790
 precisely because it is already 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.950
 chestnuts from that 2 bitter taste I say though 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.130
 let's add cocoa too 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.640
 bitter and makes the dessert even more more 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.920
 strong and I don't particularly love him 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.910
 the dough is ready now take into 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.700
 a baking pan 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.519
 I put the hinged project 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.390
 the baking paper lined with paper 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.090
 baked and then the walls went to 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.459
 brush with the butter then ho 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.100
 past of the flour to prevent the 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.880
 pasta that the castagnaccio sticks to 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.870
 we go to the walls of the pan 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.120
 simply to put the castagnaccio 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.269
 inside the pot of the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.269
 baking tin 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.420
 you can even take a licks pot 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.450
 to remove all the dough better 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.150
 from the bull 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.000
 this is why I took your own 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.900
 spoon with silicone to make 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.920
 easier then the maneuver is insufficient 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.490
 spread the castagnaccio in the pan 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.090
 for bombs ne yo also advise of 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.900
 complete with a tablespoon of oil 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.450
 extra virgin olive oil in this way 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.580
 let's take another spoon 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.870
 a little oil, even half a spoon is 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:02.550
 so that's fine and we forget about it above 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:05.580
 the sweet and then with the back of poker ai 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:14.820
 let's sprinkle it all over the whole 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:15.660
 castagnaccio here is the sweet therefore 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.550
 full 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.460
 we just have to put it in the oven at 180 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.490
 degrees for 20 30 minutes until 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.210
 on the surface or notice a crust 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.930
 golden 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:33.310
 let's go straight to everything ok 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.740
 need heated to 180 degrees e 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.220
 this is the result after 30 minutes of 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.530
 cooking 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.850
 we also complete with a sprinkle 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.389
 of icing sugar 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.060
 in this way and then I suggest 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:48.759
 the combination with the new wine that is 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:55.560
 just the ideal with castagnaccio 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:59.139
 or with a must we pour grapes 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.699
 and here is good appetite from my personal 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.690
 tv trainer and see you next time 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.690
