00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.789
 so this title is so difficult for the bike it is a matter of course 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.060
 or 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.669
 game rules respond to 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.669
 utrecht 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.590
 7 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.740
 in traffic 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.740
 that is not the case 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 Scholten can also be reversed 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.200
 why not 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.880
 read more 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.790
 law enforcement 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.570
 sell absolutely disagree with an agreement in the riders 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.760
 and 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.840
 so you have to 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.990
 I personally suggested for starters 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 the editors too 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 a little bit more than four times 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.960
 emmen 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 you can sometimes be a lot bigger than me 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.180
 a week before that 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.010
 lw 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.010
 we can come up next week 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
 the remaining package 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 but that was also the news 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.540
 and those are 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.840
 No
