welcome to Minecraft today we'll show

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.240 
welcome to Minecraft today we'll show
you<00:00:02.820> how<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.419> build<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.380> plane<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.069> game

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
you how to build a plane in this game

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.369 
you how to build a plane in this game
that<00:00:05.430> actually<00:00:05.609> works<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.390> flies<00:00:06.660> so<00:00:07.230> let's

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
that actually works and flies so let's

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.350 
that actually works and flies so let's
get<00:00:07.500> started<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.639> first<00:00:08.670> thing<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.059> wanna<00:00:09.179> do

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
get started the first thing you wanna do

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.499 
get started the first thing you wanna do
is<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.780> find<00:00:10.019> an<00:00:10.380> area<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.820> empty<00:00:12.090> and

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
is to find an area that is so empty and

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.350 
is to find an area that is so empty and
suitable<00:00:13.080> for<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.620> plane<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.130> fly<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.910> let's

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
suitable for a plane to fly so let's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.310 
suitable for a plane to fly so let's
find<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.780> area<00:00:16.320> okay<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.760> where<00:00:18.449> shall<00:00:19.109> we

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
find that area okay so where shall we

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.410 
find that area okay so where shall we
find<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.680> area<00:00:19.890> ok<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.820> area<00:00:21.029> looks<00:00:21.210> pretty

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
find this area ok this area looks pretty

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.050 
find this area ok this area looks pretty
good<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.720> actually<00:00:21.810> has<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.650> know<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.039> bunch<00:00:23.850> of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
good it actually has you know a bunch of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.670 
good it actually has you know a bunch of
empty<00:00:24.600> space<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.580> plane<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.269> for<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
empty space for the plane and for the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.339 
empty space for the plane and for the
place<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.810> plane<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.260> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
place so that the plane is going to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.370 
place so that the plane is going to
fight<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:34.170> this

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
fight but I think I just think that this

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.270 
fight but I think I just think that this
tree<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.950> out<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> way<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.500> might<00:00:38.040> want

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
tree is out of the way so I might want

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.780 
tree is out of the way so I might want
to<00:00:38.309> clear<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:39.890> just<00:00:40.890> clear<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.340> tree<00:00:41.550> there

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
to clear it just clear that tree there

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:52.369 
to clear it just clear that tree there
we<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:42.170> come<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:46.940> ok<00:00:48.440> what<00:00:49.440> was<00:00:49.590> there<00:00:51.379> clearing

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
we go come on ok what was there clearing

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.520 
we go come on ok what was there clearing
the<00:00:52.469> tree<00:00:52.710> clearing<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.670> tree<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.719> no<00:00:55.050> reason

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the tree clearing the tree for no reason

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.990 
the tree clearing the tree for no reason
actually<00:00:55.860> there<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> reason<00:00:56.250> ok<00:00:56.820> there<00:00:56.940> we

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
actually there is a reason ok there we

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.869 
actually there is a reason ok there we
go<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.890> tree<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.399> looking<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> way

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
go so now that tree was looking the way

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.930 
go so now that tree was looking the way
and<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.690> plenty<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.230> space<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and now we have plenty of space for the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.990 
and now we have plenty of space for the
plane<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.809> actually<00:01:04.260> fly<00:01:04.500> ok<00:01:05.339> wait<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.640> second

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
plane to actually fly ok wait a second

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.980 
plane to actually fly ok wait a second
what<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990

sleep let's go sleep whatever we can
build<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> plane<00:01:13.110> tomorrow<00:01:13.260> right<00:01:13.560> also

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
build a plane tomorrow right also

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.609 
build a plane tomorrow right also
building<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> plane<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.330> night<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:16.020> good

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
building the plane at night is not good

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.940 
building the plane at night is not good
for<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:16.860> house<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.030> may<00:01:18.950> because

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
die when we fly the plane so yeah it's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
die when we fly the plane so yeah it's
better<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.220> build<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.520> plane<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> freaking

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
better to build a plane in the freaking

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.050 
better to build a plane in the freaking
morning<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.020> we're<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> work<00:01:38.130> ok<00:01:38.490> now

try<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.090> fly<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.620> plane<00:02:46.860> looks<00:02:47.100> a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
try and fly it so the plane looks a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.460

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
other than that the plane is going to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.800 
other than that the plane is going to
work<00:02:55.530> mighty<00:02:55.799> fine<00:02:56.150> let's<00:02:57.150> try<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.450> out<00:02:57.510> okay

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.280 
anyways yeah so this is how you build a
plane<00:03:59.549> in<00:03:59.609> this<00:03:59.670> game<00:03:59.880> what<00:04:00.030> has<00:04:00.180> going<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.480> why

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
plane in this game what has going on why

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.039 
plane in this game what has going on why
is<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.440> question<00:04:01.590> right<00:04:01.890> now<00:04:01.920> it's<00:04:02.700> not<00:04:03.049> okay

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.080 
is the question right now it's not okay
so<00:04:04.079> this<00:04:04.350> is<00:04:04.530> how<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.769> build<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.459> plane<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.970> this

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
so this is how you build a plane in this

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.440 
so this is how you build a plane in this
game

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.479 

apparently<00:04:09.450> when<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.810> flew<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.889> plane<00:04:11.160> into

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
apparently when I flew the plane into

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.300 
apparently when I flew the plane into
the<00:04:11.670> ground<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:12.389> exploded<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.500> huge<00:04:14.010> explosion

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
the ground it exploded a huge explosion

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.659 
the ground it exploded a huge explosion
to<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.700> point<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.389> not<00:04:15.989> just<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.979> it

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
to the point that not just that it

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.979 
to the point that not just that it
exploded<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.510> game<00:04:18.660> though<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.959> actually

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
exploded in the game though it actually

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.319 
exploded in the game though it actually
exploded<00:04:19.709> in<00:04:19.829> real<00:04:20.010> life<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:21.090> savefile

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
exploded in real life and the savefile

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.380 
exploded in real life and the savefile
exploded<00:04:22.140> everything<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.650> closed<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
exploded everything is closed and

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.260 
exploded everything is closed and
everything<00:04:24.390> went<00:04:24.930> down<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.580> yeah

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
everything went down so yeah

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.839 
everything went down so yeah
that's<00:04:27.870> how<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.050> build<00:04:28.289> a<00:04:28.379> plane<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:28.849> be

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
that's how I build a plane but be

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.550 
that's how I build a plane but be
careful<00:04:30.240> do<00:04:30.419> not<00:04:30.449> crash<00:04:31.080> into<00:04:31.319> the<00:04:31.440> ground

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
careful do not crash into the ground

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.950 
careful do not crash into the ground
because<00:04:31.979> it's<00:04:32.160> gonna<00:04:32.310> make<00:04:33.030> your<00:04:33.180> hotel<00:04:33.660> safe

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960
