00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
you want another kind of S shape there

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.589 
you want another kind of S shape there
like<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.020> okay<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.970> want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> draw

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.849 

what<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> question<00:00:31.619> mark

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
what is that it's like a question mark

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.880 
what is that it's like a question mark
put<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.059> there<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> top<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.559> want

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
put that on there and on the top we want

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
put that on there and on the top we want
to<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:36.899> ellipse<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> lid

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
to have a and ellipse and then the lid

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.190 
to have a and ellipse and then the lid
will<00:00:40.020> fit<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> ellipse<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.960> knob

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
will fit into the ellipse so little knob

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.619 
will fit into the ellipse so little knob
on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.379> top<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.890> hold<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.700> there<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.239> go<00:00:45.390> we've

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
on the top to hold it there we go we've

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.260 
on the top to hold it there we go we've
made<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:46.050> pattern<00:00:46.469> room<00:00:46.649> there

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
made some pattern room there

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.779 
made some pattern room there
okay<00:00:48.270> let's<00:00:48.510> shake<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.960> big<00:00:49.280> let's<00:00:50.280> start<00:00:50.579> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
okay let's shake that big let's start on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.740 
okay let's shake that big let's start on
the<00:00:50.879> top<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.930> knob<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.100> go

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
the top with the knob there there we go

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
the top with the knob there there we go
and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.050> draw<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:56.100> line<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.770> then

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and then draw a line like that and then

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.310 
and then draw a line like that and then
the<00:00:59.579> lid<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.510> fit<00:01:00.840> into<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.180> then<00:01:03.320> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the lid can fit into that and then you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.840 
the lid can fit into that and then you
have<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.180> top<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.479> lid<00:01:06.659> fitting<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.200> there

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
have the top of the lid fitting in there

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.500 
have the top of the lid fitting in there
and<00:01:08.850> all<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.390> around<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> top<00:01:11.510> down

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and all the way around to the top down

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.420 
and all the way around to the top down
to<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.409> bottom<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.890> bit<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
to the bottom there a little bit of a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.830 
to the bottom there a little bit of a
bit<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:20.820> feel<00:01:21.090> thumb<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> hold<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:23.840> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
bit they feel thumb to hold on to that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.249 
bit they feel thumb to hold on to that
will<00:01:25.140> come<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.630> join<00:01:29.180> up<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
will come and join up like that and that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.800 
will come and join up like that and that
will<00:01:31.439> join<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> middle<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.820> little

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
will join in the middle there a little

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.960 
will join in the middle there a little
bit<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.229> us<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> stand<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.729> as

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
bit of us think for it to stand on as

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.950 
bit of us think for it to stand on as
have<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.390> kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.810> pattern<00:01:37.549> around<00:01:38.930> there

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.490 

for<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.050> shade<00:01:44.690> maybe<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:45.900> bit<00:01:46.050> of<00:01:46.200> shading

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
for the shade maybe a bit of shading

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.120 
for the shade maybe a bit of shading
there<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.460> shading<00:01:47.730> there<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
there bit of shading there and there you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.470 
there bit of shading there and there you
go<00:01:50.310> how<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.550> draw<00:01:50.760> a<00:01:50.790> teapot
