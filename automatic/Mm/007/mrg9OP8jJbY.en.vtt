 the foundry of the notebook includes a disturbing casing and ite happens that is 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.480
 in the foundry I went reindeer for coolant and oil 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.530
 the pad reinforcement plate 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.780
 the engine blog skirt is mounted using screws from men lying 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.430
 the screws allow the plate provides alkaline edition resistance 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.099
 every temple 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.529
 each engine block 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.480
 has the engine serial number stamped directly on the flange of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 escape side of the pad 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.450
 close to the steering wheel cover for better engine identification 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.800
 the connections in the padc puti liceo connectors metric wagon metric with 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.810
 hoops 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.870
 that improve the sealing capacity compared with screw connectors 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.990
 conical pipe 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.970
 The motor has replaceable cylinder sleeves attached 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.790
 the medium top design is used to seat the shirt on the blog 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.460
 a snap fit on the top of the shirt 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.850
 dress the shirt with the pro 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.170
 two hoops them one near the top of the shirt 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.450
 and one just below the middle stop area 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.590
 They provide the coolant seal for the shirt 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859
 he was secretary prevents also 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.529
 that they emit train the coolant around the shirts 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.659
 the top of the shirt 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.299
 they are here nothing to house the ring of fire 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.630
 and the graphite ring 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.369
 the crankshaft gear 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.579
 Ring tone and adapter 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.680
 are permanently installed on the crankshaft 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.190
 if any of its components is damaged 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 also talks about the crankshaft should be replaced 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 one of the crankshaft counterweights this herd slot 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.040
 this great work is aligned with the timing port of the crankshaft in the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.120
 side of the pad 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.040
 a synchronization bolt 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.630
 is installed through the pad 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.730
 and inside this great work to hold and crankshaft in position during the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.729
 basic motor synchronization 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:16.599
 the thrust bearings installed on the bench number 4 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.670
 they have a tongue that fits inside notches in the engine blog 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.670
 and on the raised lid number 4 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.309
 The head of the bolts of the base plates is relatively short 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:33.989
 when you tighten 4 what these screws be careful not to allow the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.639
 tool slide 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.779
 outside the screw head 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.190
 although utor kim conventional meter must still be used 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.619
 for hector quini seal 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.379
 a 90 degree decisional couple impact wrench can be used 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.399
 apply all the screws to three hundred foot-pounds following the 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.179
 pattern shown in the service literature 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:59.859
 then apply to all the screws an additional 90 degrees following the same 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.579
 Pattern 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.219
 with the front and rear crankshaft seals 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.859
 good wear shirt is installed pressure on the crankshaft 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.809
 as the seal is installed 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.480
 that shirt and life that seal for me a villa that wear and crankshaft

 the pistons articulated signatuur 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.920
 are from a vortex bowl design entered 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:28.769
 the notch in the piston skirt provides space for the nozzle

 tissone signature are from a conventional 13-mile piston design 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.519
 the motors and inatur also use a full-floating piston pin 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.059
 held by retaining rings 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.200
 the ends of the piston pin 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.200
 they are concave to reduce the weight 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.029
 the crank is a cummins design for heavy duty the biel assembly 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.140
 crank stage 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.140
 use guide rings for alignment

 the woman the night spent applied by the spray of the increase nozzle 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.619
 of the piston 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:17.849
 the upper bearing of the connecting rod 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.759
 is a number of different parts of the lower bearing the material of the 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.270
 upper bearing 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.280
 has changed to improve durability under the heavy load experienced 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.550
 during combustion 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.770
 changing the position of the upper bearings the lower 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.259
 results in a noticeable misalignment of the bearing in the seat thereof 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.020
 the notch on the bielecki bearing the cooling slot on the skirt of the 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.870
 piston 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.870
 they are installed on that side of the engine fuel pump 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.639
 The piston cooling nozzles are installed in the gallery 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.580
