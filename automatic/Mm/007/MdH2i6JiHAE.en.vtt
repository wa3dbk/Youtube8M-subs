Hunter code I got a little bit of energy
all<00:01:08.510> right<00:01:08.690> it's<00:01:09.110> designed<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.590> work<00:01:09.830> in<00:01:10.040> packs

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
all right it's designed to work in packs

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
use caution a little bit more energy

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.880 
use caution a little bit more energy
that's<00:01:17.510> good<00:01:19.900> and<00:01:20.900> one<00:01:21.260> of<00:01:21.380> my<00:01:21.470> favorite

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
definitely helps with killing multiples

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.490 
definitely helps with killing multiples
of<00:03:27.160> them<00:03:27.420> because<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.569> still<00:03:29.080> thought<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.290> had

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
of them because I still thought I had

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
one more and I guess my amp Rex had to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.089 
one more and I guess my amp Rex had to
add<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.739> reach<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.190> kill<00:03:33.970> two<00:03:34.150> at<00:03:34.269> once<00:03:35.099> that's

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
add the reach to kill two at once that's
