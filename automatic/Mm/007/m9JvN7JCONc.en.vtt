00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello youtube good afternoon guys 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 dream again clebson of reef by 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.250
 last time I'm going to talk about 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.639
 my car vectra 2008 equipped 2009 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.020
 with a block of 2 liters of displacement 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 simple eight-valve control with 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.180
 mechanical exchange 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.939
 I'm here at the post that I always 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 to supply the car 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.390
 but before I hit, I'll talk a little 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.939
 of his consumption now in the city 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.970
 totally in the city extremely breathless 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970
 conditioning 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.700
 Let's go quickly and here, let me know what 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.590
 we save side who knows this 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.000
 automobile knows that it has the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.730
 for 54 liters in the zero tank here. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.370
 Fuel, I just got to get right here. 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.910
 then with 54 liters I got the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.000
 with a tank of 54 liters of 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:04.170
 48 miles 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.560
 dividing this by 54 524 kilometers 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.310
 divided by 54 liters will give an average 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.380
 and of 9.8 kilometers with one liter of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.119
 fuel within the city 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.330
 extremely no air conditioning in 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.759
 some highlight of this test is 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.490
 almost 10 miles now worth it 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.560
 it's not worth it because to run with 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 a car of this size without air 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.450
 conditioning it is better to buy a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.369
 to ride with a fusca but I wanted to meet 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.790
 deeply the consumption of my car 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.060
 under all conditions then so this 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.070
 car here vectra it with air 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.899
 Direct- connected condition I got 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.710
 average exit from 8.6 and 8.7 already without the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.220
 10 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.770
 so this is how I can get one 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.030
 mileage range between 45 and 50 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.009
 more kilometers 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.590
 with or without air conditioning for me 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.380
 it's worth I'd rather lose I 'd rather 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.110
 ride - 45 - 50 kilometers with a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.619
 tank only in direct air than running without 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.349
 It is because the economy is not not it 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.030
 does not compensate for the discomfort or discomfort 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.630
 of you riding with the car of the hypotheses 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.040
 and the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.740
 I wanted to walk alone so I could do this 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.540
 test who knows my channel and who 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.220
 know who has seen the other videos 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.260
 You know I will not need to invent 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.660
 This is because I will not gain anything and 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.550
 inventing this I did not take note 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.320
 I have how to prove this time but at last 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.770
 with 54 liters I was able to run 524 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.600
 Miles in the City - Secret Coming 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.300
 In 2000 Rotation Rotations Already Swap 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.670
 I walk without air conditioning but I repeat 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.940
 does not compensate does not compensate because the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.040
 mileage for more you earn 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.950
 between 45 and 50 kilometers more running 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.300
 no guns for me does not pay for the discomfort 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.550
 to run in this car without air conditioning 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.380
 I prefer to continue running with and I 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.240
 my goals there from 8.6 to 8.7 only on the air without 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.470
 Delegate in no time is that 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.470
 big people hug there
