00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.090
 we will work again 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.240
 all the words we learned at pony 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.730
 club so I'll offer you a 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.100
 other work with labels where he 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.290
 must give the correct name that corresponds 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.880
 to the photo you will see each time 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.680
 it's something in the equipment of the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:35.140
 pony or any of the material we have 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.460
 used at the pony club did review a 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.680
 little no very long time I 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.930
 think this as usual as the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.060
 last time but not the same pictures 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.020
 not always the same pictures and before 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.020
 to replace the labels 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.469
 then we will see 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.230
 so I try to stall myself on 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.760
 two sessions a week on Tuesday and the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.460
 Friday which allows me to test the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.800
 sessions on Monday and Thursday on the hour of 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.809
 lunch we had people from bic 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.840
 on the phone who is helping or who is 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.850
 also advises on setting up and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.540
 of work using a module 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.940
 rather than another and the bass and one 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.740
 continues since we are going to say four 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.200
 weeks we see two at the rate of two 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.240
 weekly sessions on everything 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.590
 touch to the discovery class is sure 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.930
 also grammar because I try 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.270
 to focus on these two of the two 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.030
 items then you will not be well this is 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:37.659
 what are we 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:40.450
 a girl the net yes it's gone there you 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.509
 have to put everything on the pony and you 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.369
 can more requested the correction and there 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.680
 it's okay why 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.899
 that's what I did that then 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.670
 party on nine after there is still 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.619
 another job or there he will have to 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.200
 read 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.390
 and then find the words to place in 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.180
 the text is always the equipment of the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:08.560
 pony it's always the things we have 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.739
 seen at the pony club and we have to on and 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.319
 denial wheels and here I 'm going to say 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:24.209
 brakes and if we correct three funds and 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.209
 if the left has to sign a good ben 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.640
 so everything that goes to the little game of 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.650
 riddles well there I would like you 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 to show the work of riddles it is 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.220
 the first time you will do this 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.970
 type of work so I show you 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.489
 lardoise angela have this work there he 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.380
 read the questions 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.790
 of course if we can not read the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.860
 question can not answer 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.660
 so I think you are no longer 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.310
 able to read them if you are so 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.570
 you never manage to get up 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.920
 the hand I come to see you for you 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:06.390
 help to read what enemy on this summer is 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.390
 protect how he falls I am 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.749
 if I had to give myself a title to 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.209
 each of the activities 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:18.010
 the first is a kind of romÃ©o 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.409
 vocabulary in form 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.870
 of labels the second bottom is a 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.579
 kind of final evaluation because they 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.109
 had to have memorized this vocabulary 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.719
 and place them correctly without 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.120
 possibility of third correction 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.919
 work a contextualization in 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.379
 vocabulary context through a 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.030
 text that must be read then a work of 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.760
 riddles where there is reading and 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.159
 vocabulary and finally writing where 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.569
 it was up to them to rewrite it to do the 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.239
 graphical gesture to try to 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.319
 build things 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.849
 children easily take the 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.919
 stylus they have to put their fingers 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.359
 on each side of the white part for 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.040
 most they place themselves correctly 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.620
 sometimes with the third must but 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.150
 is that this often this position 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.579
 which is adopted which avoids having the 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.819
 inch above we see less with 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.439
 the stylus and at the level of writing a 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.120
 good majority tell me that they find 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.189
 that it's easier the graphic gesture 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.079
 is easier shot the better and he 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:14.699
 appreciate the color change the 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.699
 possibility of having eraser etc 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.739
 m
