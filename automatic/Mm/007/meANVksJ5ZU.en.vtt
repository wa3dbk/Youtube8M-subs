you back and you don't want to go too
far<00:03:36.890> back<00:03:37.100> because<00:03:37.220> then<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.550> turns<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:37.910> catch

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
far back because then it turns to catch

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.660 
far back because then it turns to catch
on<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.450> shoulder<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.370> see<00:03:40.520> that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
on the shoulder so you can see that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.930 
on the shoulder so you can see that
Katrina<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.480> doing<00:03:42.110> exactly<00:03:42.980> right<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.790> is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
Katrina is doing exactly right that is

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.810 
Katrina is doing exactly right that is
perfect<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:45.100> now<00:03:46.100> we're<00:03:46.250> going<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.400> need<00:03:46.520> that

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
perfect and now we're going to need that

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.710 
perfect and now we're going to need that

going<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.700> do<00:03:53.080> something<00:03:54.080> I<00:03:54.320> call<00:03:54.500> an<00:03:54.739> upside

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
going to do something I call an upside

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.610 
going to do something I call an upside
down<00:03:55.280> snow<00:03:55.790> angel<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:56.570> this<00:03:57.020> is<00:03:57.170> really

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
down snow angel and this is really

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.140 
down snow angel and this is really
challenging<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.280> I'm<00:03:58.520> gonna<00:03:58.670> make<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:58.940> even

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
challenging and I'm gonna make it even

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.910 
challenging and I'm gonna make it even
more<00:03:59.480> challenging<00:03:59.540> by<00:04:00.170> using<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.590> Eric's

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
more challenging by using the Eric's

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.690 
more challenging by using the Eric's
path<00:04:02.200> upside<00:04:03.200> down<00:04:03.350> snowy<00:04:03.680> top<00:04:04.010> there<00:04:04.459> we<00:04:04.580> go

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
path upside down snowy top there we go

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000 
path upside down snowy top there we go
