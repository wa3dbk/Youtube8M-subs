control pad the axis X's and Y's are the
left<00:02:56.220> thumbstick<00:02:56.489> okay<00:02:57.120> I'll<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.260> break<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
left thumbstick okay I'll just break the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.119 
left thumbstick okay I'll just break the
page<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.580> little<00:02:59.940> of

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
page I have a little of

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.180 
page I have a little of
note<00:03:03.129> see<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.569> all<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.840> interpretations

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
note see this is all the interpretations

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.440 
note see this is all the interpretations
I'll<00:03:06.190> most<00:03:06.430> likely<00:03:06.519> put<00:03:07.000> them<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
I'll most likely put them in the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.729 
I'll most likely put them in the
description<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:10.060> left<00:03:10.299> thumb<00:03:10.540> sticks<00:03:10.900> you

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
description the left thumb sticks you

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.460 
description the left thumb sticks you
know<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:12.310> tells<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.760> what<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.060> does<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:14.290> to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
know it tells you what it does what to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.030 
know it tells you what it does what to
label<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:14.830> is<00:03:15.040> self-explanatory<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.739> a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
label it is self-explanatory like the a

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.490 
label it is self-explanatory like the a
button<00:03:18.430> on<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.760> controller<00:03:19.150> its<00:03:19.750> button<00:03:20.230> one

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
button on the controller its button one

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.509 
button on the controller its button one
in<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.700> joy<00:03:21.849> -<00:03:22.060> key<00:03:22.209> program<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:24.280> go<00:03:24.459> to

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
in the joy - key program so you go to

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.660 
in the joy - key program so you go to
button<00:03:24.879> one<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:26.890> make<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> key<00:03:27.519> you

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
button one and you make it the key you

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.210 
button one and you make it the key you
want<00:03:27.700> on<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> emulator<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:30.220> for<00:03:30.670> example<00:03:30.760> oh

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
want on the emulator like for example oh

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.539 
want on the emulator like for example oh
this<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.519> get<00:03:34.140> blood<00:03:35.140> okay<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.160> now<00:03:36.310> I

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
this is I get blood okay so now I

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.580 
this is I get blood okay so now I
brought<00:03:36.940> up<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.269> emulator<00:03:38.280> project<00:03:39.280> 64<00:03:40.590> we're

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
brought up the emulator project 64 we're

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.729 
brought up the emulator project 64 we're
going<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.859> go<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.040> controller<00:03:43.200> okay<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.590> then

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
going to go to controller okay and then

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.970 
going to go to controller okay and then
we<00:03:45.010> see<00:03:45.250> all<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> keys<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:47.379> know<00:03:47.500> for<00:03:47.829> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
we see all the keys you know for the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.770 
we see all the keys you know for the
analog<00:03:48.459> stick<00:03:48.760> got<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.090> left<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.420> right<00:03:49.569> up

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
analog stick got the left the right up

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.949 
analog stick got the left the right up
the<00:03:49.989> down<00:03:50.170> abs<00:03:51.269> start<00:03:52.269> lrz<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:55.420> know<00:03:55.540> all<00:03:55.900> of

the down abs start lrz you know all of

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.860 
the down abs start lrz you know all of
them<00:03:56.400> date<00:03:57.400> right<00:03:57.790> now<00:03:58.859> what<00:03:59.859> we<00:04:00.010> have<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.310> do

them date right now what we have to do

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.670 
them date right now what we have to do
with<00:04:01.870> joy<00:04:02.470> -<00:04:02.739> key<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:04.510> we<00:04:04.780> have<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.140> set<00:04:05.910> all<00:04:06.910> of

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
with joy - key is we have to set all of

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.339 
with joy - key is we have to set all of
the<00:04:08.680> keys<00:04:08.919> on<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.780> emulator<00:04:11.310> into<00:04:12.310> here<00:04:12.639> so

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
the keys on the emulator into here so

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.479 
the keys on the emulator into here so
this<00:04:14.349> is<00:04:14.500> where<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.769> interpretation<00:04:15.370> comes

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
this is where the interpretation comes

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:15.930 
this is where the interpretation comes

because I could I can figured this with

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.809 
because I could I can figured this with
my<00:06:23.240> elbow<00:06:23.689> and<00:06:24.469> that's<00:06:24.589> what<00:06:24.919> I'm<00:06:25.099> doing<00:06:25.759> a

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:25.819 
my elbow and that's what I'm doing a

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.049 
my elbow and that's what I'm doing a
video<00:06:25.909> right<00:06:26.270> now<00:06:26.300> actually<00:06:27.729> so<00:06:28.729> you<00:06:28.819> just

00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:29.059 
video right now actually so you just

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:32.529 
video right now actually so you just
configure<00:06:29.539> all<00:06:29.689> that<00:06:29.900> crap<00:06:30.669> then<00:06:31.669> don't<00:06:32.180> exit

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
configure all that crap then don't exit

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.529 
configure all that crap then don't exit
it<00:06:32.689> cuz<00:06:33.139> you<00:06:33.529> just<00:06:34.490> minimize<00:06:34.879> it<00:06:34.909> and<00:06:35.150> it'll<00:06:35.360> go

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:35.539 
it cuz you just minimize it and it'll go

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.420 
it cuz you just minimize it and it'll go
away<00:06:35.659> and<00:06:35.960> appearing<00:06:36.650> a<00:06:36.710> little<00:06:36.860> icon<00:06:37.159> down<00:06:37.309> at
