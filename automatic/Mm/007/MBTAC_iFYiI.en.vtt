00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
absolutely loving at the moment I do

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.020 
absolutely loving at the moment I do
like<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.740> green<00:03:12.070> teas<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.670> White<00:03:12.820> T's

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
like the green teas and the White T's

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.790 
like the green teas and the White T's
because<00:03:13.330> they<00:03:13.450> do<00:03:13.510> have<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.900> antioxidants

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
because they do have the antioxidants

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.790 
because they do have the antioxidants
and<00:03:14.980> just<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.880> don't<00:03:16.030> know<00:03:16.210> t<00:03:16.540> Timmy's<00:03:17.290> always

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
and just I don't know t Timmy's always

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.280 
and just I don't know t Timmy's always
just<00:03:18.100> felt<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.700> lot<00:03:19.210> lighter<00:03:19.510> than<00:03:19.660> drinking<00:03:20.200> a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
just felt a lot lighter than drinking a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.740 
just felt a lot lighter than drinking a
cup<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.590> coffee<00:03:20.650> um<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.820> think<00:03:22.120> maybe<00:03:22.540> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
cup of coffee um I think maybe the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.590 
cup of coffee um I think maybe the
creamer<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.290> milk<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.770> what<00:03:24.040> weighs<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.430> down

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
creamer the milk is what weighs it down

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.880 
creamer the milk is what weighs it down

steeper<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:15.130> pour<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.550> in<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:15.970> i<00:04:16.210> put<00:04:16.690> two

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
steeper you pour it in and i put two

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.820 
steeper you pour it in and i put two
teaspoons<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.489> of<00:04:18.730> each<00:04:18.940> kind<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:20.620> fill

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
teaspoons in of each kind and you fill

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.960 
teaspoons in of each kind and you fill
it<00:04:20.980> up<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:22.740> let<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.770> steep<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.490> think<00:04:24.790> both<00:04:24.940> of

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
it up and let it steep I think both of

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.270 
it up and let it steep I think both of
these<00:04:25.240> are<00:04:25.480> like<00:04:25.660> two<00:04:26.050> minutes<00:04:26.290> maybe<00:04:26.890> three

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
these are like two minutes maybe three

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.480 
these are like two minutes maybe three
minutes<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:28.210> steep<00:04:28.480> it

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
minutes you steep it

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.379 
minutes you steep it
and<00:04:30.000> then<00:04:30.240> there's<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.699> net<00:04:32.699> in<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.000> bottom<00:04:33.300> of

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
and then there's a net in the bottom of

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.050 
and then there's a net in the bottom of
here<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.930> as<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.650> can<00:04:34.949> see<00:04:34.979> you<00:04:35.430> just<00:04:35.460> kind<00:04:35.910> of

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
here and as you can see you just kind of

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.689 
here and as you can see you just kind of
push<00:04:36.930> this<00:04:37.139> down<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.770> your<00:04:38.160> water<00:04:38.340> comes

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
push this down and your water comes

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.809 
push this down and your water comes
right<00:04:38.910> out<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.419> drains<00:04:39.720> right<00:04:39.930> into<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.410> mug

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
right out and it drains right into a mug

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.689 
right out and it drains right into a mug
I<00:04:41.819> think<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:42.630> fits<00:04:42.930> about<00:04:43.220> this<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.340> about<00:04:44.460> 8

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
I think it it fits about this is about 8

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.600 
I think it it fits about this is about 8
ounces<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:45.720> it's<00:04:45.840> pretty<00:04:46.020> good<00:04:46.289> cup<00:04:46.919> of<00:04:47.069> tea<00:04:47.340> um

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
ounces so it's pretty good cup of tea um

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.309 
ounces so it's pretty good cup of tea um
and<00:04:48.509> when<00:04:49.470> you're<00:04:49.620> finished<00:04:51.080> since<00:04:52.080> this<00:04:52.259> is

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
and when you're finished since this is

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.990 
and when you're finished since this is
going<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:52.710> drip<00:04:52.949> and<00:04:53.099> you<00:04:53.190> don't<00:04:53.430> want<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.729> to
