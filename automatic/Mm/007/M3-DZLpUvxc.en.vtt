00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:16.209
 Man's editor-in-chief Kenny Sagawa 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.710
 Come to ktm full lineup model test ride event 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.150
 Here is the first ride 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:27.789
 It is first aid round super juke r 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:32.710
 This Well While this form looks a moment in such a way that ish model Tado 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:36.219
 If you try it, it's more than a full road sport 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:42.650
 It's such a handling that is close to ss 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:47.300
 Very light-blocking seat height greater looks sharp is the body trees I'd high 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:50.810
 The origin of the hand rim is also very sharp in what region 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.840
 It's already a labor road sport and it's an engine 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.470
 lca display is good 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.850
 that 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.739
 Upper meat and so on 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.480
 It is a water engine, but this is also a higher horsepower power up than conventional models 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 It becomes 125 horsepower 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.850
 It is hot is very high middle of registration 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.670
 This it becomes quite peak by it as soon as possible of the ship in about Well it's 9000 person of Gue 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.180
 If you are upshifting, this is fast 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.650
 I idea to taking advantage of the Chinese of torque will think whether not it is the earlier 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.860
 This is what a 13-year model looks like until now there was a single sheet r 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.180
 The model has become a double sheet like this 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.220
 But I feel like tobacco 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.790
 While Well lifting the that power at Tteyuu that can be a single 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.800
 Another while increasing if sport than child 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.450
 It is also compatible with a wide range of usability, I wonder if it can be two years after that 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.870
 It sounds like 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.420
 It is when and say, brothers stuffy Well, ready-to-race and big Do later 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.380
 Or rather aggressive 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.810
 That something'll be tough I guess is pretty high a little difficult throttle response 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.310
 May have an image like 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.310
 In fact is it is very very nice it is Toka high-throttle drivability 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.090
 Only Batoshi was part say that is increased with the smooth stop 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.100
 My mom said that she would like to buy it at Tadataka dinner . 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.100
 I also put it on the towing plane very much 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.540
 The next 200 duke test drive 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.079
 Two years ago it reviews the 125 duke of 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.900
 It is the existence of the big brother, and it debuted last year 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:29.069
 So this year's 13 year model is 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.690
 It's a little bit changed and the front desk performance is getting a bit bigger 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:38.310
 The abs is standard equipment and the stopping power is better 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.640
 I think that I can say that it became safe on this a base further 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.300
 See you again 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.069
 a It seems like you're going to hold on to a circuit like this until the base is pulled 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.440
 I can not do my breaking 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.710
 Well, this is caught in the fact that it is an equipment for safety from the danger meeting 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.340
 I think that should I 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.830
 And 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.260
 This car body 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:03.459
 Speaking of brothers 6, this is a frame of Chromoly 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.959
 Off-road car and material of such black body of Joe 2 The frame using this is well 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.090
 It is quite easy 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:14.530
 Tough, and in it we have issued a because quite such a good rigidity balance 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.270
 Suspension is this after all it is the movie thread a little it is or rather Ofisha Yuitsuki 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.750
 4 After all it is soft 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:24.430
 There are plenty of strokes before and after strokes are quite tap 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.930
 I feel that the stroke gets quite high when I apply a load at cornering at the circuit 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.750
 Quite during the corner ring you force it a little Koichi matter is I'd look here times 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.440
 A little funny but quite right low 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:39.720
 So kind of rich tea 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:44.730
 It's an engine, but 125 is still that common vehicle 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.570
 125 Therefore, I'm not a little quit be if under par patients it is this 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.280
 This is just the best by marrying a 200 cc engine into a large car body 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.940
 I feel that I 've been in balance 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.239
 Furthermore say when Well 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.890
 I agree 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.209
 It would be nice if there was just a little more power to fight with a much higher exhaust rate 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.110
 I think I feel that you and say, 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:09.099
 To refer to tertiary though have Kutte it to debut this year 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:15.390
 Maybe I think that one of them will come, but this is this 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.390
 I think that is very has fallen so went machina good that balance 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:30.110
 Yes And this is the last 69 Marduke r ride 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.040
 Any of the standard, which came out last year it is there that buy only is named tar 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.290
 duke 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.770
 It is here for Otsu 9 circle power here and there is full adjustable suspension attached 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.810
 Ne 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.820
 Out of the first that the underbody has been enhanced 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.610
 It's not just full adjustable, but it's true that when you try riding it 's quite normal 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.060
 Duke looks a bit like a fluffy leg 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.389
 Here is some nice Kana still dampers for though it is a little soft touch 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.840
 The first original setting of the racing-like suspension is a bit like this 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.980
 I've been to 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.800
 Therefore the number of the car is stable and it is the home of the engine, but it is also here 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.270
 Angel is the thing I am engine of this lc 4 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.420
 It is pillow common in that single cylinder single engine , but let's see 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.660
 Accrapo It is fuller equipped this 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:18.430
 Well by the tuning of daddy computer a little + 3 horsepower 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:22.570
 70 times cut against normal poison 18 It seems like this is small but actually try to ride 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.080
 And the slot mesmons is quite different, but the bat comes out when you raise it 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.450
 Say 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.170
 Such a high torque that a front is likely to come up like this is a real fact 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.440
 It is either say 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.030
 It feels like it pops 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:39.370
 Yap girl is much stronger 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:43.000
 And you also have photos, but I don't know this right hand weapon 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:46.420
 According to the manufacturer's technical explanation earlier 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.340
 If you can't see it, you 're probably getting better 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:55.960
 Or because I entered felt a Well guarantee riding up there Well that the sound is turned 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:06:01.340
 I'd like if you still do not know a bit a place called whether although it is probably doing more 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:05.900
 Tires are even more high grip alternative at racing speed 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.850
 And wonder if that Tteyuu the door merit because the difference in the case tomorrow not it has emerged that 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.120
 Such premonition is well 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:15.800
 Summarized and more than engine 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.689
 Tuned to power bend and aligned the car body enhanced and all full 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.580
 With adjustable shock 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:24.590
 Originally I sports like it or rather the tax things set of legs to that scaffold 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.550
 By Rutte can become a standard set of 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:32.840
 I'd have been up about it 250,000 is the price commensurate with it 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.400
 That upgrade If you finish this by buying after-sales parts yourself 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.660
 Well that 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.200
 I think it will cost you more than 10,000 times as a total package 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.840
 Manufacturers 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.009
 If you set it up with this assembly, it will be worth the price for this guy. 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.910
 I thought there was no 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:53.120
 If you say from the beginning it is the strongest 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:57.260
 200 duke and 690 duke There is this 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:03.440
 And Miyanakamaru super duke Aru and Duke brothers 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:08.650
 I thought it was a shochu table , but each one is unique and has a horse mackerel 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.650
 I thought it would be a machine with a shoulder on three sides
