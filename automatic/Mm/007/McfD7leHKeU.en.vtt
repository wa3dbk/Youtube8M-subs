make<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.360> big<00:02:17.870> probably<00:02:18.560> two<00:02:18.710> batches<00:02:19.220> of

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
put this to the side so I put in my

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.310 
put this to the side so I put in my
yeast

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
yeast

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.160 
yeast
now<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.740> yeast<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.430> really<00:02:28.940> makes<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.570> magical

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
now the yeast is really makes it magical

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.290 
now the yeast is really makes it magical
the<00:02:30.380> more<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> think<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.950> more<00:02:31.070> use<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:32.120> more

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
the more I think the more use the more

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.360 
the more I think the more use the more
crispier<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.080> would<00:02:33.200> get<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.560> she<00:02:33.620> likes<00:02:33.980> super

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
crispier it would get so she likes super

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.020 
crispier it would get so she likes super
crispy

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
crispy

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.690 
crispy
put<00:02:35.750> some<00:02:35.930> more<00:02:36.050> yeast<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.590> but<00:02:37.040> just<00:02:37.460> try

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
put some more yeast in it but just try

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.460 
put some more yeast in it but just try
it<00:02:37.760> out<00:02:37.910> like<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.630> see<00:02:38.840> if<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.170> want<00:02:39.380> to

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
it out like this to see if you want to

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.980 
it out like this to see if you want to
use<00:02:39.620> less<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.250> use<00:02:40.490> more<00:02:40.880> if<00:02:41.300> you<00:02:41.450> use<00:02:41.600> less

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
use less or use more if you use less

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.800 
use less or use more if you use less
then<00:02:42.830> they<00:02:43.010> will<00:02:43.160> be<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.460> more<00:02:43.820> meaty<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
then they will be like more meaty in the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.870 
then they will be like more meaty in the
middle<00:02:45.110> if<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.530> use<00:02:45.650> more<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.430> would<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:46.760> be

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
middle if you use more it would just be

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.780 
middle if you use more it would just be
like<00:02:46.910> crispy<00:02:47.660> chicken<00:02:48.050> okay<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.130> mix<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.580> up

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
like crispy chicken okay so I mix on up

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.080 
like crispy chicken okay so I mix on up
then<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.180> want<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.420> get<00:02:50.570> cup<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.990> cold<00:02:51.230> water

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
then you want to get cup of cold water

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.650 
then you want to get cup of cold water
and<00:02:53.090> just<00:02:53.150> going<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.720> mix<00:02:53.960> it<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.290> here<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.910> it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
and just going to mix it in here and it

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.420 
and just going to mix it in here and it
gets<00:02:56.840> really<00:02:57.110> tough<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> reason<00:02:58.010> why<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.370> know

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
gets really tough the reason why I know

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.660 
gets really tough the reason why I know
a<00:02:58.790> lot<00:02:59.390> of<00:02:59.420> comments<00:03:00.110> people<00:03:00.260> were<00:03:01.100> asking<00:03:01.610> me

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
a lot of comments people were asking me

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.330 
a lot of comments people were asking me
kid<00:03:02.630> they<00:03:02.780> use<00:03:02.990> regular<00:03:03.590> flour<00:03:03.620> or<00:03:04.100> white

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
kid they use regular flour or white

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.760 
kid they use regular flour or white
flour<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.970> don't<00:03:05.480> think<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.930> would<00:03:06.050> do<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.440> same

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
flour I don't think it would do the same

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.100 
flour I don't think it would do the same
because<00:03:07.400> gluten<00:03:07.760> flour<00:03:08.060> will<00:03:08.480> make<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.840> really

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
because gluten flour will make it really

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.000 
because gluten flour will make it really
tough<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:10.400> texture<00:03:10.880> will<00:03:11.060> be<00:03:11.090> like<00:03:11.510> me<00:03:12.020> so

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
tough and the texture will be like me so

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.940 
tough and the texture will be like me so
like<00:03:13.280> chicken<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.270> if<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.930> used<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.410> want<00:03:15.770> that

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
chewy chicken and not like a red then

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.060 
chewy chicken and not like a red then
this<00:03:19.730> is<00:03:19.880> what<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.120> do<00:03:20.270> so<00:03:20.510> i'ma<00:03:21.260> go<00:03:21.380> ahead<00:03:21.830> and

looks like after adding my two cups of

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.610 
looks like after adding my two cups of
water<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.830> mix<00:03:28.490> it<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.020> gooey<00:03:30.350> and

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
nasty but as you can see this is why I

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.120 
nasty but as you can see this is why I
use<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:34.970> gluten<00:03:35.240> flour<00:03:35.480> see<00:03:35.990> when<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:36.680> rip<00:03:36.920> it

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
use a gluten flour see when you rip it

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.840 
use a gluten flour see when you rip it
open<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:38.390> texture<00:03:38.990> will<00:03:39.350> be<00:03:39.380> like<00:03:40.280> me<00:03:40.610> it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
open the texture will be like me it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.580 
open the texture will be like me it
looks<00:03:41.060> nasty<00:03:41.270> right<00:03:41.630> but<00:03:42.080> as<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.380> can<00:03:42.530> see

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590
