00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.549
 on the offline case because if you liked it 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.840
 really a mess seems to me that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.119
 even the first video what 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.310
 burton has surpassed in four thousand if not 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.380
 5 thousand I like it so I said it's no is 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 no it is no I have to do in another though 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.650
 guys to start videos that one thing 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.080
 she is a deaf person and should not be a deaf either 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.909
 please however I have to say don't send the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.009
 request to my dog if you don't have it 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.930
 see you don't even look please 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.939
 not sent because I am not the clan 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
 boss are with friends than with tours 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.240
 they don't have to graze has anything to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.520
 doing it also bothers me to give him one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 sort of a nuisance to them so it's a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.900
 mutual annoyance after venturing not 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 sent to the clan has therefore not sent her 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.710
 here if you want no send it if you remove 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 can you please don't send your own 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.310
 because some of them are also annoyed 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.500
 and let's say I feel a little embarrassed 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.970
 stylus say dance anyway and without 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.130
 so let's go today I'm here in 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.720
 present you a live attack because 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.060
 in fact , I promised to bring you in 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.670
 attack and here it is as you see these 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.460
 I alone used 111 barbarians to the 5th 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.350
 81 to cira 4 and then 4 st moore will use 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 then also the barbarian king always four 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.229
 and if you want a moment take a look 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.930
 this is my village 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.630
 improving now an extractor of 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.030
 elixir nothing 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.160
 then we have a cannon a mortar in 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.900
 preparation then what is the last and then the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.950
 wizard's tower though boys 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.390
 said there is a moment to see what kind of 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.069
 I look for opponents as it seems to me 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.050
 open in the last video you can 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.819
 I had just told you to follow him 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.370
 that I bet the money because I 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.250
 like big money so i'm looking for 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.230
 those of the villages that maybe have a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.360
 lots of elixirs a lot of gold then 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.950
 lots of resources though out there then 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.840
 put a moment to look for challengers but 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.870
 I can assure you that it's worth it 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.370
 the boys seem impossible but later 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.380
 not even twenty seconds I said 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.330
 looking for challengers I found this 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.840
 here that run from a village of the 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.790
 madonna 301 thousand of 280,000 gold elixirs 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.549
 it doesn't have the resources out but us 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.370
 we will try unless we fail to do for 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.900
 various to steal it instantly I think 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.579
 also to use a beautiful fury that 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.380
 I already put with the barbarian king because 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.390
 I want to break that mortar right away 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.010
 is likely to give us much trouble and put 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.900
 here at our best I think I did 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.970
 a breath but it's probably since 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.110
 my first attack the live started at 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.850
 do a little stride but I can 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.829
 to ensure that afterwards we take everything back 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.780
 with interest 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.549
 even put in place by the archers 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.519
 of the barbarians then the launches just in 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.530
 a thousand and we turn for a moment here 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.930
 they are beautiful archers to destroy 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.880
 the enemies and opponents we commit a 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.440
 moment ours are destroyed a little 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.540
 resources like TV are already taking 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.160
 all the elixir we will now think of a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.859
 There is no problem with them 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.620
 we have resources and all is well 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.709
 so here is where they are entering 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.389
 our great barbarians here we put 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.489
 the last to be here with the kids we have 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.269
 finished the resources we see how much 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.819
 let's make 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.489
 I must say that the is quite worked 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.230
 my strategy which you see is not 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.120
 well lance is pretty disgusting if I have to 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.459
 to be honest I also played a little 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.840
 Mars the type that omitted the case but they are 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.630
 really happy because i believe of 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.690
 having really screwed a mess of 9 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.160
 we await the final verdict however 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.230
 final that comes practically now 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.370
 because to which key as you will see boys 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.620
 I made 292,000 of gold and 205,000 of 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.389
 elixir wasting even if it were so 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.459
 say a fury because I put it 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.970
 very bad idea of ​​why 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.579
 we 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.270
 but as you can see we have done 205,000 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.830
 of is here 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.930
 and if we go to redo our own now 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.390
 nice army we can see that years 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.950
 we have just used very little 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.990
 about 40 thousand elixirs 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.250
 so guys phenomenal method now there 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.340
 I show the latest attacks 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.750
 as you can see, well see they are scared 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.670
 265 thousand 231 161,000 and 147 282 205 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.320
 guys this is my method 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.180
 I hope you also use if you do 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.740
 like maybe left bengasi 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.060
 having said that it does not seem to give me any more 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.780
 things to say and I hope this is mine 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.370
