all<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.770> cannot<00:01:23.040> occur<00:01:23.190> here<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:25.190> the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
all right this cannot occur here is the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.149 
all right this cannot occur here is the
first<00:01:26.490> comic<00:01:27.000> book<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.390> I've<00:01:27.540> ever<00:01:27.900> got<00:01:28.440> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
first comic book that I've ever got that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.670 
first comic book that I've ever got that
if<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.150> was<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.360> mint<00:01:30.780> condition

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
if it was a mint condition

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.660 
if it was a mint condition
it<00:01:31.920> would<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.220> over<00:01:32.540> $100<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.190> you<00:01:35.190> can<00:01:35.369> imagine

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it would be over $100 so you can imagine

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.290 
it would be over $100 so you can imagine
that<00:01:36.150> he'll<00:01:36.600> when<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:36.900> 15<00:01:37.650> years<00:01:38.009> ago<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
that he'll when I'm 15 years ago and I

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.690 
that he'll when I'm 15 years ago and I
was<00:01:39.450> still<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.690> teenager<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.530> got<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.950> um

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
was still a teenager and I got this um

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
was still a teenager and I got this um
she<00:01:42.690> I<00:01:42.720> thought<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.650> man

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
she I thought I was this man

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920 
she I thought I was this man
but<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.970> comic<00:01:45.300> kind<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.540> has<00:01:45.690> some

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
but this comic kind of has some

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.080 
but this comic kind of has some
sentimental<00:01:46.259> value<00:01:46.850> because<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
sentimental value because of that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.460 
sentimental value because of that
because<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.479> first<00:01:48.690> comic<00:01:48.960> book<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.290> got

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
because the first comic book that I got

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.890

that<00:01:49.619> would<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.860> been<00:01:50.009> over<00:01:50.190> $100<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.360> it's

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
that would have been over $100 and it's

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.200
