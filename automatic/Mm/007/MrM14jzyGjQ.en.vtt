one<00:00:01.709> more<00:00:01.949> important<00:00:02.580> part<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.120> weather

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
one more important part of the weather

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.039 
one more important part of the weather
is<00:00:03.629> water<00:00:04.319> vapor<00:00:04.650> present<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.549> air<00:00:06.049> the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
is water vapor present in the air the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.230 
is water vapor present in the air the
amount<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.649> water<00:00:07.950> vapor<00:00:08.250> present<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.030> air

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
amount of water vapor present in the air

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.190 
amount of water vapor present in the air
is<00:00:09.510> referred<00:00:10.080> as<00:00:10.260> humidity<00:00:11.630> let<00:00:12.630> us<00:00:12.809> see<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
is referred as humidity let us see the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.279 
is referred as humidity let us see the
impact<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.920> humidity<00:00:14.519> if<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.450> live<00:00:15.690> or<00:00:15.839> have

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
impact of humidity if you live or have

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.890 
impact of humidity if you live or have
visited<00:00:16.800> some<00:00:17.010> place<00:00:17.279> near<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> sea<00:00:18.000> or<00:00:18.240> any

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
visited some place near the sea or any

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.650 
visited some place near the sea or any
place<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.680> high<00:00:19.949> rainfall<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:21.210> must<00:00:21.480> have

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
place with high rainfall you must have

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.220 
place with high rainfall you must have
surely<00:00:21.990> felt<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:23.119> imagine<00:00:24.119> you're<00:00:24.779> full<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
surely felt this imagine you're full of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.220 
surely felt this imagine you're full of
sweat<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.769> feel<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.019> room

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
sweat and feel as if you are in a room

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.220 
sweat and feel as if you are in a room
filled<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.859> steam<00:00:29.660> you<00:00:30.660> feel<00:00:30.929> very

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
filled with steam you feel very

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.650 
filled with steam you feel very
uncomfortable<00:00:33.860> why<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.130> feel<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.640> let<00:00:36.510> us

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
uncomfortable why do you feel so let us

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.290 
uncomfortable why do you feel so let us
understand<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.530> places<00:00:38.309> near<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.820> sea<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
understand this places near the sea and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.260 
understand this places near the sea and
places<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.290> high<00:00:40.530> rainfall<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> lot<00:00:42.030> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
places with high rainfall have a lot of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.740 
places with high rainfall have a lot of
water<00:00:42.510> vapor<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.170> air<00:00:44.030> such<00:00:45.030> places<00:00:45.360> are

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
water vapor in the air such places are

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.770 
water vapor in the air such places are
humid<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:47.309> more<00:00:47.550> water<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> air

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
humid the more water that is in the air

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.529 
humid the more water that is in the air
the<00:00:49.559> higher<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.070> say<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> humidity<00:00:51.300> has

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the higher we say that the humidity has

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.029 
the higher we say that the humidity has
risen<00:00:52.100> we<00:00:53.100> sweat<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> lot<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> hot<00:00:55.039> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
risen we sweat a lot when it is hot the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.849 
risen we sweat a lot when it is hot the
evaporating<00:00:56.879> sweat<00:00:57.149> cools<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
evaporating sweat cools you because the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.700 
evaporating sweat cools you because the
process<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.460> evaporation<00:01:00.350> absorbs<00:01:01.350> heat<00:01:01.649> from

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
process of evaporation absorbs heat from

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.090 
process of evaporation absorbs heat from
your<00:01:02.160> body<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:03.470> when<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> high

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
your body but when there is high

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.550 
your body but when there is high
humidity<00:01:05.510> less<00:01:06.510> sweat<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.140> skin

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
humidity less sweat from your skin

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.880 
humidity less sweat from your skin
evaporates<00:01:08.369> into<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> air<00:01:09.229> because<00:01:10.229> there

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
evaporates into the air because there

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.310 
evaporates into the air because there
has<00:01:11.340> too<00:01:11.760> much<00:01:12.000> water<00:01:12.360> already

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
has too much water already

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.010 
has too much water already
so<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> humid<00:01:14.729> places<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.780> feel

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so in humid places you feel

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.710 
so in humid places you feel
uncomfortable<00:01:16.549> because<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.939> body<00:01:18.210> cannot

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
uncomfortable because your body cannot

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.460 
uncomfortable because your body cannot
get<00:01:19.049> rid<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.619> heat<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> sweat<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> we

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
get rid of the heat from the sweat so we

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.460 
get rid of the heat from the sweat so we
see<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:23.850> some<00:01:24.270> conditions<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:25.110> which

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
see there are some conditions in which

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.310 
see there are some conditions in which
evaporation<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.520> faster<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> air

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
evaporation is faster like when the air

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.700 
evaporation is faster like when the air
is<00:01:28.530> dry<00:01:28.860> when<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> temperature<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> high<00:01:30.710> when

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
is dry when the temperature is high when

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.039 
is dry when the temperature is high when
there<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> wind<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.570> exposed<00:01:33.570> surfaces

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
there is wind and exposed surfaces

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.319 
there is wind and exposed surfaces
larger

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.749 

now<00:01:38.140> we<00:01:38.200> will<00:01:38.500> understand<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.280> second

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
now we will understand the second

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.959 
now we will understand the second
process<00:01:40.049> if<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.740> cover<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.159> boiling<00:01:42.729> water

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
process if you cover the boiling water

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.690 
process if you cover the boiling water
with<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.359> lid<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.590> will<00:01:44.740> observe<00:01:45.009> tiny

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
with the lid you will observe tiny

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.120 
with the lid you will observe tiny
droplets<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.509> water<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.380> inner<00:01:47.560> surface

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
droplets of water on the inner surface

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.349 
droplets of water on the inner surface
of<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.340> lid<00:01:49.380> why<00:01:50.380> does<00:01:50.619> this<00:01:50.770> happen<00:01:51.359> the

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
of the lid why does this happen the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.779 
of the lid why does this happen the
steam<00:01:52.630> or<00:01:52.899> water<00:01:53.170> vapor<00:01:53.500> due<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.429> boiling

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
steam or water vapor due to the boiling

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.380 
steam or water vapor due to the boiling
water<00:01:55.229> cools<00:01:56.229> down<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.920> changes<00:01:57.670> into<00:01:58.119> tiny

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
water cools down and changes into tiny

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.340 
water cools down and changes into tiny
droplets<00:01:58.689> of<00:01:59.229> water<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:01.390> process<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:02.079> called

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
droplets of water this process is called

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.209 
droplets of water this process is called
condensation<00:02:03.810> condensation<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:05.560> just<00:02:06.039> the

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
condensation condensation is just the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.800 
condensation condensation is just the
opposite<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.909> evaporation<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.569> case

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
opposite of evaporation like in the case

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.009 
opposite of evaporation like in the case
of<00:02:11.049> water<00:02:11.260> vapour<00:02:11.650> from<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.310> boiling<00:02:12.670> water

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
of water vapour from the boiling water

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.449 
of water vapour from the boiling water
changing<00:02:14.019> into<00:02:14.290> droplets<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.890> water<00:02:15.160> and

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
changing into droplets of water and

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.850 
changing into droplets of water and
cooling<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.000> same<00:02:16.810> thing<00:02:17.079> happens<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.709> the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
cooling the same thing happens to the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.600 
cooling the same thing happens to the
water<00:02:18.090> evaporated<00:02:19.090> from<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.630> various<00:02:19.900> bodies

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
water evaporated from the various bodies

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.089 
water evaporated from the various bodies
this<00:02:21.610> water<00:02:21.940> vapor<00:02:22.140> rises<00:02:23.140> up<00:02:23.319> into<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.829> sky

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
this water vapor rises up into the sky

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.569 
this water vapor rises up into the sky
it<00:02:24.970> meets<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.660> cool<00:02:25.900> air<00:02:26.200> then<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.190> water

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
it meets the cool air then the water

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.150 
it meets the cool air then the water
vapour<00:02:27.910> becomes<00:02:28.239> cold<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.079> changes<00:02:29.799> into

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
vapour becomes cold and changes into

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.449 
vapour becomes cold and changes into
water<00:02:30.430> droplets<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:32.260> water<00:02:32.500> droplets<00:02:33.130> keep

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
water droplets the water droplets keep

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.289 
water droplets the water droplets keep
collecting<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.360> form<00:02:34.630> clouds<00:02:35.849> but<00:02:36.849> when<00:02:37.090> there

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
collecting to form clouds but when there

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.000 
collecting to form clouds but when there
is<00:02:37.329> too<00:02:37.629> much<00:02:37.810> collection<00:02:38.349> of<00:02:38.440> water<00:02:38.680> droplets

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
is too much collection of water droplets

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.890 
is too much collection of water droplets
in<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.400> clouds<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.390> clouds<00:02:40.599> become<00:02:40.989> heavy

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
in the clouds the clouds become heavy

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.379 
in the clouds the clouds become heavy
this<00:02:43.900> means<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.889> cloud<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.489> no<00:02:45.730> longer<00:02:46.060> hold

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
this means the cloud can no longer hold

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.770 
this means the cloud can no longer hold
this<00:02:46.989> much<00:02:47.230> amount<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.769> water<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:49.420> water

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
this much amount of water and the water

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.280 
this much amount of water and the water
starts<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.319> fall<00:02:50.650> back<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.519> form<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.940> rain

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
starts to fall back in the form of rain

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.710 
starts to fall back in the form of rain
so<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:53.440> see<00:02:53.680> both<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.549> evaporation<00:02:55.299> and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
so we see both the evaporation and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.640 
so we see both the evaporation and
condensation<00:02:56.519> result<00:02:57.519> in<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.940> rainfall

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.250 

that<00:03:03.340> was<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.790> tireless<00:03:04.120> journey<00:03:04.629> which

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
that was the tireless journey which

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.429 
that was the tireless journey which
water<00:03:05.560> continues<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.250> make<00:03:06.640> endlessly<00:03:07.439> this

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
water continues to make endlessly this

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.569 
water continues to make endlessly this
is<00:03:08.620> called<00:03:08.980> water<00:03:09.370> cycle<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.620> water<00:03:11.829> cycle<00:03:12.040> is

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
is called water cycle the water cycle is

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.660 
is called water cycle the water cycle is
the<00:03:12.819> journey<00:03:13.120> water<00:03:13.720> takes<00:03:14.140> as<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:15.040> circulates

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
the journey water takes as it circulates

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.899 
the journey water takes as it circulates

you a riddle if six children and two
dogs<00:03:28.450> were<00:03:29.049> under<00:03:29.439> an<00:03:29.620> umbrella<00:03:30.150> how<00:03:31.150> come

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
dogs were under an umbrella how come

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.250 
dogs were under an umbrella how come
none<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.959> them<00:03:32.170> got<00:03:32.349> wet<00:03:32.730> think<00:03:33.730> think

was<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.379> because<00:03:39.530> umbrella<00:03:40.250> was<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.519> very<00:03:40.879> big

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
was it because umbrella was a very big

was it because umbrella was a very big
one<00:03:42.099> no<00:03:43.510> think<00:03:44.510> harder<00:03:45.049> or<00:03:46.450> was<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.629> because
