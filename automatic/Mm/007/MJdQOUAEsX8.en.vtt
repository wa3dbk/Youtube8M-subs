00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 often not a lot of people is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.660
 a very beautiful but also a difficult time 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.670
 the fasting month of Ramadan has arrived 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.730
 in this month we will serve four dishes 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.070
 which are tasty anyway but also 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.320
 no attack on you may indeed 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.340
 not only do I do that with two one 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.730
 super cooks 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.619
 nadia and merijn how does the folder go 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.869
 Once ready for the 7th and we start 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.930
 first with the full day 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.190
 we use 15 ladies 50 grams for this 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.950
 peeled gun 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 a pinch of salt and stir we begin 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 basically with the basics the basics of it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.120
 break the fast 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.350
 dates and so we are going to be delicious 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.660
 maria maryns 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.550
 therefore make a good food stuff 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.550
 from least as with rose water 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.720
 what should i do with the construction they try 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.329
 secure also and then twitterer 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.400
 to actually do that why they are so because 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.260
 they are very nutritious and contain fiber 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.340
 are energy in the vitamins 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.920
 so this is kind of like 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.540
 energy source in one go 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.860
 You all can refill again something 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.110
 I think it's really in the curtain 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.490
 named as being the best food there is 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.380
 that reminds me a bit of my 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.360
 father who always made him the one 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.220
 other than those stories like it 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.330
 hunger but almost a year 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.580
 long 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.450
 Ramadan and then just with 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:32.259
 language or milk and then the what we give him 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.270
 enough and that I mixed again so yes 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.350
 instead of say this is sort of 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.940
 make food 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.619
 you can do this with sugar months 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.119
 just want to worry without gaining 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.780
