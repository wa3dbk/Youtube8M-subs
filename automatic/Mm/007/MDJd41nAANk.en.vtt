oh<00:00:37.640> my<00:00:38.640> goodness

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.869 

why<00:00:46.570> are<00:00:46.629> you<00:00:46.840> researching<00:00:47.559> insects<00:00:48.100> as<00:00:48.609> food

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
why are you researching insects as food

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.450 
why are you researching insects as food
well<00:00:49.390> we<00:00:50.079> will<00:00:50.199> have<00:00:50.230> a<00:00:50.350> meat<00:00:50.649> crisis<00:00:51.160> very

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
well we will have a meat crisis very

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.579 
well we will have a meat crisis very
soon

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
soon

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.590 
soon
70%<00:00:53.589> all<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:54.399> agricultural<00:00:55.059> land<00:00:55.269> at<00:00:55.449> the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
70% all the agricultural land at the

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.920 
70% all the agricultural land at the
moment<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.620> used<00:00:56.920> for<00:00:57.610> livestock<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:58.750> rural

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
moment is used for livestock the rural

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.610 
moment is used for livestock the rural
population<00:00:59.620> is<00:00:59.800> doubling<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:01.600> meat<00:01:01.780> the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
population is doubling and the meat the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.829 
population is doubling and the meat the
amount<00:01:02.890> is<00:01:03.190> also<00:01:03.489> doubling<00:01:03.969> so<00:01:04.540> we<00:01:04.690> need

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
amount is also doubling so we need

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.600 
amount is also doubling so we need
another<00:01:04.960> earth<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.860> feed<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.190> world

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
another earth to feed the world

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.300 
another earth to feed the world
so<00:01:07.060> just<00:01:07.390> impossible<00:01:07.930> also<00:01:08.440> if<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.830> look<00:01:08.979> at

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
so just impossible also if you look at

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.940 
so just impossible also if you look at
it<00:01:09.460> environmentally<00:01:10.229> 18<00:01:11.229> percent<00:01:11.560> of<00:01:11.710> all<00:01:11.830> the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
it environmentally 18 percent of all the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.680 
it environmentally 18 percent of all the
greenhouse<00:01:12.280> gas<00:01:12.490> emissions<00:01:12.520> are<00:01:13.270> from

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
greenhouse gas emissions are from

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.770 
greenhouse gas emissions are from
livestock<00:01:14.320> so<00:01:15.070> we<00:01:15.220> need<00:01:15.509> alternatives<00:01:16.509> for

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
livestock so we need alternatives for

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.649 
livestock so we need alternatives for
our<00:01:16.960> protein<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.000> insects<00:01:19.000> are<00:01:19.179> an<00:01:19.330> excellent

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
our protein and insects are an excellent

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.310 
our protein and insects are an excellent
alternative<00:01:20.550> put<00:01:21.550> de<00:01:21.729> colas<00:01:22.060> this<00:01:22.899> is<00:01:23.050> rubbish

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
alternative put de colas this is rubbish

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.590 
alternative put de colas this is rubbish
-<00:01:23.770> this<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.550> little<00:01:24.850> bit<00:01:24.940> be<00:01:25.240> careful

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
- this is a little bit be careful

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.620 
- this is a little bit be careful
because<00:01:25.720> they<00:01:25.960> bite<00:01:26.229> so<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.800> bite<00:01:27.539> to<00:01:28.539> be

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
because they bite so you bite to be

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.600 
because they bite so you bite to be
honest<00:01:28.929> it's<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.440> stretch<00:01:29.770> for<00:01:30.009> me<00:01:30.039> to<00:01:30.280> think<00:01:30.520> of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
honest it's a stretch for me to think of

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.969 
honest it's a stretch for me to think of
this<00:01:30.759> guy<00:01:31.149> as<00:01:31.360> food<00:01:31.659> but<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:32.200> must<00:01:32.710> be<00:01:32.800> the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
this guy as food but that must be the

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.529 
this guy as food but that must be the
battle<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.490> you're<00:01:33.610> facing<00:01:33.909> trying<00:01:34.479> to

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
battle that you're facing trying to

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.120 
battle that you're facing trying to
convince<00:01:34.810> Westerners<00:01:35.530> that<00:01:35.740> there's<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:36.009> good

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
convince Westerners that there's a good

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.040 
convince Westerners that there's a good
meal<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.550> be<00:01:36.580> had<00:01:36.789> of<00:01:36.970> these<00:01:37.179> guys<00:01:37.450> yeah<00:01:37.869> but

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
meal to be had of these guys yeah but

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.719 
meal to be had of these guys yeah but
it's<00:01:38.200> only<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.679> Western<00:01:39.039> people<00:01:39.369> have<00:01:39.520> got

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
it's only the Western people have got

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.550 
it's only the Western people have got
Moses<00:01:40.060> eat<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.450> yeah<00:01:40.750> most<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.380> world

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
Moses eat so yeah most of the world

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.130 
Moses eat so yeah most of the world
population<00:01:42.000> doesn't<00:01:43.000> have<00:01:43.179> any<00:01:43.539> problem<00:01:43.990> and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
population doesn't have any problem and

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.279 
population doesn't have any problem and
I<00:01:44.679> would<00:01:44.860> also<00:01:45.009> say<00:01:45.310> if<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.610> taste<00:01:45.850> advance

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
I would also say if you taste advance

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.749 
I would also say if you taste advance
then<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.409> next<00:01:47.979> time<00:01:48.100> is<00:01:48.280> not<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.490> problem

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
then the next time is not a problem

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.410 
then the next time is not a problem
anymore

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
anymore

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.380 
anymore
so<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.770> there<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.099> have<00:01:51.129> it<00:01:51.429> insects<00:01:52.149> such<00:01:52.360> as

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
so so there you have it insects such as

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.749 
so so there you have it insects such as
locusts<00:01:53.080> grasshoppers<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:54.039> mealworms<00:01:54.489> are

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
locusts grasshoppers and mealworms are

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.240 
locusts grasshoppers and mealworms are
nutritious<00:01:55.569> and<00:01:55.720> have<00:01:56.110> much<00:01:56.349> less<00:01:56.619> impact<00:01:57.099> on

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
nutritious and have much less impact on

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.100 
nutritious and have much less impact on
the<00:01:57.310> environment<00:01:57.520> than<00:01:58.119> livestock<00:01:58.629> but

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
the environment than livestock but

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.020 
the environment than livestock but
finding<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.619> right<00:01:59.649> insect<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.399> just<00:02:00.610> part<00:02:00.910> of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
finding the right insect is just part of

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.059 
finding the right insect is just part of
the<00:02:01.149> story<00:02:01.209> if<00:02:01.660> we're<00:02:02.080> gonna<00:02:02.200> make<00:02:02.379> any<00:02:02.530> impact

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
the story if we're gonna make any impact

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.400 
the story if we're gonna make any impact
at<00:02:03.190> all<00:02:03.399> on<00:02:03.459> a<00:02:03.700> global<00:02:04.119> demand<00:02:04.420> for<00:02:04.479> protein<00:02:04.750> we

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
at all on a global demand for protein we

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.839 
at all on a global demand for protein we
need<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.679> make<00:02:05.830> sure<00:02:05.979> we've<00:02:06.160> got<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.310> reliable

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
need to make sure we've got a reliable

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:12.210 
need to make sure we've got a reliable
and<00:02:07.030> sustainable<00:02:07.270> supply<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.830> we've<00:02:11.980> come<00:02:12.190> to

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220

Wow<00:02:38.750> those<00:02:39.750> warms<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.349> big<00:02:40.560> enough<00:02:40.739> for

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
Wow those warms are big enough for

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.960 
Wow those warms are big enough for
selling<00:02:41.370> coming<00:02:42.030> week<00:02:42.260> they<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:44.099> shifted<00:02:44.459> and

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
selling coming week they get shifted and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.589 
selling coming week they get shifted and
then<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.599> sell<00:02:45.840> see<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:47.040> can<00:02:47.250> put<00:02:47.550> more<00:02:48.090> warmth

then we sell see you can put more warmth

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.559 
then we sell see you can put more warmth
in<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.290> place<00:02:49.680> then<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.520> can<00:02:50.730> put<00:02:51.000> cows

in one place then you can put cows
I<00:02:51.599> think<00:02:52.319> there's<00:02:52.560> between<00:02:53.120> 700<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
I think there's between 700 and a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.440 
I think there's between 700 and a
thousand<00:02:55.020> kilos<00:02:55.290> only<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.550> room<00:02:57.150> of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
thousand kilos only in this room of

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.160 
thousand kilos only in this room of
insects<00:02:57.959> insects<00:02:59.780> insects<00:03:00.780> are<00:03:00.930> great

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.340 
one kilogram beef but that same 10
kilograms<00:03:08.730> will<00:03:09.000> produce<00:03:09.180> 9<00:03:09.630> kilograms<00:03:09.989> of

insect<00:03:10.739> protein<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.670> because<00:03:12.000> they're

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
insect protein this is because they're

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.820 
insect protein this is because they're
cold-blooded<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.900> don't<00:03:13.140> need<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.380> waste<00:03:13.530> any

temperature<00:03:16.700> okay<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:17.760> we've<00:03:18.030> done<00:03:18.060> our

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
temperature okay so we've done our

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.840 
temperature okay so we've done our
feeding<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.989> mealworms<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.610> next

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
feeding of the mealworms and the next

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.750 
feeding of the mealworms and the next
stage<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.239> process<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.870> now<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.080> take<00:03:22.319> the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
stage of the process is now to take the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.280 
stage of the process is now to take the
mature<00:03:23.760> worms<00:03:24.090> out

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.270

Wow look at that there's a lot of worms
so<00:03:46.910> this<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.270> like<00:03:47.480> pure<00:03:47.780> adult<00:03:48.410> meal<00:03:48.680> worm

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
so this is like pure adult meal worm

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.940 
so this is like pure adult meal worm
which<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.310> ready<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.760> go<00:03:49.880> up<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.150> market<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:51.080> to

found out the insects and nutritious you
can<00:04:09.629> farm<00:04:09.870> them<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.200> commercial<00:04:10.499> scale<00:04:10.829> and

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
can farm them on a commercial scale and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.250 
can farm them on a commercial scale and
they're<00:04:11.670> better<00:04:11.849> for<00:04:11.969> the<00:04:12.209> environment<00:04:12.299> but

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260
