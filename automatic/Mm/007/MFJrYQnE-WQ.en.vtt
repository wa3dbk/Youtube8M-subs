00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.030
 so for the richest of colocynths those who swear by 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.380
 this game 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 I present to you this little something 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 and besides for those who follow 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.410
 nevertheless it may be that this game I know that 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.220
 a lot for the acquisition of this game as a result of my video 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.820
 retrospective 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.110
 on the tiger columns present trade 4 how then a very very 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.130
 good game 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.660
 and so that motivated a lot of people to the city is good for these 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.370
 people who discover that the trade 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.540
 who could not really find out how they wanted because of the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.840
 maintenance does not let go for him 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.890
 too urgent 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.730
 see them only when you start the game 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.350
 you always tend to get a lot of opponents 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.610
 so the v8 gt three eliminations so that allows me to have a lot and here 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.740
 they appear by 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.840
 exactly planned just now 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.160
 well they appear for these excessive amounts 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.150
 so here I tried to eliminate this opponent elsewhere the killed leader 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.310
 oddly because of that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.360
 we have the impression anquetil had 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.380
 the asset commando nougaro fort de vancia put a stab in the back 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990
 had passed away from him 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.630
 I do not know about you 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.820
 but I feel like all the players are doing exactly 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.270
 the idea of ​​being flasher 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.760
 I know his parents 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.050
 who when he got angry and stays up 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.000
 same time his share m it seems logical I think that 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
 if everyone does it it's because he has a 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.060
 a reason for that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.170
 for this fight we are less visible from the ground 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.630
 st-imier when flash an opponent we see that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.280
 what was going on like that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.360
 it's really online 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.530
 it is necessary here and to be able to say that it is an easy target 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.629
 being lying meeting 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.629
 high school job is done 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.149
 placed in me something that is appreciable 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.489
 to the inverted in front of me I'm limited it's easily it's because 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.489
 that he had everything that is doing in this little corner there 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.730
 now it's going to be how to say decisive because you had to 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.359
 that at the beginning I started playing with the 16 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.909
 so with the muffler 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.989
 and that I passed on the 47 a4 silent 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.579
 for the simple and good reason that opposite who had a lot a lot 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.929
 of opponents who played with machine guns 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.929
 so whether it's the p90 or not 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.319
 ould el pais 5 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.469
 so it's true that playing 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.049
 with them the silent mc 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.579
 counter-foot and machine guns it's not necessarily a good thing so it's 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.159
 why I decided on you 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.859
 to spend percent on the 417 if we follow that it is really 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.859
 very good example 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.179
 a little stab 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.599
 limited glued to him 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.799
 rub against him 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.799
 this guy I thought there is a lot of knife 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.049
 so cac 40 already yields that makes 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.049
 but on what makes a noise he puts up in front of the right pace 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.059
 he is a pivot player 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:23.090
 tutu tutu culture 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.769
 for his 30 years 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.099
 the towers and the time that the scapa recounted 138 to pull up this thread 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.269
 an opponent in your city denis 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.269
 we were surrounded 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:38.169
 I got the mini cut 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.449
 I can not send it right away because I have a partner who 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.679
 sent kylie I sent to his 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.679
 his helico way because he wants 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.629
 take them out of there 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.659
 I could child we could see no during this time he is waiting 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:57.939
 the young woman who has worn a whole range of mobiles 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.989
 the helicopter of our partners 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.989
 even though the study but unfortunately his prefecture 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.680
 and seeing that I get killed by a panel of five so you paid either lp 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.680
 five kinds 90 unveiling on the left 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.799
 more really I'm adapting a little but this case 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.809
 that's something I strongly advise 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.139
 when you play 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.889
 at any colavitti try to attack you a bit before 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.189
 to your opponents 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.919
 that is when you are against players 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.969
 6 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.139
 at the rock level 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.740
 try crazy maybe a little more static 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.150
 if you are 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.529
 against players 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.639
 which are mounted extremely statistic extracts of the month 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.639
 try to outsmart intelligently 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.729
 prevent them from competing 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.729
 this forum to adapt 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.930
 to the players you have in front of you 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.930
 he is really too 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.800
 adjust your level of play 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.319
 you have in front of you 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.779
 sylvain dufour 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.089
 com weapons that you have in front of you 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.139
 if you have something to do 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.259
 in front of you because you 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.990
 which is encouraging that the use of the sector 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.009
 bah 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.270
 we also encourage 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.949
 self-respecting fan 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.949
 if you are on a map style 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.050
 for those who know m 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.050
 so that's an approach that is downloadable 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.050
 with a map pack 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.050
 that we hold us I'm more worn in the back 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.139
 it's actually a donation 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.400
 a sniper rifle 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.819
 it's really very unlikely 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.300
 to make good scores 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.460
 so really trying to perpetually adapt you do we have to deal 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.680
 make good high scores 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.080
 the most competitive possible 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.879
 so I'm a little 38 years old 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.530
 for those who do not really 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.949
 it is not bad at all 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.069
 especially in a game like collage catouillart the ideas that he would be who 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:04.719
 are really 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:05.969
 fairly little 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.009
 destructive I think it's a pretty good part
