lot of lean on the Boston bless the one

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.290 
lot of lean on the Boston bless the one
that<00:00:19.980> jasmine<00:00:20.400> has<00:00:20.580> there<00:00:20.880> has<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.240> been

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
that jasmine has there has not been

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.960 
that jasmine has there has not been
trimmed<00:00:21.869> yet<00:00:22.140> now<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.010> look<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:23.789> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
trimmed yet now you look at the one that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.540 
trimmed yet now you look at the one that
David<00:00:24.300> has<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.070> where<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> fat

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
David has here and you see where the fat

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.960 
David has here and you see where the fat
has<00:00:26.730> been<00:00:26.760> trimmed<00:00:26.970> away<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.160> down<00:00:29.760> at

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
has been trimmed away and then down at

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.569 
has been trimmed away and then down at
the<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.240> side<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.779> see<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.170> has<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.710> bone

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the one side you see what has a bone

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.020 
the one side you see what has a bone
usually<00:00:33.270> I'll<00:00:33.390> take<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> whole<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.030> cut

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
usually I'll take a whole but and cut

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.900 
usually I'll take a whole but and cut
the<00:00:36.149> butt<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.480> half<00:00:36.950> after<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.340> fat<00:00:38.670> has<00:00:38.879> been

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the butt in half after the fat has been

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.010 
the butt in half after the fat has been
cut<00:00:39.390> away<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.280> then<00:00:41.360> place<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.660> grill

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
cut away and then place it on the grill

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.150 
cut away and then place it on the grill
that<00:00:43.920> makes<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> shorter<00:00:45.120> cook<00:00:45.420> time<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
that makes for a shorter cook time and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
that makes for a shorter cook time and
actually<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.550> two<00:00:47.789> pieces<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.239> meat<00:00:48.559> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
actually you have two pieces of meat the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.580 
actually you have two pieces of meat the
reasons<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:49.950> cutting<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> fat<00:00:50.850> away<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:52.050> so

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
reasons for cutting the fat away is so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.400 
reasons for cutting the fat away is so
that<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.219> seasoning<00:00:53.910> will<00:00:54.660> season<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that the seasoning will season all the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.099 
that the seasoning will season all the
way<00:00:55.530> around<00:00:55.940> I'm<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.210> interested<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.930> eating

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
way around I'm not interested in eating

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.400 
way around I'm not interested in eating
a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.219> fat<00:00:59.719> mostly<00:01:00.719> I'm<00:01:00.809> looking<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
a lot of fat mostly I'm looking for the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.889 
a lot of fat mostly I'm looking for the
lean<00:01:01.620> meat<00:01:01.949> one<00:01:02.820> reason<00:01:03.059> why<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> favor<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
lean meat one reason why I favor the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.330 
lean meat one reason why I favor the
Boston<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.680> more<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> because<00:01:07.189> versus<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
Boston but more is because versus the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.120 
Boston but more is because versus the
rib<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.939> because<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> Boston<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.960> has<00:01:10.200> more

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
rib is because the Boston but has more

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.910 
rib is because the Boston but has more
meat<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.939> less<00:01:12.299> bone<00:01:12.630> you're<00:01:13.530> paying

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
meat on it and less bone you're paying

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.230 
meat on it and less bone you're paying
for<00:01:13.950> more<00:01:14.369> meat<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:15.900> less<00:01:16.200> bone<00:01:17.240> you're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
for more meat and less bone you're

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.460 
for more meat and less bone you're
eating<00:01:18.479> more<00:01:18.689> meat<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:20.520> less<00:01:20.759> bone<00:01:21.470> so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
eating more meat and less bone so

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.710 
eating more meat and less bone so
therefore<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.640> Boston<00:01:24.060> butt<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> good

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
therefore the Boston butt is a good

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.210 
therefore the Boston butt is a good
tasting<00:01:25.290> meat<00:01:25.500> also<00:01:27.470> actually<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.770> said<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
tasting meat also actually I said it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.270 
tasting meat also actually I said it
comes<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> front<00:01:30.869> upper<00:01:31.560> shoulder<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
comes from the front upper shoulder of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.899 
comes from the front upper shoulder of
the<00:01:32.729> hog<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.409> meat<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.890> usually<00:01:35.340> pick<00:01:35.640> is

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the hog the meat that I usually pick is

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.800 
the hog the meat that I usually pick is
a<00:01:35.939> swift<00:01:37.100> brand<00:01:38.100> Boston<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.240> which<00:01:39.509> actually

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
a swift brand Boston but which actually

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.630 
a swift brand Boston but which actually
has<00:01:40.229> less<00:01:40.590> fat<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.920> don't<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.610> what

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
has less fat I don't know for what

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.190 
has less fat I don't know for what
reason<00:01:41.759> whoever<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.770> roar<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.220> hogs<00:01:44.430> are

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
reason whoever the roar of the hogs are

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.499 
reason whoever the roar of the hogs are
has<00:01:46.200> less<00:01:46.500> fat<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.890> their<00:01:47.100> back<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.450> a
