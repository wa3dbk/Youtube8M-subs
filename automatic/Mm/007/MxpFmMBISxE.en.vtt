00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.760
 33 seasons ago by mike 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.469
 brown that are the angels lakers now 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.389
 I worked three summers in a row in the 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.060
 company in las vegas' week impacted 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.400
 and there was training as you between ments 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.689
 individual professional games there 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.570
 I had the opportunity to train with 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.099
 players like chance v 2 like kevin 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.650
 garnett and many other colors 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.710
 university students of nba 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.530
 and good to match mike 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.650
 I was 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.680
 Well he liked how he worked and I 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.320
 basically offered a long story 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.240
 very well reduced but this was 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.550
 exposed in the right place at the moment 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.320
 of the game 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.420
 after three years that I've been here, I'm very 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.110
 happy with the organization with the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.360
 deal received with my own work 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.950
 for being European and has grown 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.340
 in another culture and in the context of a 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.600
 different way because I'm not 100% the same 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.240
 to the other coaches that 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.059
 probably have grown up with the 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.400
 basketball here but yes I've 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.400
 valued that they have seen me as 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.700
 maybe something different if the truth is that 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.010
 we have a short and medium project 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.410
 term 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.110
 regarding the interior of this media 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.910
 season with which in such a group 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.860
 cold we have improved in terms of 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.100
 talent we have been fighting for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.900
 enter the youth I think it is that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.240
 are the steps to follow because I think the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.340
 Spanish team is a group that had 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.680
 demonstrating over the years that it is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.080
 be aspiring to everything 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.399
 50 with 2 with good with a handicap that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.490
 is the riki injury 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.829
 unfortunately he can not be there 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.930
 now we have had the operation 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.360
 of rudy that we hope he recovers in 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.729
 brief but even though I still believe that the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.530
 union of the group and the fact that they have 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.880
 been together sharing a lot during 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.689
 a lot of time they have won many 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.380
 titles I think that we put them as 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.380
 serious candidates 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.260
 from washington 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.970
 a hug greeting and encourage everyone 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.130
 you would have here to experience what is the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.780
 idea and above all has followed our 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.290
 European that is what all the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.290
 presidents
