00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Jews on guest and welcome to delivery 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.279
 14 of millions of hunts you have 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.049
 chosen on case number three we go 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.179
 see what we get in it we already get one 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.690
 not a good player for a while 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.950
 it is a sum of 200,000 costs so 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.809
 certainly not wrong 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.760
 let's see how we do that in our team 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.890
 can implement on your screen you see 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.570
 now let the suitcases that you can still choose 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.279
 sure of comment behind minus 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 case 3 which is this episode then 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.269
 and leave a comment 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.769
 the previous episode had known service 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.939
 specifically small to the none 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.040
 commons 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.780
 so from that 200k I really have 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.460
 ridiculously many players can buy 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.920
 want the team to be able to get a big boost 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 give on right back cart van gorp cv 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.780
 search a nice detail we ramos on cv and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 I do not know if he automatically no 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.219
 was that not yet on CVM we have engine 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 each on a right winger we have care 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.890
 Well, grabbing glasses was already one of those 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.899
 200k 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.460
 then have the da still on goal that I have 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.469
 also purchased and for the rest fill it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.629
 a bit in with the players we are out 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.100
 our premium your team had with this team 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 let's play a game in the division 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.239
 we play in the opponent found in 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 divisions 6 we are going so crazy about team 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.229
 who has it today is Monday tomorrow 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.939
 comes the last episode of the un and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.040
 glory and then Wednesday comes as 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.540
 everything goes according to plan my 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.040
 new series from around the let 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.570
 fix and like this video behind 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.460
 architetti me just i got there myself 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.680
 ridiculous sense and I can not 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.659
 wait until that series is really ridiculous 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.070
 a lot of planning went into it 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.110
 can finally come online outside of game 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.689
 seems to me 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.030
 creapop why whistles will have 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.009
 referee he waits so long with 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.820
 defender 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.500
 no then i just have to wait until 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.659
 play just like global space goes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.799
 so that I can have a chance 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.880
 we create for the rest there is really no 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.780
 so many in so can this guy from 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.229
 to do 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 look the image for your good foot 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.590
 came alongside how I seriously thought it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590
 went in 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.770
 yes finally made a mistake this must 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.659
 we are going to punish those that have been abolished 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 we really too stupid for words battery again oh 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.399
 do whatever this guy is trying 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.619
 time to understand because watch as you do this 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.239
 does fine if the john games box okay 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.860
 but if you then make a mistake array 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.450
 you surely do something good 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.890
 we worship was the divide have 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.870
 Closed off for rest I think he is 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.350
 a lot of possession indeed has 63% 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.080
 but still has nothing 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.940
 nate to create so little we know to 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.350
 creating with this team actually works best 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.940
 surprising is that i think it is one 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.489
 from the most creative teams that I belong to 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.420
 have used so far 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.670
 side also have to deal with 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.440
 opponent that he just bit vague 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.080
 we actually do score with each one 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.180
 again but what a weird gates this 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.220
 say i know why the salary 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.080
 Some people have a game plan week 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.880
 don't spam just about it 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.170
 at depth balls or that go lemmer trick 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.760
 is walking or trying to do that 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.650
 just to give up 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.170
 this guy who actually does it all 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.430
 nothing but think it's real football 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.530
 and then he slowly tries to get up 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.450
 build what just doesn't work because then love it 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.090
 you just pace the game and pace 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.110
 he only does that and that 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.019
 is it then 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.860
 and then then do not know what he 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.950
 want to achieve with it 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.170
 gerard wants to type and perfect position 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.239
 for the free kick for you goes there 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.940
 Also just in me, I do what's up 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.860
 then you admit it is not zero four 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.080
 nice free kick jorg certainly not 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.880
 wrongly considered was concluded 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.860
 and with me really no where 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.239
 noticeably opposed to me 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.680
 and that's for the first time in one 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.630
 viva competition 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.730
 collected during the series, which is 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.470
 happened in my opinion there two lap 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.630
 had and outside the box where he 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.980
 has 89 passion times it isn't either 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.230
 very difficult so you know it 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.819
 central defenders cruise 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.750
 but for the rest nothing happened 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.310
 How much 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.450
 this has sufficient fitness so me 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.400
 think that access is still a game 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.500
 play with this team I want is gerbil 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.030
 try it again because it's really mine 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.830
 favorite right winger from the game and 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.750
 that free kick and that chip just like 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.280
 we only saw that evidence 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.709
 found the team but his team 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.890
 name is do b yes and I wrote 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.540
 the worst we have to do against you 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.400
 and that also happens but the Russian one 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.269
 variant with mike come on left winger 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.400
 wedding 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.560
 gusttavo melo hernandez it is one 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.630
 brazilian behind 10 not very good 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.880
 but certainly good enough to be dangerous 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.400
 can be 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.620
 Get rid of zara in the first minute 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.030
 oh he made a sliding that was real 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.220
 very stupid and only gave us again 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.150
 space and almost as good as from the 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.110
 kick off 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.110
 we know how to score again 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.800
 oh no he is the door g at the game 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.630
 an escort how can it be that 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.419
 defense suddenly fell apart for a moment 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.100
 repeat what suddenly with one 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.700
 deep on shore were the three on a shelf 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.700
 defenders away and we start off with it 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.370
 but it came to be very much like you 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.290
 azarius immediately some frisk from 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.770
 80 your audience scored there in the first 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.669
 six minutes of the match is in 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.740
 this j 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.580
 kotori-chan really incredibly tasty lung 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.590
 shot 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.160
 let them see let them see or 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:07.370
 just up close that is possible again 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.370
 so many men in sixteen times peer 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.320
 whose are how many men 16 oh yes now 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.940
 then now then the pokÃ© battery again oh 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.169
 actually we are back at two 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.169
 goals ahead 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.190
 how do you score this 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.360
 ikea also may see repeat well know 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.560
 you if you shoot right at the keeper then 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.850
 do you expect in principle that the 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.830
 keeper has it but apparently it is 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.350
 gold the technique that this guy good 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.290
 know how to apply 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.910
 oh on her that's a nice ball 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.660
 rafael you get spread 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.780
 pronounced 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.760
 the ball is given hare he became 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.620
 why should that be important at the 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.550
 filters agneta the world and just 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.550
 to see 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.230
 which is also good 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.740
 on paper 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.740
 no all those balls also score yet 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.629
 h yes 90 students still score a ball 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.129
 battery again oh huppekee no too of the 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.690
 line picked up this is such a typical one 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.550
 luckily we stand for 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.500
 and luckily have won this is the 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.120
 hard-fought victory like youri 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.250
 Mulder could have said that one says 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.690
 pronunciation for him but damn 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.580
 I think for the moral I see I 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.099
 said it was heavily fought abandoned 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.580
 and that it is also 12 saucer by 15 in 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.190
 total 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.569
 every shot was in the sixteen and their 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.400
 mother to keep this good happy
