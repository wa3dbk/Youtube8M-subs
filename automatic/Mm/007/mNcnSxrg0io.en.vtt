00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
remove the four millimeter nut that

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.319 
remove the four millimeter nut that
holds<00:00:44.500> it<00:00:44.800> on<00:00:44.950> once<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.640> wheel<00:00:45.790> nut<00:00:46.000> is<00:00:46.120> out<00:00:46.300> of

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
holds it on once the wheel nut is out of

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.850 
holds it on once the wheel nut is out of
the<00:00:46.480> way<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.870> tires<00:00:47.110> gonna<00:00:47.380> come<00:00:47.590> right<00:00:47.800> on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
the way the tires gonna come right on

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.740 
the way the tires gonna come right on
off<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.280> now<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.670> can<00:00:48.910> go<00:00:49.059> ahead<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.390> switch<00:00:49.510> it

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
off and now I can go ahead and switch it

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.600 
off and now I can go ahead and switch it
out<00:00:49.870> for<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.200> new<00:00:50.350> one<00:00:50.590> now<00:00:51.040> these<00:00:51.190> tires<00:00:51.460> are

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
out for the new one now these tires are

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.010 
out for the new one now these tires are
rather<00:00:51.760> interesting<00:00:51.880> because<00:00:52.420> for<00:00:52.899> the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
rather interesting because for the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.450 
rather interesting because for the
electric<00:00:53.380> Rustler<00:00:53.770> these<00:00:54.010> are<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.219> front

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
electric Rustler these are the front

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.430 
electric Rustler these are the front
tires<00:00:54.760> but<00:00:55.149> for<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.390> nitro<00:00:55.750> racer<00:00:56.140> they're

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
tires but for the nitro racer they're

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.190 
tires but for the nitro racer they're
the<00:00:56.590> rear<00:00:56.829> they<00:00:57.550> do<00:00:57.610> utilize<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.690> wheel<00:00:58.840> hex

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
the rear they do utilize the wheel hex

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.660 
the rear they do utilize the wheel hex
hub<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.800> Front's<00:01:00.160> are<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.309> little<00:01:00.550> bit

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
hub the Front's are a little bit

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.220 
hub the Front's are a little bit
different<00:01:01.059> but<00:01:01.180> for<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.450> rear<00:01:01.629> it's<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.960> same

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
different but for the rear it's the same

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.290 
different but for the rear it's the same
another<00:01:03.070> thing<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.610> is<00:01:03.789> that<00:01:03.910> if<00:01:04.059> you<00:01:04.119> don't

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
another thing is is that if you don't

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.150 
another thing is is that if you don't
know<00:01:04.420> which<00:01:04.600> direction<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:05.259> tire<00:01:05.470> goes<00:01:05.800> there

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
know which direction the tire goes there

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.800 
know which direction the tire goes there
is<00:01:06.250> always<00:01:06.550> an<00:01:06.670> indicator<00:01:07.060> on<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.390> tire<00:01:07.600> to

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
is always an indicator on the tire to

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.109 
is always an indicator on the tire to
show<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.020> which<00:01:08.380> way<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.710> rotation<00:01:08.830> is<00:01:09.369> so

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
show you which way the rotation is so

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.790 
show you which way the rotation is so
for<00:01:10.360> now<00:01:10.479> let's<00:01:10.780> just<00:01:10.930> go<00:01:11.110> ahead<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.350> slide<00:01:11.560> it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
for now let's just go ahead and slide it

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.520 
for now let's just go ahead and slide it
on<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.190> reattach<00:01:13.149> the<00:01:13.509> 4<00:01:13.810> millimeter<00:01:14.050> wheel

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
on and reattach the 4 millimeter wheel

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.949 
on and reattach the 4 millimeter wheel
nut<00:01:14.770> now<00:01:15.369> for<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.700> front<00:01:15.910> tires<00:01:16.149> it<00:01:16.509> is<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.690> bit

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:16.959 
nut now for the front tires it is a bit

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.480 
nut now for the front tires it is a bit
different<00:01:17.170> you're<00:01:17.530> not<00:01:17.560> gonna<00:01:17.830> be<00:01:17.979> removing<00:01:18.429> a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
different you're not gonna be removing a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.710 
different you're not gonna be removing a
four<00:01:18.729> millimeter<00:01:18.910> nut<00:01:19.300> you're<00:01:19.450> gonna<00:01:19.569> be

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
four millimeter nut you're gonna be

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.139 
four millimeter nut you're gonna be
removing<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.380> 5<00:01:20.709> millimeter<00:01:21.009> nut<00:01:21.490> once<00:01:22.030> the

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
removing a 5 millimeter nut once the

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.430 
removing a 5 millimeter nut once the
wheel<00:01:22.300> that<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.630> out<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.929> way<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.350> you

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
wheel that is out of the way and you

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.660 
wheel that is out of the way and you
pull<00:01:23.619> off<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.800> tire<00:01:24.130> you're<00:01:24.280> gonna<00:01:24.399> realize

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
pull off the tire you're gonna realize

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.490 
pull off the tire you're gonna realize
that<00:01:25.090> there<00:01:25.270> are<00:01:25.300> bearings<00:01:25.869> inside<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.440> the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
that there are bearings inside of the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.469 
that there are bearings inside of the
rim<00:01:26.709> themselves<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:27.940> what<00:01:28.090> you're<00:01:28.209> gonna<00:01:28.300> have

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
rim themselves so what you're gonna have

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.529 
rim themselves so what you're gonna have
to<00:01:28.569> do<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:29.110> gently<00:01:29.890> go<00:01:30.250> ahead<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:30.880> pop<00:01:31.179> out<00:01:31.360> the

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
to do is gently go ahead and pop out the

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.190 
to do is gently go ahead and pop out the
bearings<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:33.310> push<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.849> on<00:01:34.000> through<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
bearings just push it on through and

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.630 
bearings just push it on through and
when<00:01:35.410> you<00:01:35.500> do<00:01:35.679> you're<00:01:35.860> gonna<00:01:35.979> realize<00:01:36.250> there

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
when you do you're gonna realize there

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.190 
when you do you're gonna realize there
is<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.789> bushing<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.450> goes<00:01:37.630> in<00:01:37.810> between<00:01:37.840> the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
is a bushing that goes in between the

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.460 
is a bushing that goes in between the
two<00:01:38.349> bearings<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:40.090> once<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.569> get<00:01:40.810> these<00:01:41.200> two

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
two bearings so once you get these two

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.410 
two bearings so once you get these two
bearings<00:01:41.950> out<00:01:42.160> it's<00:01:42.550> time<00:01:42.819> to<00:01:42.970> go<00:01:43.090> ahead<00:01:43.300> and

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
bearings out it's time to go ahead and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.900 
bearings out it's time to go ahead and
transfer<00:01:43.959> it<00:01:44.050> over<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.709> new<00:01:44.860> tire<00:01:45.220> so<00:01:45.789> what

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
transfer it over to the new tire so what

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.969 
transfer it over to the new tire so what
I'm<00:01:46.030> gonna<00:01:46.119> do<00:01:46.330> is<00:01:46.479> just<00:01:46.630> slide<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.709> bearing

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
I'm gonna do is just slide the bearing

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.529 
I'm gonna do is just slide the bearing
in<00:01:48.099> there<00:01:48.220> push<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.640> all<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.849> way<00:01:48.970> down<00:01:49.000> and

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
in there push it all the way down and

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.650 
in there push it all the way down and
then<00:01:50.170> flip<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.649> over<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:51.069> the<00:01:51.190> other<00:01:51.280> side<00:01:51.660> drop

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
then flip it over to the other side drop

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.529 
then flip it over to the other side drop
in<00:01:52.959> the<00:01:53.110> bushing<00:01:53.470> make<00:01:54.009> sure<00:01:54.160> it<00:01:54.250> goes<00:01:54.369> in

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
in the bushing make sure it goes in

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.330 
in the bushing make sure it goes in
followed<00:01:55.539> by<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:55.720> other<00:01:55.959> bearing<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.619> then

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
followed by the other bearing and then

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.309 
followed by the other bearing and then
like<00:01:57.849> I<00:01:58.000> said<00:01:58.060> before<00:01:58.330> just<00:01:58.869> look<00:01:59.050> for<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
like I said before just look for the

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.249 
like I said before just look for the
indicator<00:01:59.770> of<00:02:00.009> where<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.250> rotation<00:02:00.789> goes<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
indicator of where the rotation goes and

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.169 
indicator of where the rotation goes and
then<00:02:02.410> just<00:02:02.649> slide<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.190> tire<00:02:03.429> on<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.030> then

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
then just slide the tire on and then

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.359 
then just slide the tire on and then
reattach<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.869> nut<00:02:05.110> so<00:02:05.410> here's<00:02:05.619> Banshees<00:02:06.160> old

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
reattach the nut so here's Banshees old

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.070 
reattach the nut so here's Banshees old
tires<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:08.340> here's<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.729> new<00:02:09.940> Anaconda<00:02:10.810> tires

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
tires and here's the new Anaconda tires

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.880 
tires and here's the new Anaconda tires

interesting<00:03:02.850> because<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.510> these<00:03:03.960> tires<00:03:04.470> even

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
interesting because for these tires even

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.350 
interesting because for these tires even
though<00:03:05.400> they<00:03:05.580> do<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:06.260> now<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.590> Rustler

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
though they do you now for the Rustler

though they do you now for the Rustler
for<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.480> electric<00:03:09.930> Rustler<00:03:10.470> they<00:03:10.950> go<00:03:11.100> on<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
for the electric Rustler they go on the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.220 
for the electric Rustler they go on the
back<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.210> can<00:03:12.240> see<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.720> I'm<00:03:12.840> pointing

back and you can see that I'm pointing

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.480 
back and you can see that I'm pointing
out<00:03:13.350> things<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.740> I<00:03:13.860> don't<00:03:14.130> need<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.370> be

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
out things that I don't need to be
