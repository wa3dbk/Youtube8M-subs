00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.919 

look<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.059> said<00:00:09.210> at<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.389> start<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.719> series

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
look I said at the start of the series

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.030 
look I said at the start of the series
their<00:00:10.200> goal<00:00:10.349> was<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.590> win<00:00:10.620> every<00:00:10.800> test

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
their goal was to win every test

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.339 
their goal was to win every test
actually<00:00:11.280> played<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.360> lot<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.690> hard<00:00:12.960> work<00:00:13.049> is

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
actually played so a lot of hard work is

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.990 
actually played so a lot of hard work is
going<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.980> get<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.250> result<00:00:16.279> and<00:00:17.279> way<00:00:17.670> it

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
going in to get this result and way it

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.330 
going in to get this result and way it
looks<00:00:18.390> convincing<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.650> end<00:00:19.800> result<00:00:20.130> winning

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
looks convincing the end result winning

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.859 
looks convincing the end result winning
formula<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.090> guarantee<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.480> was

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
formula but I can guarantee that was

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.330 
formula but I can guarantee that was
certainly<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.920> lot<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.160> tough<00:00:23.310> times

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
certainly a lot of tough times

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.220 
certainly a lot of tough times
throughout<00:00:23.760> his<00:00:23.910> test<00:00:24.150> series<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> I

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
throughout his test series but I I

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.960 
throughout his test series but I I
couldn't<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.010> happier<00:00:26.099> we've<00:00:26.580> played<00:00:26.789> some

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
couldn't be happier we've played some

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.429 
couldn't be happier we've played some
really<00:00:27.210> good<00:00:27.330> cook<00:00:27.539> applied<00:00:27.990> some<00:00:28.199> very

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
really good cook applied some very

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.470 
really good cook applied some very
consistent<00:00:29.099> cricket<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.550> that's<00:00:30.090> that's

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
consistent cricket and that's that's

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.780 
consistent cricket and that's that's
very<00:00:30.539> satisfying<00:00:30.869> yeah<00:00:31.650> that's<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.460> i<00:00:32.489> said

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
very satisfying yeah that's like i said

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.430 
very satisfying yeah that's like i said
i<00:00:32.820> think<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> consistency<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.020> been<00:00:34.170> an<00:00:34.260> area

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
i think the consistency has been an area

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.380 
i think the consistency has been an area
that<00:00:34.559> we've<00:00:34.770> had<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.010> work<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> team<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that we've had to work on as a team and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
that we've had to work on as a team and
today<00:00:36.780> baqi<00:00:37.290> packing<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.860> throughout<00:00:38.190> this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
today baqi packing up throughout this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.860 
today baqi packing up throughout this
series<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.940> win<00:00:39.030> all<00:00:39.149> four<00:00:39.390> test<00:00:39.660> matches

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
series and win all four test matches

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
series and win all four test matches
shows<00:00:40.770> we're<00:00:41.040> improving<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.640> area<00:00:41.940> so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
shows we're improving in that area so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810 
shows we're improving in that area so
you<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> less<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.070> South<00:00:44.340> Africa<00:00:44.789> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you know the less in South Africa and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.020 
you know the less in South Africa and
the<00:00:44.969> less<00:00:45.180> against<00:00:45.450> new<00:00:45.629> zealand<00:00:45.660> is

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
the less against new zealand is

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
the less against new zealand is
something<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.600> guess<00:00:49.079> every<00:00:49.289> plane<00:00:49.500> in

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
something that I guess every plane in

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
something that I guess every plane in
that<00:00:50.460> chain<00:00:50.700> room<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> having<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.750> front<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that chain room is having the front of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.330 
that chain room is having the front of
their<00:00:52.170> mind<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.649> that's<00:00:52.800> probably<00:00:52.949> been<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
their mind and that's probably been a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
their mind and that's probably been a
bit<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.300> inspiration<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.960> guess<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> make

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
bit of an inspiration I guess to make

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.619 
bit of an inspiration I guess to make
sure<00:00:55.770> when<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.699> feel<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.059> things<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.510> on

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
sure when we feel like things are go on

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.380 
sure when we feel like things are go on
war<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.050> keep<00:00:58.260> pushing<00:00:58.590> forward<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.239> make<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
war to keep pushing forward to make the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.299 
war to keep pushing forward to make the
most<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.410> momentum<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.039> we've<00:01:02.190> been

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
most of the momentum that we've been

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.380 
most of the momentum that we've been
able<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.979> yeah<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.880> decided<00:01:06.240> but

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
able to have and yeah I have decided but

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.640 
able to have and yeah I have decided but
I<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> need<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.140> throughout<00:01:07.500> your

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
I think you need that throughout your

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.840 
I think you need that throughout your
career<00:01:07.950> you'll<00:01:08.100> need<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:08.369> through<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> few

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
career you'll need to go through a few

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.580 
career you'll need to go through a few
tough<00:01:09.090> times<00:01:09.330> individually<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> team

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
tough times individually and as a team

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.550 
tough times individually and as a team
to<00:01:10.830> realize<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.420> how<00:01:12.750> hard<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.229> test

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
to realize you know how hard it is test

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.920 
to realize you know how hard it is test
cricket<00:01:13.700> but<00:01:14.700> then<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.060> special<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.689> when

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
cricket but then how special it is when

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
cricket but then how special it is when
you<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.140> days<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.619> today<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.430> series

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you have days like today and a series

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.670 
you have days like today and a series
like<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.659> every<00:01:19.020> every<00:01:19.380> player<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
like this I think every every player in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.960 
like this I think every every player in
that<00:01:19.740> change<00:01:20.070> room<00:01:20.280> should<00:01:20.460> be<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.729> proud

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that change room should be very proud

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.530 
that change room should be very proud
and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:24.060> definitely<00:01:24.360> enjoy

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
match where I think all the guys are

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.869 
match where I think all the guys are
quite<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> big<00:02:31.980> part<00:02:32.220> throughout<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.670> series

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
quite a big part throughout the series

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.930 
quite a big part throughout the series
in<00:02:33.150> us<00:02:33.660> as<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> team<00:02:33.959> having<00:02:34.440> success<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.760> one

in us as a team having success the one
day<00:02:36.120> thur<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> different<00:02:37.590> format<00:02:37.890> but

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
day thur like is a different format but

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.250 
day thur like is a different format but
I<00:02:38.670> certainly<00:02:39.060> believe<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.750> guys<00:02:39.930> in

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
I certainly believe that the guys in

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.770 
I certainly believe that the guys in
this<00:02:40.530> test<00:02:40.769> team<00:02:41.010> at<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.220> moment<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.819> could

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
this test team at the moment and could

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
this test team at the moment and could
play<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:43.140> day<00:02:43.170> cricket<00:02:43.410> that's<00:02:43.799> for<00:02:43.980> sure<00:02:44.099> you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
play one day cricket that's for sure you

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.030 
play one day cricket that's for sure you
know<00:02:44.549> what<00:02:44.790> attack<00:02:45.510> we<00:02:45.690> go<00:02:45.840> for<00:02:46.170> we'll<00:02:46.739> have<00:02:46.920> to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
know what attack we go for we'll have to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.410 
know what attack we go for we'll have to
wait<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.250> see<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.060> they've

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
wait and see but I think that they've

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.660 
wait and see but I think that they've
shown<00:02:48.450> for<00:02:48.690> their<00:02:48.989> stakes<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.370> shorter

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
form that they can they can do the job

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.960 
form that they can they can do the job
in<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.890> shorter<00:02:53.160> form<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.400> well<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.730> wouldn't

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.440 
played I think he's a wonderful talent I
do<00:04:04.319> seem<00:04:04.829> as<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> big<00:04:05.250> part<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.639> of<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
do seem as a big part of of the

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.180 
do seem as a big part of of the
Australian<00:04:06.930> teaming<00:04:07.319> in<00:04:07.470> all<00:04:07.590> three<00:04:07.829> forms<00:04:08.130> of

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
Australian teaming in all three forms of

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.339 
Australian teaming in all three forms of
the<00:04:08.310> game<00:04:08.340> going<00:04:08.730> forward<00:04:09.209> but<00:04:09.389> he<00:04:10.079> certainly

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
the game going forward but he certainly

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.140 
the game going forward but he certainly
needs<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.769> continue<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.190> make<00:04:11.340> runs<00:04:11.609> and<00:04:11.910> I

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
needs to continue to make runs and I

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.940 
needs to continue to make runs and I
think<00:04:12.630> if<00:04:12.750> he<00:04:12.810> gets<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.109> opportunity<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.769> play

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
think if he gets the opportunity to play

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.690 
think if he gets the opportunity to play
first

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
first

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.340

think<00:06:25.720> that's<00:06:26.020> probably<00:06:26.710> just<00:06:26.890> the<00:06:26.979> way<00:06:27.160> down

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
think that's probably just the way down

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.800 
think that's probably just the way down
i<00:06:27.460> think<00:06:27.669> the<00:06:27.729> best<00:06:27.940> bowling<00:06:28.270> spell<00:06:28.600> that<00:06:28.720> we

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
i think the best bowling spell that we

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.110 
i think the best bowling spell that we
had<00:06:28.960> was<00:06:29.140> probably<00:06:29.440> in<00:06:30.100> sydney<00:06:30.580> when<00:06:30.729> men<00:06:30.910> here

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
had was probably in sydney when men here

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.390 
had was probably in sydney when men here
free<00:06:31.270> bar<00:06:31.479> about<00:06:32.290> a<00:06:32.350> partnership<00:06:32.710> we<00:06:33.220> didn't

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
free bar about a partnership we didn't

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.800 
free bar about a partnership we didn't
get<00:06:33.460> any<00:06:33.610> rickets<00:06:33.910> but<00:06:34.150> we<00:06:34.240> bought<00:06:34.390> about<00:06:34.510> nine

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
get any rickets but we bought about nine

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.719 
get any rickets but we bought about nine
overs<00:06:35.200> stratum<00:06:35.860> Odin's<00:06:36.220> and<00:06:36.370> I<00:06:36.400> think<00:06:36.610> that

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
overs stratum Odin's and I think that

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.940 
overs stratum Odin's and I think that
just<00:06:36.760> showed<00:06:37.150> that<00:06:37.419> summed<00:06:37.660> up<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:38.680> summer

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
just showed that summed up the summer

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.800 
just showed that summed up the summer
and<00:06:39.220> what<00:06:39.370> we<00:06:39.520> what<00:06:39.729> we<00:06:39.760> wanted<00:06:40.120> to<00:06:40.180> achieve<00:06:40.360> in

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
and what we what we wanted to achieve in

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.000 
and what we what we wanted to achieve in
every<00:06:41.169> match<00:06:41.350> that<00:06:41.380> we<00:06:41.650> would<00:06:41.770> have<00:06:41.890> been

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
every match that we would have been

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.590 
every match that we would have been
involved<00:06:42.280> that's<00:06:42.789> the<00:06:43.000> way<00:06:43.120> we<00:06:43.270> want<00:06:43.419> to<00:06:43.510> go

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
involved that's the way we want to go

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
involved that's the way we want to go
about<00:06:43.840> it<00:06:43.900> and<00:06:43.990> I<00:06:44.080> think<00:06:44.289> that's<00:06:44.440> probably

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
about it and I think that's probably

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.130 
about it and I think that's probably
without<00:06:45.460> any<00:06:45.669> wickets<00:06:45.970> and<00:06:46.180> that's<00:06:47.020> probably

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
without any wickets and that's probably

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.480 
without any wickets and that's probably
the<00:06:47.350> best<00:06:47.440> speller<00:06:47.770> bowling<00:06:48.100> that<00:06:48.220> we<00:06:48.310> had<00:06:48.460> all

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
the best speller bowling that we had all

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.640 
the best speller bowling that we had all
summer<00:06:48.820> and<00:06:48.970> just<00:06:49.960> that<00:06:50.110> was<00:06:50.229> the<00:06:50.350> plan<00:06:50.530> we

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
summer and just that was the plan we

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.640 
summer and just that was the plan we
want<00:06:50.830> to<00:06:50.919> do<00:06:51.070> and<00:06:51.340> I<00:06:52.030> think<00:06:52.300> that's<00:06:52.479> some<00:06:52.750> that

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
want to do and I think that's some that

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.620 
want to do and I think that's some that
was<00:06:53.740> perfect<00:06:53.890> done<00:06:54.310> reading<00:06:54.850> and<00:06:54.970> show<00:06:55.479> what

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
was perfect done reading and show what

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:08.239 
was perfect done reading and show what
we're<00:06:55.750> all<00:06:55.870> about

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:08.249 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:10.309
