00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 guys girls or all of me without laces 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.429
 states and this is minecraft today os 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.010
 let's say that a small guide of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.269
 the colors of the bacon according as 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.860
 you are seeing there are a lot of colors 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.839
 different we are in the version 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.850
 14 what's 32 to worth and this is one thing 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.680
 that will come out from the 1.8 vale 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.359
 with this version of forward you already go 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.630
 to have the agreement then when we go 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.630
 to start 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.090
 and is that the bacon will not have the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.439
 color that has always had the smell 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.439
 this the safe harbor dais 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.720
 Let's see 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.470
 is not going to have this color so shabby to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.480
 I never like it is that I never liked 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.360
 and hey, he 's helping me to take off 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.489
 names and the tabulator how they change the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 people are very cool and good today 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.870
 I'm going to tell the town a little about 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 about the colors of agreement has a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.160
 small ship I will explain it but already 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.500
 I have read where they bojen that this flight 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.330
 they are going to remove vale is good depending 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.710
 the type of glass that you put over 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.740
 of beacon will change the colors 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.979
 of agreement you will be able to choose all and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.660
 then as you already have all you will be able to 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.759
 do the same but with two lenses like this 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.790
 to be able to make egg colors that were not 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.310
 you had in minecraft do not be green anymore 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.120
 dark you do not have it around here this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.120
 dark purple that you have so much 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.180
 this orange-orange rose that does not 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.860
 we can have or be crappy orange that 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.900
 we can not have it either but as you can see 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.490
 we can take them out, that is, the 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.260
 combinations can be exaggerated not 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.960
 combine all and we will leave this 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.790
 rare brown not but then there is a small 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.610
 hole that explain in agreement and is that 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.110
 when you put together three colors of equal 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.510
 the order and the beige crystals is 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.280
 yellow black green green yellow 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.450
 ourselves but the book what it does 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.000
 is that instead of putting the same 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.820
 tonality has changed it's worth a 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.560
 they are looking for bojan people who are going it 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.440
 they will change to fix agreement 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.270
 so good is one thing that in 1.12 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.310
 it will not happen, but if you see what happens 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.540
 you do not worry it is not 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.860
 logic also that the green and the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.910
 yellow 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.440
 I do not know if we're going to go to what we're going 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.880
 to go to the colored blocks and 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.060
 you know that these blocks are going to 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.590
 do with six the pilots and masters 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.130
 we put the different ones together so that 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.810
 you see the changes the red that 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.610
 docked beige and the rayito has 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.100
 turned into a red it's worth if we put it 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.569
 the blue then the blue yes on top of the red 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.319
 we put 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.319
 a blue 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.480
 to see if he makes the change there you see is 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.430
 a kind of purple 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.080
 it's funny but if for example above 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.290
 from him we put the brown 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.760
 no paisa and the change well what kind of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.190
 things we can do good we're going to 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.560
 catch more colors, it's worth it if it seems good 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.630
 in corraleja of pimps 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.630
 let's make yellow 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.530
 before this insult yellow oil the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.530
 next will go green 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.540
 and the next shade of blue there is already 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.860
 has changed to beige which is yellow all 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.130
 the tulle and vice are changing the colors 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.130
 that yes that in the end we are leaving s 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.390
 it's fine if we put more blue 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.310
 notes that you see since it has been more blue or 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.680
 as soon as we say that you are changing 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.750
 you see here the blue at the beginning there was no 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.610
 much here neither here either and then 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.709
 here and on foot all the tonality agreement 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.620
 of the third block if you go 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.100
 adding more of the same color same 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.920
 possibilities that it becomes worth 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.230
 let's see there we have 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.790
 just the green with a blue tone the 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.220
 first blue that we have gotten and gives us 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.430
 that tone is worth then we have the following 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.750
 blue we have gotten 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.709
 and we will take this next tone it 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.160
 for the blues they are becoming more 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.430
 dark then we have this I think it's 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.430
 the same 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.280
 exact 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.229
 we started a yellow we went to the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.789
 green of the green we wanted everything in blue 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.710
 and we want it to end in blue 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.960
 then as you see with a touch of blue 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.870
 a crystal blue two blue crystals 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.009
 you contract you have that purpose and already with 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.930
 four we get 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.169
 the end I think it's the end we're going to 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.449
 try now 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:47.420
 it's not yet the end you see what 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:51.070
 it changes slightly very little 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.070
 let's see now with this already 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.660
 If you lose already my days are the same 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:01.790
 that has almost changed you 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.840
 let's go a little bit more and we'll do the whole 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.310
 blue 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.530
 we started with a yellow and you see 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.639
 how is it softening the same thing we could 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:13.960
 do here let's take for example 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.820
 the blue red and the pink we started with a 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.210
 blue 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.260
 I'll come both red in the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.210
 school enough 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.610
 I want to lose it some more blue because 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.040
 I do not see that it's enough but I want to go 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.639
 to go one pink teach him here 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.289
 rositas 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.380
 and David will change the tones 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.270
 different that goes creating vale 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.940
 because more red because it becomes 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.680
 everything in red there are my here the 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.710
 tones as they change and I say it but 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.470
 because that also better in pink but 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.750
 also three roses we have all pink 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.280
 but I say young it's a bit shabby we're going to 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.590
 put a little purple has 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.880
 added blue and then I say I do not know 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.880
 let's put a gray 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.180
 picking up all kinds of tonalities you see 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.250
 there 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.050
 how they are changing is amazing 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.720
 number of colors that combinations 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.130
 that you can get under it 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.860
 well basically this is the way that I 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.630
 brought in the beacons is worth not only is 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.620
 a color nor are only two or three that 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.900
 you can make the ray itself have 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.490
 many different groups of colors 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.000
 you can do a lot of combinations 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.680
 different is worth and that this little mistake 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.320
 is going to be corrected in in minecraft vale 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.330
 which they are the same color but give it 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.990
 all different 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.970
 and that's it, this is all I bring you 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.250
 If you like life then nothing subscribe 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:44.919
 and it's going to serve because there are many who do not 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.659
 I wanted it and others surely yes and nothing 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.659
 guys tomorrow more and better until then
