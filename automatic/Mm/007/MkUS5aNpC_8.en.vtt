00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.980
 Simferopol 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.990
 last year for many Crimea became 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.609
 a kind of symbol of new life 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.980
 Russian Federation but how 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.660
 last year the flow of tourists to the Crimea 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.199

 You know where you come out on nature 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.430
 mountain trees are all so beautiful but everything 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.250
 littered with garbage so I advise 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.040
 get a little bit here as well 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.510

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.100

 nevertheless 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.320
 tourism, they still estimate the utilities 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.510

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.890
 special offers were developed 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.590

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.340
 and major Russian tour operators 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.700
 about nine 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.800
 Russiaâ€™s leading tour operators this year 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.200

 specialists of the relevant ministry 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.840

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.250
