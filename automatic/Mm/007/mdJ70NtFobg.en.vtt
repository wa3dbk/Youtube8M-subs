00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.320
 but all like this this is a video 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.740
 tutorial to touch the circle of two 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.670
 that's a very simple circle 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.320
 basically to touch the circle of 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:21.940
 where we are second one that is formed 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.940
 of a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.010
 that's a love of the dow then we're 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.010
 together 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.170
 and then one the least now to make a 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.690
 smaller we just do this where you go 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 to do it 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.170
 What is it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.149
 and so we form the agreed upon minor 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 so 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.230
 unless 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.270
 and then we're going to do less than 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.750
 the following way we're basically going to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.750
 these 2 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.670
 the least 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.670
 and then the seventh sun that is formed from 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:32.280
 then it 's a 26 of windsor and then of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.280
 here we go to the minor 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.660
 Y 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.370
 and then we play a lower than 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.420
 basically what we do from his sight 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.320
 the one that formed the D minor and then already 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.320
 the seventh sun 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.640
 associative that the way of a fahd king 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.260
 then we are 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.130
 we can touch them with both hands at 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.130
 same time that would be 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.070
 two 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.160
 everyone 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.420
 two 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.160
 i 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.420
 then and then we can do it 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.050
 point 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.050
 two 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.320
 3 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.780
 2. 3 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.050
 we can also touch it another way 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.050
 creates 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.730
 same 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.530
 that is all 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.150
 if not 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.150
 and then make a minor 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.870
 and then a minor re 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.650
 and then a seventh sun basically the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.790
 seventh to do is your hand 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.790
 is a sun 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.210
 we know the seventh because it's like a 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.110
 before the octave 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.890
 so 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.890
 we can see this first 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.299
 which is basically 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.379
 do not 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.370
 what are six movements 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.600
 no no no 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.620
 3 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.830
 6 then 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.190
 good the rhythm of you also for 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.190
 do something 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.669
 it's just to add a little more 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.610
 spicy at the time of practicing 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.020
 I agreed forgive the circle of one and 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.380
 basically we have also practiced 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.380
 chords 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.800
 what 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.250
 ah 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.250
 Y 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:04.090
 Y 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:06.330
 and also other things that they can do 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.330
 that 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.820
 to 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.830
 to 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.160
 i 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:32.280
 they notice that it's basically going touching 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.280
 each one of the waves 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.790
 ah 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.930
 and what we had to the next agreed 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.930
 which is the minor chord 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.360
 and we played it the D minor ' 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.010
 7a 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.940
 two 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.740
 there are so many ways in which they can 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.740
 practice it can also do 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.790
 i 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.650
 that same but faster 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.050
 to 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.050
 and it can do it upside down 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.419
 to 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.419
 and later 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:54.990
 there are different ways if only one idea 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:58.020
 or not that is the circle I hope has 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.729
 liked do not remember to keep sending me 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.729
 your comments and we 're going to the next
