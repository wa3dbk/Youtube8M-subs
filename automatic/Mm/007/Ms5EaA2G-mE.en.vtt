point to where we were last night in the
contest<00:00:24.649> I<00:00:24.919> think<00:00:25.369> we<00:00:25.489> were<00:00:25.730> getting<00:00:26.000> better

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.679 
contest I think we were getting better
and<00:00:26.329> better<00:00:26.450> with<00:00:26.599> a<00:00:26.750> running<00:00:27.680> that<00:00:27.890> offense<00:00:28.279> I

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.380 
them to hit those threes it sort of made
a<00:00:46.070> reflection<00:00:46.640> that<00:00:46.760> we<00:00:46.850> didn't<00:00:47.030> play<00:00:47.180> a<00:00:47.210> good

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
a reflection that we didn't play a good

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.750 
a reflection that we didn't play a good
game<00:00:47.450> we<00:00:48.050> played<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.290> damn<00:00:48.590> good<00:00:48.890> game<00:00:48.920> we<00:00:49.550> just

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
game we played a damn good game we just

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.670 
game we played a damn good game we just
had<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.120> many<00:00:50.270> meltdowns<00:00:50.810> and<00:00:51.020> let<00:00:51.140> them<00:00:51.320> play

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
had so many meltdowns and let them play

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.430 
had so many meltdowns and let them play
counting<00:00:52.370> about<00:00:52.520> three<00:00:52.820> that<00:00:53.630> you<00:00:54.170> know<00:00:54.290> the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
counting about three that you know the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.620 
counting about three that you know the
score<00:00:54.740> got<00:00:54.890> lopsided<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:56.090> know<00:00:56.210> we<00:00:56.450> lost

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
score got lopsided and you know we lost

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.770 
score got lopsided and you know we lost
it<00:00:56.840> at<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.079> end<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.090> if<00:00:59.090> we<00:00:59.150> clean<00:00:59.450> up<00:00:59.510> those

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
it at the end so if we clean up those

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.660 
it at the end so if we clean up those
things<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:00.290> we<00:01:00.380> hold<00:01:00.590> teams<00:01:00.920> like<00:01:01.280> we've<00:01:01.460> been

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
things and we hold teams like we've been

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.090 
things and we hold teams like we've been
holding<00:01:02.000> them<00:01:02.120> all<00:01:02.270> preseason<00:01:02.720> uh<00:01:03.009> you<00:01:04.009> know

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
holding them all preseason uh you know

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.740 
holding them all preseason uh you know
to<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.309> low<00:01:04.489> shot<00:01:04.729> percentage<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.449> make<00:01:05.720> sure

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
to a low shot percentage and make sure

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.120 
to a low shot percentage and make sure
that<00:01:06.170> they're<00:01:06.350> not<00:01:06.500> scoring<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.950> many

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
that they're not scoring that many

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.080 
that they're not scoring that many
points<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.549> then<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:07.700> get<00:01:07.850> into<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
points and then I get into the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.270 
points and then I get into the
free-throw<00:01:08.360> line<00:01:08.540> as<00:01:08.750> effectively<00:01:09.229> I<00:01:09.530> think

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
free-throw line as effectively I think

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.219 
free-throw line as effectively I think
we'll<00:01:10.430> be<00:01:10.460> fine<00:01:10.549> but<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.750> doesn't<00:01:12.049> worry

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
we'll be fine but I that doesn't worry

the open floor I mean there's a bunch of

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.990 
the open floor I mean there's a bunch of
athletes<00:03:42.990> especially<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.100> Tim<00:03:44.550> Shane

Lee Anthony I can get out and score how
do<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:47.940> either<00:03:48.090> flow<00:03:48.450> into<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.660> triangle<00:03:49.170> or

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
do you either flow into the triangle or

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.360 
do you either flow into the triangle or
how<00:03:49.380> does<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.590> work<00:03:49.740> within<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.250> overall

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
how does that work within the overall

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.550 
how does that work within the overall
offensive<00:03:50.970> game<00:03:51.270> plan<00:03:51.300> we<00:03:51.930> work<00:03:52.110> on<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.470> every

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
offensive game plan we work on it every

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.470 
offensive game plan we work on it every
single<00:03:52.860> day<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.730> course<00:03:54.000> we're<00:03:54.180> trying<00:03:54.390> to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
single day of course we're trying to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.820 
single day of course we're trying to
push<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.840> ball<00:03:54.990> we're<00:03:55.290> trying<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.560> push<00:03:55.710> it

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
push the ball we're trying to push it

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.080 
push the ball we're trying to push it
down<00:03:55.920> your<00:03:56.070> throat<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.370> score<00:03:56.610> as<00:03:56.730> fast<00:03:56.940> as

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
down your throat the score as fast as

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.760 
down your throat the score as fast as
possible<00:03:57.300> if<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:57.900> can<00:03:58.050> do<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.320> that's<00:03:58.560> what

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
possible if we can do that that's what

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.110 
possible if we can do that that's what
fish<00:03:59.040> once<00:03:59.340> that's<00:03:59.580> what<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> coaching<00:04:00.090> staff

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
fish once that's what the coaching staff

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.210 
fish once that's what the coaching staff
once<00:04:00.540> they<00:04:00.750> want<00:04:00.960> us<00:04:01.110> bringing<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:02.010> ball

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
once they want us bringing that ball

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.130 
once they want us bringing that ball
full<00:04:02.490> speed<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.450> we<00:04:03.540> don't<00:04:03.660> have<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.020> use

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
full speed and if we don't have to use

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.510 
full speed and if we don't have to use
the<00:04:04.320> triangle<00:04:04.560> then<00:04:04.890> we<00:04:04.980> don't<00:04:05.070> have<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.310> use

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
the triangle then we don't have to use

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.610 
the triangle then we don't have to use
the<00:04:05.640> triangle<00:04:05.880> but<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.930> cool<00:04:07.140> thing<00:04:07.170> about<00:04:07.380> it

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
the triangle but the cool thing about it

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.710 
the triangle but the cool thing about it
is<00:04:07.890> if<00:04:08.160> even<00:04:08.790> when<00:04:08.940> we're<00:04:09.090> pushing<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.510> in

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
is if even when we're pushing it in

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.660 
is if even when we're pushing it in
transition<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.440> need<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.680> push<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.130> in<00:04:11.310> an

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
transition we need to push it in an

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.520 
transition we need to push it in an
organized<00:04:12.120> manner<00:04:12.270> we<00:04:13.020> know<00:04:13.200> where<00:04:13.410> we're

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
organized manner we know where we're

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.900 
organized manner we know where we're
supposed<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.800> be<00:04:13.950> running<00:04:14.070> lanes<00:04:14.460> so<00:04:14.880> that

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
supposed to be running lanes so that

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.520 
supposed to be running lanes so that
just<00:04:15.330> in<00:04:15.450> case<00:04:15.660> we<00:04:15.810> have<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.990> put<00:04:16.260> on<00:04:16.380> the

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
just in case we have to put on the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.930 
just in case we have to put on the
brakes<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:16.920> we<00:04:17.010> don't<00:04:17.100> have<00:04:17.340> an<00:04:17.460> easy<00:04:17.609> bucket

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
brakes and we don't have an easy bucket

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.700 
brakes and we don't have an easy bucket
we<00:04:18.420> should<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.660> able<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.900> flow<00:04:19.140> right<00:04:19.350> into<00:04:19.380> the

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
we should be able to flow right into the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.289 
we should be able to flow right into the
triangle<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:20.280> we<00:04:20.489> definitely<00:04:20.880> have<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.150> do<00:04:21.270> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
triangle so we definitely have to do a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.640 
triangle so we definitely have to do a
better<00:04:21.359> job<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.200> think<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.470> lot<00:04:22.500> of

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
better job of that I think a lot of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.310 
better job of that I think a lot of
times<00:04:23.270> during<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.450> game<00:04:24.660> with

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
times during a game with

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.200 
times during a game with
or<00:04:25.410> going<00:04:25.830> away<00:04:25.950> it<00:04:26.160> goes<00:04:26.370> sometimes<00:04:26.790> we'll

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
or going away it goes sometimes we'll

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.760 
or going away it goes sometimes we'll
put<00:04:27.390> on<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.630> brakes<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:28.050> little<00:04:28.080> early<00:04:28.620> and

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
put on the brakes a little early and

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.370 
put on the brakes a little early and
walk<00:04:29.460> into<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.880> offense<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:31.020> know<00:04:31.140> has

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
walk into the offense and you know has

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.500 
walk into the offense and you know has
to<00:04:31.680> have<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.040> has<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.490> habit<00:04:32.700> get<00:04:33.000> stronger<00:04:33.330> I

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
to have it has the habit get stronger I

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.510 
to have it has the habit get stronger I
think<00:04:33.780> we'll<00:04:34.080> be<00:04:34.110> fine<00:04:34.230> with<00:04:34.740> pushing<00:04:35.340> the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
think we'll be fine with pushing the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.100 
think we'll be fine with pushing the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
ball down until we think we can get a

ball down until we think we can get a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
lab if we can't get it will back it out

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
and we'll be able to flow in because

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.560 
and we'll be able to flow in because
pushing<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:40.950> ball<00:04:41.100> faster<00:04:41.610> do<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:42.030> also<00:04:42.390> give

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
pushing the ball faster do it also give

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.150 
pushing the ball faster do it also give
us<00:04:42.690> more<00:04:42.870> time<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.230> that<00:04:43.260> shot<00:04:43.500> clock<00:04:43.770> that's

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
us more time on that shot clock that's
