00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.449
 so this trailer of a company ended 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.240
 of recycled materials on the road 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.130
 toluca palmillas presumably its 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.840
 driver because the heavy vehicle 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.090
 after a patrol will close the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.460
 step when trying to stop it 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 from the same people who were 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.430
 here they tell me that a patrol 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.980
 stopped and the truck was closed for 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.809
 have is a state patrol at the time 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.540
 that the patrol is closing the driver 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.489
 by not ramming it you have to tie up and 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.300
 when you brake like a truck 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.250
 articulated the truck is unbalanced 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.079
 the cargo vehicle was on the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.930
 kilometer 5 of the side lane of this 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.309
 road while his driver had 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.510
 have to be transferred to a nearby hospital 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.510
 with some hits 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.090
 according to the owner of the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.280
 company the patrol heard seconds later 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.990
 should the accident occur without them achieving 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.990
 have more characteristics of the unit 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.420
 about state police 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.490
 commented that by the brands of 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.939
 braking the vehicle was driven to 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.939
 speeding 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.360
 with footprints no accident 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.799
 has more than 30 meters of braking though 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.939
 they do not claim that the accident was caused 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.939
 for a patrol 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.399
 the owner says he was not told he was 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.149
 a patrol but from outside no no 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.740
 we are certain that it is true 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.740
 so they make the complaint and what 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.600
 leading the side lane of this 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.399
 road remained closed more than one 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.619
 hour in what firemen of toluca 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.420
 they cleaned the fuel from the pavement and 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.079
 with the help of these cranes they removed the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.079
 heavy vehicle
