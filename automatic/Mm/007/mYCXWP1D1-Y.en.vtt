00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
absolutely the beginning the season when

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.080 
absolutely the beginning the season when
I<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.159> Seattle<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.549> weren't<00:01:41.759> doing<00:01:41.850> so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I was in Seattle we weren't doing so

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
I was in Seattle we weren't doing so
well<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> lot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> pressure<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
well so there was a lot of pressure and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.429 
well so there was a lot of pressure and
we<00:01:44.850> were<00:01:44.939> able<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> turn<00:01:45.780> things<00:01:45.869> around<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
we were able to turn things around and I

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.810 
we were able to turn things around and I
think<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.799> exactly<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.369> Houston<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
think that's exactly what Houston is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.410 
think that's exactly what Houston is
doing<00:01:48.000> right<00:01:48.119> now

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
doing right now

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.770 
doing right now
it's<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.649> very<00:01:49.950> tight<00:01:50.189> race<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.299> East<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it's a very tight race in the East I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.179 
it's a very tight race in the East I
know<00:01:51.899> there's<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> point<00:01:52.979> or<00:01:53.159> two

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
know there's like a point or two

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.850 
know there's like a point or two
difference<00:01:53.790> between<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.299> seventh<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
difference between like seventh and the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.950 
difference between like seventh and the
fifth<00:01:56.040> place<00:01:56.250> spots<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.790> these<00:01:57.509> games<00:01:57.780> are

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
fifth place spots so these games are

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660 
fifth place spots so these games are
vital<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.920> crucial<00:01:59.100> stretch<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
vital it's a crucial stretch in the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
vital it's a crucial stretch in the
season<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.090> three<00:02:01.020> games<00:02:01.229> against<00:02:01.530> Chivas

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
a way and you can tell in training he

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.390 
a way and you can tell in training he

brings that out of his players he
demands<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.750> passion<00:03:17.989> from<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.860> first

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
demands that that passion from the first

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.070 
demands that that passion from the first
minute<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.519> practice<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.209> until<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.930> last

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
minute of practice and until the last

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.110 
minute of practice and until the last
minute<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.769> guess<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.610> sort<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:22.970> style

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120
