00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.020 

hi<00:00:08.810> Scott<00:00:09.470> the<00:00:09.650> winemaking<00:00:09.980> by<00:00:10.340> mom<00:00:10.880> I'm

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
hi Scott the winemaking by mom I'm

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.879 
hi Scott the winemaking by mom I'm
making<00:00:11.300> calm<00:00:11.690> here<00:00:11.990> with<00:00:12.139> actually<00:00:12.590> knotted

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
making calm here with actually knotted

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.770 
making calm here with actually knotted
well<00:00:13.160> I<00:00:13.190> guess<00:00:13.460> it's<00:00:13.639> kind<00:00:13.790> of<00:00:13.820> a<00:00:13.910> tip<00:00:14.150> but<00:00:14.630> it's

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
well I guess it's kind of a tip but it's

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.299 
well I guess it's kind of a tip but it's
also<00:00:14.930> me<00:00:15.290> asking<00:00:15.650> you<00:00:15.740> your<00:00:15.860> opinion<00:00:15.920> on

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
also me asking you your opinion on

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.029 
also me asking you your opinion on
something<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.300> my<00:00:17.870> question<00:00:18.260> is<00:00:18.380> what<00:00:18.800> kind<00:00:18.980> of

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
something so my question is what kind of

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.500 
something so my question is what kind of
yeast<00:00:19.250> you<00:00:19.430> typically<00:00:19.760> use<00:00:19.850> when<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:20.330> make

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
yeast you typically use when you make

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.660 
yeast you typically use when you make
your<00:00:20.690> wine<00:00:20.840> usually<00:00:21.440> it's<00:00:21.740> going<00:00:21.800> to<00:00:21.950> be<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.280> dry

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
your wine usually it's going to be a dry

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.759 
your wine usually it's going to be a dry
yeast<00:00:23.019> because<00:00:24.019> that's<00:00:24.260> usually<00:00:24.500> what's

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
yeast because that's usually what's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.460 
yeast because that's usually what's
included<00:00:25.010> in<00:00:25.369> winemaking<00:00:26.000> kits<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.109> I'm<00:00:27.289> sure

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
included in winemaking kits and I'm sure

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.200 
included in winemaking kits and I'm sure
when<00:00:27.859> you<00:00:27.949> go<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.250> winemaking<00:00:28.609> store<00:00:28.970> it's

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
when you go to the winemaking store it's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.820 
when you go to the winemaking store it's
what<00:00:29.359> you're<00:00:29.480> going<00:00:29.599> to<00:00:29.660> grab<00:00:29.869> when<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:30.199> go<00:00:30.380> if

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
what you're going to grab when you go if

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.830 
what you're going to grab when you go if
you're<00:00:30.980> making<00:00:31.130> wine<00:00:31.429> from<00:00:31.699> grapes<00:00:31.759> or<00:00:32.630> from

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
you're making wine from grapes or from

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.810 
you're making wine from grapes or from
fruit<00:00:33.110> well<00:00:33.740> have<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:34.490> ever<00:00:34.610> considered

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
fruit well have you ever considered

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.050 
fruit well have you ever considered
using<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.570> liquid<00:00:36.110> yeast<00:00:36.470> like<00:00:37.040> this<00:00:37.280> one<00:00:37.550> from

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
using a liquid yeast like this one from

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.380 
using a liquid yeast like this one from
wu's<00:00:38.840> technologies<00:00:39.760> really<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.879> question<00:00:41.239> is

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
wu's technologies really the question is

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.380 
wu's technologies really the question is
does<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:41.719> make<00:00:41.899> difference<00:00:42.730> does<00:00:43.730> it<00:00:43.910> mean

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
does it make difference does it mean

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.029 
does it make difference does it mean
that<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:45.200> should<00:00:45.379> pay<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.710> extra<00:00:45.920> money

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
that you should pay the extra money

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.240 
that you should pay the extra money
because<00:00:46.550> after<00:00:46.879> all<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.360> is<00:00:47.570> a<00:00:47.600> $2.00<00:00:48.379> yeast

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
because after all this is a $2.00 yeast

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.599 
because after all this is a $2.00 yeast
packet<00:00:49.699> and<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.270> is<00:00:50.449> a<00:00:50.719> $10<00:00:51.620> packet<00:00:52.190> well

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
packet and this is a $10 packet well

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.580 
packet and this is a $10 packet well
cost<00:00:52.940> may<00:00:53.149> vary<00:00:53.359> depending<00:00:53.539> on<00:00:53.870> what<00:00:54.410> the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
cost may vary depending on what the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.709 
cost may vary depending on what the
costs<00:00:54.859> are<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.039> trip<00:00:55.309> line<00:00:55.640> store<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.539> let's

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
costs are a trip line store so let's

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.020 
costs are a trip line store so let's
explore<00:00:57.170> some<00:00:57.379> of<00:00:57.500> these<00:00:57.559> differences<00:00:58.039> one<00:00:58.730> is

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
explore some of these differences one is

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.470 
explore some of these differences one is
how<00:00:59.269> you<00:00:59.329> rehydrate<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.289> yeast<00:01:00.530> usually<00:01:01.280> with

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
how you rehydrate the yeast usually with

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.910 
how you rehydrate the yeast usually with
this<00:01:02.480> dried<00:01:02.899> packet<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.440> yeast<00:01:03.469> you're<00:01:03.769> going

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
this dried packet of yeast you're going

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.890 
this dried packet of yeast you're going
to<00:01:04.040> gather<00:01:04.129> sprinkle<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.790> over<00:01:04.970> your<00:01:05.510> why<00:01:05.630> must

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
to gather sprinkle it over your why must

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.630 
to gather sprinkle it over your why must
depending<00:01:06.320> on<00:01:06.410> your<00:01:06.590> instructions<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:07.520> your

depending on your instructions in your
kit<00:01:07.850> or<00:01:08.360> you're<00:01:08.540> going<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.050> put<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:09.290> into<00:01:09.410> a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
kit or you're going to put it into a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.760 
kit or you're going to put it into a
warm<00:01:10.640> cup<00:01:11.210> of<00:01:11.360> water<00:01:11.690> let<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:11.990> sit<00:01:12.080> for<00:01:12.320> 15

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.550 
from what people tell me you're going to
get<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> lot<00:01:55.409> more<00:01:56.479> fermentation<00:01:57.479> action<00:01:57.840> from

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
get a lot more fermentation action from

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.249 
get a lot more fermentation action from
the<00:01:59.130> liquid<00:02:00.119> yeast<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.509> your<00:02:00.539> from<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:01.020> dry

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the liquid yeast in your from the dry

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.529 
the liquid yeast in your from the dry
yeast<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:03.049> really<00:02:04.369> is<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.549> worth<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> cost

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
yeast so really is this worth the cost

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.719 
yeast so really is this worth the cost
is<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.960> worth<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.319> expense<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.890> guess<00:02:08.519> if

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
is this worth the expense I guess if

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.270 
is this worth the expense I guess if
you're<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.149> those<00:02:09.209> people<00:02:09.599> who<00:02:10.280> are

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
you're one of those people who are

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.300 
you're one of those people who are
making<00:02:11.489> wine<00:02:11.819> because<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:12.840> how<00:02:13.470> cheap

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
making wine because you like how cheap

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.640 
making wine because you like how cheap
it<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.299> you're<00:02:15.840> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.019> go<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
it is to do it you're going to go with a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.710 
it is to do it you're going to go with a
dry<00:02:17.010> yeast<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:17.610> you're<00:02:17.790> somebody<00:02:17.970> who's<00:02:18.269> maybe

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
dry yeast if you're somebody who's maybe

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.920 
dry yeast if you're somebody who's maybe
spent<00:02:19.290> more<00:02:19.530> money<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.549> premium<00:02:21.420> wine<00:02:21.660> kit

before then I highly recommend that you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
before then I highly recommend that you
try<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.489> those<00:02:32.489> who<00:02:32.900> think<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:33.989> it's<00:02:34.290> really

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
try it those who think that it's really

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.680 
try it those who think that it's really
a<00:02:34.709> much<00:02:35.340> ado<00:02:35.579> about<00:02:35.610> nothing<00:02:35.819> otherwise

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690

a much ado about nothing otherwise
you're<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.110> tip<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.410> queue<00:02:37.590> typically

you're going to tip the queue typically
going<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.489> argue<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:39.290> example<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.709> it's

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
going to argue for example that it's

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.770 
going to argue for example that it's
more<00:02:41.220> important<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.819> kind<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.209> yeast<00:02:42.510> that

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
more important the kind of yeast that

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.130 
more important the kind of yeast that
you<00:02:43.530> make<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.610> matches<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.780> type<00:02:45.959> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
you make that matches up to the type of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.259 
you make that matches up to the type of
sugar<00:02:46.349> that's<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.130> your<00:02:47.280> why<00:02:47.400> must<00:02:47.700> versus

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
sugar that's in your why must versus
