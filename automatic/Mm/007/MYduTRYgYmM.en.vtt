00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:29.570
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.540
When I opened my eyes, everything around me was ancient

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.830
The only thing standing was this relic of a temple

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:51.070
I wonder if I made a wish here, would it be granted?

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.330
For this longing, for these unheard feelings to be…

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.250
Only in the morning upside

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.080
Without saying a word

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.910
Only in the morning upside

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.770
Time kept passing me by

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.620
Only in the morning upside

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.540
Inside my sunken heart

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.280
Only in the morning upside

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.020
Time will not move

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020
Only in the morning upside

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.740
Night will not dawn

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.570
Only in the morning upside

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.210
Even now nothing has changed

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.720
I’m sure you didn’t notice, but I cried again today

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.330
Even though I could never hope for my wish to be heard

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:38.450
Never Fulfilled, Never Heard

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.750
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.240
Even if it’s only a little bit, time never stops turning
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.680
Even if it seems like nothing has changed
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.330
Everything around us moves on and
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.930
My heart keeps a beat
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.700
Even if I could never grasp even a fragment of a dream
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.200
I keep searching for the morning, and will forever
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.050
So again I’ve cut into my own heart
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.140
Even though I’m sure there’s nothing I can do
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:25.700
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.970
And this ancient temple asks me

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.260
“Do those who cling to others really have emotions or feelings of their own?”

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.530
You’re saying that because my only wish is for these feelings…You’re saying that this just means I’m still clinging to others…?
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.690
“All I see here is a shell where a person might have been.”
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.790
“All I see here is a shell where a person might have been.”

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.630
Only in the morning upside

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.630
I don’t understand what you’re saying

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.240
Only in the morning upside

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.240
Even inside these sunken emotions

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.880
Only in the morning upside

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.880
My feelings have not changed

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.480
Only in the morning upside

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.400
Time will not turn

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400
Only in the morning upside

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.050
Night will not dawn

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.050
Only in the morning upside

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.650
Even now nothing has changed

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.050
Even though I knew this, I couldn’t say anything back
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.790
I just stood there, unable to do anything
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:35.010
What really are these feelings of mine?
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.820
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.450
Even if it’s only a little, everyone should dream
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.630
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.000
But I still couldn’t understand
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.770
And so everything around me would not change
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.930
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.310
Only time would slowly advance
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.060
I told myself that my feelings, my emotions were strong
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.160
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.590
And that was enough, but I was only running away
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.310
Even though I really knew what I was doing, I could not move
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.020
And so still in the darkness the cherry trees would not blossom
only in the morning upside down after moonlight

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:36.580
only in the morning upside down after moonlight
