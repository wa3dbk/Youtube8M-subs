going<00:00:05.450> to<00:00:05.509> show<00:00:05.660> you<00:00:05.720> how<00:00:05.900> I<00:00:05.930> make<00:00:06.350> a<00:00:06.560> speaker

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
going to show you how I make a speaker

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.140 
going to show you how I make a speaker
box<00:00:07.759> or<00:00:08.089> a<00:00:08.120> speaker<00:00:08.480> enclosure<00:00:09.110> if<00:00:09.469> necessary

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150

box or a speaker enclosure if necessary
you'll<00:00:11.150> see<00:00:11.389> that<00:00:11.570> this<00:00:11.719> is<00:00:11.780> fairly

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
you'll see that this is fairly

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.909 
you'll see that this is fairly
time-consuming<00:00:13.099> and<00:00:14.619> doesn't<00:00:15.619> come<00:00:15.769> up<00:00:15.889> with

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:15.919 
time-consuming and doesn't come up with

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.090 
time-consuming and doesn't come up with
the<00:00:16.070> best<00:00:16.340> possible<00:00:17.080> results<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:18.440> if<00:00:18.710> I<00:00:18.860> can

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
the best possible results so if I can

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.370 
the best possible results so if I can
get<00:00:19.370> a<00:00:19.430> pre-made<00:00:19.880> enclosure<00:00:20.330> for<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:20.990> speaker

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
get a pre-made enclosure for the speaker

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.770

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
is on top you see there's some places

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.100 
is on top you see there's some places
that<00:02:14.560> aren't<00:02:15.090> fully<00:02:16.090> formed<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:16.720> I'm<00:02:16.930> going<00:02:17.050> to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
that aren't fully formed so I'm going to

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.920 
that aren't fully formed so I'm going to
put<00:02:17.230> some<00:02:17.350> Fowler<00:02:17.530> expert<00:02:18.070> down<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.510> corners

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
put some Fowler expert down the corners

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.100 
put some Fowler expert down the corners
to<00:02:20.050> create<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.380> fill<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:21.010> glue<00:02:21.840> between<00:02:22.840> the

sides and each other and the speaker
being<00:02:27.580> very<00:02:27.880> careful<00:02:28.090> not<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.450> get<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.780> on<00:02:28.930> the

speaker cone by the way just a tip on
the<00:02:33.760> Fowler<00:02:33.970> expert<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:35.380> will<00:02:35.680> dry<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.340> that

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the Fowler expert it will dry in that

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.350 
the Fowler expert it will dry in that
probe<00:02:38.230> unless<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.860> keep<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.280> closed<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.180> keep

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
probe unless I keep it closed and I keep

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.699 
probe unless I keep it closed and I keep
it<00:02:40.480> closed<00:02:40.690> with<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.930> piece<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.140> brilliant

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
it closed with a piece of brilliant

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.650 
it closed with a piece of brilliant
copper<00:02:42.070> wire<00:02:42.280> now<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.270> we're<00:02:43.360> done<00:02:43.480> with

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
copper wire now that we're done with

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.810 
copper wire now that we're done with
this<00:02:43.810> put<00:02:44.560> some<00:02:44.739> clamps<00:02:45.040> on<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.280> speaker<00:02:45.670> to

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
this put some clamps on the speaker to

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.810 
this put some clamps on the speaker to
hold<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.150> in<00:02:46.420> position<00:02:47.040> while<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.580> Fowler

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
hold it in position while it the Fowler

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.670 
hold it in position while it the Fowler
sets<00:02:49.150> up<00:02:49.330> because<00:02:49.510> it'll<00:02:49.630> take<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:50.110> minute<00:02:50.590> or

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
sets up because it'll take a minute or

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.180 
sets up because it'll take a minute or
so<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.220> really<00:02:51.519> get<00:02:52.269> strong<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.720> firm<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:53.980> I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
so to really get strong and firm so I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.620 
so to really get strong and firm so I
got<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.610> fair<00:02:54.820> amount<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.060> time<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.390> get<00:02:55.480> these

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
got a fair amount of time to get these

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.259 
got a fair amount of time to get these
clamps<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.140> place<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.620> hold<00:02:56.769> it<00:02:56.890> all<00:02:57.010> together

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
clamps in place and hold it all together

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.820 
clamps in place and hold it all together
then<00:02:58.269> we're<00:02:58.390> done<00:02:58.570> with<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.200> time<00:02:59.530> to

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
then we're done with that it's time to

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.670 
then we're done with that it's time to
put<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.670> top<00:03:00.880> on<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.420> simply<00:03:02.019> a<00:03:02.200> little

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
put the top on it and simply a little

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.350 
put the top on it and simply a little
bit<00:03:02.860> of<00:03:03.120> em<00:03:04.120> ek<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:05.320> hold<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.980> together<00:03:06.330> put<00:03:07.330> it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
bit of em ek to hold it together put it

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.040 
bit of em ek to hold it together put it
in<00:03:07.510> place

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
in place

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.330 
in place
and<00:03:09.870> there<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:11.050> go<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.260> little<00:03:11.350> Emma<00:03:11.739> Kate<00:03:12.070> to

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
and there you go a little Emma Kate to

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.009 
and there you go a little Emma Kate to
tack<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.760> down<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.239> then<00:03:13.330> I'll<00:03:13.450> seal<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.780> off

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
tack it down and then I'll seal it off

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.800 
tack it down and then I'll seal it off
with<00:03:14.560> some<00:03:14.769> Fowler<00:03:14.980> expert

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
with some Fowler expert

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.290 
with some Fowler expert
I<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.690> Fowler<00:03:19.870> expert<00:03:20.380> because<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.920> has

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
I like the Fowler expert because it has

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.300 
I like the Fowler expert because it has
styrene<00:03:22.300> in<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:23.260> performs<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.980> little

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
styrene in it and it performs a little

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.160 
styrene in it and it performs a little
filling<00:03:24.760> action<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:25.840> sort<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.050> like

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
filling action it's sort of like

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.620 
filling action it's sort of like
gap-filling<00:03:26.849> CA<00:03:27.849> or<00:03:28.180> something<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:28.569> that

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
gap-filling CA or something like that

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.199 
gap-filling CA or something like that
it'll<00:03:29.440> actually<00:03:29.650> make<00:03:29.830> a<00:03:29.980> fill<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.459> or<00:03:31.150> a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
it'll actually make a fill it or a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.600 
it'll actually make a fill it or a
rounding<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.050> corner<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:33.160> will<00:03:33.310> fill

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
rounding of the corner and it will fill

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.270 
rounding of the corner and it will fill
in<00:03:33.790> any<00:03:34.000> gaps<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:34.930> seal<00:03:35.590> off<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.950> enclosure

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
in any gaps and seal off the enclosure

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280 
in any gaps and seal off the enclosure
very<00:03:36.640> well

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
very well

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.479 
very well
after<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.319> take<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.709> out<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.069> clamps<00:03:39.400> I

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
after I take it out of the clamps I

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.790 
after I take it out of the clamps I
might<00:03:39.640> even<00:03:39.760> put<00:03:39.880> some<00:03:40.209> more<00:03:40.390> fowler<00:03:41.349> expert

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
might even put some more fowler expert

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.489 
might even put some more fowler expert
on<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.010> just<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.280> make<00:03:42.340> sure
