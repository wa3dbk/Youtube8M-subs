00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello friends welcome to a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.139
 training 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.090
 I will be 0 and this has been a video that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.769
 they have asked for it enough in the world 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.870
 videos had scored goals from the start and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 so they see me shock like the chair and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.439
 then this video is for everyone 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.869
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.760
 this is like scoring goal from the serve 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.500
 start and if they know how to occupy to be able 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.970
 score a goal since the start 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 match or when they make a goal for 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.230
 can tie or is a super tool 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.850
 useful, the only thing they have to do is 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.880
 go deep and this is going to do 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.100
 that the button elevates more and the l one more 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.930
 triangle is a pass that we occupy in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.320
 all our parties now we are going to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.360
 start 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.739
 check this in our kick-off what 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.480
 first they have to see is who is 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.070
 forward in this case benzema and di maria 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.410
 that we front and those who are 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.629
 behind them in this case to my right 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.520
 Xabi Alonso is already not even 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.940
 luca models what we're going to do is give 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 One pass and the other run to space 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.449
 we are going to place our player that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.090
 profile with a race almost diagonally 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.769
 and let him touch his right leg in this 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.970
 case a veloso is not left-handed we are going to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.980
 observe the mobile 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.330
 of our forward and we just have to 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.520
 predict the time you are going to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.290
 cross the line of defenses and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
 let's put our pass to depth 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.790
 we calculate it between two bars and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.530
 two and a half bars and the pass what 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.240
 we direct lightly you're 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.100
 running to our player is going to fall 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.050
 the perfect ball and will be able to put a 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.900
 great goal and will fall to a very position 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.670
 good here we will observe in a 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.960
 position a little in slow motion 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.060
 observe how our choir is being 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.470
 moving and just at the moment that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 is almost crossing the defensive line 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.150
 there we send the pass so that it arrives 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.479
 perfect and just before the outside of 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.490
 place 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.430
 see how it goes very well dinar and there 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.290
 can put here a great goal this step 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.990
 can apply in many cases here 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.660
 what is shaping its right foot that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.190
 is the right gives the pass to di maria and 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.930
 we have a great goal 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.360
 can be applied in many ways 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.310
 for example to pass here xavi to 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.680
 modern we look forward to the same time 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.490
 Outlines your correct leg sends passes 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.130
 high 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.510
 we have other balls or here head and if 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.880
 for example the play was seen what 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.100
 can do is use their bands to send 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.080
 a pass to the one on the end either 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.080
 the right or left side and give the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.000
 Pass applies in all these cases 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.590
 here we are raised a real match and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.230
 see how well the firm passage comes out and 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.760
 la pasa van persie touches it and pum equal 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.120
 as we did in our 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.120
 training 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.530

 tell me how this movement is done that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.209
 the last time he had a lot of confusion 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.420
 because it is not as dominate the ball but 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.760
 is how he is dominating the ball and 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.939
 while you are dominating them, make a 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.129
 rainbow about you that's the movement and 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.019
