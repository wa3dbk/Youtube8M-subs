place<00:02:19.079> so<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:20.099> can<00:02:20.250> do<00:02:20.340> exactly<00:02:20.459> what<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.030> want

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
place so it can do exactly what I want

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.539 
place so it can do exactly what I want
to<00:02:21.360> do<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.989> legs<00:02:22.170> go<00:02:22.500> anywhere<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.010> want<00:02:23.129> and

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
to do the legs go anywhere I want and

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.360 
to do the legs go anywhere I want and
it's<00:02:23.909> still<00:02:24.150> very<00:02:24.510> very<00:02:24.750> stable<00:02:25.079> now<00:02:25.799> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
it's still very very stable now the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.690 
it's still very very stable now the
tension<00:02:27.209> up<00:02:27.739> this<00:02:28.739> really<00:02:29.189> appeals<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.549> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
tension up this really appeals to the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.410 
tension up this really appeals to the
geek<00:02:29.849> in<00:02:30.030> me<00:02:30.060> because<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:32.129> looks<00:02:33.120> really

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
geek in me because it's a looks really

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.240 
geek in me because it's a looks really
nice<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.599> me<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.170> works<00:02:34.409> in<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.680> really<00:02:35.040> really

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
nice but me it works in a really really

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.699 
nice but me it works in a really really
cool<00:02:35.400> way<00:02:35.579> to<00:02:35.970> increase<00:02:36.930> attention<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.680> just

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
cool way to increase attention you just

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.099 
cool way to increase attention you just
push<00:02:38.069> this<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.420> if<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.480> want<00:02:39.689> to<00:02:39.720> lower<00:02:39.930> the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
push this up if you want to lower the

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.099 
push this up if you want to lower the
tension<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.829> just<00:02:41.040> do<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.700> around<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.989> it

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
tension you just do this around and it

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.750 
tension you just do this around and it
clicks<00:02:43.379> down<00:02:43.590> one<00:02:44.069> click<00:02:44.280> at<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> time<00:02:44.640> so

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
clicks down one click at a time so

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.490 
clicks down one click at a time so
you've<00:02:44.849> got<00:02:44.939> eight<00:02:45.180> different<00:02:45.810> tensions<00:02:46.290> on

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
you've got eight different tensions on

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.300 
you've got eight different tensions on
the<00:02:46.560> higher<00:02:48.319> very<00:02:49.319> very<00:02:49.709> good<00:02:51.440> now<00:02:52.440> we<00:02:52.500> go<00:02:53.280> on

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
the higher very very good now we go on

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.330 
the higher very very good now we go on
to<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.670> snare<00:02:54.239> drum<00:02:54.480> stem<00:02:54.980> which<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.010> just

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
to the snare drum stem which is just

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.009 
to the snare drum stem which is just
here<00:02:56.659> it's<00:02:57.659> a<00:02:57.870> central<00:02:59.239> central<00:03:00.239> snare<00:03:00.540> basket

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
here it's a central central snare basket

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.119 
here it's a central central snare basket
and<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.889> one<00:03:02.689> bolt<00:03:03.689> release<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.889> turn

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
and just one bolt release it I can turn

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.089 
and just one bolt release it I can turn
the<00:03:05.310> drum<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.180> also<00:03:06.389> tilt<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.590> it's

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
the drum and I can also tilt it so it's

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:17.240 
the drum and I can also tilt it so it's
a<00:03:08.340> very<00:03:08.609> very<00:03:09.269> functional<00:03:09.480> very<00:03:10.400> racer<00:03:16.250> so

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
a very very functional very racer so

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.039 
a very very functional very racer so
this<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.670> other<00:03:17.909> new<00:03:18.299> hardware<00:03:18.720> line<00:03:18.870> from

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
this is the other new hardware line from

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.400 
this is the other new hardware line from
sake<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:19.829> is<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> other<00:03:20.430> flats

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
sake this is the other flats

the flat base stands very light very

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.080 
the flat base stands very light very
strong<00:03:25.100> now<00:03:25.720> we've<00:03:26.720> seen<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.670> flush<00:03:28.670> may<00:03:28.820> stands

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090

strong now we've seen a flush may stands
flat<00:03:29.360> base<00:03:29.510> stands<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:29.930> before<00:03:30.200> but

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
flat base stands like this before but

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.490 
flat base stands like this before but
for<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.960> very<00:03:33.620> very<00:03:34.330> common<00:03:35.330> mounting<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.290> Tom

so sucky are going to start doing some
metal<00:04:21.290> stairs<00:04:21.560> very<00:04:21.709> soon<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:23.300> this<00:04:24.130> look

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
metal stairs very soon and the this look

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.010 
metal stairs very soon and the this look
I<00:04:25.370> let<00:04:25.730> medium<00:04:25.940> like<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.330> can<00:04:26.450> go<00:04:26.540> over<00:04:26.810> the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
I let medium like you can go over the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.200 
I let medium like you can go over the
bead<00:04:27.170> in<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.410> shell<00:04:27.620> without<00:04:28.220> any<00:04:28.730> problems

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
bead in the shell without any problems

bead in the shell without any problems
so<00:04:29.450> we're<00:04:30.200> gonna<00:04:30.290> see<00:04:30.500> this<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.710> lot<00:04:30.980> of<00:04:31.250> psychos

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
so we're gonna see this a lot of psychos
