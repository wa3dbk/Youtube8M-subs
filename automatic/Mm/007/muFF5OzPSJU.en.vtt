 of the mobile cache and install 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.359

 third of the menu and we give it here then 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:36.079

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.670
 how everything is formatted as it goes 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.220
 forming dices 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.330
 formatting a complete format like 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.009
 this option that we are worth but if 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.500
 we want to eliminate the processes that 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.250
 stored in the mobile cache we had 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.620
 again and he just formates is worth this 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.120
 it is already on the one hand to achieve the initiates 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.630
 I want to say that once this is done 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:13.090
 all all all will be deleted but 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.170
 all user data 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 We're seeing 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:25.489
 can imation let them james wood this 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.680
 version is 10.1 of cyanogenmod based 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.849
 in 34 points 2.2 with the four 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.019
 procedures we have to go back to 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.359
 configure the mail and password of the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.950
 wifi to configure everything and can do 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.950
 backup of that email 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.209
 good will seem a little more time 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.610
 to wait for them to charge to speak a 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.910
 little about this terminal ending in 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.700

 ram memory of 512 8 gb of memory 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:06.319
