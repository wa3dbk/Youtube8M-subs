00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.880
 whatsapp everyone shouts his joy 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.080
 comes mostly for the woods that news to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.580
 about a video anyway 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.040
 particular since it is a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.570
 video are so on the iphone 6 attention 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 about speculation so these are 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.300
 things still not really official 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.980
 by down by apple so rumors that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.150
 are turning really so for you 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.590
 to share a little bit to see a little bit 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.810
 that you think so 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.660
 apparently he kind of sketches that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.349
 we will say leak and one of the device 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 giving us some information 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.090
 such as its measurement ie 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.920
 at its height its width 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.809
 so just before so these are two in 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.940
 a few companies from elsewhere 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.969
 apparently who are in the process of 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.530
 produce the iphone 6 after that to see if 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.610
 it's fake or not but it's true that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.610
 it's quite strange because on 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.199
 several sites at different times on 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.850
 gets to find pretty much the same 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.059
 things said as well as with this famous 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.760
 sketch which appears so a kind 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 image I will show you on sure and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.940
 of course the screen to which ben can 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.019
 find a few things 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.210
 because for now all we know 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.490
 is that apparently the iphone 6 so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 will have a bigger screen ie 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.590
 that apple puts that in a bigger 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.450
 screen that is a 4 1 4 points 7 inches 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.070
 excuse me so what is that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.540
 means, of course, that an asset that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.610
 are going to ask this question there basically 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.080
 it simply means that he 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.470
 will make 64 1 mm in width and 138 mm in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.320
 length is basically so it's going to be 6 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.329
 cm I say no nonsense of width 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.890
 so with so 138 13 cm in length 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.880
 So, if I got a little lost 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.009
 in the words we are simply 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.030
 a small conversion that can do 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.930
 for now it's all 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.119
 information we have 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.500
 I wanted to tell you about it already 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.610
 I was about at the level of 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.040
 top features about is at 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 level of the iphone 5 pieces to see this 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.460
 that finally there is a great 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.799
 screen size evolution is what 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.899
 the size of the screen between the iphone 5 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.369
 pieces to the iphone 6 is actually 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.619
 important is what ultimately 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.060
 a person with iphone 5 aces will say - 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.369
 I bought the iphone 6 is what there is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.990
 a reason to buy it to have a 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.330
 larger screen size and well 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.780
 listen if we make simple the size of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.819
 the screen of the iphone 5 is 123 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.410
 mm of course so tall so basically two 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:21.200
 lengths and 58 6 mm in width actually 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.330
 width does not matter it will be a little 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.480
 wider at the level of the iphone 6 6 and 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.270
 the big who says true but it's true that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.640
 relatively we are still 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.650
 with a Thai really higher it is 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.180
 to say well we end up sailing 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.260
 with a salary size of about 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.050
 2.1 cm the size of the screen on 1 cm 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.670
 bigger on the iphone 6 than on 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.519
 the iphone 5 to sion makes have a small 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.580
 comparison with basle to version by 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.100
 apple's smartphone that 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.840
 by the way is the latest version of 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.750
 nowadays but who will be the penultimate 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.950
 version is fine when the iphone 6 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.580
 so basically will blow up that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.760
 will make April 12 13 cm with the iphone 5 is 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.040
 so 12.8 recent 12 to 23 cm 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.410
 excuse me two lengths while 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.410
 the iphone 6 apparently would do 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.880
 so that 13.8 cm even besides a little 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.220
 more than 1 cm it is exactly 1 5 cm 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.870
 more at the level of the length so that 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.160
 frankly that to see but hey it's 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.910
 why all the info that has been 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.920
 given in passing 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.829
 the iphone 5 aces therefore works with a 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.970
 7 64 bit processor which is not 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.350
 nothing and it's true that when we can get 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.670
 ask the question with the iphone 6 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.720
 well listen I do not know at all 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.530
 what are they going to be able to put 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.900
 is it going to be a new one 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.670
 processor is what I do not know 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.150
 frankly even at the level of beats 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.130
 all that 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.170
 well frankly if it's really that 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.730
 the size of the screen that does not change that 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.680
 would really be a shame my 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.299
 notice knowing apple they will add 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.799
 a few extra things 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.390
 and then after that remains to be seen but 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.280
 honestly this idea of ​​building a 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.019
 bigger screen and well it looks 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.850
 to be rather very feasible 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.910
 because we are going to say that they have released 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.380
 still a lot of iphone in between 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.420
 of the iphone so we will say 3g up 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.670
 the iphone 5 aces to which we have not 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.660
 had really big then there not 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.000
 as we have 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.610
 the screen really higher ie 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.950
 that the next shutter is 1.5 cm 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.750
 more but it's true that previously 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.100
 did not actually have level evolution 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.930
 of the screen size what has been 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.100
 asked where here by by the buyers 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.989
 but at the time we really asked 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.180
 people also like to have the same 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.400
 size of the iphone after that that's it 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.810
 can be your own opinion - support 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.940
 personally it can be a good 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.160
 idea if he does a kind of plus size 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.330
 or to a larger screen size but 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.670
 as wrong as the features 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.290
 aisle must that it slams 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.980
 what compared to iphone 5 is it would 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.320
 Too bad 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.720
 well if necessarily apple they just come out 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.880
 an iphone for the screen size if 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.470
 people judge a smartphone f1 just 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.360
 for the screen size so end at 25 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.040
 centimes to head here are two more than 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.090
 the other it would be a pity here thank you to 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.500
 you every day thank you for being a 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.860
 little young at the video it's great 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.150
 pleasure 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.530
 sutout of sir will be patched from 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.670
 staff and then I tell you the 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.670
 next every day pilot
