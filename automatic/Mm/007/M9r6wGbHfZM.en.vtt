00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
that I do it you'll start to hear echo

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.740 
that I do it you'll start to hear echo
in<00:00:09.510> my<00:00:09.650> voice<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.070> that's<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.269> control

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
in my voice and that's how we control

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.049 
in my voice and that's how we control
our<00:00:12.990> effects<00:00:13.440> there<00:00:13.950> are<00:00:14.070> many<00:00:14.280> settings<00:00:14.849> that

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
our effects there are many settings that

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.430 
our effects there are many settings that
we<00:00:15.210> can<00:00:15.360> do<00:00:15.509> right<00:00:15.660> here<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:15.990> already<00:00:16.170> have

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
we can do right here we already have

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.200 
we can do right here we already have
them<00:00:16.770> set<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> way<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.640> would<00:00:17.850> like<00:00:17.880> them

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
them set the way that we would like them

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.170 
them set the way that we would like them
to<00:00:18.270> sound<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.230> if<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.529> were<00:00:19.680> singing<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.279> so

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
to sound as if we were singing and so

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.210 
to sound as if we were singing and so
this<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.810> amount<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.470> effects<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.070> would

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
this is the amount of effects you would

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.480 
this is the amount of effects you would
hear<00:00:23.600> if<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.869> put<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> up<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.680> far<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
hear if you put it up this far and the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.250 
hear if you put it up this far and the
less<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.539> less<00:00:27.689> effects<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.230> have

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
less you have the less effects you have

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.730 
less you have the less effects you have
the<00:00:28.590> echo<00:00:28.980> goes<00:00:29.220> away<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.820> go<00:00:30.000> down<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
the echo goes away as you go down and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.080 
the echo goes away as you go down and
there<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:31.859> other<00:00:32.070> settings<00:00:32.369> besides<00:00:32.850> echo

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
there are other settings besides echo

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.549 
there are other settings besides echo
but<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.540> pretty<00:00:33.780> much<00:00:34.020> what<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.530> have

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
but it's pretty much what we have

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.790 
but it's pretty much what we have
there's<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.950> whole<00:00:35.160> chart<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.300> different<00:00:36.809> ways

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
there's a whole chart of different ways

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.400 
there's a whole chart of different ways
you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.190> set<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:39.989> over<00:00:40.260> here

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
you can set this that's right over here

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.310 
you can set this that's right over here
on<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.710> side<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.129> board<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.930> that'll

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
on this side of the board and that'll

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.840 
on this side of the board and that'll
that'll<00:00:43.559> take<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> effects<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> part

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that'll take you to the effects of part

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.049 
that'll take you to the effects of part
of<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.620> going<00:00:46.620> back<00:00:46.800> over<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.820> green

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
of it going back over here the green

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.610 
of it going back over here the green
button<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.719> auxilary<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
button is for auxilary which is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.900 
button is for auxilary which is
something<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.950> we're<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
something that we're really not going to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.479 
something that we're really not going to
use<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.289> right<00:00:52.800> above<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
use and then you go right above that and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.250 
use and then you go right above that and
this<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> low<00:00:54.120> frequency<00:00:54.149> I'll<00:00:54.960> turn<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
this is the low frequency I'll turn it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
this is the low frequency I'll turn it
up<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.530> bit<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.160> low<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
up a little bit this is low as for the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.729 
up a little bit this is low as for the
bass<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.750> voice<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> turn<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
bass in your voice so if you turn it to

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.349 
bass in your voice so if you turn it to
the<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:58.920> you're<00:00:59.370> increasing<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> bass

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the right you're increasing the bass

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.229 
the right you're increasing the bass
Chim<00:01:01.289> Chim<00:01:01.530> Chim<00:01:01.800> check<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.640> hear<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
Chim Chim Chim check as you can hear and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.570 
Chim Chim Chim check as you can hear and
if<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.660> turn<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> back<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> center<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.129> if

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
if you turn it back to the center or if

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
if you turn it back to the center or if
you<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.850> too<00:01:06.150> deep<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.659> voice<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.049> would

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you have too deep of a voice and would

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.539 
you have too deep of a voice and would
take<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.619> bit<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.310> back

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
take a little bit of that out you back

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.130 
take a little bit of that out you back
it<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> left<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.750> gets<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> little

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it off to the left and it gets a little

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.250 
it off to the left and it gets a little
tinny<00:01:10.560> err<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.909> less<00:01:12.420> deep<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
tinny err a little a little less deep so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870 
tinny err a little a little less deep so
we<00:01:13.409> keep<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:13.979> 12<00:01:14.220> o'clock<00:01:14.580> again

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
we keep that at 12 o'clock again

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.789 
we keep that at 12 o'clock again
everything's<00:01:15.299> pretty<00:01:15.450> much<00:01:15.600> standard<00:01:16.229> for

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
everything's pretty much standard for

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.039 
everything's pretty much standard for
just<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> normal<00:01:17.490> sounding<00:01:17.880> voice<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.780> next

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
just a normal sounding voice the next

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.749 
just a normal sounding voice the next
two<00:01:19.200> buttons<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.460> mid

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
two buttons that you have here are mid

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.030 
two buttons that you have here are mid
frequencies<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.750> they're<00:01:22.409> both<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
frequencies and they're both just to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.530 
frequencies and they're both just to
control<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> mid<00:01:23.640> frequency<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.420> voice

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
control the mid frequency in your voice

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.030 
control the mid frequency in your voice
if<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.049> need<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> voice<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.950> little

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
if you need to get the voice a little

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.249 
if you need to get the voice a little
sharper<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> hear<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> talk<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.140> then

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
sharper you want to hear a talk and then

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.480 
sharper you want to hear a talk and then
you<00:01:28.290> make<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.799> sharper<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.310> way

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you make it a little sharper that way

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
you make it a little sharper that way
that's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> little<00:01:30.000> too<00:01:30.150> much<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.200> back<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that's a little too much so we back it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.340 
that's a little too much so we back it
back<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:33.119> everything<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.900> always<00:01:34.079> done

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
back down and everything is always done

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
back down and everything is always done
to<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> individual<00:01:35.159> person<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.700> singer

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
to the individual person or singer

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.410 
to the individual person or singer
here's<00:01:36.930> another<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.470> frequency<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.210> turn

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
here's another one frequency and we turn

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.660 
here's another one frequency and we turn
it<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.659> turn<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.340> back<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it up turn it down and we can go back to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
it up turn it down and we can go back to
the<00:01:41.790> 12<00:01:42.030> o'clock<00:01:42.090> position<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> very

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the 12 o'clock position and at the very

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
the 12 o'clock position and at the very
top<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> high<00:01:44.729> frequency<00:01:45.329> which<00:01:45.479> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
top we have the high frequency which is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.120 
top we have the high frequency which is
for<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> highs<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.290> your<00:01:46.409> voice<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
for the highs in your voice and that

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
for the highs in your voice and that
really<00:01:47.430> does<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.210> tell<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
really does as you can tell here the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
really does as you can tell here the
difference<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.829> voice<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.310> speaking<00:01:50.700> at

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
difference in my voice I'm speaking at

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.460 
difference in my voice I'm speaking at
the<00:01:50.939> same<00:01:51.149> volume<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.049> changes

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the same volume it just changes

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
the same volume it just changes
everything<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:53.759> put<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.000> there

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
everything so we put that there

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200 
everything so we put that there
the<00:01:54.869> red<00:01:55.170> button<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.280> game<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:57.000> an

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the red button is the game so that's an

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.810 
the red button is the game so that's an
individual<00:01:58.020> volume<00:01:58.409> control<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.189> this

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
individual volume control for this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.850 
individual volume control for this

right in there and you plug it in and
again<00:03:22.260> same<00:03:22.709> thing<00:03:23.040> with<00:03:23.280> these<00:03:23.430> buttons<00:03:23.730> here

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
again same thing with these buttons here

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.670 
again same thing with these buttons here
just<00:03:24.390> make<00:03:24.570> sure<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.870> when<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.140> go<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.380> talk

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
just make sure that when you go to talk

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.250 
just make sure that when you go to talk
on<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:25.980> microphone<00:03:26.690> then<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.840> use<00:03:28.050> this

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
on this microphone then you use this

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.470 
on this microphone then you use this
volume<00:03:28.770> in<00:03:29.370> addition<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.970> master<00:03:30.300> volume

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
volume in addition to the master volume

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.930 
volume in addition to the master volume
that<00:03:30.660> you've<00:03:30.870> already<00:03:31.050> used<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.459> think<00:03:32.610> that

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
that you've already used so I think that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.449 
that you've already used so I think that
that<00:03:32.970> pretty<00:03:33.360> much<00:03:33.680> sums<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.160> part<00:03:35.400> I

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
that pretty much sums up that part I

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.120 
that pretty much sums up that part I
think<00:03:35.640> I'll<00:03:35.700> leave<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.950> one<00:03:37.950> thing

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
think I'll leave that on and one thing

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.920 
think I'll leave that on and one thing
we<00:03:38.220> didn't<00:03:38.520> go<00:03:38.580> over<00:03:38.610> yet<00:03:39.000> was<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.239> special

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
we didn't go over yet was a special

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.660 
we didn't go over yet was a special
little<00:03:40.050> switch<00:03:40.470> box<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:41.070> we<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.220> right

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
little switch box that we have right

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.880 
little switch box that we have right
here<00:03:41.900> because<00:03:42.900> depending<00:03:43.380> on<00:03:43.470> what<00:03:43.709> we're

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
here because depending on what we're

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.910 
here because depending on what we're
using<00:03:44.100> we<00:03:44.700> may<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:44.970> using<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.570> laptop<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.709> we

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
might be using a jbk depending on what

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.170 
might be using a jbk depending on what
portion<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.620> our<00:03:49.739> show<00:03:49.800> we're<00:03:50.250> doing<00:03:50.580> if<00:03:50.790> we

here and it says input on it and this is

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.689 
here and it says input on it and this is
the<00:05:43.479> one<00:05:46.770> see<00:05:47.770> how<00:05:47.800> we<00:05:47.979> lost<00:05:48.220> our<00:05:48.490> picture

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
the one see how we lost our picture

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.930 
the one see how we lost our picture
because<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:50.080> video<00:05:50.470> box<00:05:50.800> is<00:05:51.159> not<00:05:51.370> connected

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
because the video box is not connected

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.879 
because the video box is not connected
if<00:05:52.090> we<00:05:52.539> want<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:52.810> connect<00:05:53.139> it<00:05:53.289> you<00:05:53.440> don't<00:05:53.650> have

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
if we want to connect it you don't have

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.170 
if we want to connect it you don't have
to<00:05:54.070> use<00:05:54.310> this<00:05:54.820> one

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
to use this one

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.150 
to use this one
not<00:05:55.480> mark<00:05:55.780> the<00:05:55.870> one<00:05:56.170> that<00:05:56.320> says<00:05:56.470> input<00:05:56.890> is<00:05:57.010> one

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
not mark the one that says input is one

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.500 
not mark the one that says input is one
that's<00:05:57.280> going<00:05:57.400> to<00:05:57.460> bring<00:05:57.610> our<00:05:57.730> video<00:05:58.060> signal

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
that's going to bring our video signal

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.900 
that's going to bring our video signal
from<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:58.900> box<00:05:59.140> into<00:06:00.100> our<00:06:00.220> monitor<00:06:00.610> I'll<00:06:00.700> plug

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
from the box into our monitor I'll plug

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.330 
from the box into our monitor I'll plug
that<00:06:01.030> back<00:06:01.090> in<00:06:01.480> just<00:06:01.630> so<00:06:01.810> you<00:06:01.870> can<00:06:02.050> see<00:06:05.340> and

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
that back in just so you can see and

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
as much as we could of course if there's

can just follow the green and that goes
into<00:07:19.000> the<00:07:19.060> subwoofers<00:07:19.630> the<00:07:19.660> other<00:07:19.960> end<00:07:20.170> of<00:07:20.230> the

cables are also green so that you know

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.340 
cables are also green so that you know
