00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 it is best to feed the body very often 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:14.429
 small portions so better u famous 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:16.080
 and yes you feel better out 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.730
 probably more correct to ask a question 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 on how a person lived russia in america 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.520
 what are the two opinions about the fact that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.410
 why america athletes look on 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.090
 order is better than us or on 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.550
 order but differences are still big 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.070
 Odessa or the whole thing in the climate and pain 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.700
 newer drugs or some other 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.270
 nuances but again the quality of food 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.800
 other products here other 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.469
 a lot more food then 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 eat an assortment of fish say it again 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.280
 sports supplements are much better here 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 but of course pharmacology is probably 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.149
 level up 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.910
 here basically tops athletes they know 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.680
 secret combinations here are a lot 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.960
 Different approaches exist therefore I 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 I think that an order of magnitude better but 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 training each correspondingly more 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.189
 focused on family anesthetic power 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.659
 on the development of muscle mass but because 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.369
 that people here in Russia start in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.520
 mostly from steer ingo steam lifting 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.729
 such bro powerlifting creates a very 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 loses wide waist can be said 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.650
 skeleton here and 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.240
 It seems to me that is lost aesthetics and for 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.340
 this tremendous respect for armlift 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.070
 because basically i started myself 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.259
 strength training but it seems to me that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.329
 only so our athletes are a bit 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.600
 lagging behind because everyone wants more 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.350
 be wanting to lift more weight over here 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.030
 top well, professionals I see 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.710
 in the voice we are constantly every day 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.960
 deals with light weight with which 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.180
 deals with people who basically has 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.060
 only two three years of experience in the gym 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.030
 the hall that's just the most there is no exhaustion 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.560
 muscle volume training is very intense 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.240
 Here I am, in principle, I train for sure 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.350
 also it seems to me that this is the best 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.560
 approach as question 6 how to keep the waist 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.180
 at the same time to build muscle 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.040
 genetics flattery any secrets in 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.760
 there is no general secret there are just methods 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.650
 workouts 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.960
 need to wear a belt because time 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.890
 keeps your italians hold abdominal 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.890
 abdominal muscles that keeps your 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.840
 abdominal cavity people who do not wear 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.700
 the belt crouches hard on them 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.890
 the abdominal cavity turns on 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.440
 she too muscles she also increases by 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.760
 improves and everything look at 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.560
 they all have great powerlifters 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.510
 abdominal because working with 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.720
 big weights are very hard to squat 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.040
 makes deadlift very hard 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.280
 that is, all these jerks they really 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.920
 create such you can say the load on 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.350
 abdominal visage oil for not 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.840
 increase in size so if you 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.610
 train 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.730
 be sure to wear a belt if you already have 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.560
 wide waist and wide muscular abdominal 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.100
 the cavity and the fact that the muscles on it that is 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.900
 and blix 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.750
 and what you need to do very much 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.030
 exhausting work on the press that is 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.820
 1000 downloads per day is what I am 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.130
 doing now I'm on an empty stomach with 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.870
 am you probably take you 40 45 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.010
 minutes if you do every day and you 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.950
 promise you will see progress in that 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.440
 make your tallin much more symmetrical 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.810
 refined once again speak carriers me 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.209
 there are not many other methods 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.370
 and like a vacuum with that is exercise 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.530
 vacuum then tightening the abdominal cavity 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.060
 inside a lot of people and they forgot about 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.660
 this talked arnold says it 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.840
 Frank Zane 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.120
 really help to keep the waist 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.890
 together that is tightly tight here and 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.320
 control the abdominal cavity too and 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.970
 the posture improves accordingly 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.220
 wear a belt for every workout 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.920
 addiction to do or deadlift or 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.620
 do squats and bench press or biceps 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.330
 I always wear a belt I don't care who 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.600
 what people say in russia 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.489
 it is not good that something is nonsense 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.530
 works for me that worked for frenk 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.300
 Zane and for Arnold for Franco Colombo 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.489
 so I would not listen to anyone 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:05.890
 the rest in general question 7 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.780
 is it important is there is time is there is time 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.620
 or have more weight clearer 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.319
 daily calorie 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.229
 I do not have any of either when I told them 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.410
 i'm hungry usually hungry every two hours 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.150
 the moment both now is in the very 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.729
 the height because I'm trying right now 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.340
 dry came up the work is not your 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.830
 projects that's why I remove carbohydrates 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.300
 centering carbs 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.090
 my metabolism is very well developed in 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.110
 principle and in the off-season too I eat only 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.970
 when i'm hungry i drink a lot of water i 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.190
 I do not know how many calories I eat 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.570
 day im i instinctive i mean i 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.699
 feel when i need to add 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.949
 carbohydrates when I need carbohydrates when 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.680
 remove when I need to raise proteins and 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.199
 so this kind of experience he is recruited 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.760
 with time that is instinctive 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.460
 nutrition effective workout on 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.280
 have time so you can it 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.350
 develop that is eat certain 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.169
 ingredients and you write down how you yourself 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.050
 feel after we ate one 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.820
 or other other product and you can lead 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.010
 such a journal how it affects your 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.110
 training feeler vascularity u10 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.580
 what have you been blown away like you 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.260
 stop digestion that is so 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.880
 way you can from all these products 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.979
 which badly affect our body 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.930
 bad for your metabolism 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.000
 digestion that suit 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.729
 assimilated better duet better pamba 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.680
 feel their best growth so i'm at 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.620
 principle developed for myself such an instinct 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.200
 and I know that I need to eat 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.330
 the next meal is usually two three 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.190
 hours I think it's best to feed 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.440
 the body is very often in small portions 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.930
 so better absorbed and yes so better 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.990
 you feel that's why if you 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.810
 Namaste advise better 12 14-15 times a day 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.940
 sounds crazy so do him 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.180
 I am eating here now 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.099
 68 times a day on drying and I don't 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.139
 feel 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:01.860
 pulled de-energized that is barely dragging 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:04.470
 legs because i went through such an experience here 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.030
 I think you need to eat well even 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.030
 on drying just need to eat right 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.530
 8 and what kind of executioner injuries go along the way 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.979
 physical improvement and fame 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:22.360
 God never seriously injured were 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:23.979
 there may be stretching in but serious 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.259
 there were no injuries when I was training 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.520
 wrestling I broke my collarbone for yes never 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.710
 did not bother me to train 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.930
 bodybuilding next subsequent this 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.900
 it was very on her age so I 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.020
 I train very intelligently with the mind 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.699
 I feel vez en I do not control weight 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.810
 letting weight control me 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.539
 have I feel somewhere some 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:46.870
 minimal discomfort I put the woods 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.949
 back and get upset we can 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.930
 be weight down 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.639
 I select another angle that is necessary 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.310
 train wisely because if 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.729
 your career and you hurt yourself very much 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.729
 it will be difficult 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:17.800
 i seem 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.800
 and
