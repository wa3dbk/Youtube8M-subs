00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.289
 what it glistens today with a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 new green club boss is already passing 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.010
 I can just see for this 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.370
 buy slippery flare with full 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.710
 harmony 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.030
 there you have to mark a job 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.220
 Below in the description is on each 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.960
 In the case it is marked for the ps4 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.940
 I have created a job in any case 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 if you mark it the pause the 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.579
 just him and then yes I'll tell you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.350
 makes friends with friends that's his name 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.700
 suffers another buddy and then you have 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.790
 you can see more fun already 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 lounge matrix bar fraps this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.480
 specially marked by 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.000
 because you need then you start 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.160
 the invite expensive buddy and starts 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.649
 that's just how it is 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.320
 but people mist that you at the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.930
 race gta set just let 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 all preferences as they are 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.500
 For example, really there must 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.079
 to be really gta and a round one 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.829
 He definitely wanted to reach 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.899
 I still say 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.270
 matrix and I have that look in 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.130
 heaviest work out because 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.039
 we did not know how we got here 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.109
 make container so dynamic and there me 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.689
 badly waved around and so it was 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.920
 right that if you too 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.060
 She wanted to upload us to everyone 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.130
 case link that was of course whole 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.249
 new we want a distant community 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.719
 stay yes and as I said you invite 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:31.170
 then just buddy in germany then 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:33.060
 Just fix it and then start 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.369
 The race is best bought 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.590
 ammunition with us in the case bastian 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.929
 this flag continued and if you the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.619
 then you bought then you have 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.119
 Huge fun people as I said then 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.130
 in the race since today the race simply 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.429
 So far as I have only a few 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.200
 snatch checkpoints off and if 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.369
 you then brought people then 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.799
 you just go here to these 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.899
 Containers and we already see it here 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.179
 can and there are just a few things 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.789
 fly it fly container from 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.709
 the air people yes that was not so 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.389
 so now I will show you again what 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.160
 it's funny that thinks now 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:10.229
 Disco will follow all this and so on 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.050
 you can do a lot with this container 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.540
 move all 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.700
 can already see is right 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.710
 Freaky as I said it was hard work 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.170
 true mega if the mark us 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.460
 could because she also uploads that and yes 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.980
 then I would best show you that 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.270
 Here my buddy matrix is ​​now high 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.990
 Of course I'll fly that to you now 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.760
 demonstrate 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.470
 he just shoots on the containers 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.300
 He can already see we fly so far 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.950
 away that I do not even see him anymore 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.900
 Of course people can show you this 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.730
 from my perspective against the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.770
 container moves in the middle 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.470
 To look all the way up with the spots 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.850
 and shoot it around me 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.440
 that's flying like that 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.510
 fierce and so extreme 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.870
 you can even perform actions 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.820
 you can even record people and the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.520
 even killing is definitely like that 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.830
 blatant because there was something like that for a long time 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.620
 as I said it has been hard work 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.620
 and this clip no idea because it does so 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.880
 Saves badly and we now 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.710
 In any case, a few 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.090
 you can see cutouts 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.500
 even with friends if you then 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.750
 both at the same time then shoot at it 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.270
 you fly extremely far into the air people 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.820
 and it is so horny sometimes it is 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.140
 so that one or the other is not like that 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.270
 high is like the buddy 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.220
 Here matrix is ​​right up 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.720
 and not me so now 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.250
 It really depends on us 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.660
 Try every case with 30 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.370
 people do it all 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.170
 I think that's funny 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.630
 30 people in a container and everyone on 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.860
 shoot once with the flag up and 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.110
 yes, here I show you some of course 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.300
 insights and you can see that one 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.280
 but really far flies up 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.739
 is not all 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.750
 sometimes you fly so high that 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.220
 You simply fly upstairs baking flies 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.110
 then that's how they look like 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.030
 you fly around all the time and when 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.560
 The container then stand around with the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.450
 then you can have a lot of fun like that 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.190
 you are catapulted sometimes weird 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.320
 you are being catapulted out and 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.800
 sometimes you just feel so far 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.630
 above 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.330
 It just really depends on it 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.770
 that's really blatant people it can be too 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.390
 Of course sometimes that will be easy 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.390
 claps on the floor and easy 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.069
 but it survives that it rarely becomes people 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.500
 in that case it was so i just put him in 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.630
 floor unfolded has survived here 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.940
 Again in the ego perspective was too 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.510
 very peacefully flew up my 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.519
 opinion 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.420
 I could even walk up here 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.790
 was mysterious in any case, so yes 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.390
 sometimes works down and is 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.400
 dead said people you have to do the job to you 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.620
 Just mark on the social club 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.150
 page as serious club data not 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.100
 You know you can also do it with your ps 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.960
 Just log in a data and if 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.240
 you have logged in there you click 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.830
 Just once or twice on the link 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.990
 depending on when sometimes it can be 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.980
 that the link market is not there then 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.690
 found a game 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.669
 we have to stop on playstation 4 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.810
 but I think that's it 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.570
 Everyone is aware of how to play such a game 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.500
 but yes if there are questions 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.240
 you can see below in the comments 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.000
 I would say but how to write 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.470
 just say job then go 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.600
 you restart and then you can the 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.160
 job cost 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.830
 yes and yes it really is it 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.720
 horny without joke here you can see 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.250
 here I am high flown 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.860
 i was sick of many actions 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.750
 go through and so well I would people 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.669

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.590
 upload volt links us it's us 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.030
 want all four be people it is 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.630
 Just like that and then I would say 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.020
 I'm out I say goodbye now 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.020
 from you so then white skin in 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.020
 rhapsody
