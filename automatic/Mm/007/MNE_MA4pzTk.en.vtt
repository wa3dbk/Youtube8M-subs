00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.080
 i draw with a black kohl pencil 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.660
 a line as close as possible to the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.690
 eyelash edge and then I can 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.309
 up in your arcade arch 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.109
 then I make that corner in its entirety 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 a bit darker because I want one 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.740
 intense black smokey eyes 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.740
 but beware that you don't go too high 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.330
 it does not have to be neat we go here 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 name fade away 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.340
 then you blur the cabbage pencil 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.820
 you fade a bit down 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.100
 slowly follow your arcade to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.629
 inside and out a bit 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.070
 in the end it is a smokey eye you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 so it must be a bit smoky 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.100
 no hard lines so plant is your 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100
 friend 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.570
 I make with a dark brown eye shadow 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 the whole a little bit warmer 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.469
 at the same time the coles fixes well 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.290
 on the skin kohl pencil is of course something 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.129
 greasy substance so this worries 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.129
 that it stays in place 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.670
 don't forget your lower lashes either 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.530
 to take with a dark brown 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.179
 eye shadow 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.920
 each base and needs a little fixation 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.920
 and get that smokey effect 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.220
 but pay attention sometimes you can with eye shadow 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.500
 easily crumble under your eye and that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.060
 is sin for your base so I use 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:48.630
 sometimes a tissue 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:51.890
 so you work a little cleaner see her blue 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.890
 eyes already came forward 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.590
 I then make everything 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.780
 softer with an orange-like earth 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.670
 refueling thereby I ensure that the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.460
 hard lines are even less visible 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.610
 so dark to nothing about 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.610
 runs 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.420
 deck with a lighter shade of eye shadow 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.400
 the moving eyelid a bit 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.020
 because you keep this light you create 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.020
 more the people in your smokey eye 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.300
 wipe a little crumbled then 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.890
 gently away with a fluffy brush 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.220
 I like it a little bit around the eyes 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.880
 to highlight with a 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.880
 champagne colored highlighter 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.250
 but eyelash edge optically a bit fuller 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.450
 to make it appear 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.130
 I still go with a little black 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.810
 eye shadow as close as possible to her 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.100
 eyelash edge with a black eye pencil 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.500
 of course you can also do it as a finishing touch 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.730
 naturally a good mascara touch 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.380
 bring it as close to you as possible 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.760
 eyelash edge again with a zig saw him 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.720
 draw a movement and then 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.550
 up 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.460
 with that you separate all hairs well 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.780
 and they are the best in law 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.880
 you can use a few layers of mascara 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.350
 do it is a smokey eye 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.610
 So the more intense the better you can 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.470
 opt for a skin-colored carbon pencil 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.340
 your format 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.340
 open glance 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.900
 In this case I choose a black pencil 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.900
 you for an intense smokey eye
