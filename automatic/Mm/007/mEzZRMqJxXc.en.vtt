consolation<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.469> quite<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.829> bit

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
consolation you can see it's quite a bit

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
consolation you can see it's quite a bit
bigger<00:00:38.190> than<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> fighters<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.360> over

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
bigger than the fighters we have over

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.740 
bigger than the fighters we have over
here<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.230> RSI<00:00:40.770> Aurora<00:00:41.930> origin<00:00:42.930> through<00:00:43.230> 25<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
here the RSI Aurora origin through 25 a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
here the RSI Aurora origin through 25 a
but<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.840> still<00:00:46.079> relatively<00:00:46.469> small<00:00:46.890> ship<00:00:47.309> in

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
but it still relatively small ship in

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.270 
but it still relatively small ship in
the<00:00:47.730> grand<00:00:47.940> scheme<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.210> things<00:00:48.329> others<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the grand scheme of things others the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
the grand scheme of things others the
Uyghurs<00:00:50.610> Corvette<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> Bengal<00:00:51.629> carrier

Uyghurs Corvette and the Bengal carrier
Levin<00:00:52.320> announced<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:52.860> sure<00:00:53.039> there's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
Levin announced and I'm sure there's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.959 
Levin announced and I'm sure there's
gonna<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.430> tons<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.969> other<00:00:54.090> bigger<00:00:54.899> ships<00:00:55.320> I

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.950 

believe<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.300> second<00:01:00.750> largest

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
believe this is the second largest

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
believe this is the second largest
shipping<00:01:01.440> by<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:02.190> now

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.550 

so<00:01:07.360> obviously<00:01:07.690> you<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:07.960> cockpit<00:01:08.410> up

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
so obviously you have the cockpit up

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.370 
so obviously you have the cockpit up
there<00:01:08.830> over<00:01:09.550> here<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:09.910> have<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.380> currents

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
there over here you have the currents

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.020 
there over here you have the currents
that<00:01:11.500> are<00:01:11.560> controlled<00:01:11.980> by<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.190> pilots<00:01:12.730> or<00:01:12.940> the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
that are controlled by the pilots or the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.230 
that are controlled by the pilots or the
fix<00:01:13.240> cannons<00:01:13.900> I<00:01:15.330> believe<00:01:16.330> their<00:01:16.510> fix<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:19.150> have

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
fix cannons I believe their fix you have

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.719 
fix cannons I believe their fix you have
brusters<00:01:20.400> inside<00:01:22.950> its<00:01:23.950> operator<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.580> there's

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
brusters inside its operator so there's

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.070 
brusters inside its operator so there's
a<00:01:24.760> lot<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:24.910> cargo<00:01:25.180> capacity<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.780> enter<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
a lot of cargo capacity to enter the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.050 
a lot of cargo capacity to enter the
ship<00:01:29.290> you<00:01:29.410> have<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.590> go<00:01:29.710> in<00:01:29.890> this<00:01:30.010> little<00:01:30.250> hatch

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
ship you have to go in this little hatch

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.430 
ship you have to go in this little hatch
or<00:01:31.660> air<00:01:32.170> lock<00:01:32.470> device<00:01:33.370> I<00:01:37.020> love<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.140> immersive

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
or air lock device I love the immersive

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.170 
or air lock device I love the immersive
animations<00:01:39.190> are<00:01:39.430> pretty<00:01:40.060> awesome<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:43.060> is

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
animations are pretty awesome so this is

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.670 
animations are pretty awesome so this is
a<00:01:43.210> cockpit<00:01:43.540> up<00:01:43.840> here<00:01:44.050> i'm<00:01:44.229> not<00:01:44.380> sure<00:01:44.560> what

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
a cockpit up here i'm not sure what

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.499 
a cockpit up here i'm not sure what
these<00:01:44.830> two<00:01:45.070> seats<00:01:45.340> do<00:01:45.580> i<00:01:45.610> don't<00:01:46.000> i<00:01:46.210> don't<00:01:46.360> know

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
these two seats do i don't i don't know

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.940 
these two seats do i don't i don't know
if<00:01:46.600> they<00:01:46.720> know<00:01:46.900> but<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.950> can't<00:01:48.190> use<00:01:48.369> him<00:01:48.520> yet

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
if they know but you can't use him yet

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.760 
if they know but you can't use him yet
so<00:01:50.950> i<00:01:51.009> can<00:01:51.250> just<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.570> mattered<00:01:53.020> diagnostics<00:01:53.649> or

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
so i can just it mattered diagnostics or

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.090 
so i can just it mattered diagnostics or
something<00:01:53.979> like<00:01:54.040> that<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.500> pilots<00:01:56.920> see

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
something like that so pilots see

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.660 
something like that so pilots see
obviously<00:01:57.970> i<00:01:59.100> don't<00:02:00.100> know<00:02:00.250> if<00:02:00.340> these<00:02:00.430> two

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
obviously i don't know if these two

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.520 
obviously i don't know if these two
panels<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.240> left<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.690> right<00:02:01.720> do<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:02.410> i'm

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
panels on the left and right do but i'm

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.980 
panels on the left and right do but i'm
hoping<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:03.130> they<00:02:03.399> show<00:02:03.759> you<00:02:03.820> what<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.390> what

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
hoping that they show you what the what

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.430 
hoping that they show you what the what
the<00:02:05.020> turret<00:02:05.440> Gunners<00:02:05.740> see<00:02:06.630> may<00:02:07.630> be<00:02:07.690> pretty

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
the turret Gunners see may be pretty

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.979 
the turret Gunners see may be pretty
awesome<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:10.030> heads<00:02:10.239> up<00:02:10.360> display<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.840> get

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
awesome the heads up display you get

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:29.540 
awesome the heads up display you get
some<00:02:11.110> Diagnostics<00:02:11.739> up<00:02:11.860> there

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.740 

where<00:02:30.550> you're<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.000> turret

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.770 

on<00:02:35.750> top<00:02:36.020> side<00:02:36.290> since<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:36.800> easier<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.550> see

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
on top side since it's easier to see

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.309 
on top side since it's easier to see
it's<00:02:39.590> lighter<00:02:40.540> they<00:02:41.540> open<00:02:41.900> these<00:02:41.990> shield

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
it's lighter they open these shield

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.290

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.289 

so<00:02:48.799> it's<00:02:48.950> got<00:02:49.129> 360<00:02:50.120> degrees<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.810> rotation<00:02:52.299> it's
