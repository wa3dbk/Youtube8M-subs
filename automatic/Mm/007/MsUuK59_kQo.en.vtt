00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.390
 Hi everyone! How are you ? 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.760
 I want to show something that is very 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.550
 present day to day I think that everything 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.210
 world that works with creation with fashion 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.640
 with design also uses it every day that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.220
 It's the sketchbook so I'm just here today. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.470
 To talk about him, I'll show him what 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 is and also how you can fill the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:35.780
 Your the sketchbook I used this from here. 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.780
 wake song is a size 5 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:57.890
 and that stadler pencil case and he 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:01:00.350
 have the pencils 2h hbp 2b 4b 6b and also 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.900
 comes with a rubber and super sharpener 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.080
 Good so if you do not have pencils I 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.790
 I advise you to buy these from here. 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.890
 both sketchbook and this 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.290
 pencils you can find in the store 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.210
 designer and I'll leave their link 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.380
 here in the discretion for you to enter there 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.380
 and buy and beauty 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.820
 So before we start squandering 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.330
 our ideas out there we need 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.250
 know what each pencil does then you 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.530
 they perceived each and every one of them 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.200
 has a different numbering and each one 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.509
 of them have a different weight say 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
 so on paper I'll show you 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.009
 What are you going to do? 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.320
 so that first there is the two 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.320
 Warm clothes can see that it is super thin 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:55.970
 soon after that came hb which is a bit 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.370
 softer then I have there bp that is 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.570
 easier than hb and they are all 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.010
 doing so is the same pressure is not 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.260
 squeezing stronger by doing exactly 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.420
 The same Christian is for you to see the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.420
 difference that each of them time 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.070
 this is the 4 be the last 6b note 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.010
 difference of the two of 2h 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.320
 This is good for you to take this test to 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.620
 you see exactly the difference 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.240
 them and which ones you will use depending on the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.330
 what you want then sometimes you want 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.950
 do only one sketch after painting for 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.010
 Up then you will use more pencils 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.480
 thin and wants to make a drawing in graphite 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.050
 probably want to do the sum in 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.130
 shadows 6b onwards 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.020
 and look at people sketchbook white is 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.880
 a plate full for our eyes neither 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.520
 will say I do not feel like leaving 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.410
 saying everything then the first thing that 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.690
 I do is write my name and number 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.570
 sketchbook in this case the sketchbook 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.910
 number two and a sketchbook you can 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.980
 use it for several ways to 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.140
 different types 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.360
 You can use it to draw 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.370
 a collection that you are creating you 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.640
 can use it to train your drawing 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.890
 and you can have it at the prom in your bag 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.020
 beach you see a cool thing an idea 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.390
 It's cool that I write you a notebook. 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.830
 ideas draw ideas 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.140
 You can also go out to do 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.200
 cutouts of buildings and clippings 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.380
 newspaper with the materials is the notebook 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.340
 of your creativity in your head then 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.570
 so do not blame do not be prejudiced 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.430
 put everything you want because 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.110
 after all this is not a job you do not 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.180
 You're going to have to give it to anyone. 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.590
 It's your world and you put it on 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.959
 Any way you want it 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.390
 I used a marker, but how can you? 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.700
 see the marker it ball on the other side 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.430
 so it is if you did not go in the other 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.240
 page can use but if they did not see it as 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.700
 he is dumb 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.450
 I would say to you use colored pencils 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.790
 pastel chalk and even watercolor, you can use me 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.800
 I tested you later, you'll see. 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.840
 is the paper stayed with port and the cattle more 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.540
 he did not find it produces otherwise the 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.090
 paper has not melted so this is a 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.010
 Good thing because 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.459
 You can even use color to paint it. 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.829
 on it good this one I started to use them 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.320
 sketchbook because I have a project 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.030
 I want to make a clutch so I 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.410
 I'm putting all my ideas 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.419
 then the concept is everything is there, idea is 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.340
 a body scale had made of blue 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.639
 to the red in which the middle 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.410
 purple and we needed this project 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.090
 so I took a color pencil test 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.900
 but I did not like it very much and then I did it with 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.000
 watercolor got better then this page 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.510
 I decided to put the whole 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.810
 concept in a drawing only then I solved 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.260
 make a medium with panel and drawing 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.240
 same time I did everything 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:02.750
 step by step there I think I am 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:05.479
 using pencils if I'm not mistaken and is a 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.220
 lapse which is neither too strong 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.220
 weak so I decided I used it 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.860
 and then I went to do the decoration is 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.080
 wrapped and beans the concept at home Ana 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.650
 which is the theme of my project 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.620
 even people give a spoiler alert that 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.090
 I'm doing a blog about my project. 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.370
 so everything step by step I am 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.110
 doing what I'm recording and when I'm 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.030
 I'm going to post the video there, you go. 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.930
 to be able to follow each step that was 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.770
 do this project if it worked otherwise 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.770
 stay the expectation 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.660
 and this way you will fill 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.930
 page making all your 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:16.020
 ideas flowed there is he wrote a 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:20.310
 poem that has to do with my name mine 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.990
 the project and that's the December training 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.720
 in watercolor because I 'm starting with 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:28.290
 watercolor I still do not know how to do very well 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.720
 so I'm training and such a sketchbook 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.660
 No sketchbook for this so we train. 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.080
 to make a mistake so I got it right 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.330
 What can you say, that you'll never do again? 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.430
 and so we are moving on 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.070
 so as you can see you can also 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.840
 It is used to train design as well 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.000
 as for many other functions that I 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.310
 I said that pencil scale of 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.290
 color I solved watercolor farm 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.150
 this is another objective that I had 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.740
 first if you want to see it full 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.620
 he has in the video evolution of my 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.450
 drawings and this one only trained the drawing 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.340
 well then this was the video I hope today 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.800
 You liked it because I liked it and 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.720
 sign up for the channel and follow me on the networks 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.190
 social links are down here 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.030
 people see us in broken people until 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.030
 near 21
