it's gonna be fun it's gonna be a series
kind<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.060> road<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.600> diamond<00:02:07.020> pistols<00:02:07.500> but

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
kind of like road to diamond pistols but

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550 
kind of like road to diamond pistols but
it's<00:02:08.640> gonna<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> little<00:02:09.569> bit<00:02:09.929> shorter<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
it's gonna be a little bit shorter I

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.589 
it's gonna be a little bit shorter I
think<00:02:10.979> probably<00:02:11.250> not<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.879> same<00:02:12.090> length<00:02:12.390> at

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
think probably not the same length at

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.930 
think probably not the same length at
least

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
least

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.940 
least
that's<00:02:13.060> what<00:02:13.180> I'm<00:02:13.300> anticipating<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.620> far

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
that's what I'm anticipating so far

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.010 
that's what I'm anticipating so far
there<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.000> possibility<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.990> being

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
there is the possibility of it being

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.850 
there is the possibility of it being
even<00:02:17.860> longer<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.900> know<00:02:20.020> no<00:02:20.680> one<00:02:20.830> really

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
even longer but you know no one really

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.650 
even longer but you know no one really
knows<00:02:21.430> because<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.940> don't<00:02:22.120> exactly<00:02:22.360> know<00:02:22.630> how

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
knows because I don't exactly know how

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.270 
knows because I don't exactly know how
many<00:02:22.990> videos<00:02:23.380> I'm<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.770> end<00:02:23.920> up<00:02:24.040> putting

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
in modern warfare 2 and world at war i

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.970 
in modern warfare 2 and world at war i
am<00:03:06.580> currently<00:03:06.910> 10th<00:03:07.360> prestige<00:03:07.630> but<00:03:08.380> i<00:03:08.440> can<00:03:08.740> say

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.250 
am currently 10th prestige but i can say
that<00:03:09.220> i<00:03:09.250> got<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.120> less<00:03:10.750> than<00:03:11.080> legitimate

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
that i got it in a less than legitimate

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.840 
that i got it in a less than legitimate
way<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:14.620> one<00:03:14.920> will<00:03:15.130> be<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> first<00:03:15.610> one

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
way so this one will be the first one

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.790 
way so this one will be the first one
that<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:16.030> really<00:03:16.420> do<00:03:16.600> by<00:03:16.930> myself<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.680> it's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
that I really do by myself and it's

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800 
that I really do by myself and it's
going<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> be<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.160> ton<00:03:18.430> of<00:03:18.459> fun<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.750> can't

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
going to be a ton of fun and I can't

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.690 
going to be a ton of fun and I can't
wait<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.380> be<00:03:20.560> there<00:03:20.800> because<00:03:21.070> I'll<00:03:21.400> just<00:03:21.580> be

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
wait to be there because I'll just be

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.550

able<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.030> be<00:03:22.209> 10th<00:03:22.510> prestige<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:23.350> won't

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
able to be 10th prestige and I won't

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.710 
able to be 10th prestige and I won't
have<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.860> worry<00:03:24.100> about<00:03:24.190> leveling<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.090> then<00:03:25.600> of

have to worry about leveling and then of

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.510 
have to worry about leveling and then of
course<00:03:25.750> because<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.620> game<00:03:26.890> did<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.280> right

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
course because this game did it right

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.790 
course because this game did it right
and<00:03:27.580> this<00:03:27.910> game<00:03:28.120> understood<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:29.500> should

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
and this game understood that you should

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.310 
and this game understood that you should
do<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.250> there<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.060> possibility<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:32.110> do<00:03:32.290> a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
do this there is a possibility to do a

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.400 
do this there is a possibility to do a
fresh<00:03:32.709> start<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:34.450> guys<00:03:34.660> also<00:03:34.930> might<00:03:35.290> be

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
fresh start you guys also might be

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.800 
fresh start you guys also might be
wondering<00:03:35.620> why<00:03:36.370> my<00:03:36.580> commentary<00:03:37.180> style<00:03:37.510> seems

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
wondering why my commentary style seems

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.990 
wondering why my commentary style seems
a<00:03:37.989> little<00:03:38.170> bit<00:03:38.350> different<00:03:38.800> right<00:03:38.830> now<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.430> know

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
a little bit different right now I know

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.720 
a little bit different right now I know
that<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.390> am<00:03:40.900> kind<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.410> worried<00:03:42.280> about<00:03:42.489> that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
that I am kind of worried about that

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.040 
that I am kind of worried about that
because<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.180> might<00:03:43.360> sound<00:03:43.630> a<00:03:43.720> little<00:03:43.750> different

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
because I might sound a little different

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.229 
because I might sound a little different
than<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.410> would<00:03:44.590> normally<00:03:44.620> sound<00:03:45.340> I'm<00:03:45.820> trying

knife I'm practicing with my new
wireless<00:04:42.140> scuf<00:04:42.620> controller<00:04:43.040> because<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.430> have

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
wireless scuf controller because I have

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.160 
wireless scuf controller because I have
a<00:04:43.670> wireless<00:04:43.940> one<00:04:44.180> instead<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.810> wired<00:04:45.020> one

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
a wireless one instead of a wired one

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.560 
a wireless one instead of a wired one
now<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:45.830> my<00:04:46.430> fingers<00:04:46.850> kind<00:04:47.090> of<00:04:47.180> moved<00:04:47.360> to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
now and my fingers kind of moved to

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.750 
now and my fingers kind of moved to
different<00:04:47.750> places<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:48.920> I'm<00:04:49.040> seeing<00:04:49.340> how<00:04:49.490> quick

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
different places so I'm seeing how quick

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.270 
different places so I'm seeing how quick
I<00:04:49.910> can<00:04:49.940> still<00:04:50.330> knife<00:04:50.600> with<00:04:50.900> a<00:04:50.930> wireless<00:04:51.280> but

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
I can still knife with a wireless but

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.250 
I can still knife with a wireless but
it's<00:04:52.460> definitely<00:04:52.790> better<00:04:53.360> than<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.230> original

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
it's definitely better than the original
