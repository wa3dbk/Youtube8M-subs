00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
the linear five by five but she's been

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.489

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
I think was 120 pounds for five sets of

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.090 
I think was 120 pounds for five sets of
five<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:01.200> was<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.350> first<00:02:01.530> time<00:02:01.709> she<00:02:01.770> hit

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
five and that was the first time she hit

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
five and that was the first time she hit
that<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.639> that<00:02:03.149> was<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> pretty<00:02:03.420> awesome

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

week overhead press for six reps got 150
pounds<00:03:08.139> which<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.379> was<00:03:08.500> pretty<00:03:08.680> happy<00:03:08.859> about

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
pounds which I was pretty happy about

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.849 
pounds which I was pretty happy about
and<00:03:09.719> just<00:03:10.719> feeling<00:03:10.930> good<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.469> the<00:03:11.560> gym

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
and just feeling good in the gym

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.280 
and just feeling good in the gym
probably<00:03:12.760> because<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.540> increased<00:03:14.079> food

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
probably because of the increased food

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.940 
probably because of the increased food
and<00:03:14.620> increased<00:03:15.239> body<00:03:16.239> fat<00:03:16.629> but<00:03:17.019> I'm<00:03:17.620> okay<00:03:17.769> with

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
and increased body fat but I'm okay with

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.319 
and increased body fat but I'm okay with
it<00:03:18.129> for<00:03:18.430> now<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.579> still<00:03:18.879> don't<00:03:19.030> know<00:03:19.090> what<00:03:19.209> I

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
it for now I still don't know what I

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.729 
it for now I still don't know what I
would<00:03:19.480> have<00:03:19.510> been<00:03:19.900> weighing<00:03:20.079> myself<00:03:20.290> just

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
would have been weighing myself just

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.140 
would have been weighing myself just
kind<00:03:20.919> of<00:03:21.010> taking<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.400> mental<00:03:21.730> break<00:03:21.939> from

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
kind of taking a mental break from

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.179
