all<00:00:20.240> and<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> did<00:00:22.050> some<00:00:22.230> reading<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
all and what I did some reading on the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.769 
all and what I did some reading on the
internet<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.279> found<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.240> found<00:00:24.600> that

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
internet I found that the I found that

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.720 
internet I found that the I found that
the<00:00:25.050> common<00:00:25.439> problem<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the common problem is to do with the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.099 
the common problem is to do with the
electrical<00:00:27.150> connector<00:00:27.539> where<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.840> connects

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
electrical connector where it connects

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.390 
electrical connector where it connects
to<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.320> circuit<00:00:28.650> board<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> windshield

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
to the circuit board at the windshield

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.389 
to the circuit board at the windshield
washer<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.570> shield<00:00:30.929> wiper<00:00:31.109> motor<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.369> I

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
washer as a shield wiper motor so what I

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
washer as a shield wiper motor so what I
did<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.790> touched<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> actual<00:00:33.750> connector

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
did was I touched the actual connector

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.549 
did was I touched the actual connector
with<00:00:34.260> my<00:00:34.410> hand<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> wire<00:00:34.950> harness<00:00:35.370> and

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
with my hand the wire harness and

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.690 
with my hand the wire harness and
suddenly<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> wiper<00:00:37.829> started<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> move<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
suddenly the wiper started to move on

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.250 
suddenly the wiper started to move on
low<00:00:38.879> speed<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.480> knew<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.870> was<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> problem

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
low speed so I knew that was a problem

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
low speed so I knew that was a problem
so<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> did<00:00:41.250> was<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.879> took<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> cover<00:00:42.480> off

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
so what I did was I took this cover off

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500 
so what I did was I took this cover off
right<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.379> using<00:00:43.649> using<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> t20<00:00:45.000> Torx<00:00:45.210> bit

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
right here using using a t20 Torx bit

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
right here using using a t20 Torx bit
there<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.750> three<00:00:45.930> screws<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.230> come<00:00:46.410> off<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
there are three screws that come off the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.959 
there are three screws that come off the
cover<00:00:47.760> comes<00:00:48.030> off<00:00:48.149> under<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> cover<00:00:49.789> this<00:00:50.789> is

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
cover comes off under that cover this is

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
cover comes off under that cover this is
the<00:00:51.090> circuit<00:00:51.480> board<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> what

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the circuit board right here and what

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
the circuit board right here and what
you<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.059> wiggle<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.660> pulling<00:00:55.079> on

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you do is you wiggle it out pulling on

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
you do is you wiggle it out pulling on
the<00:00:55.590> black<00:00:55.829> connector<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.610> then<00:00:57.149> also

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the black connector and then also

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.939 
the black connector and then also
pulling<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.109> part<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> board<00:00:58.770> down

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
pulling on this part of the board down

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
pulling on this part of the board down
here<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.789> got<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> screwdriver<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
here you kind of I got a screwdriver and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
here you kind of I got a screwdriver and
kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.559> prior<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.039> really<00:01:02.430> really

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
kind of just prior to that really really

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.969 
kind of just prior to that really really
carefully<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:04.170> whittled<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.619> back<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
carefully and I whittled it back and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
carefully and I whittled it back and
forth<00:01:05.129> until<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> came<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.570> can

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
forth until it came out and if you can

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.350 
forth until it came out and if you can
see<00:01:06.960> these<00:01:07.920> are<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> contacts<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> actually

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
see these are the contacts that actually

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149 
see these are the contacts that actually
go<00:01:09.570> into<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> motor<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> you're<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
go into the motor and you're going to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.160 
go into the motor and you're going to
have<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.640> very<00:01:11.670> careful<00:01:12.240> when<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> wiggle

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
have to be very careful when you wiggle

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.240 
have to be very careful when you wiggle
rows<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.680> should<00:01:13.830> come<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.159> there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
rows but they should come out of there

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.640 
rows but they should come out of there
without<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.670> trouble<00:01:15.259> when<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> look<00:01:16.530> at

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
without it in trouble when you look at

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.710 
without it in trouble when you look at
this<00:01:16.799> far<00:01:17.580> side<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> circuit<00:01:18.390> board<00:01:18.570> right

and<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.760> will<00:01:43.090> show<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:43.360> how<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.280> reset<00:01:45.280> a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
and so that will show you how to reset a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.980 
and so that will show you how to reset a
cold<00:01:45.670> solder<00:01:45.880> joint<00:01:46.180> it's<00:01:46.420> also<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.720> really

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
cold solder joint it's also a really

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.390 
cold solder joint it's also a really
good<00:01:47.110> idea<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.410> put<00:01:47.560> an<00:01:47.650> extra<00:01:47.830> blob<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.130> solder

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
good idea to put an extra blob of solder

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.670 
good idea to put an extra blob of solder
on<00:01:48.550> there<00:01:48.820> at<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:48.970> same<00:01:49.180> time<00:01:49.450> these<00:01:50.350> are<00:01:50.410> the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
on there at the same time these are the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.830 
on there at the same time these are the
these<00:01:51.190> are<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.580> solder<00:01:52.090> dots<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:52.570> people

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
these are the solder dots that people

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.840 
these are the solder dots that people
typically<00:01:53.200> have<00:01:53.440> problems<00:01:53.830> with<00:01:53.950> however<00:01:54.550> in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
typically have problems with however in

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.640 
typically have problems with however in
my<00:01:55.030> case<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.450> noticed<00:01:55.780> there's<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.050> burnt<00:01:56.290> trace

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
my case I noticed there's a burnt trace

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.950 
my case I noticed there's a burnt trace
right<00:01:57.010> here<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:58.330> don't<00:01:58.510> know<00:01:58.570> what<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:58.810> does

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
right here and I don't know what it does

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.420 
right here and I don't know what it does
but<00:01:59.170> it's<00:01:59.290> very<00:01:59.500> thin<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.890> I<00:01:59.950> can<00:02:00.130> tell<00:02:00.280> it's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
but it's very thin and I can tell it's

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.610 
but it's very thin and I can tell it's
burnt<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.150> what<00:02:01.300> I'm<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.600> do<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:02.050> jumper

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
burnt so what I'm going to do is jumper

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.340 
burnt so what I'm going to do is jumper
from<00:02:02.800> that<00:02:03.070> solder<00:02:03.610> joint<00:02:03.940> right<00:02:04.060> there<00:02:04.350> over

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
from that solder joint right there over

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.010 
from that solder joint right there over
to<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:06.490> bigger<00:02:06.880> solder<00:02:07.300> joint<00:02:07.570> right<00:02:07.750> here

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
to this bigger solder joint right here

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.740 
to this bigger solder joint right here
along<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.070> same<00:02:09.310> trace<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.509> it's

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
along the same trace so it's

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.570 
along the same trace so it's
electrically<00:02:11.230> it's<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.590> same<00:02:11.800> but<00:02:12.400> this

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
electrically it's the same but this

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.220 
electrically it's the same but this
trace<00:02:12.850> is<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> lot<00:02:13.300> more<00:02:13.510> meat<00:02:13.780> in<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:14.020> than<00:02:14.200> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
trace is a lot more meat in it than that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.990 
trace is a lot more meat in it than that
original<00:02:14.920> one<00:02:15.040> would<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.700> I'm<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.940> to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
original one would have so I'm going to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.790 
original one would have so I'm going to
do<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.510> hopefully<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.140> reset<00:02:17.770> all

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
do that and hopefully and reset all

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.380 
do that and hopefully and reset all
these<00:02:18.010> coats<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.430> cold<00:02:18.730> solder<00:02:18.970> joints<00:02:19.270> and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
these coats so cold solder joints and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.580 
these coats so cold solder joints and
hopefully<00:02:19.630> it'll<00:02:19.720> take<00:02:19.930> care<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.170> my<00:02:20.230> problem

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
hopefully it'll take care of my problem

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.340 
hopefully it'll take care of my problem
good<00:02:20.860> luck<00:02:21.010> with<00:02:21.160> yours
