in<00:00:01.889> this<00:00:02.889> movie<00:00:03.280> the<00:00:03.520> third<00:00:03.970> of<00:00:04.240> the

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.330 
in this movie the third of the

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.240 
in this movie the third of the
special-effects<00:00:04.960> camera<00:00:05.439> movement<00:00:05.830> we've

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
special-effects camera movement we've

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.520 
special-effects camera movement we've
set<00:00:06.460> up<00:00:06.490> our<00:00:06.670> scene<00:00:07.059> to<00:00:07.389> play<00:00:07.720> nice<00:00:08.080> with<00:00:08.380> the

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
set up our scene to play nice with the

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.079 
set up our scene to play nice with the
camera<00:00:08.920> and<00:00:09.099> we<00:00:09.190> actually<00:00:09.370> move<00:00:09.790> it<00:00:09.910> through

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:10.089 
camera and we actually move it through

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.959 
camera and we actually move it through
the<00:00:10.150> scene<00:00:10.509> we've<00:00:11.290> also<00:00:11.589> set<00:00:12.219> up<00:00:12.249> the<00:00:12.429> object

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
the scene we've also set up the object

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.810 
the scene we've also set up the object
so<00:00:13.179> that<00:00:13.209> they<00:00:13.929> have<00:00:14.309> rotational<00:00:15.309> behaviors

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
so that they have rotational behaviors

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.310 
so that they have rotational behaviors
to<00:00:16.030> point<00:00:16.299> out<00:00:16.390> the<00:00:16.510> camera<00:00:16.690> so<00:00:16.990> we<00:00:17.080> can't

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
to point out the camera so we can't

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.750 
to point out the camera so we can't
really<00:00:17.410> tell<00:00:17.890> they're<00:00:18.190> two-dimensional

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
really tell they're two-dimensional

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.820 
really tell they're two-dimensional
objects<00:00:19.150> we'll<00:00:20.020> need<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:20.320> do<00:00:20.470> that<00:00:20.620> and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
objects we'll need to do that and

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.230 
objects we'll need to do that and
double-check<00:00:21.250> that<00:00:21.400> that's<00:00:21.580> the<00:00:21.820> case<00:00:22.000> with

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
double-check that that's the case with

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.420 
double-check that that's the case with
Windsor<00:00:22.690> I'll<00:00:23.260> open<00:00:23.530> the<00:00:23.620> layer<00:00:23.650> options<00:00:24.280> and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
Windsor I'll open the layer options and

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.190 
Windsor I'll open the layer options and
we<00:00:24.520> see<00:00:24.730> that<00:00:24.910> he<00:00:25.150> too<00:00:25.510> has<00:00:25.720> been<00:00:25.870> set<00:00:26.080> up<00:00:26.110> to

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
we see that he too has been set up to

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.830 
we see that he too has been set up to
rotate<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:26.890> face<00:00:27.100> the<00:00:27.400> camera<00:00:27.850> now<00:00:28.540> winter<00:00:28.810> has

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
rotate to face the camera now winter has

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.840 
rotate to face the camera now winter has
his<00:00:29.140> own<00:00:29.380> animations<00:00:30.100> and<00:00:30.310> before<00:00:30.580> we<00:00:30.730> get

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
his own animations and before we get

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.310 
his own animations and before we get
into<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.180> camera<00:00:31.540> move<00:00:31.690> when<00:00:31.840> I<00:00:31.930> did<00:00:32.110> want<00:00:32.290> to

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
into the camera move when I did want to

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.259 
into the camera move when I did want to
point<00:00:32.559> out<00:00:32.739> something<00:00:33.070> it's<00:00:33.940> a<00:00:34.030> little

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
point out something it's a little

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:35.099 
point out something it's a little
different<00:00:34.510> than<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.839> way<00:00:34.960> we've<00:00:35.079> been

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:35.109 
different than the way we've been

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:36.959 
different than the way we've been
setting<00:00:35.440> up<00:00:35.559> scenes<00:00:35.859> typically<00:00:36.550> we'll<00:00:36.699> set<00:00:36.879> up

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
setting up scenes typically we'll set up

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.840 
setting up scenes typically we'll set up
everything<00:00:37.449> on<00:00:37.570> frame<00:00:37.989> zero<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.760> the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
everything on frame zero one of the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.250 
everything on frame zero one of the
reasons<00:00:40.149> we're<00:00:40.300> not<00:00:40.329> doing<00:00:40.629> that<00:00:40.719> now<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.079> that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
reasons we're not doing that now is that

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.869 
reasons we're not doing that now is that
happens<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.769> be<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:41.980> course<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.489> rigging

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
happens to be of course the rigging

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.479 
happens to be of course the rigging
frame<00:00:43.210> where<00:00:43.839> Windsor<00:00:44.260> is<00:00:44.440> exploded<00:00:45.370> across

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
frame where Windsor is exploded across

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.149 
frame where Windsor is exploded across
the<00:00:45.999> scene<00:00:46.269> and<00:00:46.569> so<00:00:47.230> it's<00:00:47.379> easier<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.739> set<00:00:48.039> up

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
the scene and so it's easier to set up

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.189 
the scene and so it's easier to set up
some<00:00:48.339> of<00:00:48.370> this<00:00:48.609> and<00:00:48.819> get<00:00:48.879> it<00:00:48.940> queued<00:00:49.809> into

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
some of this and get it queued into

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.130 
some of this and get it queued into
three-dimensional<00:00:50.649> space<00:00:51.399> on<00:00:51.789> frame<00:00:52.420> one<00:00:52.809> and

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
three-dimensional space on frame one and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.169 
three-dimensional space on frame one and
then<00:00:53.649> animate<00:00:54.069> from<00:00:54.190> that<00:00:54.399> point<00:00:54.640> forward

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
then animate from that point forward

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.299 
then animate from that point forward
in<00:00:55.659> fact<00:00:56.019> our<00:00:56.229> animation<00:00:56.649> is<00:00:56.769> probably<00:00:57.129> going

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
in fact our animation is probably going

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.910 
in fact our animation is probably going
to<00:00:57.399> go<00:00:57.579> beyond<00:00:57.879> 72<00:00:58.420> frames<00:00:58.719> we'll<00:00:59.079> have<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.499> go

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
to go beyond 72 frames we'll have it go

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.459 
to go beyond 72 frames we'll have it go
up<00:00:59.949> to<00:01:00.370> 90<00:01:00.699> frames<00:01:00.999> the<00:01:01.690> idea<00:01:01.989> here<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.440> that

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
up to 90 frames the idea here is that

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:03.779 
up to 90 frames the idea here is that
we're<00:01:02.649> going<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:02.859> have<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.159> camera<00:01:03.550> further

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
we're going to have the camera further

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.520 
we're going to have the camera further
away<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.690> will<00:01:04.870> do<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.019> little<00:01:05.260> bit<00:01:05.379> of<00:01:05.470> a

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
away it will do a little bit of a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.100 
away it will do a little bit of a
dramatic<00:01:06.009> zoom<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.820> we'll<00:01:07.450> also<00:01:07.630> have<00:01:07.960> it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
dramatic zoom in we'll also have it

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.289 
dramatic zoom in we'll also have it
shift<00:01:08.409> left<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:09.250> right<00:01:09.460> so<00:01:09.790> we<00:01:09.939> get<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.119> little

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
shift left to right so we get a little

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.149 
shift left to right so we get a little
bit<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.780> difference<00:01:11.710> in<00:01:11.829> what's<00:01:11.979> called

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
bit of difference in what's called

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.850 
bit of difference in what's called
parallax<00:01:12.850> or<00:01:13.240> perspective<00:01:14.049> between<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
parallax or perspective between the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.080 
parallax or perspective between the
objects<00:01:15.219> in<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.340> background<00:01:15.460> moving

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
objects in the background moving

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.609 
objects in the background moving
slightly<00:01:16.360> different<00:01:16.990> that<00:01:17.110> just<00:01:17.320> help<00:01:17.500> the

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
slightly different that just help the

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.130 
slightly different that just help the
viewers<00:01:18.070> cue<00:01:18.490> into<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.030> fact<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.570> this<00:01:19.960> is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
viewers cue into the fact that this is

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.469 
viewers cue into the fact that this is
actually<00:01:20.469> a<00:01:20.500> three-dimensional<00:01:20.890> space<00:01:21.549> so<00:01:22.060> on

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
actually a three-dimensional space so on

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.959 
actually a three-dimensional space so on
frame<00:01:22.960> 1<00:01:23.469> right<00:01:24.039> here<00:01:24.070> we'll<00:01:24.549> go<00:01:24.670> ahead<00:01:24.820> and

for<00:01:40.659> over<00:01:41.320> here<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:42.210> should<00:01:43.210> say<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.570> track

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930

it<00:02:41.560> rests<00:02:42.099> there<00:02:42.609> and<00:02:43.510> then<00:02:43.810> what<00:02:43.959> I'll<00:02:44.049> do<00:02:44.230> is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
it rests there and then what I'll do is

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.520 
it rests there and then what I'll do is
have<00:02:44.590> very<00:02:45.069> very<00:02:45.760> slow<00:02:46.299> motion<00:02:46.870> over<00:02:47.019> here<00:02:47.319> all

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
have very very slow motion over here all

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.490 
have very very slow motion over here all
the<00:02:47.739> way<00:02:47.889> on<00:02:48.189> frame<00:02:48.730> 90<00:02:51.510> what<00:02:52.510> I'll<00:02:52.629> do<00:02:52.840> is<00:02:53.169> go

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
the way on frame 90 what I'll do is go

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.550 
the way on frame 90 what I'll do is go
ahead<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:54.389> hand<00:02:55.389> the<00:02:55.629> camera<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.319> little

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
ahead and hand the camera just a little

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.330 
ahead and hand the camera just a little
bit<00:02:56.680> more<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.400> now<00:03:00.549> as<00:03:00.639> we<00:03:00.790> scrub<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.239> timeline

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
bit more so now as we scrub the timeline

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.479 
bit more so now as we scrub the timeline
that's<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.519> very<00:03:03.790> subtle<00:03:04.329> shift<00:03:08.189> but<00:03:09.189> what<00:03:09.340> this

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
that's a very subtle shift but what this

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.050 
that's a very subtle shift but what this
will<00:03:09.639> allow<00:03:09.879> us<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.569> from<00:03:11.139> frame<00:03:11.980> 42<00:03:12.459> on<00:03:12.700> and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
will allow us to do from frame 42 on and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.849 
will allow us to do from frame 42 on and
let's<00:03:13.180> scroll<00:03:13.450> down<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:13.840> our<00:03:13.959> timeline<00:03:14.260> just<00:03:14.769> a

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.890 
let's scroll down on our timeline just a
little<00:03:15.069> bit<00:03:15.189> you<00:03:15.939> see<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.180> keyframes<00:03:16.450> are

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
amplitude to be very great so i'm going

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.509 
amplitude to be very great so i'm going
to<00:03:42.400> put<00:03:42.819> it<00:03:42.909> down<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.329> 0.5<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.560> scale<00:03:44.949> of<00:03:45.280> this

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519

I<00:03:45.790> want<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.090> be<00:03:46.180> something<00:03:46.780> more<00:03:46.959> like<00:03:47.199> 1

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
I want to be something more like 1

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.449 
I want to be something more like 1

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.219 
see now that we get just a little bit
extra<00:03:55.000> motion<00:03:55.389> in<00:03:55.659> there<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:55.989> may

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
extra motion in there and that may

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.770 
extra motion in there and that may
actually<00:03:56.530> be<00:03:57.009> too<00:03:57.280> much<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:58.269> let<00:03:58.419> me<00:03:58.540> come<00:03:58.750> back

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
actually be too much so let me come back

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.210 
actually be too much so let me come back
and<00:03:59.229> one<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.470> reasons<00:03:59.709> is<00:03:59.769> because<00:03:59.799> it's

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
and one of the reasons is because it's

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.059 
and one of the reasons is because it's
so<00:04:00.519> close<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.540> character<00:04:02.169> come<00:04:02.739> down<00:04:02.889> to

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
so close to the character come down to

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.420 
so close to the character come down to
noisy<00:04:04.379> I'm<00:04:05.379> going<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.709> change<00:04:05.949> this<00:04:06.040> instead

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
noisy I'm going to change this instead

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.589 
noisy I'm going to change this instead
of<00:04:06.549> 0.5<00:04:07.139> to<00:04:08.139> 0.2<00:04:08.949> and<00:04:09.189> make<00:04:09.669> it<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:10.030> little<00:04:10.299> less

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
of 0.5 to 0.2 and make it a little less

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.249 
of 0.5 to 0.2 and make it a little less

movement<00:04:20.629> around<00:04:20.810> here<00:04:21.229> we<00:04:21.829> could<00:04:21.949> add<00:04:22.099> sound

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
movement around here we could add sound

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.309 
movement around here we could add sound
effects<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.819> that<00:04:22.849> the<00:04:23.599> last<00:04:23.810> level<00:04:24.110> step

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:24.319 
effects to that the last level step

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.900 
effects to that the last level step
we'll<00:04:24.440> want<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.800> do<00:04:25.009> is<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.370> actually<00:04:25.520> come

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
got a keyframe out at frame 90 right now

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.240 
got a keyframe out at frame 90 right now
until<00:04:31.909> the<00:04:32.000> project<00:04:32.419> settings<00:04:32.690> here<00:04:33.099> we'll<00:04:34.099> go

until the project settings here we'll go

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.040 
until the project settings here we'll go
ahead<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.729> say<00:04:35.000> let's<00:04:35.300> do<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.539> entire

frame of 90 the other thing I want to do

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.710 
frame of 90 the other thing I want to do
is<00:04:41.509> engage<00:04:41.690> depth<00:04:42.590> of<00:04:42.800> field<00:04:43.159> now<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.389> is

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
is engage depth of field now this is

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.540 
is engage depth of field now this is
going<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.050> give<00:04:45.169> us<00:04:45.289> some<00:04:45.470> fake<00:04:45.800> camera

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
going to give us some fake camera

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.149 
going to give us some fake camera
blurring<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.629> way<00:04:47.810> or<00:04:48.199> as<00:04:48.590> things<00:04:48.949> get

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
blurring the way or as things get

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.210

further<00:04:49.430> away<00:04:49.849> from<00:04:49.879> the<00:04:50.419> camera<00:04:50.599> itself<00:04:51.220> the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
further away from the camera itself the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.969 
further away from the camera itself the
focus<00:04:52.580> distance<00:04:52.819> is<00:04:53.270> within<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.750> value<00:04:54.259> of<00:04:54.500> two

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
focus distance is within a value of two

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.800 
focus distance is within a value of two
in<00:04:55.340> your<00:04:55.610> scene<00:04:55.909> and<00:04:55.940> I'm<00:04:56.240> actually<00:04:56.449> going<00:04:56.690> to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
in your scene and I'm actually going to

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.710 
in your scene and I'm actually going to
want<00:04:57.020> a<00:04:57.139> focus<00:04:57.800> range<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:58.940> two<00:04:59.270> as<00:04:59.449> well<00:04:59.690> I

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
want a focus range of two as well I

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.080 
want a focus range of two as well I
don't<00:05:00.139> want<00:05:00.319> our<00:05:00.680> main<00:05:01.009> character<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.729> blur

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
don't want our main character to blur

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.990 
don't want our main character to blur
out<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.620> give<00:05:03.770> that<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:03.949> value<00:05:04.310> of<00:05:04.430> two<00:05:04.729> and

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
out so I give that a value of two and

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.309 
out so I give that a value of two and
then<00:05:05.060> I'm<00:05:05.180> going<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.389> reduce<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.110> maximum

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
then I'm going to reduce the maximum

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.980 
then I'm going to reduce the maximum
blur<00:05:06.860> something<00:05:07.400> not<00:05:08.000> quite<00:05:08.300> so<00:05:08.509> aggressive

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
blur something not quite so aggressive

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.779 
blur something not quite so aggressive
as<00:05:09.110> 12<00:05:09.440> I'm<00:05:09.590> going<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.860> go<00:05:09.949> ahead<00:05:10.069> and<00:05:10.370> put<00:05:10.639> that

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
as 12 I'm going to go ahead and put that

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.689 
as 12 I'm going to go ahead and put that
at<00:05:10.969> 3<00:05:11.389> and<00:05:11.659> select<00:05:12.349> okay<00:05:12.770> now<00:05:13.039> nothing<00:05:13.580> has

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
at 3 and select okay now nothing has

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.850 
at 3 and select okay now nothing has
changed<00:05:14.180> here<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.630> that's<00:05:14.840> because<00:05:15.319> this<00:05:15.620> is

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
changed here and that's because this is

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.399 
changed here and that's because this is
a<00:05:15.889> rendered<00:05:16.610> effect<00:05:17.120> so<00:05:17.780> from<00:05:18.020> this<00:05:18.139> point

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
a rendered effect so from this point

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:19.899 
a rendered effect so from this point
right<00:05:18.620> here<00:05:18.680> I'm<00:05:19.159> going<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.400> go<00:05:19.520> ahead<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.819> do

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
right here I'm going to go ahead and do

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.580 
right here I'm going to go ahead and do
a<00:05:19.940> quick<00:05:20.120> render<00:05:22.419> we<00:05:23.419> see<00:05:23.630> our<00:05:23.750> character<00:05:24.349> in

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
a quick render we see our character in

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.670 
a quick render we see our character in
perfect<00:05:25.099> crisp<00:05:25.610> focus<00:05:26.270> we<00:05:26.930> see<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.319> objects

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
perfect crisp focus we see the objects

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.200 
perfect crisp focus we see the objects
in<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.860> background<00:05:28.039> get<00:05:28.759> a<00:05:28.789> little<00:05:29.060> more

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
in the background get a little more

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.939 
in the background get a little more
blurry<00:05:29.630> as<00:05:29.930> they<00:05:30.080> move<00:05:30.259> further<00:05:30.469> away<00:05:30.680> and

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
blurry as they move further away and

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:31.870 
blurry as they move further away and
that's<00:05:31.099> perfect

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
that's perfect

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.180 
that's perfect
the<00:05:32.479> next<00:05:32.750> thing<00:05:32.930> then<00:05:33.110> is<00:05:33.259> to<00:05:33.409> go<00:05:33.530> ahead<00:05:33.650> and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
the next thing then is to go ahead and

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.399 
the next thing then is to go ahead and
render<00:05:34.699> out<00:05:35.029> our<00:05:35.240> scene<00:05:35.539> and<00:05:35.569> see<00:05:36.050> how<00:05:36.199> this

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
render out our scene and see how this

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.930 
render out our scene and see how this
looks

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
looks

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.360

movement<00:05:52.520> folder<00:05:52.969> right<00:05:53.150> here<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:53.599> you<00:05:53.690> can

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
movement folder right here so you can

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.950 
movement folder right here so you can
view<00:05:54.050> that<00:05:54.110> if<00:05:54.380> you<00:05:54.469> want<00:05:55.630> we<00:05:56.630> use<00:05:56.779> the

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
view that if you want we use the

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.930 
view that if you want we use the
animation<00:05:57.319> codec<00:05:57.979> because<00:05:58.430> it's<00:05:58.610> the<00:05:58.729> most

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
animation codec because it's the most

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.659 
animation codec because it's the most
efficient<00:05:59.509> for<00:05:59.690> areas<00:06:00.020> of<00:06:00.199> flat<00:06:00.500> color<00:06:00.860> I'll

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
efficient for areas of flat color I'll

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:02.920 
efficient for areas of flat color I'll
go<00:06:01.759> ahead<00:06:01.849> and<00:06:02.029> leave<00:06:02.150> that<00:06:02.180> right<00:06:02.509> there<00:06:02.750> and
