00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
for the superbowl both Super Bowls that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.810 
for the superbowl both Super Bowls that
is<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.530> you<00:00:34.530> guys<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> play<00:00:35.250> duplicates<00:00:35.730> on

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
is as you guys see I play duplicates on

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.490 
is as you guys see I play duplicates on
my<00:00:35.910> offensive<00:00:36.239> line<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.570> can't<00:00:36.690> even<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:37.230> in

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
my offensive line I can't even like in

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.100 
my offensive line I can't even like in
front<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.390> don't<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:39.780> people<00:00:40.020> play

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
front I don't like when people play

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.360 
front I don't like when people play
duplicates<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.860> guess<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.340> little

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
duplicates so I guess it's a little

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.770 
duplicates so I guess it's a little
hypocritical<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:42.270> when<00:00:42.420> they're<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
hypocritical but when they're on the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260 
hypocritical but when they're on the
offensive<00:00:43.170> line<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
offensive line I don't really think it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.720 
offensive line I don't really think it
matters<00:00:45.379> but<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.710> our<00:00:46.860> own<00:00:47.010> opinions

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
matters but we all have our own opinions

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
matters but we all have our own opinions
and<00:00:48.110> I<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.230> feeling<00:00:49.620> really<00:00:49.770> good<00:00:49.980> this
