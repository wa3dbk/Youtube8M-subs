00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.200 
started aging they developed a lot of
rattles<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.299> squeaks<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:04.030> when

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
rattles and squeaks and that's when

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.170 
rattles and squeaks and that's when
these<00:02:04.360> cars<00:02:04.630> would<00:02:04.780> come<00:02:04.930> up<00:02:05.049> for<00:02:05.259> sale<00:02:05.439> rather

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
these cars would come up for sale rather

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.389 
these cars would come up for sale rather
inexpensively<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:08.049> was<00:02:08.200> wondering<00:02:08.679> if<00:02:08.830> in

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
inexpensively and I was wondering if in

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.610 
inexpensively and I was wondering if in
the<00:02:09.909> process<00:02:09.939> of<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.659> restoration<00:02:11.110> work<00:02:11.470> if

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
the process of the restoration work if

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.709 
the process of the restoration work if
they<00:02:11.830> managed<00:02:12.609> to<00:02:12.639> take<00:02:12.909> all<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.209> squeaks<00:02:13.540> and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
they managed to take all the squeaks and

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.199 
they managed to take all the squeaks and
rattles<00:02:13.870> out<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.409> this<00:02:14.529> they<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.819> think<00:02:15.939> they

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
rattles out of this they I think they

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.970 
rattles out of this they I think they
got<00:02:16.389> most<00:02:16.629> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
got most of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.800 
got most of
out<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.310> when<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:17.550> got<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.060> had<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.360> kind<00:02:18.690> of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
out but when I got it I had to kind of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.330 
out but when I got it I had to kind of
fine<00:02:19.019> tune<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.409> there<00:02:19.709> were<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> few<00:02:20.069> things

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
fine tune it there were a few things

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.210 
fine tune it there were a few things
that<00:02:20.610> were<00:02:21.299> were<00:02:21.780> rattling<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.799> just<00:02:22.980> kind<00:02:23.159> of

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
that were were rattling and just kind of

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.149
