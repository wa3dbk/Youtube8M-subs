00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.099
 chapter 1 at the beginning we were 9 we 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.400
 we went when we were small almost 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.010
 too small to remember almost 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.690
 they told me the earth trembled and the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.260
 heavens were filled with lights and 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.510
 explosions we were in that period of 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.970
 two weeks a year in which both moons 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.760
 they are at opposite ends of the horizon 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.070
 it was a time of celebration and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.290
 beginning the explosions will 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.460
 they interpreted as fireworks 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.250
 but it was not like that it was warm from the sea 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.830
 came a gentle wind always 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.710
 mention the weather it was hot there was a 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.159
 soft wind I've never been able to understand 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.350
 why this is important the memory 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.110
 most alive that I have of that day is the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.869
 image of my grandmother was frantic and 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.010
 also sad there were tears in their 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.100
 eyes 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.220
 my grandfather was at his side I remember as 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.310
 his glasses picked up the light from heaven there was 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.130
 hugs words spoken by each of 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.250
 they 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.549
 I do not remember what words and there is nothing 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.340
 that obsesses me more took a year in 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.250
 get here I was five years old when 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.259
 we arrived we had to integrate to the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.840
 culture of this planet before 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.390
 return to our lorient when this one 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.670
 I could go to the support life 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.979
 nine we had to separate and look 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.679
 our own way 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.829
 nobody knew for how long and we continue 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.470
 unknowingly none of the others knows 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.170
 where I am and I do not know where they are 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.080
 or how they are now is our way of 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.170
 protect us thanks to the conjured spell 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.360
 when we went a success that guarantees 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.610
 They can only kill us according to the order 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.310
 of our numbers as long as 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.209
 let's stay separate if we meet 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.730
 the spell breaks when they find and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.890
 they kill one of us a scar 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.890
 circular closes around the ankle 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.349
 right of those who are still alive and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.329
 in the left ankle formed from the 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.880
 moment in which success was conjured up 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.550
 Orient we have a small scar 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.880
 the amulet that we all wear around our necks 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.850
 the circular scars are another part 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.130
 of the spell an alarm system for 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.710
 that we know what happened to the others 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.440
 and therefore when our 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.020
 turn the first scar appeared 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.120
 When I was nine years old, I got 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.030
 I dream of burning myself in my card 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.730
 We lived in Arizona in a little town 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.490
 border near mexico I woke up 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.410
 screaming in the middle of the night desperate for 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.110
 the pain terrified to see how the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.020
 scar marked me the meat was the 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.460
 first sign that the Mogadorians 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.860
 finally they had found us in the 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.230
 earth the first sign that we were 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.810
 in danger until the appearance of the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.180
 sign had almost managed to convince me of 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.550
 that my memories were wrong about what 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.310
 that rime had told was not true 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.280
 I wanted to be a common kid who lived a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.530
 normal life but in that moment I knew more 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.590
 beyond any doubt or discussion that 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.090
 it was not the next day we moved to 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.459
 Minnesota 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.790
 the second scar appeared when 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.940
 I was 12 years old I was at school in 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.760
 Colorado in a spelling bee in 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.739
 when I started to feel the pain I knew what 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.099
 what was happening to him 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.769
 past 2 the pain was frightening but 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.260
 this time bearable I could have 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.930
 stay on stage but the heat 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.910
 I burned the sock the teacher who 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.310
 he was running the contest he bathed me with the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.519
 fire extinguisher and it took me to all 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.140
 hurry to the hospital the doctor of the ward 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.079
 of emergencies found the first 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.660
 scar and called the police when 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.299
 he arrived in King threatened to arrest him 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.100
 for child abuse but as no 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.620
 It was near at the moment when 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.530
 appeared the second scar they had 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.280
 to let him go free we got on 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.660
 car and we left this time to mayne 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.210
 we left everything we had 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.240
 - the lorient chest I know that in ree load 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.330
 I get all 21 removals 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.180
 changes that we have lived to date 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.000
 the third scar appeared a 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.400
 hour was sitting on the ship of the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.469
 parents of the most popular school boy 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.199
 that he organized a party there without his 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:57.259
 consent to me I had never been 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.389
 invited to the school parties as 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.490
 they knew we would have to leave in 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.219
 any time I had always had 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.770
 kept on the sidelines but the thing had 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:08.900
 been quiet for two years 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.819
 henrry had not seen in the news 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.310
 nothing that could lead to 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:16.310
 mogadorianos towards any of us or 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.860
 that warned us about his presence 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.900
 so I made a couple of friends and one of 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.569
 they introduced me to the host of the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.599
 party we are all in the 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.250
 dock there were three coolers a bit 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.169
 of music and girls who had 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.300
 admired from afar but with those who do not 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.879
 I had never spoken even when I wanted to 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.789
 do it we leave the dock and we 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.699
 we enter about 800 meters into the gulf 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.770
 of mexico was sitting with a girl 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.830
 very pretty with dark hair and blue eyes 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.230
 call for when simplicity 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.150
 the water started to boil around me 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.130
 leg and the bottom began to 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.310
 shine where it was getting worse the 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:58.220
 scar the third symbol of lorient the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.170
 third face ad began to scream and 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.110
 they all started to crowd me 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.930
 around I knew I did not have how 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.810
 explain it and I knew we would have to 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.660
 leave immediately now there was 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.120
 much more at stake had I found 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.800
 three wherever he or she was 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.230
 and he had died 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.360
 so that reassure tara I gave her a 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.490
 kiss on the cheek I told him there was 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.190
 It was a pleasure to meet you and what I expected 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.440
 I had a long and beautiful life 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.110
 I dived down the side of the boat and started 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.330
 to swim as fast as possible below 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.460
 of water all the time except once 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.580
 I went to take a breath halfway 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.980
 until I reached the shore after I ran 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.870
 on the side of the road right by the 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.560
 boundary of the forest at the same speed 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.510
 of the cars when I got home I found 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.550
 henry in the bank of scanners and 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.080
 monitors that he used to investigate the 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.780
 news from the whole world 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.120
 and policing the area 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.370
 He knew without saying a word but 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.610
 I still wore my pants soaked 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:05.479
 to see the scars at the beginning 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:09.139
 we were a group of 93 have gone are 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:11.770
 others dead persecute us and not 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:15.560
 they will stop until they have killed us all 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:18.219
 I'm number four and I know I'm the 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.219
 following
