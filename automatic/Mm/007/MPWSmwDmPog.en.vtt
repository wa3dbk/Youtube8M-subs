raise the sleeve one of the things I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
raise the sleeve one of the things I
like<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.219> recommend<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.480> furrow<00:00:33.750> your

like to recommend when you furrow your

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.850 
like to recommend when you furrow your
your<00:00:34.530> head<00:00:34.710> sail<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.399> good<00:00:35.579> idea<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
your head sail it's a good idea to use a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.490 
your head sail it's a good idea to use a
short<00:00:37.860> length<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.640> line<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.860> to<00:00:40.860> secure<00:00:42.500> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
short length of line and to secure the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.430 
short length of line and to secure the
clew<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> sail<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
clew of the sail and you don't have to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
clew of the sail and you don't have to
do<00:00:46.559> anything<00:00:46.800> fancy<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.700> regular<00:00:48.239> square

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
do anything fancy here a regular square

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
do anything fancy here a regular square
knot<00:00:48.960> will<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> job<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.340> want<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
knot will do the job we just want to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.479 
knot will do the job we just want to
make<00:00:51.030> sure<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.309> sail<00:00:53.850> doesn't<00:00:54.480> unfurl

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
make sure that the sail doesn't unfurl

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.220 
make sure that the sail doesn't unfurl
and<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.820> course<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> sleeve<00:00:57.510> helps<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> keep

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and of course the sleeve helps to keep

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.750 
and of course the sleeve helps to keep
that<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.710> happening<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
that from happening but I think it's a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.090 
that from happening but I think it's a
good<00:00:59.910> safety<00:01:00.210> measure<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.649> other<00:01:01.770> thing<00:01:01.980> we

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
good safety measure the other thing we

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
good safety measure the other thing we
do<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> sheets<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.539> our<00:01:03.629> Genoa

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
do is we have the sheets to our Genoa

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.429 
do is we have the sheets to our Genoa
here<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.299> we're<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.720> bring<00:01:06.930> those<00:01:07.170> out

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
here and we're going to bring those out

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
here and we're going to bring those out
of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> sleeve<00:01:08.270> either<00:01:09.270> at<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> separation

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of the sleeve either at a separation

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.440 
of the sleeve either at a separation
point<00:01:10.710> between<00:01:10.920> zippers<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> bottom

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
point between zippers or at the bottom

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.110 
point between zippers or at the bottom
of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> sleeve<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.500> basically<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
of the sleeve so basically all there is

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.210 
of the sleeve so basically all there is
to<00:01:16.690> our<00:01:16.810> sleeve<00:01:17.080> is<00:01:17.290> determining<00:01:17.860> which<00:01:17.980> way

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
to our sleeve is determining which way

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.070 
to our sleeve is determining which way
it<00:01:18.370> goes<00:01:18.610> up<00:01:18.910> and<00:01:19.300> that's<00:01:19.390> going<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.690> be<00:01:19.870> based

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
it goes up and that's going to be based

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.780 
it goes up and that's going to be based
on<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:21.550> zippers<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:22.870> we<00:01:23.170> need<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.440> unzip<00:01:23.790> all

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
on the zippers and we need to unzip all

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.680 
on the zippers and we need to unzip all
of<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.210> zippers

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690
