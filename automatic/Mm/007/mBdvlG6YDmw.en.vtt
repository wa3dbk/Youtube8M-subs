 achieve repeat what happened in 1962 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.140
 I am 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.200
 public statements about mercury

 pooled between football society 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.539
 and the government could think of 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.450
 organize global although at the same time 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.700
 he warned that there would be a lot of work

 deal with the emergence of this idea

 really chile would be in a position 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.200
 to be the headquarters of something like this 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.020

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.290
 the Brazilian government destination near 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.120
 5,700 million dollars only in works 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.430

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 invest in road infrastructure 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.740
 logistics and security

 delegations and fans if it is for the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.000
 figures it seems that the idea is somewhat 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.800

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.930
 have to say that all the countries that have 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.030

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.880
 seen an increase in its internal product 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.280
 gross for advertising tourism concept 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.200
 and other economic benefits that

 get by organizing the world cup 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.030
 in the same way you will have chile in the future 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.370
 the basic needs of their 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.550
 Resolute inhabitants to spend 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.739
