fourth and sixth fret and the seventh
and<00:01:38.080> ninth<00:01:38.399> but<00:01:39.399> I<00:01:39.430> think<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:39.789> down<00:01:40.270> below

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
and ninth but I think in down below

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.480 
and ninth but I think in down below
where<00:01:40.899> I<00:01:40.930> have<00:01:41.110> all<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.289> information<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:41.979> just

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
where I have all the information I just

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.130 
where I have all the information I just
call<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.850> second<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.479> fourth<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:43.960> the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
call the second the fourth and the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.590 
call the second the fourth and the
seventh<00:01:44.440> frets<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.890> make<00:01:45.009> it<00:01:45.130> easier<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:46.270> the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
seventh frets to make it easier and the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.850 
seventh frets to make it easier and the
last<00:01:46.780> chord<00:01:47.049> you're<00:01:47.170> going<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.350> be<00:01:47.409> needing<00:01:47.680> is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
last chord you're going to be needing is

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.480 
last chord you're going to be needing is
an<00:01:48.220> ESS<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.690> for<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.440> verse<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.860> you're<00:01:51.220> only

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
an ESS so for the verse is you're only

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.980 
an ESS so for the verse is you're only
going<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:51.970> be<00:01:52.030> switching<00:01:52.479> back<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:52.780> forth

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
going to be switching back and forth

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.680 
going to be switching back and forth
between<00:01:53.259> E<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:53.710> ISA<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.270> easiest<00:01:55.479> way<00:01:55.600> to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
between E and ISA so the easiest way to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.249 
between E and ISA so the easiest way to
do<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:55.899> is<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:57.159> make<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.360> e<00:01:58.390> chord<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.140> then

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
do that is to make the e chord and then

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.139 
do that is to make the e chord and then
just<00:01:59.950> pick<00:02:00.159> up<00:02:00.190> your<00:02:00.310> middle<00:02:00.640> finger<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.090> put

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
just pick up your middle finger and put

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.490 
just pick up your middle finger and put
your<00:02:01.390> pinkie<00:02:01.720> down<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.229> can<00:02:02.350> keep<00:02:02.440> your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
your pinkie down and you can keep your

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.660 
your pinkie down and you can keep your
pointer<00:02:02.860> finger<00:02:03.130> right<00:02:03.280> there<00:02:03.310> because

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
pointer finger right there because

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.669 
pointer finger right there because
there's<00:02:04.300> another<00:02:04.659> finger<00:02:05.110> on<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.380> string

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
there's another finger on that string

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.800 
there's another finger on that string
now<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.729> won't<00:02:06.940> really<00:02:07.149> be<00:02:07.270> getting<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
now so it won't really be getting in the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.570 
now so it won't really be getting in the
way<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.410> strumming<00:02:08.769> pattern<00:02:08.800> is<00:02:09.190> just<00:02:09.369> down

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
way the strumming pattern is just down

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.460 
way the strumming pattern is just down
down<00:02:09.850> up<00:02:09.880> up<00:02:10.239> down<00:02:10.299> up<00:02:10.479> down<00:02:10.750> down<00:02:10.810> up<00:02:11.080> up<00:02:11.410> down

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.559 
down up up down up down down up up down
and<00:02:12.190> I'm<00:02:12.280> not<00:02:12.459> sure<00:02:12.700> exactly<00:02:12.790> how<00:02:13.180> many<00:02:13.360> times

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
and I'm not sure exactly how many times

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.090 
and I'm not sure exactly how many times
you<00:02:13.720> play<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.989> on<00:02:14.019> each<00:02:14.200> chord<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:14.739> kind<00:02:14.980> of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
you play it on each chord it's kind of

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.550 
you play it on each chord it's kind of
up<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.610> but<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.000> go<00:02:16.209> through<00:02:16.510> each<00:02:16.750> chord

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
up to you but I go through each chord

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.000 
up to you but I go through each chord
twice<00:02:17.799> so<00:02:18.220> ii<00:02:18.640> ii<00:02:19.269> ii<00:02:19.420> ii<00:02:19.720> ii<00:02:20.140> sus<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.920> that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
twice so ii ii ii ii ii sus and that

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.830 
twice so ii ii ii ii ii sus and that
gets<00:02:21.190> me<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.519> end<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> verses<00:02:22.120> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
gets me to the end of the verses and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.960 
gets me to the end of the verses and
then<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.320> go<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.590> chorus<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.700> can

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
then you go to the chorus so you can

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.910 
then you go to the chorus so you can
kind<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.450> do<00:02:25.570> what<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.750> want<00:02:25.959> in<00:02:26.560> between<00:02:26.890> I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
kind of do what you want in between I

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.710 
kind of do what you want in between I
kind<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.489> dragged<00:02:27.730> out<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:27.940> last<00:02:28.299> chord

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
kind of dragged out the last chord

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.430 
kind of dragged out the last chord
before<00:02:28.959> switching<00:02:29.320> um<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:31.019> when<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.170> start

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
before switching um and when you start

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.300 
before switching um and when you start
playing<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.799> not<00:02:32.950> right<00:02:33.100> at<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.250> beginning

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
playing it's not right at the beginning

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.520 
playing it's not right at the beginning
of<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.609> course<00:02:33.760> it's<00:02:34.000> they<00:02:34.660> say<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:34.900> like<00:02:35.380> her

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
of the course it's they say I like her

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.039 
of the course it's they say I like her
because<00:02:35.590> she's<00:02:35.950> smart<00:02:36.519> when<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.510> say<00:02:37.690> smart

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
because she's smart when you say smart

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.539 
because she's smart when you say smart
that's<00:02:38.410> when<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.769> play<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.040> first<00:02:39.130> chord<00:02:39.280> so

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
that's when you play the first chord so

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.630 
that's when you play the first chord so
the<00:02:39.640> first<00:02:39.820> chord<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.329> going<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:42.430> B

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
the first chord is going to be the B

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.330 
the first chord is going to be the B
power<00:02:43.000> chord<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:44.200> fourth<00:02:44.560> fret<00:02:44.829> then

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
power chord on the fourth fret then

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.830 
power chord on the fourth fret then
you're<00:02:45.459> going<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.609> go<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> second<00:02:46.510> fret

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
you're going to go to the second fret

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.130 
you're going to go to the second fret
and<00:02:47.079> then<00:02:47.829> you're<00:02:48.130> going<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:49.239> e<00:02:49.269> sauce<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:49.989> it's

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
and then you're going to e sauce so it's

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.660 
and then you're going to e sauce so it's
basically<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.590> same<00:02:50.650> thing<00:02:50.799> with<00:02:51.160> -<00:02:51.549> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
basically the same thing with - the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.729 
basically the same thing with - the
pointer<00:02:51.910> finger<00:02:52.079> and<00:02:53.079> then<00:02:53.440> you're<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:53.680> to

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
pointer finger and then you're going to

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.800 
pointer finger and then you're going to
repeat<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.510> forth<00:02:55.709> back<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.970> then

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
repeat that so forth back in and then

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.520 
repeat that so forth back in and then
zero<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.239> time<00:03:01.540> which<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
zero and then this time which is the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.810 
zero and then this time which is the
third<00:03:02.680> time<00:03:02.920> through<00:03:03.160> it's<00:03:03.430> going<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:03.670> get<00:03:03.790> a

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
third time through it's going to get a

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.630 
third time through it's going to get a
little<00:03:04.060> trickier<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.900> you're<00:03:05.079> going<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.260> go

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
little trickier and you're going to go

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.920 
little trickier and you're going to go
from<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.790> fourth<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:07.750> seven<00:03:08.620> second

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
from the fourth to the seven second

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:20.009 
from the fourth to the seven second
and<00:03:11.890> then<00:03:12.700> Jesus<00:03:14.760> second<00:03:16.230> Jesus<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.810> was

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
and then Jesus second Jesus so that was

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.259 
and then Jesus second Jesus so that was
a<00:03:20.049> little<00:03:20.439> quick<00:03:20.709> but<00:03:21.069> you<00:03:21.700> just<00:03:21.909> kind<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.120> have

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
a little quick but you just kind of have

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.910 
a little quick but you just kind of have
to<00:03:22.299> get<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.599> pattern<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.079> your<00:03:23.200> head<00:03:23.379> and<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
to get the pattern in your head and the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.619 
to get the pattern in your head and the
strumming<00:03:24.250> pattern<00:03:24.280> kind<00:03:24.879> of<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.180> goes<00:03:25.390> with

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
strumming pattern kind of just goes with

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.750 
strumming pattern kind of just goes with
it<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.319> use<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.980> same<00:03:27.129> strumming<00:03:27.489> pattern

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
it so I use the same strumming pattern

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.849 
it so I use the same strumming pattern
from<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:28.090> verses<00:03:28.510> which<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:29.200> just<00:03:29.439> down<00:03:29.620> down

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
from the verses which is just down down

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.770 
from the verses which is just down down
up<00:03:29.890> up<00:03:30.159> down<00:03:30.310> up<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.730> basically<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.150> try<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.420> fit

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
up up down up and basically I try to fit

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.390 
up up down up and basically I try to fit
that<00:03:31.900> into<00:03:32.109> each<00:03:32.379> chord<00:03:32.739> as<00:03:32.829> many<00:03:33.040> times<00:03:33.310> as

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
that into each chord as many times as

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.839 
that into each chord as many times as
possible<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:34.480> what<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.840> mean<00:03:35.019> by<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.319> is<00:03:35.849> at

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
possible so what I mean by that is at

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.420 
possible so what I mean by that is at
the<00:03:37.120> beginning<00:03:37.209> it's<00:03:37.720> going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.959> go<00:03:38.129> down<00:03:39.129> down

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
the beginning it's going to go down down

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.640 
the beginning it's going to go down down
up<00:03:39.640> up<00:03:39.849> down<00:03:40.060> up<00:03:40.239> down<00:03:40.269> down<00:03:40.659> up<00:03:40.810> up<00:03:41.140> down<00:03:41.439> up

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
up up down up down down up up down up

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.800 
up up down up down down up up down up
down<00:03:41.680> down<00:03:42.099> up<00:03:42.159> up<00:03:42.489> down<00:03:42.760> up<00:03:42.940> down<00:03:42.970> down<00:03:43.389> up<00:03:43.450> up

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
down down up up down up down down up up

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.539 
down down up up down up down down up up
down<00:03:43.870> up<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.500> then<00:03:44.650> again<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.129> same<00:03:45.310> thing

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
down up and then again the same thing

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.000 
down up and then again the same thing
but<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.299> third<00:03:46.480> time<00:03:46.750> when<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:47.650> up<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
but the third time when you go up to the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.610 
but the third time when you go up to the
seventh<00:03:48.370> fret<00:03:48.940> it's<00:03:49.269> gonna<00:03:49.480> go<00:03:49.720> down<00:03:50.260> down<00:03:50.560> up

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
seventh fret it's gonna go down down up

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.589 
seventh fret it's gonna go down down up
up<00:03:50.950> down<00:03:51.220> up<00:03:51.370> down<00:03:51.400> down<00:03:51.819> up<00:03:51.940> down<00:03:52.090> down<00:03:52.540> up

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
up down up down down up down down up

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.440 
up down up down down up down down up
down<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.379> then<00:03:53.500> continue<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:54.909> you<00:03:54.970> kind<00:03:55.389> of

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
down and then continue so you kind of

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.110
