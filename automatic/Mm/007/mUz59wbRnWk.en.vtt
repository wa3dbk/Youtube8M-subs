 prepared in a proper way 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.710
 let's start with the oats that the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.020
 Oatmeal is very rich in fiber and eating 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.910
 fiber we will feel fuller by 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.860
 much more time there is also very 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.560
 good to stabilize the levels 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.080
 and blood sugar and helps us 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.230
 get rid of all that bad cholesterol 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.780
 that we do not want then we have the eggs 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.030
 the eggs have a high content in 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.160
 protein the protein helps us 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.130
 suppress the appetite and at the same time help us 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.290
 to create muscle or to define muscle if 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.350
 is what we want the eggs too 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.570
 they contain vitamin B-12 vitamin B6 that 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.900
 they have other great benefits for 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.150
 our health and are the nuts the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.520
 nuts contain omega 3 and is 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.340
 proven that people who consume 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.850
 a diet rich in omega 3 have better 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.450
 capabilities to lose the fat of the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.940
 body and drink is caffeine the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.290
 caffeine activates the degradation of 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.009
 fat in the body or practically 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.899
 caffeine what it helps to undo 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.610
 in a certain way all that fat that 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.500
 we have in the body as they could 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.960
 give account is a 3 foods and a 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.140
 As they are very easy to get 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.060
 that I believe are within the reach of 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.430
 possibilities of many in the I killed the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.370
 higher 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.890
 us and that you can implement us in 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.560
 a delicious breakfast for example can 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.400
 be that breakfast is a portion of 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.790
 oatmeal with a little bit of nuts a couple 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.670
 of eggs and a cup of coffee without sugar 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.620
 good idea not that there is double in the want 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.620
 you to triumph or nothing else
