makes<00:00:52.679> cleaning<00:00:52.980> real<00:00:53.909> easy<00:00:55.999> but<00:00:56.999> we<00:00:57.149> also

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
makes cleaning real easy but we also

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.070 
makes cleaning real easy but we also
have<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.879> removable<00:01:00.269> floor<00:01:00.600> now<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.780> reason

for<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.290> removable<00:01:04.650> floor<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.610> go

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
for the removable floor is when you go

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.790 
for the removable floor is when you go
between<00:01:06.180> chickens<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.990> ducks<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.560> that

between chickens and ducks and all that

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.950 
between chickens and ducks and all that
you<00:01:08.729> probably<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> pull<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> floor

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

and<00:01:12.170> clean<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.290> out<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.770> disinfect<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> you're

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and clean it out and disinfect so you're

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
and clean it out and disinfect so you're
not<00:01:15.600> transferring<00:01:16.229> any<00:01:17.130> parasites<00:01:17.700> or

have the easy open door and one nice
thing<00:01:25.050> about<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.340> birds<00:01:27.180> grow

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
thing about this is as the birds grow

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.660 
thing about this is as the birds grow
you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> lift<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.550> lamp<00:01:29.870> and<00:01:31.670> clamp

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
you can you can lift your lamp and clamp

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.170 
you can you can lift your lamp and clamp
it<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:35.760> don't<00:01:35.880> need<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it so that because they don't need the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.290 
it so that because they don't need the
heat<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.600> only<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:36.960> low<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.180> ground

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
heat you only have it low to the ground

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.690 
heat you only have it low to the ground
you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.260> it<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.440> mean<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.370> way<00:01:41.490> down

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you can have it I mean all the way down

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.720 
you can have it I mean all the way down
I<00:01:45.380> mean<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.440> can<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> real<00:01:47.250> close<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
I mean you can have it real close to the

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.700 
I mean you can have it real close to the
floor<00:01:47.970> when<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.900> babies<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.260> newborn

floor when the babies are newborn

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
floor when the babies are newborn
newborn<00:01:50.610> baby<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.150> what<00:01:51.300> you<00:01:51.420> would<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.690> is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
newborn baby is what you would do is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
newborn baby is what you would do is
you'd<00:01:51.960> put<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.200> couple<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.980> paper<00:01:53.130> towels<00:01:53.220> in

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you'd put a couple of paper towels in

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.360 
you'd put a couple of paper towels in
here<00:01:53.730> and<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:55.560> heat<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:55.860> reflect<00:01:56.070> off<00:01:56.340> of

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
here and the heat will reflect off of

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.070 
here and the heat will reflect off of
that<00:01:56.640> no<00:01:56.850> stays<00:01:57.120> plenty<00:01:57.480> warm<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:57.870> you<00:01:57.930> have

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
that no stays plenty warm and you have

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.910 
that no stays plenty warm and you have
the<00:01:58.200> food<00:01:58.410> on<00:01:58.620> just<00:01:58.950> outside<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.610> light<00:01:59.790> area

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:14.190 

there<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.040> go

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.360 

that's<00:02:15.200> about<00:02:15.470> where<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.680> would<00:02:15.890> start<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.250> with

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
that's about where I would start it with

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:31.510 
that's about where I would start it with
day<00:02:16.580> old<00:02:16.760> babies<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:18.230> then

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.950 

then<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.700> put<00:02:32.880> paper<00:02:33.090> towel<00:02:33.360> there<00:02:33.600> and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
then you just put paper towel there and

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.300 
then you just put paper towel there and
your<00:02:34.350> babies<00:02:34.650> are<00:02:34.740> going<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.980> stay<00:02:35.100> pretty

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
your babies are going to stay pretty

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
your babies are going to stay pretty
much<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.820> paper<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.210> they<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.570> survive

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
much on the paper but they can survive

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.990 
much on the paper but they can survive
on<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:38.540> screen<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:39.990> this<00:02:40.520> this<00:02:41.520> holds<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
on this screen but this this holds the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600 
on this screen but this this holds the
heat<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:43.410> know<00:02:43.530> your<00:02:43.710> heat<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.070> good

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
heat and you know your heat is good

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.250 
heat and you know your heat is good
not<00:02:44.880> necessarily<00:02:45.300> by<00:02:45.480> having<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.750> thermostat

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
not necessarily by having a thermostat

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.880 
not necessarily by having a thermostat
on<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.160> by<00:02:48.230> where<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.380> chickens<00:02:49.740> are

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
on it but by where the chickens are

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.260 
on it but by where the chickens are
positioned<00:02:50.400> if<00:02:50.550> all<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> chickens<00:02:51.180> are

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
positioned if all the chickens are

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.180 
positioned if all the chickens are
bundled<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.990> middle<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.530> then<00:02:53.040> your

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
bundled up in the middle here then your

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.620 
bundled up in the middle here then your
light<00:02:53.340> needs<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.700> come<00:02:53.910> down<00:02:53.940> if<00:02:54.300> they're<00:02:54.480> all

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
light needs to come down if they're all

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.610 
light needs to come down if they're all
sitting<00:02:55.080> around<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.440> edge<00:02:56.120> then<00:02:57.440> your<00:02:58.440> light

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
sitting around the edge then your light

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.180 
sitting around the edge then your light
needs<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.950> go<00:02:59.070> up<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.340> little<00:02:59.460> bit<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.650> more

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
needs to go up a little bit and the more
