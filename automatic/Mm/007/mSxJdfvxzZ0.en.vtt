00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.279
 I was looking for something to compare at least 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.569
 remotely tiamat 7 and 1 in front of me 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.519
 Matt Cutse headphones 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.209
 although the company was ashamed to indicate about 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:16.240
 this on the packaging of 3 tons of pro + 5 1 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.470
 headphones with this multichannel not 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.470
 imitated by sound 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.000
 affiliation to accuracy can be understood 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.800
 by design after opening the box immediately 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.980
 associations come up either with 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.390
 transforming talisa sports cars 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.270
 glossy body bright saturated 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.580
 red gray stripe what exactly 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.670
 reminds sports car coloring 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.430
 looking for headphones as for me is not the best 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.629
 solution though look spectacular but from 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.940
 fingerprint 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.879
 not going anywhere with good lighting 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.750
 they are very visible headphones seem 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.989
 monolithic 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.539
 in places the headband adjustment is permissible and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.170
 backlash cups adjustable in two 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.289
 directions and here in this pretty 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.330
 still tight that more good than bad, we 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.280
 this chi decided not particularly soared about 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.440
 pillows on the headband making it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.229
 minimum size on one side 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.240
 no longer needed in my case part 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.030
 headband without this pillow and not at all 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.160
 touch the head but the shape of the head of all 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.420
 different and it can deliver to someone 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.399
 some discomfort 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.189
 headphones are sitting on the head 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.689
 perfect course the cups are big and ear 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.700
 fit completely 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.860
 but here are the ear cushions hard and slightly 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.810
 push on the head with big cups 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.270
 does not press on the ears but the pressure on 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.520
 a little head can eat 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.470
 take off and if possible I would replace them 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.810
 on something softer on the left cup 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.149
 there is a microphone jack 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.040
 at these cup sizes one would 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.590
 hide it in the cup itself 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.500
 but for some reason it was decided 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.790
 make it removable but here are the cells and fat 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.299
 and from the remote it is even more thickened 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.149
 cable heavy 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.549
 the microphone remotes are light enough but in 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.759
 aggregate they weight the left cup 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.530
 noticeably good enough that the remote 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.929
 you can attach somewhere to clothes or 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.060
 belt but sometimes home conditions it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.770
 just nowhere to be attached 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:20.040
 it will all be a little straining oh 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.910
 ways a lot of settings can be adjusted 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.020
 the volume of each channel is also bearish 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.310
 what can be regulated 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.950
 overall microphone volume 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.410
 by clicking on the knob you can hear your 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.900
 voice and adjust the microphone more precisely also 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.209
 pressing the volume knob can 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.000
 turn off the sound it will display 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.680
 here is this pictogram where I first 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.019
 I think that this button as well as 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.420
 headphones can connect consoles and pc 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.519
 bundled is just mass 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.519
 adapters so problems when 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.950
 there will be no connection plus 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.790
 visual instruction is attached 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.620
 so now let's talk about this block 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.690
 a kind of sound card 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.239
 and you do not need to install 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.330
 no drivers all and so will 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.849
 work cool sound I'll say right about 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.340
 music if connects via usb and 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.470
 only all this is better not at all 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.560
 connect when listening through 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.450
 sound card more less but still 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.620
 headphones me for music that's in games 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.440
 completely different story 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.750
 the sound is really surround and makes 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.150
 the process of the game is very exciting 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.239
 the balance between frequencies is well preserved 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.670
 However, if you compare steamos 71 then 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.940
 razer I liked more sound in them 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.549
 somehow deeper what is not needed 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.980
 no drivers of course convenient but here 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.079
 I would like something more subtle 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.359
 adjust the sound so without good 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.970
 programs or sound adjustments i'm into these 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.739
 Headphones used days summing up 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.049
 I will note an excellent design 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.829
 although we all understand the cons of glossy 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.840
 surfaces 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.630
 high build quality and reliability 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.139
 each item in the set has everything 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.579
 necessary cables and adapters 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.380
 interesting solution with a sound card 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.330
 which can connect a pair of headphones 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.810
 at 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.110
 to the console from a friend and of course 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.860
 real sound 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.900
 5 1 as far as he can be present 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.060
 headphones countries she somehow in our 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.680
 time is hard to find perfect headphones 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:32.050
 when the technology has reached such heights and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.050
 what do you think what headphones reality 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.050
 of
