behind the wheel do you think you know
when<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.410> got<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.770> i<00:00:37.950> asked<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> guy<00:00:38.489> i<00:00:38.790> said<00:00:39.210> i

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
when we got in i asked the guy i said i

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.330 
when we got in i asked the guy i said i
didn't<00:00:40.260> ask<00:00:40.379> him<00:00:40.590> i<00:00:40.680> told<00:00:40.710> him<00:00:40.980> i<00:00:41.100> said<00:00:41.250> i'm

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
didn't ask him i told him i said i'm

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.720 
didn't ask him i told him i said i'm
driving<00:00:42.469> he<00:00:43.469> wasn't<00:00:43.739> willing<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.219> give<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
driving he wasn't willing to give up the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.090 
driving he wasn't willing to give up the
wheel<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.300> i<00:00:45.600> guess<00:00:46.410> i'll<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.620> riding<00:00:46.829> today

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
wheel so i guess i'll be riding today

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400 
wheel so i guess i'll be riding today
and<00:00:47.399> fortunately<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.719> i<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and fortunately and i don't think that I

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.840 
and fortunately and i don't think that I
would<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.800> able<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.010> drive<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:50.760> not

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.480 
working on getting that back to the full
range<00:01:33.470> because<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.860> step<00:01:35.100> into<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> ring
