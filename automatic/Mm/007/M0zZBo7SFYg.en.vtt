bicycle basically now to learn a wheelie
from<00:01:31.290> scratch<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.400> first<00:01:32.670> thing<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.210> is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
from scratch the first thing to do is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.090 
from scratch the first thing to do is
just<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.659> ride<00:01:33.840> wrong<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.259> quite<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> slow<00:01:34.829> pace

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
just to ride wrong at quite a slow pace

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
just to ride wrong at quite a slow pace
and<00:01:35.540> you've<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> preload<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.110> body<00:01:37.380> again

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
time as pushing down on that pedal you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.700 
time as pushing down on that pedal you
want<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> lift<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> bars<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.840> lean

want to lift up on the bars and lean

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.920 
want to lift up on the bars and lean
back<00:01:50.009> slightly<00:01:50.310> don't<00:01:51.149> overly<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
would just pull straight off the back so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.630 
would just pull straight off the back so
basically<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.219> riding<00:01:56.399> along

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
you're just going to do that movement

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.760 
you're just going to do that movement
hit<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> pedal<00:02:00.299> don't<00:02:00.659> lift<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> bars

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
hit the pedal don't lift up on the bars

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.010 
hit the pedal don't lift up on the bars
now<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:02.969> first<00:02:03.210> step<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.719> doing<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
now that's your first step to doing a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.139 
now that's your first step to doing a
wheelie<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.950> second<00:02:05.369> step<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.729> find<00:02:05.939> your

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
wheelie your second step is to find your

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.290 
wheelie your second step is to find your
sweet<00:02:06.270> spot<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.190> you're<00:02:09.149> going

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
sweet spot now to do that you're going

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.900 
sweet spot now to do that you're going
to<00:02:09.360> need<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.539> start<00:02:09.750> pedaling

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
to need to start pedaling

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.390 
to need to start pedaling
so<00:02:11.510> you're<00:02:12.230> gonna<00:02:12.350> lift<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.740> bike<00:02:12.920> up<00:02:13.190> and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
so you're gonna lift the bike up and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.010 
so you're gonna lift the bike up and
you're<00:02:14.000> going<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.210> try<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.600> give<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.990> one

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
you're going to try and give it one

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.320 
you're going to try and give it one
crank<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.800> time<00:02:16.040> if<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.250> can<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:17.000> no<00:02:17.180> one's

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
crank at a time if you can we no one's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.180 
crank at a time if you can we no one's
expecting<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.050> 20<00:02:18.440> pedals<00:02:18.830> down<00:02:19.010> that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
expecting you to do 20 pedals down that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.520 
expecting you to do 20 pedals down that
direction<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:19.820> lift<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.390> bike<00:02:20.510> up<00:02:20.840> try<00:02:21.260> one

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
direction just lift the bike up try one

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.230 
direction just lift the bike up try one
crank<00:02:21.860> get<00:02:22.160> under<00:02:22.400> control<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.880> let<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.060> drop

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
crank get under control and let it drop

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.850 
crank get under control and let it drop
back<00:02:23.450> down<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.900> floor<00:02:24.020> then<00:02:24.590> eventually

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
back down to the floor then eventually

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.470 
back down to the floor then eventually
you<00:02:25.100> just<00:02:25.130> build<00:02:25.550> up<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:25.970> build<00:02:26.180> up<00:02:26.300> on

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
you just build up and you build up on

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.850 
you just build up and you build up on
your<00:02:26.600> cranks<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.080> then<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.320> will<00:02:27.710> you'll

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
your cranks and then you will you'll

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.260 
your cranks and then you will you'll
find<00:02:28.100> your<00:02:28.250> balance<00:02:28.370> point<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:28.940> you'll<00:02:29.090> just

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
find your balance point and you'll just

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.350 
find your balance point and you'll just
keep<00:02:29.420> going<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:31.280> example<00:02:31.850> you'd<00:02:32.810> lift<00:02:33.050> up

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
keep going so for example you'd lift up

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.700 
keep going so for example you'd lift up
also<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> very<00:02:35.870> important<00:02:36.290> thing<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.680> use

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
also a very important thing is to use

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.250 
also a very important thing is to use
your<00:02:36.950> brake<00:02:37.190> if<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.850> feel<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.990> when<00:02:39.170> you've

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
your brake if you feel that when you've

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.930 
your brake if you feel that when you've
lifted<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.620> bike<00:02:39.800> up<00:02:40.070> your<00:02:40.400> body<00:02:40.610> weight<00:02:40.820> is

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
lifted the bike up your body weight is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.310 
lifted the bike up your body weight is
going<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.120> go<00:02:41.240> far<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.690> over<00:02:41.900> back<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.230> you're

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
going to go far to over back and you're

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.140 
going to go far to over back and you're
going<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.470> fall<00:02:42.680> off<00:02:42.830> just<00:02:43.280> slightly<00:02:43.730> hit<00:02:44.030> your

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
going to fall off just slightly hit your

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.760 
going to fall off just slightly hit your
back<00:02:44.300> brake<00:02:44.540> what<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.260> will<00:02:45.380> do<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.530> that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
back brake what that will do is that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.710 
back brake what that will do is that
will<00:02:45.890> stop<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.310> bike<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.300> will<00:02:47.420> stop<00:02:47.600> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
will stop the bike and it will stop it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.420 
will stop the bike and it will stop it
from<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.990> back<00:02:48.140> any<00:02:48.440> further<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:49.310> will

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
from going back any further it will

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.570 
from going back any further it will
actually<00:02:49.550> want<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:49.970> push<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.420> down<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.680> then

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580
