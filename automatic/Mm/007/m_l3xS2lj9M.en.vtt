00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.360
 I've always liked to think that our 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.530
 life belongs to us that we can change it 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.960
 as you want to see look at your horse and 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.060
 I do not know how lovely is a small specimen 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.540
 very small you never had an eye for 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.369
 horses or for girls you have to 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.470
 choose a life as a child because it is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.970
 bordeaux that earn a lot of money or that of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.669
 a rider who works hard to be 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.079
 Olympic champion in insurance and how was your 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.079
 dream became mine 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.930
 I always wondered how I would fare if 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.930
 I re-assembled you still fit him 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.360
 what energy does that horse have more 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.360
 what's that 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.140
 and those of dollars medals of your 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.710
 career but you've thought about it all 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.710
 understood nothing 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.670
 ah 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.089
 plus 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.040
 the bad thing is that maybe they are right I have 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.750
 a good horse but I'm not a good horseman 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.310
 if you want to leave it or leave it your mother and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.930
 I do not regret anything what 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.760

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.200
 prove nothing and it will be your way is the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.330
 evolution that you have achieved with this 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.369

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.409

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.229
