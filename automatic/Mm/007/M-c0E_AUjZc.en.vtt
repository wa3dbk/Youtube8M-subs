00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.840
 Now everyone is looking for a new video 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.519
 the title spark offers more in faro 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.100
 or less, some are very provocative 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.000
 formulated at first times, firstly a 21 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.490
 explains why 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.859
 In the last episode I had the thing 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 that I extremely fast a dungeon 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.250
 had found and the wholesale external 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050
 because you only hand of popsongs 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.910
 No muslims do not see anything 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.320
 and I immediately knew where the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.180
 boxes are underneath 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 dived without course rome search 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.809
 some came that a bit spanish 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.270
 but that's why I thought so myself 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.460
 make a very short resolution here 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.110
 of all the quicktip in relation to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.399
 Find dungeon is actually more like that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.760
 a basic thing almost 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.710
 again 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.879
 and there for you in the world is and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.610
 just a little short 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.149
 example first shown yes first 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.899
 we have a dungeon you can put it in 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.739
 Bonner and both boxes can be seen 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.609
 you can see you can also see the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.870
 big role that is all there in front of us 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.070
 I really asked so much about it 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.700
 thought there come then show it all 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.990
 short wiebels fruit why and in 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.760
 the desert gone so small 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.630
 For example, because gremmel is similar to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.490
 sand has the same characteristics 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.869
 That's why I also have scrabble dungeon 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.220
 found and there but no kreml 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.630
 I can find manic so spontaneously 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.520
 simply found on sent namely 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.229
 I have fled the desert 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.350
 right over there is the dungeon 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.310
 and in the consequences or successes 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.170
 most likely have seen that 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.670
 went to him and immediately targeted 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.659
 have given to the crates down 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.130
 first box second box and see now 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.200
 we'll be here for a moment in the basic story 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.710
 why the so simple had to mats 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.710
 maybe already seen 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.750
 glock toyota crates dungeons have the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.270
 property that you naturally without 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.340
 cover and spawn it here to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.649
 example and if it is the case that is there 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.060
 the dungeon generally on the surface 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.009
 spawn then you normally see it 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 not we have now, however, a 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.670
 special case that happens to be the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 surface where the underneath spawn out 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.659
 greven and sand would exist then 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.100
 this kreml and this one sent 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.930
 logically down into the dungeon 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.849
 fall for once the world generated 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.530
 which also for example with these then 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.850
 even the fall is in the desert with sand 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.280
 that rounds out ecclestone 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.560
 phase one two three four five six 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.570
 seven times one two three four five 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.430
 and there are simply people you need 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.930
 bigger with 7 x 7 as far as I know that 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.450
 you two varieties and the sport always without 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.910
 ceiling with yes would have to keep or 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.860
 somewhere kreml is as below as ground 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.480
 We are lucky sometimes that we 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.890
 trip over it and see exactly where that 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.880
 stuff is flopped down and if 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.710
 we think it logically 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.990
 the dungeon room is actually empty 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.110
 Empty room was made by ponies and two 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.880
 boxes and then the sand forms when the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.390
 Above a flat surface forms this 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.530
 automatically after that means one 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.540
 Sand surface down here so now 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.610
 would fall the shapes of the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.800
 lower room to imitate more 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.290
 so to speak and that's why it's here too 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.790
 the middle of the span happens we can 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.350
 Let's see if there is no sand here 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.390
 blog is higher than it is because 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.520
 that here below is the Spaniard 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.740
 and that's why the sand is not 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.050
 can fall down far as there where none 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.000
 waters and that's why there is a son here 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.770
 including pin Opel out if I just already 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.930
 that they are so out of shape now 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.090
 sandstone but if it's you cobblestone 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.700
 for example is still we have to 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.860
 here for sc coupled stone just like that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.930
 somewhere that can not be normal 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.470
 why is it either someone or her 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.670
 are then already 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.560
 you do not even have to be moster and 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.480
 blessed cobblestone sees which 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.670
 still this formation seen here from 1 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.380
 point and two still standing in the corner 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.940
 mostly they are the boxes because 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.200
 similar to the spawn is because of that 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.770
 here the sand is not quite so far down 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.930
 can fall 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.520
 Well, if I go up so now 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.960
 press here then the other box 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.950
 logically, because the sand is not 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.440
 can fall down so far 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.430
 So we have it at a glance 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.930
 immediately found out where the boxes are 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.310
 and that was actually the whole thing 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.630
 mystery in the story it has 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.490
 just do a bit of exercise though 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.690
 one then still minecraft player one has 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.370
 for something like that myself am over it 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.770
 Driven from now on 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.850
 either via one sees the likes to see 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.370
 you can not see anything but me pretty much 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.840
 I see it was like that at once 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.370
 Live the falling success 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.450
 luckily had a job and no 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.480
 I really knew because she did not 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.490
 earlier on, I'm not going to 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.350
 exception you can do nothing you can 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.520
 do not cheat at all 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.630
 the plugin that regulates so I can too 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.870
 not but they seem that will be instant 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.280
 recognized well to clarify the question why 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.630
 why why a little quicktipp for 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.430
 me how to find dungeons always 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.200
 Be careful if there is a strange sand 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.510
 or grass information looks 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.830
 So that's what he was so crucial 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.200
 I hope to learn something 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.330
 then it seems we were so against 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.680
 many ask how against that now 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.660
 Thank you for watching 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.660
 Cook until soon
