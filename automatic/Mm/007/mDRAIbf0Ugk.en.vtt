which is just um plates oops and you
also<00:01:10.049> need<00:01:10.350> electronics<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.220> arc<00:01:11.430> reactor

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
also need electronics and an arc reactor

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.160 
also need electronics and an arc reactor
which<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.890> electronics<00:01:13.890> cutting<00:01:14.700> angles

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
which is electronics cutting angles

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
which is electronics cutting angles

disarmer<00:01:30.479> plates<00:01:31.430> shoes<00:01:32.750> electronics<00:01:33.750> shoot

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
disarmer plates shoes electronics shoot

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.580 
disarmer plates shoes electronics shoot
shell<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> rockets<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> let's<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
shell and rockets so let's get into the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.840 
shell and rockets so let's get into the
abilities<00:01:39.829> Bret<00:01:41.570> yes<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.670> full

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
abilities Bret yes so this is the full

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.399 
abilities Bret yes so this is the full
Ironman<00:01:45.360> suit<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:49.020> fly

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
Ironman suit and as you see you can fly

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
Ironman suit and as you see you can fly
and<00:01:49.680> gives<00:01:49.890> off<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.250> awesome<00:01:50.729> particle<00:01:51.270> effect

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and gives off an awesome particle effect

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:03.380 
and gives off an awesome particle effect
and<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.210> ground<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:59.340> look<00:02:00.210> heaps<00:02:00.630> fast<00:02:02.390> so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and on the ground can look heaps fast so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.720 
and on the ground can look heaps fast so
yeah<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.610> then

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
yeah and then

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.010 
yeah and then
if<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.930> press<00:02:08.170> shift<00:02:08.620> offline<00:02:09.840> kind<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.870> like

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
if you press shift offline kind of like

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
if you press shift offline kind of like
glide<00:02:12.360> stuff<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.800> yeah<00:02:14.800> Sophie<00:02:15.280> press<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.930> said

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
glide stuff so yeah Sophie press is said

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.910 
glide stuff so yeah Sophie press is said
it<00:02:18.040> shoots<00:02:18.370> like<00:02:18.520> an<00:02:18.640> arrow<00:02:18.880> bit<00:02:19.270> later<00:02:19.920> it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
it shoots like an arrow bit later it

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.820 
it shoots like an arrow bit later it
will<00:02:21.190> turn<00:02:21.430> into<00:02:21.610> like<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.940> bullet<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
will turn into like a bullet like the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.740 
will turn into like a bullet like the
Iron<00:02:24.010> Man<00:02:25.560> X<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:27.130> not<00:02:27.370> actually<00:02:27.850> X's<00:02:28.420> working

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
Iron Man X is not actually X's working

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.100 
Iron Man X is not actually X's working
for<00:02:28.900> me<00:02:29.020> right<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:30.810> some<00:02:31.810> chickens<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.710> you<00:02:33.280> go

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
for me right I some chickens so you go

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.520 
for me right I some chickens so you go
up<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.380> chickens<00:02:35.740> oh<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.990> once<00:02:38.380> you'd

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
up to the chickens oh and once you'd

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.580 
up to the chickens oh and once you'd
like<00:02:38.710> look<00:02:39.010> at<00:02:39.100> them<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:40.000> die<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:41.500> you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
like look at them like I die so you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.330 
like look at them like I die so you
press<00:02:41.740> X<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.900> goes<00:02:44.080> some<00:02:44.350> lightning<00:02:45.930> see

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
press X there goes some lightning see

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.760 
press X there goes some lightning see
figure<00:02:48.340> down<00:02:48.490> here<00:02:48.760> Craig's<00:02:49.600> create<00:02:50.530> some

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
figure down here Craig's create some

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.460 
figure down here Craig's create some
massive<00:02:51.280> crater<00:02:51.730> around<00:02:52.240> you<00:02:52.420> blows<00:02:53.140> up<00:02:53.350> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
massive crater around you blows up the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.680 
massive crater around you blows up the
whole<00:02:53.740> thing<00:02:54.840> around<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:57.270> v<00:02:59.610> if<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:01.360> just

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
whole thing around you v if you just

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.810 
whole thing around you v if you just
click<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.880> makes<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.570> one<00:03:04.990> thing<00:03:05.820> one

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
click it it makes like a one thing one

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.500 
click it it makes like a one thing one
thing<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:07.120> fire<00:03:07.420> but<00:03:07.960> if<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.140> hold<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.470> down<00:03:09.510> it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
thing a fire but if you hold it down it

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.750 
thing a fire but if you hold it down it
makes<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.870> bigger<00:03:11.050> one<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.430> b<00:03:13.209> is<00:03:14.760> basically

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
makes a bigger one so b is basically

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.750 
makes a bigger one so b is basically
like<00:03:15.790> v<00:03:16.240> bit<00:03:17.050> it<00:03:17.260> explodes<00:03:17.890> where<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.370> want<00:03:18.610> it

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
like v bit it explodes where you want it

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.690 
like v bit it explodes where you want it

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
for mining because it gives like will

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.479 
for mining because it gives like will
cease<00:03:30.100> probably<00:03:30.489> better<00:03:32.130> this<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.250> all<00:03:33.459> in

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
cease probably better this is all in

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.720 
cease probably better this is all in
survival<00:03:34.120> but<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.160> island<00:03:36.160> does<00:03:36.310> go<00:03:36.489> down<00:03:36.520> and
