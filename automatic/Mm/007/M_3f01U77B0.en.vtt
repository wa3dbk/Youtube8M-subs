00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.539> in<00:00:00.989> terms<00:00:01.230> of<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.680> fourth

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:02.480 
I think in terms of in the fourth

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.150 
I think in terms of in the fourth
obviously<00:00:03.480> with<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.689> double<00:00:04.080> team<00:00:04.290> just

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
obviously with the double team just

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.540 
obviously with the double team just
trying<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> get<00:00:05.580> either<00:00:05.819> get<00:00:06.120> rid<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:06.600> or

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
trying to get either get rid of it or

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.190 
trying to get either get rid of it or
back<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:08.760> up<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.120> wait<00:00:09.450> for<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.809> double<00:00:10.080> team

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
back it up and wait for the double team

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.999 
back it up and wait for the double team
to<00:00:10.320> go<00:00:10.469> away<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.710> then<00:00:10.980> attack<00:00:11.450> Marion<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:12.690> um

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
to go away and then attack Marion but um

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.310 
to go away and then attack Marion but um
you<00:00:14.009> know<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.130> think<00:00:14.460> they<00:00:14.610> did<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.790> great<00:00:15.030> job<00:00:15.059> of

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
you know I think they did a great job of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.090 
you know I think they did a great job of
doubling<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.770> was<00:00:17.190> different<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:18.060> haven't

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
pick-and-roll but the other three guys

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.209 
pick-and-roll but the other three guys
what<00:00:46.260> they're<00:00:46.440> doing<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.860> where<00:00:47.039> they're

standing<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:48.090> different<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.079> just

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
standing is different and so that just

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.229 
standing is different and so that just
every<00:00:49.980> time<00:00:50.190> he<00:00:50.309> makes<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.850> adjustment

every time he makes a little adjustment
the<00:00:51.510> reeds<00:00:51.719> become<00:00:52.050> different<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.770> he's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the reeds become different and so he's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.610 
the reeds become different and so he's
just<00:00:52.980> teaching<00:00:53.550> me<00:00:53.989> how<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> lead<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> team

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
they're going to constantly change

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
they're going to constantly change
because<00:00:59.640> depending<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> team<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> we're

together you can't just win a
championship<00:01:19.430> by<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.640> being<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.939> good

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
championship by not being a good

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
championship by not being a good
defensive<00:01:21.630> team<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.810> we

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
defensive team and so but you know we

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.590 
defensive team and so but you know we
came<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.950> moved<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> ball<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.970> we

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
came out and we moved the ball and we

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.190 
came out and we moved the ball and we
had<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> lot<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> people<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:30.360> contributed

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
had a lot of people that contributed

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.649 
had a lot of people that contributed
tonight<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.130> think<00:01:32.700> across<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> board<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
tonight and I think across the board the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.319 
tonight and I think across the board the
efficiency<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.880> was<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.150> from

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
efficiency was just was there from

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.440 
efficiency was just was there from
everybody<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.430> that's<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.820> when

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
everybody and and so that's just when

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.730 
everybody and and so that's just when
you<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.750> when<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> play<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.590> on

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you have when you play like that on

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
you have when you play like that on
offense<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> lot<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> weapons<00:01:41.970> go

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
offense and you have a lot of weapons go

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.210 
offense and you have a lot of weapons go
on<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> same<00:01:43.079> time<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.710> something's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
on at the same time it's something's

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.410 
on at the same time it's something's
going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.430> open<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:44.850> something's<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.390> to
