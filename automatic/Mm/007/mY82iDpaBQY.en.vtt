00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
move on and you know the x51 is going to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.799 
move on and you know the x51 is going to
replace<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> overall<00:00:46.710> our<00:00:46.829> theory<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:48.780> i

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
getting the x51 high end like everything

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
getting the x51 high end like everything
maxed<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.489> i<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.940> suggest<00:00:54.260> buy<00:00:55.260> this

you guys are trying to get into gaming

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.039 
you guys are trying to get into gaming
then<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> x51<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> low<00:01:05.970> end<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.330> x<00:01:06.540> 51

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
then get the x51 get the low end at x 51

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.460 
then get the x51 get the low end at x 51
or<00:01:07.200> maybe<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> mid<00:01:08.130> x<00:01:08.490> 51<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.439> are

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
or maybe the mid x 51 but if you are

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.929 
or maybe the mid x 51 but if you are
going<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> high-end<00:01:11.250> definitely<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:11.909> for

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
going for the high-end definitely go for

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
going for the high-end definitely go for
this<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:13.369> what<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> got<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:16.590> Aurora<00:01:16.830> are

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
this one here what I got the Aurora are

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
this one here what I got the Aurora are
three<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.970> only<00:01:18.210> thing<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> changed<00:01:18.960> was<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
three the only thing I changed was the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.810 
three the only thing I changed was the
cpu<00:01:19.890> GPU<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:22.229> actually<00:01:22.530> got<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> same<00:01:23.189> GPU<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
cpu GPU I actually got the same GPU you

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.210 
cpu GPU I actually got the same GPU you
would<00:01:23.970> find<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> alienware<00:01:24.840> aurora<00:01:25.220> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
would find on the alienware aurora the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.679 
would find on the alienware aurora the
one<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.670> cost<00:01:26.880> two<00:01:26.970> thousand<00:01:27.360> dollar<00:01:27.479> which

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
one that cost two thousand dollar which

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.460 
one that cost two thousand dollar which
is<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> 1.5<00:01:28.560> gig<00:01:29.549> nvidia<00:01:30.450> geforce<00:01:31.110> gtx<00:01:31.890> 560ti

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
is the 1.5 gig nvidia geforce gtx 560ti

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.280 
is the 1.5 gig nvidia geforce gtx 560ti
when<00:01:34.470> i<00:01:34.500> ordered<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.810> laurel<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.930> three

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
when i ordered the laurel are three

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.870 
when i ordered the laurel are three
which<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.100> side<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
which is the one on this side it

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.030 
which is the one on this side it
actually<00:01:39.060> gave<00:01:39.299> me<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> option<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.920> know

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
actually gave me the option to you know

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
actually gave me the option to you know
change<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.579> video<00:01:41.820> card<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.600> some

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
change the video card but now for some

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660 
change the video card but now for some
reason<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.049> doesn't<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.950> pretty<00:01:44.009> sure<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> has

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
reason it doesn't I'm pretty sure it has

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.990 
reason it doesn't I'm pretty sure it has
to<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.909> with

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
to do with

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.070 
to do with
they're<00:01:46.150> getting<00:01:46.300> rid<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.630> them<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:46.840> they

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
they're getting rid of them so they

can get two of them so you get 144 corso
in<00:02:39.250> both<00:02:39.430> home<00:02:39.640> you'll<00:02:39.820> get<00:02:39.970> approximately

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
in both home you'll get approximately

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.110 
in both home you'll get approximately
about<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:42.010> same<00:02:42.220> performance<00:02:42.670> as<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
about the same performance as the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.370 
about the same performance as the
high-end<00:02:43.690> x51<00:02:45.540> with<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:48.340> GTX<00:02:49.709> 555<00:02:51.209> so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
high-end x51 with the the GTX 555 so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.440 
high-end x51 with the the GTX 555 so
you'll<00:02:53.380> get<00:02:53.530> about<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.799> same<00:02:53.830> performance

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
you'll get about the same performance

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.180 
you'll get about the same performance
but<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:56.049> of<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.200> reasons<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:56.620> this<00:02:56.830> model

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
but one of the reasons to get this model

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.949 
but one of the reasons to get this model
is<00:02:57.220> because<00:02:57.549> you'll<00:02:57.880> have<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> marshal<00:02:58.630> much

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
is because you'll have a marshal much

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.920 
is because you'll have a marshal much
larger<00:02:59.880> power<00:03:00.880> supply<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.239> you'll<00:03:01.510> also<00:03:01.720> be

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
larger power supply and you'll also be

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.289 
larger power supply and you'll also be
able<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.200> upgrade<00:03:02.830> your<00:03:03.280> system<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.760> lot<00:03:04.060> easier
