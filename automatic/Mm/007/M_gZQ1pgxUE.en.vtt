undertones a deep royal purple it's
definitely<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.729> much<00:01:48.360> darker<00:01:48.630> much

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
different than heroin so as you can see

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.940 
different than heroin so as you can see
very<00:01:53.210> streaky

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
very streaky

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
very streaky
takes<00:01:56.130> quite<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.580> few<00:01:56.880> swipes<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.450> get<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.720> built

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
takes quite a few swipes to get it built

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.580 
takes quite a few swipes to get it built
up<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:59.549> still<00:01:59.750> streaky<00:02:00.750> there's<00:02:01.229> parts

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
up and it's still streaky there's parts

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.370 
up and it's still streaky there's parts
of<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.950> are<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.540> I'll<00:02:03.540> try<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> live

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
of it that are not I'll try to do a live

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.789 
of it that are not I'll try to do a live
lip<00:02:04.680> swatch<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.159> well<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.570> very

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
lip swatch as well is just very

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.779 
lip swatch as well is just very
underperforming<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.009> say<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.280> least

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
underperforming to say the least

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.590 
underperforming to say the least
the<00:02:09.179> next<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:09.569> we<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.800> got<00:02:11.039> is

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
the next one we have that I got is

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.390 
the next one we have that I got is
instigator<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.050> also<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.380> purple<00:02:14.010> but

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
instigator and this is also a purple but

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.920 
instigator and this is also a purple but
it's<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.580> red<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.910> purple<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.450> kind<00:02:15.810> of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
it's a red and purple and I kind of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's a red and purple and I kind of
thought<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.170> would<00:02:16.319> be<00:02:16.380> similar<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:17.090> rebel

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
thought it would be similar to rebel

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.090 
thought it would be similar to rebel
like<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.270> dark<00:02:18.630> oh<00:02:18.750> Revell<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.800> actually

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
like a dark oh Revell but it's actually

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.770 
like a dark oh Revell but it's actually
kind<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.400> similar<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.730> another<00:02:21.030> Shane<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
kind of similar to another Shane and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.650 
kind of similar to another Shane and
you'll<00:02:21.930> see<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> end<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.450> didn't

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
you'll see the end so this one I didn't

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.540 
you'll see the end so this one I didn't
have<00:02:24.870> any<00:02:25.140> problems<00:02:25.709> with<00:02:25.830> when<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.069> swatch

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
have any problems with when I swatch

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.120 
have any problems with when I swatch
this<00:02:26.880> one<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.300> got<00:02:27.540> full<00:02:27.780> opaque<00:02:28.140> color<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.739> one

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
this one I got full opaque color in one

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.520 
this one I got full opaque color in one
swipe<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.450> course<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:30.989> go<00:02:31.110> over<00:02:31.140> it

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
swipe and of course I can go over it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.979 
swipe and of course I can go over it
again<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.920> get<00:02:32.040> even<00:02:32.310> darker<00:02:32.850> but<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.690> can<00:02:33.840> see

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
again to get even darker but you can see

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.130 
again to get even darker but you can see
two<00:02:34.230> swipes<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:35.010> full<00:02:35.250> color<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.900> mean<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.989> had

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
two swipes you full color I mean you had

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.720 
two swipes you full color I mean you had
good<00:02:37.319> opacity<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:37.950> two<00:02:38.130> swipes<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.519> get<00:02:38.640> even

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
good opacity but two swipes you get even

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.970 
good opacity but two swipes you get even
better<00:02:38.940> opacity<00:02:39.569> whereas<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.769> still

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
better opacity whereas this is still

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.500 
better opacity whereas this is still
streaking<00:02:41.430> no<00:02:41.459> matter<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.090> did<00:02:42.209> I'm
