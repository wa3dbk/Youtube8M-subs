8 p.m. then you hold it down to get to
the<00:01:49.110> next<00:01:49.350> stage

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the next stage

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.410 
the next stage
then<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.140> minutes<00:01:52.939> hold<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.119> down<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
then that's the minutes hold it down to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.609 
then that's the minutes hold it down to
get<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.899> next<00:01:55.259> stage<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.630> that's<00:01:57.630> year<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
get to the next stage so that's year and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.310 
get to the next stage so that's year and
that's<00:01:59.219> 15<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.939> me<00:02:00.240> hold<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.259> down<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:02.070> more

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
that's 15 for me hold it down a bit more

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.359 
that's 15 for me hold it down a bit more
so<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.979> month

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
so that's the month

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.070 
so that's the month
then<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.299> hold<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.780> down<00:02:07.960> once<00:02:08.410> more<00:02:08.739> and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
then you hold it down once more and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.869 
then you hold it down once more and
that's<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.260> day<00:02:11.530> then<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.129> hold<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.489> down<00:02:12.819> for

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
that's the day then you hold it down for

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.380 
that's the day then you hold it down for
three<00:02:13.209> seconds<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.200> get<00:02:14.349> out<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:15.390> now

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
three seconds to get out of that now

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.500 
three seconds to get out of that now
that's<00:02:16.599> how<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.870> works<00:02:17.200> right<00:02:17.560> now<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.510> 829

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that's how it works right now it's 829

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.240 
that's how it works right now it's 829
for<00:02:19.810> me<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.319> that's<00:02:20.500> why<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.739> didn't<00:02:20.980> change
