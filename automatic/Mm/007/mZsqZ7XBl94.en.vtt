00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.710
 The winner is whoever arrives safely below this 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.630
 motto would fit well with the alpine 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.320
 inline planning is not for the weak 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.330
 annoy 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.139
 the risk of injury more permanent 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.940
 companion falls on the agenda 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:23.039
 seriously happened that came to luck 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.050
 Nevertheless, nothing can ever happen 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.670
 happen that you slipped away 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.500
 however, this support is not 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.810
 dangerous one becomes in the band all 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.759
 are well protected with protectors so 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.180
 looks much more dangerous than it does 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.820
 wm is the chef sets instead of fall 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.010
 the voltage factor of the local matador and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 reigning world champion sebastian gruber 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 with full concentration on his 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.930
 he finals his week up and down he 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.180
 is hard crashed then gold in the team 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.190
 slalom and today in slalom it works 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.470
 similarly, only fourth place in the first place 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.720
 Pass on best time in the second 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.260
 but a man is easy on this day 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.420
 invincible the lilac kristaps little of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.180
 alpine ski world cup strengthened in winter 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.100
 Too strong for the Upper Palatinate 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.380
 Therefore, it is more likely to finish third at the end 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.620
 low at where is was Christoph 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.410
 win better in the first run and 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.900
 Europe team out the strong performance 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.530
 the upper palatinate completes claudia 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.300
 wittmann also came out as well 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.370
 Team World Champion and also with the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.410
 increase in the second run as 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.220
 gets taken to the piste third last 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.920

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.560
 twice gold once silver and once 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.950
 bronze just great for our fc 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.990
 cham minster 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.810

 experienced beauty believes not be 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.720
 Not 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.670
 and because it was so beautiful, the wm 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.920
 boss one last time even on the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.430
 skates strapped and is without a fall 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.780
