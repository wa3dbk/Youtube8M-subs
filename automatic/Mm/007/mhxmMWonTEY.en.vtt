00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's their SAS tech viscoelastic foam so

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.360 
it's their SAS tech viscoelastic foam so
basically<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.620> memory<00:00:56.070> type

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
basically it's this this memory type

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
basically it's this this memory type
foam<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> help<00:00:57.510> keep<00:00:57.809> its<00:00:57.989> shape

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
foam that's going to help keep its shape

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.569 
foam that's going to help keep its shape
it's<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.829> more<00:00:59.010> comfortable<00:00:59.460> on

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
