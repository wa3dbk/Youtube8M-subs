power<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.510> i'm<00:03:11.199> going<00:03:11.439> to<00:03:11.620> say<00:03:11.829> they<00:03:12.340> are

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
power and i'm going to say they are

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.909 
power and i'm going to say they are
overpowered<00:03:13.269> but<00:03:13.989> it's<00:03:14.290> not<00:03:14.379> something<00:03:14.769> that

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
overpowered but it's not something that

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.929 
overpowered but it's not something that
you<00:03:15.099> hate<00:03:16.109> because<00:03:17.109> since<00:03:18.010> every<00:03:18.400> weapon<00:03:18.609> is

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
you hate because since every weapon is

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.020 
you hate because since every weapon is
over<00:03:19.239> power<00:03:20.280> okay<00:03:21.280> look<00:03:21.549> at<00:03:21.699> that<00:03:21.849> right<00:03:22.000> there

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
over power okay look at that right there

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.589 
over power okay look at that right there
BAM<00:03:22.840> he<00:03:23.169> was<00:03:23.290> about<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.560> kill<00:03:23.829> me<00:03:24.299> but<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.359> guess

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
BAM he was about to kill me but I guess

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.780 
BAM he was about to kill me but I guess
he<00:03:25.629> shot<00:03:26.079> me<00:03:26.199> on<00:03:26.229> the<00:03:26.319> arm<00:03:26.590> or<00:03:26.919> something<00:03:26.979> and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
he shot me on the arm or something and

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.490 
he shot me on the arm or something and
that's<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.359> reason<00:03:28.509> why<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.870> got<00:03:29.139> the<00:03:29.259> kill

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
that's the reason why I got the kill

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.610 
that's the reason why I got the kill
with<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.799> three-round<00:03:30.370> burst<00:03:30.780> gone<00:03:31.780> look<00:03:32.470> at
