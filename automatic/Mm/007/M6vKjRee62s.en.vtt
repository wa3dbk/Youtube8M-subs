00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 very good friends of the stranger I am 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.140
 cruise 95 and I bring a black gameplay 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.630
 ops 2 but good first of all I want 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.870
 apologize on behalf of the three 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.519
 so much will in fact grant the mummy 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 because it should be over, we have not 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 could upload many videos of us 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.960
 a week write nothing but good to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.289
 change I bring a game of domain 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.109
 terrestrial war of some games that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.179
 they fell with schumer with their subscribers 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:34.320
 if you will see that in this it seemed like it dies 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:38.040
 and killed by consuming multiple times the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.600
 The only problem is that the cinema of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 whites that goes as well as all 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.350
 we know you can inspire the mind 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.970
 I cut the game into two segments 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.710
 three minutes this round is not over 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.900
 you cut the three minutes and then 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.210
 start in the middle of the second round 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.480
 just then the terms very weird everything 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.130
 very very white 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.420
 but first of all I want physical in 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.760
 this clip that comes next 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.140
 when he took the flag of ba3 I would 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.580
 I get to take the flag for webber 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.400
 already good one dead 32 dead 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.330
 put insert or game log in 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.369
 interest 40 takes matter run but this 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.780
 is the reason why it is though 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.720
 possibly do not pass, I'll send the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.509
 consumer video as I told you I do not want 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.520
 the hunter shot the helicopter as 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.420
 they gave the amp I do say good let's see what 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.440

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.659

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.100
 low 7 low with agrando explaining to 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.280
 people do not see that it is very 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.009
 next but what I hear has been that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.960
 but hey Now yes Weather 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.650
 time runs and I want to talk about a topic 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.530
 today I do not want to talk about good today 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.500
 he inspired me he will be playing with out 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.140
 consumer and good enough of his psuv that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.130
 is playing with let's say one of your 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.399
 references of youtube 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.469
 let's see what you have as a reference 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.050
 I do not know that I have the references that 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.950
 are the consumer and his brother and the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.599
 I truly felt like not playing no 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.120
 it grew I did not feel the same playing 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.660
 when when I was playing yesterday that 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.489
 when he played a normal game and I started 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.459
 to think yesterday night I for the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.630
 tomorrow about it not knowing the thing is 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.030
 Of course it is not possible that during all 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.180
 the time we play the call of duty or 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.140
 any other game we find ourselves with 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.510
 people who are on youtube is moderately 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.739
 famous your communities people who have 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.260
 its good number of subsedes a good 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.220
 number of followers or not only of 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.019
 other communities but also the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.960
 Spanish and that you do not know no but no 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.550
 we feel 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.070
 despite knowing that it is possible that we 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.620
 we feel different but the moment 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.000
 in which people are by 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.610
 example here when they consume this 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.410
 consumer item 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:05.200
 Jorge the serious encounters with alex and 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:07.270
 with equal with people like this not very well known 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.450
 and that they follow and consider themselves fans 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.819
 his 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.890
 Well, we kind of have a session 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.900
 to say pussy is that you are seeing me such 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.239
 but I think that right now I'm 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.200
 playing and what the same party have 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.319
 following already is seeing the same 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.790
 consumer gave me like pussy molano and I 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.290
 with him is something that on the one hand motivates you 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.560
 and on the other hand it makes you nervous not by 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.530
 have to motivate you say sorry I want no 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.760
 I want to look bad in front of a person 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.830
 which has more than 200,000 subscribers 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.630
 because who knows any of these 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.090
 games ends in his channel that the wise 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.530
 It was also good that people are not going to 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.840
 fix we know that people will not be 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.610
 fiscal but everyone think 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.569
 I'm sure that someone is, I do not know 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.860
 always always though you know that there 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.329
 let's have these thoughts for the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.110
 head and I do not know the truth that motivates but 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.220
 it also makes you nervous not me the truth 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.709
 in the fine games I played four or 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.390
 five games the first two were 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:08.650
 a copy no other thing because to see if 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.290
 they are positive but they were a 12 11 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.480
 things and not but suddenly from campus 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.720
 this game that with that sevenfold of the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.889
 ramp well up and I ended up with a 65 something 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.949
 that in the game you will not see 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.539
 finish I think the end those 65 something 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.759
 so I would like you to tell me this is how 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.430
 a little above that you think not this 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.229
 to pick up and set aside from 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.400
 these losses with their large 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.419
 big channels or big youtubers 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.820
 have a very relaxed atmosphere because 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.460
 this function we are talking about almost 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.759
 everything except to play then look at that 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.979
 good friends to use this weapon and I saw a 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.139
 video I do not know we 're not talking 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.780
 so much with consumer was everything very relaxed 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.759
 but what do you think you think you can put 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.200
 nervous you think that it can motivate 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.270
 players 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.840
 I dont know 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.040
 what do you think about that youtubers 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.210
 play with subscribers do not you think 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.850
 well you think it's wrong 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.920
 you think they do it I know to see if 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.870
 some are left and taken out a game 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.470
 to climb you want to do it 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.090
 simply to become popular or 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.610
 however , you want them not to do it 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.940
 because they care about subscribers because 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.930
 I do not know why they like to play with them 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.330
 all this kind of stuff does not 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.910
 so well I 'm going to apologize for that 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.919
 for these weeks without going up not 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.090
 I promise that the regularity of the videos 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.070
 keep being a video and I will do as it arrives 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.660
 being because good we are now that if 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.390
 we start classes again 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.540
 yes 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.320
 the cdr is with studying like crazy 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.320
 for exams 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.000
 of sun and I have not heard from 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.660
 one week 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.660
 I think he died 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.740
 and I, well, you know that between 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.550
 week I usually have time to record and 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.800
 going up 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.750
 and the truth then a little more than to tell you 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.120
 it was a short job just to 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.819

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.950

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.630
 games with volume 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.950

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.530
