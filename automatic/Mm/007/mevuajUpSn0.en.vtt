 The Lord is the time of the hotline Today I received high school students learning sign language 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:27.380
 Mr. Yoshida Saho from Kozukui High School in Mie Prefecture 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:33.160
 In Kisai High School, I started a sign language class two years ago as an elective course 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.160
 Mr Yoshida is in the second year of taking the class 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.380
 Mr. Yoshida targeted teenagers 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:07.250
 At the World Championship of Wrestling 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:13.120

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.210
 Hand 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:17.090
 Mr. Yoshida is a father and a former Leslie 6 player and 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:20.330
 Really the whole family that your brother is actually Jesus Jing player now 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:26.630
 It is amazing to say that sling family 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:28.120
 I asked you that the practice was quite tough , but how about that? 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.090
 1 year 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.310
 There is no rest 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.500
 The holidays are only New Year holidays 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.500
 at home 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.100
 From 7 am every day 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.580
 9 o'clock 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:50.600
 I am practicing 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:55.370
 At the time of training, I have been beaten, beaten and cried by my father 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.100
 Said stopped in is whether such a strict practice so 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.160
 Have you never thought 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.840
 Many times 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.830
 But to tournaments and 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.830
 I also want to quit 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:15.710
 Is that so 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:17.520
 What is the reason why you were interested in sign language while you were busy on the train ? 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.050
 One time 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.880
 Senior 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.440
 I suddenly started sign language 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.950
 At that time, do your best for the Olympics 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.950
 I 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:38.450
 I was interested in seeing the method. 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:43.319
 Do you actually have Marsh taking classes 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:50.370
 Knowledge is no tan at all about the sign language 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:54.060
 Speaking of language , I thought that it was natural to speak in voice, but variously by hand 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:00.420
 I was surprised that I could express it 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:04.500
 I also a little weak is that this Jitto to study study in this textbook I's right 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:09.390
 This in the sprouting of the body I'd heard the wind that 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.849
 Study one of'm out like better I originally 10 through to 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.569
 p minutes 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.680
 Just studying is the same in February 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:20.100
 After all day 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:27.480
 I think Chiba that can be expressed is perfect for me 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:30.400
 In sign language 4 of something Is that so I left representation in the impression is as-so 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:36.610
 For example 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:39.670
 Flow line in the middle here as Lulu also use the rule wrestling with is 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.460
 Ton wow send is omitted something 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.080
 The second is 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:53.759
 As a high cheap money at the time of the high cheap 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:58.009
 The third and the third can be described as a power that can express their feelings in the size of sign language 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.009
 Can explain easily what is difficult 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.210
 ran 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:09.700
 I heard that there is something I'm really looking forward to, but what is it? 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.510
 With people who can not hear until now 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.990
 By all means because there is no experience in the conversation 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.990
 Presbyterian 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.640
 I want to join Fall 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:28.180
 On top of that there is a good teacher in this studio 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:37.150
 Please, began to talk by all means a lot because you Welcome also soon Mr. 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:38.080
 I 'm actually a third-grade high school student now, but after graduation I would like to get involved with sign language 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:45.610
 Is it 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:48.169
 It may be difficult to study sign language while continuing the boothing in the future 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.370
 Three years of learning turf 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.690
 Is 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.690
 I have nothing to do 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:07.220
 Showy and my feelings from the top of the future Olympic podium 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:08.600
 I think it would be nice if I could express it when I got on the podium with two hands 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.940
 Sign language 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.920
 What do you want to tell 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.630

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:23.100
