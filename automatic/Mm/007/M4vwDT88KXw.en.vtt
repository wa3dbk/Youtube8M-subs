recommend<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.149> there's<00:01:58.720> two<00:01:58.899> different

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
recommend this there's two different

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.960 
recommend this there's two different
types<00:01:59.500> of<00:02:00.300> mounts<00:02:01.300> I<00:02:01.360> guess<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:03.369> short<00:02:03.729> and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
types of mounts I guess one is short and

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.410 
types of mounts I guess one is short and
one<00:02:04.420> has<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> little<00:02:05.020> arch<00:02:05.259> I<00:02:06.179> recommend<00:02:07.179> using

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
one has a little arch I recommend using

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.190 
one has a little arch I recommend using
the<00:02:07.659> arch<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.130> putting<00:02:09.130> some<00:02:09.660> extenders<00:02:10.660> on

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
the arch and putting some extenders on

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.630 
the arch and putting some extenders on
it<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:11.709> way<00:02:11.829> you<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.810> film<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.459> their

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
it that way you can film like with their

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.979 
it that way you can film like with their
board<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.090> everything<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.660> could<00:02:16.840> see

so<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:44.990> while<00:02:45.170> you're<00:02:45.380> writing<00:02:45.790> will<00:02:46.790> make

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
so that while you're writing will make

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.710 
so that while you're writing will make
any<00:02:47.150> noise

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
any noise

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.640 
any noise
and<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.890> won't<00:02:49.010> fall<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:50.660> really<00:02:51.260> good<00:02:51.500> to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
and it won't fall so it's really good to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.020 
and it won't fall so it's really good to
know<00:02:54.670> right

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
know right

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.080 
know right
