here we will be using apple's safari
browser<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:20.039> make<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.430> completely<00:00:20.850> fair

both devices on google chrome here so to
make<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.829> fair<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.879> running<00:00:45.180> google

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
make this fair will be running google

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.920 
make this fair will be running google
chrome<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.039> left<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> iphone<00:00:48.210> 4

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
chrome on the left here on the iphone 4

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
chrome on the left here on the iphone 4
and<00:00:49.250> our<00:00:50.250> main<00:00:50.730> safari<00:00:51.329> browser<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:53.239> other

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and our main safari browser on the other

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.060 
and our main safari browser on the other
device<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:57.050> now<00:00:58.050> both<00:00:58.230> devices<00:00:58.559> will<00:00:58.949> be

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
device here now both devices will be

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.270 
device here now both devices will be
connected<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.879> Wi-Fi<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.469> speeds<00:01:01.859> should

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
connected to Wi-Fi so the speeds should

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.340 
connected to Wi-Fi so the speeds should
be<00:01:02.430> relatively<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> same<00:01:03.120> since<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:03.750> will

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
be relatively the same since they will

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.710 
be relatively the same since they will
be<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.830> next<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.159> each<00:01:05.280> other<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
be right next to each other here and the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570 
be right next to each other here and the
first<00:01:06.960> website<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.549> a

three<00:01:59.940> two<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:04.130> Google<00:02:05.130> Chrome<00:02:05.340> did<00:02:05.670> beat

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
three two one and Google Chrome did beat

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.919 
three two one and Google Chrome did beat
safari<00:02:07.170> by<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> second<00:02:08.340> or<00:02:08.489> two<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.330> overall<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
safari by a second or two so overall you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.990 
safari by a second or two so overall you
can<00:02:10.229> see<00:02:10.380> that<00:02:10.410> google<00:02:10.679> chrome<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> little

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
can see that google chrome is a little

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.080 
can see that google chrome is a little
bit<00:02:12.090> faster<00:02:12.630> than<00:02:13.170> safari<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:14.459> granted

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
bit faster than safari but granted

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.420 
bit faster than safari but granted
google<00:02:15.390> chrome<00:02:15.510> does<00:02:15.690> not<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:16.140> its<00:02:16.430> amazing

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
google chrome does not have its amazing

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.479 
google chrome does not have its amazing
javascript<00:02:18.390> implemented<00:02:19.380> into<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.980> ios<00:02:20.459> app

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
javascript implemented into the ios app

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:29.300 
javascript implemented into the ios app
itself<00:02:21.209> here<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:28.200> let's<00:02:28.440> go<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> weather<00:02:28.860> com

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
itself here and let's go to weather com

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.140 
itself here and let's go to weather com
for<00:02:29.850> one<00:02:30.120> more<00:02:30.420> website<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.380> three<00:02:31.650> two<00:02:31.860> one

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.979 

and<00:02:36.890> we<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.130> see<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:38.760> google<00:02:39.330> chrome<00:02:39.690> did

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
and we can see that google chrome did

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.410 
and we can see that google chrome did
beat<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.500> little<00:02:40.709> bit<00:02:40.860> faster<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.970> overall

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
beat it a little bit faster so overall

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.100 
beat it a little bit faster so overall
both<00:02:43.140> browsers<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:44.370> good<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.030> iphone<00:02:45.600> but

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
both browsers are good on the iphone but

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.070 
both browsers are good on the iphone but
google<00:02:46.440> chrome<00:02:46.650> may<00:02:46.890> have<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.489> bit<00:02:47.610> more

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
google chrome may have a little bit more

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.280 
google chrome may have a little bit more
faster<00:02:49.080> speeds<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.860> your<00:02:50.790> iphone<00:02:51.269> if<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.170> guys

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
faster speeds on your iphone if you guys

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.110 
faster speeds on your iphone if you guys
do<00:02:52.530> like<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.799> speed<00:02:53.100> test<00:02:53.340> don't<00:02:53.790> forget<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
do like the speed test don't forget to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.330
