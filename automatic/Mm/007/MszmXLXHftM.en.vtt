00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello everyone I'm yemen rockies and 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.470
 to this boyfriend of taksim and now he does 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.780
 enough time has not been a video of 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.429
 those that is opening the packages in the 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.740
 administration really not in fact 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.590
 long ago because the last time I 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.850
 I did they gave me pure garbage so if in 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.040
 this opportunity will also give me 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.170
 trash that will be the last video of this 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.840
 series really the idea of â€‹â€‹those of those 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.030
 videos or from these series was to open those 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.160
 packages or let's say open those 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.110
 legend packages most of all for the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.670
 surprise and to see what great things 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.649
 they are going to give us but the last time 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.960
 I was opening I got pure specks from 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.489
 light and bullshit so well then if 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.929
 this time it happens the same is going to be the last 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.789
 video so good let's go open 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.679
 let's open 10 packages of the 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.030
 administration of legend packages to 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.789
 see if we are lucky and we will win 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.829
 something interesting good I have these five 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.809
 that are from the dead orbit but some 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.800
 shader I do not have any sweater of the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:01.010
 dead orbit and I'm already in level 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.410
 in 20 the level 20 so good 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.909
 I hope I have some luck so the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.250
 administrator you already know how the thing 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.770

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.990
 high they go up to nothing wrong but neither 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.450
 something like this very very strange or know

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.869
 nice twitter to fuck that are photos 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.520
 of titan I think sorcerer I call a home 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.960
 for cannons of hand discipline and strength 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.310
 to have more materials for them 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.900
 make the voice but fuck 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.030
 light bikes as a package of 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.630
 legend is going to come out with a muta tip of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.650
 light damn game go shader damn 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.869
 be 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.040
 I do not want to say broadcast and nobody 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.040
 uses no longer useless 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.270
 good that we have high impact 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.440
 that's not bad either, not everything 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.390
 and changing and not rebuilding to see 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.860
 what goes well is not bad is good 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.740
 I did not touch any shader so at 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.120
 have gas let's see that our cocoa 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:32.090
 the woman counts damn strange coin 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:38.849
 fuck this from the forefront 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.959
 titan beavers strives reduces the 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.830
 recovery time of the body to 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.959
 body 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.400
 impact in every proportion impact and 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.790
 force that I do not like the other 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.380
 improvements 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.460
 and well here something I know flickering 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.460
 your shader happen to the shit 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:09.280
 ok that's right from the door 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.710
 although good only the mind used it 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.210
 I like I like black 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.760
 shmidt but I can give it to the 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:26.060
 sorceress at least was in the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.310
 dead orbit because that's who lives 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.950
 what are the arks script because it gave me 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.510
 some great stuff at least 100 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.420
 grams saying something like that to open a 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.890
 time only use three and well 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.780
 you will tell me in the comments 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.190
 if they want it to remain videos of 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.020
 this series and saving the packages and 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.240
 and opening her eyes and that's the last 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.170
 of tomares download a site that people 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.550
 do not want more of this mainly 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.950
 succeeded after 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.730
 ok a gram of legend enough had the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.830
 all right 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.490
 Fuck and the last 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.570
 only half 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.190
 a shit of heavy good now we go 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.700
 to open the legend the other two hours 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.820
 after that really good now go 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.710
 this is what I have here it does not matter that 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.390
 someone this criminal knowledge and already after 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.430
 what I have out there remember with the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.180
 administration I open them later but 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:24.990
 garbage and more garbage and something good fucking 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.000
 fucking remove that good thing to fuck 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.099
 Scout's rifle does not use a rifle 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.680
 and fiction programs because I 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.539
 the improvements were good enough but 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.720
 I use it a lot it is possible to explore 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.729
 more does not have the elemental damage take it out 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.210
 it only served me for the crucible 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.210
 already 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.479
 it uses it equally to explore good yes 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.669
 what is it then that was all I really thought 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.289
 I was going to get worse I was pretty well 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.120
 comparison as it was it is passed that 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.960
 there were ten packages and without bothering 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.080
 they were pure 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.300
 pure that pure specks of light and coins 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.500
 strange and that is good that I was by 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.440
 least other things 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.810
 I got sider from death orbit so I 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.009
 well yes it was pretty cool so 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.199
