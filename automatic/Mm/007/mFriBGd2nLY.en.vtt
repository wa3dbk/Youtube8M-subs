load driver button if it's not already
loaded<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:07.540> then<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.690> click<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.110> load

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290

loaded and then you click the load
driver<00:03:09.560> button<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.459> won't<00:03:10.760> install<00:03:12.370> so

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370

now<00:03:13.519> your<00:03:13.790> computer<00:03:13.910> recognizes<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.110> device

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.009 

now<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:18.950> need<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.280> set<00:03:19.459> up<00:03:19.489> profile<00:03:20.209> there's<00:03:20.900> a

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
now I need to set up profile there's a

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.340 
now I need to set up profile there's a
default<00:03:21.560> mode<00:03:22.130> or<00:03:22.550> profile<00:03:23.260> for<00:03:24.260> the

default mode or profile for the
DualShock<00:03:24.860> 3<00:03:24.890> controller<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.910> prefer<00:03:26.450> not<00:03:26.660> to

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
DualShock 3 controller I prefer not to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.500 
DualShock 3 controller I prefer not to
use<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:28.280> probably<00:03:28.640> best<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.299> go

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
use that and it's probably best you go

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.500 
use that and it's probably best you go
ahead<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.900> create<00:03:30.049> your<00:03:30.290> custom<00:03:30.830> profile

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
ahead and create your custom profile

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.090 
ahead and create your custom profile

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
controller what it allows you to

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.259 
controller what it allows you to
calibrate<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.319> stuff<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.880> see<00:03:50.090> if<00:03:50.180> it's

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
calibrate it and stuff and see if it's

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.569 
calibrate it and stuff and see if it's
working<00:03:50.690> now<00:03:51.320> we're<00:03:51.530> going<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.680> create<00:03:52.070> a

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
working now we're going to create a

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.930 
working now we're going to create a
custom<00:03:53.540> profile<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.440> really<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.489> just<00:03:55.700> need

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
custom profile and really you just need

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.150 
custom profile and really you just need
to<00:03:56.030> default<00:03:56.510> settings<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.590> you'll<00:03:58.010> need

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
to default settings so that you'll need

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.310 
to default settings so that you'll need
to<00:03:58.220> click<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.760> default<00:03:59.209> button<00:03:59.450> down<00:04:00.140> at<00:04:00.230> the

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
to click the default button down at the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.370 
to click the default button down at the
bottom<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.769> this<00:04:00.920> menu<00:04:03.880> aim<00:04:04.880> it

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
bottom of this menu aim it

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.560 
bottom of this menu aim it
now<00:04:06.829> you<00:04:06.890> will<00:04:07.040> name<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.400> anything<00:04:07.910> you<00:04:08.150> want

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
now you will name it anything you want

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.259 
now you will name it anything you want
early<00:04:08.980> ps3<00:04:09.980> controller<00:04:10.340> will<00:04:10.549> do<00:04:10.670> but<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.090> can

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
early ps3 controller will do but you can

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.780 
early ps3 controller will do but you can
come<00:04:11.420> up<00:04:11.540> with<00:04:11.600> something<00:04:11.870> witty<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.790> funny

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
come up with something witty and funny

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.550 
come up with something witty and funny
if<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.030> want

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.379 

and<00:04:17.650> then<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.489> make<00:04:18.730> sure<00:04:18.910> it's<00:04:19.060> selected<00:04:24.389> and

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
and then you make sure it's selected and

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.850 
and then you make sure it's selected and
then<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:25.600> go<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.960> game<00:04:26.139> controller<00:04:26.620> panel

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
then you go to the game controller panel

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.310 
then you go to the game controller panel
and<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:27.730> can<00:04:27.910> check<00:04:28.150> or<00:04:28.450> not<00:04:28.630> if<00:04:28.750> it's<00:04:28.900> working

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
and you can check or not if it's working

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.460 
and you can check or not if it's working
as<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.919> can<00:04:30.070> see<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.520> is<00:04:30.669> working<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:32.020> X&amp;Y

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
as you can see it is working the X&amp;Y

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.220 
as you can see it is working the X&amp;Y
rotation<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.760> six<00:04:34.480> axis<00:04:34.990> controls<00:04:37.230> then

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
rotation is the six axis controls then

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.720 
rotation is the six axis controls then
the<00:04:38.320> buttons<00:04:38.710> are<00:04:38.860> lighting<00:04:39.220> up<00:04:39.310> down<00:04:39.520> there

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
the buttons are lighting up down there

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.270 
the buttons are lighting up down there
each<00:04:40.360> button<00:04:40.780> has<00:04:40.810> a<00:04:40.960> number<00:04:41.380> assigned<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.010> it

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
each button has a number assigned to it

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.860 
each button has a number assigned to it
and<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:43.419> x<00:04:43.960> axis<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.650> y<00:04:44.800> axis<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:46.150> analog

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
and the x axis and y axis is the analog

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.980 
and the x axis and y axis is the analog
stick<00:04:47.169> on<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.410> left<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.700> z<00:04:48.940> axis<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:49.630> z

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
stick on the left and the z axis and z

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.020 
stick on the left and the z axis and z
rotation<00:04:50.200> is<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.950> analog<00:04:51.310> stick<00:04:51.639> on<00:04:51.880> the

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
rotation is the analog stick on the

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.980 
rotation is the analog stick on the
right<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:53.229> dual<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:53.830> slider<00:04:54.250> options<00:04:54.990> down

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
right the dual and slider options down

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.950 
right the dual and slider options down
there<00:04:56.460> do<00:04:57.460> not<00:04:57.639> have<00:04:57.940> anything<00:04:58.300> assigned<00:04:58.780> to

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
there do not have anything assigned to

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.230 
there do not have anything assigned to
them<00:04:59.110> next<00:04:59.680> you<00:05:00.220> can<00:05:00.460> calibrate<00:05:00.760> the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
them next you can calibrate the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:13.740 
them next you can calibrate the
controller<00:05:01.360> if<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.290> wish<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.620> do<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:12.750> and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
controller if you wish to do so and

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.240 
controller if you wish to do so and
that's<00:05:14.050> pretty<00:05:14.290> much<00:05:14.410> it<00:05:14.530> with<00:05:14.950> the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
that's pretty much it with the

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
that's pretty much it with the
motioninjoy<00:05:16.860> controller<00:05:17.860> tool<00:05:18.160> also<00:05:18.729> you

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
motioninjoy controller tool also you

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.779 
motioninjoy controller tool also you
should<00:05:19.450> probably<00:05:19.690> turn<00:05:20.139> off<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.740> six<00:05:21.370> axis

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
should probably turn off the six axis

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.570 
should probably turn off the six axis
tilt<00:05:22.120> controls<00:05:22.720> because<00:05:23.169> they're<00:05:23.580> they're

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
tilt controls because they're they're

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.190 
tilt controls because they're they're
not<00:05:24.820> used<00:05:25.060> for<00:05:25.270> ps1<00:05:25.750> games<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:28.120> yeah

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
not used for ps1 games so yeah

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.110 
not used for ps1 games so yeah
plus<00:05:29.740> it'll<00:05:30.010> mess<00:05:30.220> up<00:05:30.430> your<00:05:30.640> can<00:05:30.789> your

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
plus it'll mess up your can your

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.390 
plus it'll mess up your can your
configuration<00:05:31.900> and<00:05:32.020> when<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.229> get<00:05:32.410> to<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.950> PS

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.740 

and<00:05:39.160> now<00:05:39.790> we'll<00:05:40.330> work<00:05:40.780> with<00:05:41.020> ePSXe
