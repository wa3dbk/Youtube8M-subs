00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.220
 good morning and welcome to fine wood 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.570
 I hope you all are doing well 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.240
 today we are back with 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.610
 all of you good today we're going to 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.050
 continue what is the soap and since the 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.300
 yesterday we have done what is the spa 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.000
 your bundled in a surface of medea in 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.680
 this case is a laminate what we're going to 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.810
 do now is sand 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.370
 before that we must use our 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.539
 gloves 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.210
 how to hurt 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.620
 it's always important that friends what 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.219
 we have repeated since we have started 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.219
 the ideals 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:45.550
 the normal thing is to listen to communicate to the water 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:49.100
 number 220 what happens is that we know 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.730
 this here comes out with a powder 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.730
 a white could 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.129
 and for this we must use a mask or 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.510
 we can also do it with the life of 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.510
 a little way 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.640
 and the guy quit and go out again 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.990
 how do I do this so that this can not enter 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.549
 I go and you suck and truth 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.549
 and we do it with water 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:34.120
 we do not do with water this we have 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:37.090
 thank is water water water normal water 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.460
 and how is this furniture itself is 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.620
 protected with a good coat of lacquer 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.770
 being with a spatula means that 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.120
 it is well sealed and the water does not 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.820
 penetrates the furniture as it has a layer 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.300
 of nitrocellulose sealer lacquer 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.630
 and this does not penetrate the furniture what 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.690
 can do here is to fix a water let 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.420
 with water is to improve truth yes always 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.670
 many times we do not do like that given to 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.039
 the idea that you can not put water in 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.990
 furniture but in this case as we have the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.250
 furniture and has protected and has already sealed 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.560
 waterproofed with a layer of lacquer 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.800
 can do this 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.530
 It can be done with to see 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.320
 this said that here we have is a light 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.020
 water is used a lot in what is the 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.350
 painted cars and they have also been 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.860
 painted furniture in this case 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.370
 [Music] 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.920
 and the water is not rolled over here 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.920
 I can put it in and nothing does not come undone 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.790
 what we do is sand it 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.520
 and the video pool and nasal the dust 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.690
 what 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.700
 supposedly he left and they do not know if he 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.220
 becomes a white pole but it is already 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.110
 the water 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.470
 and described it as breathe a kilo 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.470
 all right 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.830
 he gave me the wicket I know 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.640
 water no longer meets not 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.170
 it comes off and does not fly or anything that we 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.930
 we benefit because we no longer 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.660
 we are already the mask already because the cop 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.800
 it's not like what 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.040
 the water is kept 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.720
 and look at how it is going back but as 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.550
 milky they normal are going to consult 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.140
 It is very important that for this sanding 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.910
 on the surface but it also 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.040
 add since if it is not sealed it will not go 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.740
 to peel this has to be fine it 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.160
 would see as we say in the other video 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.160
 then for thulium 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.520
 and we are already achieved 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.830
 they had sealed the wood 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.380
 and we can afford to leave 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.120
 ours until the hairlines of the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.640
 spatula what we've done before 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.640
 disappear we use in this way 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.299
 we must do it with sanding from 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:14.469
 220 up can be 220 can be 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:18.120
 of 300 out of 400 out of 500 600 but less than 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:20.959
 220 not if we're not going to grate anything 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.959
 in this way 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.139
 [Music] 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.139
 that is all wet 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.780
 the important thing is that you have to 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.780
 disappear 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.060
 [Music] 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.960
 ends the ends 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.960
 with water 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.130
 [Music] 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.840
 does not penetrate the wood but we must 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.320
 take care that you did not get lost because if 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.920
 they peel good can have problems there 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.660
 it is important that we do not fight 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.340
 only what is necessary only that is 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.370
 same in everything and that is like a 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.640
 report all this once we have 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.260
 finish of linares and we passed to what 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.260
 It is the last point 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.150
 and we avoid that dust that 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.840
 it came off before 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:27.410
 and so we have concluded in today's video 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.300
 already with sanding to water do not forget 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.700
 Sanding to water and you can also be 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.790
 communicate finer this I have here 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.620
 it's a child number place and it's thinner 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.229
 finest 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.919
 do not choose much not and also you can already 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.919
 as we review 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.660
 well here many videos but you can 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.190
 give a revised on everything like sanding more 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.740
 fine number 1600 and with that we will already have 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.790
 concluded the video I hope this video 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.950
 it is useful to you all I hope that 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.770

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.580

 there is the statute bundled of the furniture and 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.020
