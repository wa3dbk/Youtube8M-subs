next to the Mamet's monument and while I
don't<00:00:36.510> think<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.750> should<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:37.079> any<00:00:37.110> there<00:00:38.780> and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
of this you know let's give everybody

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.430 
of this you know let's give everybody
equal<00:02:20.800> time<00:02:21.340> stuff<00:02:22.120> yeah<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.840> know<00:02:22.930> because

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
equal time stuff yeah you know because

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.220 
equal time stuff yeah you know because
at<00:02:24.340> what<00:02:24.580> point<00:02:24.910> does<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.150> become<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.810> absurd

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
at what point does it become just absurd

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.860 
at what point does it become just absurd
when<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.769> I<00:02:27.099> mean<00:02:27.370> not<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.420> know<00:02:28.540> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
when you have I mean not that you know a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.949 
when you have I mean not that you know a
crash<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:30.130> satanic<00:02:30.730> display<00:02:31.180> side<00:02:31.569> by<00:02:31.750> side

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
crash and a satanic display side by side

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.110 
crash and a satanic display side by side
have<00:02:32.410> gotten<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.069> absurd<00:02:33.400> point<00:02:33.730> but<00:02:33.940> once

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
have gotten to the absurd point but once

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.930 
have gotten to the absurd point but once
we've<00:02:34.300> littered<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.900> landscape<00:02:35.440> with

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
we've littered the landscape with

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.240 
we've littered the landscape with
everybody's<00:02:37.019> display<00:02:38.019> out<00:02:38.290> there<00:02:38.560> at<00:02:38.769> some

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
everybody's display out there at some

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.330 
everybody's display out there at some
point<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.519> does<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.299> little<00:02:40.630> ridiculous

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
point it does get a little ridiculous

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.970 
point it does get a little ridiculous
and<00:02:42.340> as<00:02:42.970> Rachel<00:02:43.629> Maddow<00:02:43.810> would<00:02:44.049> say<00:02:44.290> what
