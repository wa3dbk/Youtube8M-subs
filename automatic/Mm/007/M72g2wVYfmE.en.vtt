00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.220
 Last year we already showed you Furka in the Amsterdam urban area 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.560
 museum made drawings on his skin for 24 hours 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.600
 but here in Rotterdam an artist is going to be fair 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.289
 marjolein van den assem draws on her every day for no less than a year 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:15.629
 twitter 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.550
 recently made her all the last part in touring and we were there 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.020
 I had the uitmarkt 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.320
 our grandson was tired of recording it there 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.950
 I saw that his departure was fit that week 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.879
 9 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.379
 carrefour is to learn it installed i make one there 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 if a drawing had been put up for sale, twitter will give him a response 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.880
 from an art collector who says what a beautiful drawing 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 I thought 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.220
 I also think that the fantastic technique of taking each other make it up 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 yes 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.650
 that kept the current program reporting 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.710
 The municipality of Dinkelland has very little 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.090
 and it was precisely because of this that I learned to learn a lot 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.090
 and at the same time it is a day to be expected 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 the so is i am fast 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.650
 then vogts 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.399
 terror over peat but that only makes me a combatant and so 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.749
 Sometimes four lines are set before the afterdeck holding it 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.890
 can think of hard and software 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.130
 or the words 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.750
 this intense coming 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.159
 i think it is a fantastic technique this is sooo straight i have her 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.520
 last year because every day 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.549
 to kill I am very disciplined of myself to that has also been shown 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.490
 that last a whole year 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 regardless of the circumstances or bowl like or 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.400
 Quite a few other people's lives can happen 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
 we make it for her 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.719
 there 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.260
 I thought it was very important that it wasn't going to be the art they are 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.269
 I feel that it is also a daily drawing unpretentious 2 that 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.340
 I woke up a bit more today 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.700
 and I looked around the night to cancella formless perfectly despondent 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.150
 that means seeing a decline 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.359
 or rebellious chains 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.389
 there is literally what happens 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.619
 the 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.029
 the 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.539
 there will be, among other things, the year 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.539
 to be allowed to go 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.989
 when a 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:13.889
 Sunday
