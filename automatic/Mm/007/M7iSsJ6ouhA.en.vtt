00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:02.660
 investing in bed 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.730
 yes a bit and on that location picked up but yes well considering my back still 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.809
 I've been in the hospital for three weeks, the most well known 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:11.709
 summer 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.489
 that activation not for the first time 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.810
 so real for that so do not walk and at least do not touch 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.130
 I'm training now 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.300
 that trainer does not that I supervise doing with a cell 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.609
 and convert the exercise bike to cycling and yes just sit upright then 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.609
 yes spain spira then it will automatically become stronger and stronger 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.660
 so yes I am now about all of them takes two hours that I can sit 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.660
 but well 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.170
 sometimes real movement like I work before, your muscles are immediately laid flat 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.480
 both take it easy 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.510
 But well after all it is all considerably less pain than you can for 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.920
 why it started with the bacterium with that inflammation 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.500
 but I don't make this video there 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.520
 this is a region because of years of sitting in the middle of the world 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.910
 world Championship football 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.850
 and of course there are a lot of real elections and mountains and that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.960
 kind of business 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.880
 and TNT for the pressure of my grounds and the room will later or caramba 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.300
 to the Netherlands 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.760
 because I launched that 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.960
 and what a huge amount of tickets it is 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.880
 the lighters and cards 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.060
 because it becomes the best football player is chosen as the best commercial 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.270
 chosen 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.790
 some competition nowadays a lot of tv I normally make PVV 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.320
 although I must say that I explain how I see it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.990
 and I have to say with the world cup is quite funny that will probably come up with 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.030
 recently I saw an advertisement of the igloo and the fish fingers 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.430
 well i especially like that is typical that a little bit of jumping is there to get there 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.110
 like a fridge 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.970
 and entrepreneurs strongly argued against which state then you will be witnesses responded 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.340
 trickett hour talk and then 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.140
 poet roast works for quite funny 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.360
 And yes, there is a lot of RTV today 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.930
 but well on the bed I can do very little else 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.800
 so I had figured this out so from a bet do the three years and k 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.990
 although the oldest oriental on but she was quietly reached in the week 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.369
 kuyt is the goal of the so you can choose the best abba man netherlands 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:27.779
 in particular also because those made up to twenty that he made up to 20 select at 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.299
 the smart broadcaster received a lot of comments 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.759
 yes all jealous that she is running so well here I can't help it either 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.479
 make good videos there 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:39.019
 But then they start pissing about Joris and the dragon that he is not at number one 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.529
 because to get the most with the most likely it will gradually go out 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.609
 drawers that win 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.290
 those people that I love sitting there very book people are just good ones 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.889
 roller coaster look really just 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.709
 but from the speed of her job and not so much why it will stir bolt 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.849
 is whether it is a unique albanian or 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.439
 that it can be just a lot he only has the fastest roller coaster is the 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.469
 best equipment works in the long term it is definitely not that I do 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.139
 given the top 20 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:10.429
 and so there are also real few that end up very low and then very different 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.699
 if some don't understand anything but well then that's a personal list but 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.379
 I already have a lot of comments on it and therefore invited seven years to see the 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.809
 football now all those elections are what i said with all sorts of football 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:23.239
 elections advertising elections like that 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.650
 that I that we go to gig 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.350
 it quite often just after the region with the top 20 jobs already chosen 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.380
 was by the visitors to the stability and then I sat a bit 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.079
 more idea what is very popular 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.749
 so i would say come to a week silent in me said you went fitch s and that says 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.349
 rudi strauss also online again 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.589
 The extreme right I have paid the bills so nature was me I was 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.089
 forget to pay 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:53.539
 so that they have been offline for three months maaike back online but yes one 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.709
 series of trey sparkling streamers shifting a bundle of nature 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.540
 advertise the event and smoothly 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.129
 for the beautiful pictures all beautiful fireworks especially in the world cup with that big 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.389
 book that you will 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.929
 nice to have a look 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.929
 but the extreme the emission points after about the roller coasters 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:13.369
 and choose your most popular abba outside diary there can only be voters who clean 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.929
 people 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.519
 or that either 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.190
 well my own choice is of course already known which is the joris and the dragon in the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.319
 the explanation thereof 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.710
 and I am just giving it because they are the church's answer and 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.939
 one was completely pathetic and funny 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.180
 you can only explain on a4 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.530
 and that send why they chose this list so that I believe here completely 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.009
 good at his head is max 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.849
 and already laughing 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.530
 painfully yes guys were rockets would racer 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.830
 yes I mean to say race roller coaster to where you are in the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.850
 neighborhood we had the 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.800
 cook chase monastery in which residents mother also struggle not to put on a motorcycle 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.040
 making is afterwards broken unfortunately really whole without it was really nice 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.419
 roller coaster that was 10 years 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.409
 he also has his but not so much like this trainer against each other 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.999
 but actually only the last and real goal is that with a role that is 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.759
 I believe 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.439
 real came together and you can start up together 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.210
 but it will be both Antwerp models 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.860
 barely cows, I can once again withstand marketing also a raid, I believe 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.050
 but now online is still on my mind 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.539
 also on the channel the experiment 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.129
 shock claeys comfort food I believe 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.089
 determined on appeal 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.449
 but sometimes there was in the neighborhood and to the stopera 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.759
 in eilat short anthura 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.360
 and I don't think you have the rest 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.620
 to my knowledge none 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.419
 the year 6 in the neighborhood may not have you come to light that 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.069
 connie neighbor door maybe I was serious there 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.069
 far away in france but not at the front in france anyway 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.199
 yeah well so you know we already have three races there they will score you one 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.810
 very high second is the reactors brand and internationally both brands is coach 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.580
 it makes that mistake that traffic 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.819
 but it is built by one but that also has offices built a price too 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.069
 wrap up and 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.770
 so delicious a mess there 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.990
 Troy in it also very good top all very much there can be very much 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.990
 changes of directions may not place any straight 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.389
 so that's why joris and the dragon with me is number one but maybe you are 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.430
 says Cowboy, the Moluccas to then 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.990
 with me there is no such peel and didi that speed then you come on 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.439
 time to blast might be rent but that launch at the express 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:24.400
 I think it is very cool 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.600
 and that is why I am worried about this again, or do you say that you do not like it, I just have it whole 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.339
 many memories of the frog roller coaster in Duinrell 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:35.080
 the first sample was taken as a trial year 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.390
 that you therefore that to bankers it is natural for everyone that is 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:39.449
 in person 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.460
 but I want to hear that there is a little look what is in the Netherlands le 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.439
 journal which attackers who are the most popular 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.520
 so i would say guys just ww external link when voting while their 

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:52.199
 child with a cheeky woman 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.139
 with that of course 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.100
 even leave it alone
