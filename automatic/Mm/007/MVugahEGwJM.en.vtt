00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:21.080
 In this issue, I will show how I bake 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.269
 gum rubber mold well itself 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.119
 the process of cutting and laying rubber i 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.800
 I will not show like on u tube 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.800
 a lot of information about this 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:43.430
 so stop there and not 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:47.020
 I will be here already ready collecting form we can in 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:51.340
 aluminum such pallets 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.340
 sold in disposable dishes all 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:59.719
 control will use will 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:02.350
 use our device is universal and 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.350
 so let's say 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.899
 1 pallet is needed just that sometimes tires 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:35.869
 climbs out of shape and gets on ted 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.869
 shooter protect you so use 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:47.750
 We take a thermo couple and we put only to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.979
 she touched get the most forms 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.979
 Specifically, the temperature showed 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.460
 away from n.a. 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:29.500
 this is set to 170 degrees and we will 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:45.580
 bake this form somewhere around 90 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:49.420
 minutes after power on and lowered slightly 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.400
 to 150 degrees because here's the first 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.970
 time when it warms up the stove can 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.630
 be a jump then a higher temperature for 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.030
 bricks 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:05.980
 there is inertia so the first time is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:09.450
 so and then increase the temperature to 170 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.450
 175 degrees 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:25.340
 here is the gum ready already cut 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:32.710
 You can see what is baked in the oven 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:35.710
 very well then tried a shard can 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.710
 third 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:32.680
 Well, I have a stove and a half kilowatt 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:36.910
 well insulated plates here 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:42.340
 mullite siliceous here asbestos 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:45.890
 foil door covered with asbestos cardboard 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:51.140
 such a heater when buying release 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:55.730
 that for dith muffle are used very 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.650
 convenient thing inertia stove somewhere five 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:03.850
 degrees is 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.850
 which is very good
