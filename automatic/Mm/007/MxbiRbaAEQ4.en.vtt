00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
the keys here as well yes certainly it's

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.550 
the keys here as well yes certainly it's
obviously<00:04:15.030> we've<00:04:15.239> we've<00:04:15.900> been<00:04:16.049> away<00:04:16.260> for<00:04:16.530> a

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
obviously we've we've been away for a

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.469 
obviously we've we've been away for a

in it's great to get back together get
back<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.239> work<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.860> obviously<00:04:22.860> being<00:04:23.099> yeah

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
back to work and obviously being yeah

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.490 
back to work and obviously being yeah
away<00:04:24.060> together<00:04:24.270> full<00:04:24.599> up<00:04:24.750> here<00:04:24.930> at<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.110> time

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
away together full up here at a time

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.190 
away together full up here at a time
traveling<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.640> certainly<00:04:27.210> helps<00:04:27.570> build<00:04:28.020> that

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
traveling it certainly helps build that

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.240 
traveling it certainly helps build that
team<00:04:28.410> spirit<00:04:29.810> on<00:04:30.810> top<00:04:31.380> of<00:04:31.410> all<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.920> training

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
team spirit on top of all the training

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.010 
team spirit on top of all the training
with<00:04:32.340> doing<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.670> I<00:04:32.850> think<00:04:32.880> that's<00:04:33.150> that's

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
with doing that I think that's that's

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.340 
with doing that I think that's that's
really<00:04:34.170> part<00:04:34.620> important<00:04:35.220> part<00:04:35.460> of<00:04:35.520> preseason

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
really part important part of preseason

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.290 
really part important part of preseason
and<00:04:37.350> getting<00:04:37.650> ready<00:04:37.740> for<00:04:38.070> ya<00:04:38.430> what<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.030> always

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
and getting ready for ya what is always

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.620 
and getting ready for ya what is always
a<00:04:39.330> long<00:04:39.780> season<00:04:39.990> ahead<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:41.070> obviously<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.730> boat

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
a long season ahead and obviously a boat

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.390 
a long season ahead and obviously a boat
the<00:04:42.750> fitness<00:04:43.080> it's<00:04:43.500> not<00:04:43.650> just<00:04:43.950> about<00:04:44.070> that

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
the fitness it's not just about that

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.030 
the fitness it's not just about that
it's<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.670> bit<00:04:44.820> imagine<00:04:45.210> being<00:04:45.360> able<00:04:45.420> to<00:04:46.040> make

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
it's a bit imagine being able to make

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.300 
it's a bit imagine being able to make
some<00:04:47.280> key<00:04:47.640> tactical<00:04:48.420> decisions<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:49.680> will<00:04:50.130> go

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
some key tactical decisions that will go

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.680 
some key tactical decisions that will go
ahead<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.670> summer<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.350> early<00:04:53.060> on<00:04:54.060> in<00:04:54.300> the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.300 
ahead in the summer and early on in the
season<00:04:54.840> that's<00:04:55.500> something<00:04:55.770> that's<00:04:55.980> very

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
season that's something that's very

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.000 
season that's something that's very
important<00:04:56.940> for<00:04:57.200> going<00:04:58.200> into<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.500> new<00:04:58.830> season

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
fresh ideas possibly new players so that

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.159 
fresh ideas possibly new players so that
all<00:05:20.820> yeah<00:05:21.000> there's<00:05:21.180> all<00:05:21.300> sorts<00:05:21.540> of<00:05:21.630> tactical

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
all yeah there's all sorts of tactical

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.730 
all yeah there's all sorts of tactical
and<00:05:22.770> technical<00:05:22.800> stuff<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:23.610> do<00:05:23.730> as<00:05:23.850> well<00:05:24.030> so

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
and technical stuff to do as well so

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.050 
and technical stuff to do as well so
yeah<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.770> lot<00:05:25.919> of<00:05:26.040> work<00:05:26.190> crammed<00:05:26.490> into<00:05:26.700> a<00:05:26.820> short

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
yeah a lot of work crammed into a short

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.050 
yeah a lot of work crammed into a short
space<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.390> time<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:28.729> hopefully<00:05:29.729> that<00:05:30.030> is

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
space of time and hopefully that is

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.210 
space of time and hopefully that is
that's<00:05:30.630> what's<00:05:30.840> going<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.710> know<00:05:31.830> be<00:05:32.010> the

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
that's what's going to you know be the

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.580 
that's what's going to you know be the
foundation<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.300> guess<00:05:33.479> for<00:05:33.750> a<00:05:33.780> successful

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
foundation I guess for a successful

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.860 
foundation I guess for a successful
season
