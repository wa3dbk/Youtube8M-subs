 never 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.800
 in the presence of that in the coming years 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.399
 yes such graves 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.800
 very special properties 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.929
 we conducted many experiments on 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.740
 impact on water samples with the most 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.489
 various factors 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.569
 magnetic fields diet fields 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.759
 percentage of personal objects but also in that

 what is his purpose

 positive and in negative it 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.220
 most active 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.070
 moment neighbor 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.900
 in the laboratory of Professor Korotkov 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.270
 outstanding have been passed 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.260
 experiments on the effects of human 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 emotions on the water 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.970
 a group of people asked 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.239
 project on 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.700
 the hill of glory that stood before them 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.780
 most positive 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.719
 anniversary of tenderness 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.780
 care 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.570
 then changed to my forehead 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.290
 and again asked to concentrate 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.350
 ongoing action but others 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 a feeling of fear and greek hate 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.180
 then made measurements of samples 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.620
 changes in the charge clearly pronounced 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 orientation 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 that is, love increases by 10 kopecks 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.540
 percentage and stabilized year 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.730
 process and lawyers goes down 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.300
 changes dramatically when I found it possible 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.859
 thanks to this planet 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.349
 I decided to try to show people to 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.830
 give back has memory 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.460
 in the laboratory of the doctor and moldova are investigated 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.290
 water samples that are exposed 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.240
 different types of exposure 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.090
 impressions are provided with 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.619
 using her swift 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.619
 freezing successors 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.810
 what does the heated water look like 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.360
 microwave oven 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 Cairo 5 thousand mobile phones 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.909
 I was told today 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.690
 thank 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.690
 decline 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.290
 you disgust me
