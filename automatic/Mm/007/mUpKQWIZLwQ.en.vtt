00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.080
 I'll call you back with one 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.970
 new comments back and there today 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.980
 it's the top five better place again 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.199
 and in fifth place we have the same here 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.420
 the optician shows what he is doing 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.620
 Kemper makes seven pieces here 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.480
 this roof is really a 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.980
 Bit crass and the only thing you can 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.690
 should do with it then is the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.879
 with a circle I think it's all right 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.780
 great clip thanks for that and we do 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.070
 continue with place four 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 and here we have the andreas he 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.699
 really pretty, he played 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.920
 here the apg shoots here on the 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.989
 scout eli caught the one but you 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.550
 sees only shoot the pilot out like that 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.590
 I have never really seen anything 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.969
 really blatant but the best 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.070
 could because there is the second 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.410
 scout eli and zack he still has 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.910
 really well done two helis in that way 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.860
 short time and above all things the 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.570
 one is still heal he takes then 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.369
 Just like that, I would too 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.729
 make room of the real class 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.890
 four 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.860
 thanks again and we will continue 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.210
 third place 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.800
 and here we have the christie chris 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.869
 with a really pretty cool one 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.979
 I've never had tactics in the game like this 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.439
 seen he goes on the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.090
 passenger seat catches the jet with the 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.710
 Of course he does not smog and that's not what he does 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.280
 only once no, that will come now 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.140
 once again 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.610
 because the tactics seems really good 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.049
 he has that too now 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.130
 So you can do that again 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.229
 go on a little bit further 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.579
 Here comes the next scout elia 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.439
 unfortunately a bit unfavorable here 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.329
 hit flies on the side but no 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.220
 he hits the loose really well 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.229
 and I'll tell you a little bit about 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.070
 Chris, we'll see something like that soon 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.600
 For a long time we continue with second place 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.310
 and here we have the wupsi jaja the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.439
 really a blatant sniper shot 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.149
 I lie here my first opponent 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.250
 I would have hit that too 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.140
 I just say once, however, the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.939
 second one is really far away and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.140
 i do not say that much yet but it is 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.850
 really very well done 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.890
 he sees the transport here 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.230
 Of course helicopter shoots on it 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.940
 and really gets the pilot 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.620
 unbelievably blatant as I said 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.910
 I can never and from the one very 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.910
 deserved second place 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.730
 and we already have the first place 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.650
 again the Kristic chris I told you so 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.180
 just hinted and what he tears 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.910
 here I can hardly believe it 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.590
 a rendezvous and what a really 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.700
 he does it incredibly well 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.630
 of course also back to the job 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.640
 enter 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.709
 really the best I ever have 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.450
 So I really got it 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.580
 Respect for you, you have 2 super here 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.930
 clip zangl delivered I hope I 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.620
 see you again in the next one 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.510
 from that 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.980
 Thank you for that, of course, thank you 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.600
 all others who participated 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.430
 your links are of course in the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.810
 descriptions so the people look 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.760
 sometimes they do it themselves 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.470
 You are welcome to visit videos 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.209
 I have linked all and otherwise 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.250
 Of course you can also use your clips 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.470
 a rich by her form in the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.360
 The description is very important 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.190
 this is loading your clips only 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.900
 google drive up i have it unfortunately 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.610
 even in the last time it experienced that 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.050
 was just somewhere else uploaded 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.760
 sadly, I can not do that 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.290
 only consider who the form 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.390
 Filling in correctly will also 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.890
 otherwise, as I said, I take into consideration 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.900
 I hope the whole thing failed one 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.580
 Of course rating would be great and that 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.720
 it was now my name is more quest 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.720
 and I'm out now
