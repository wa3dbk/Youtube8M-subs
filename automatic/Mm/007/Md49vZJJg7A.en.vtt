00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.059
 now from other tutors more fingering 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.660
 of herself series of two of two series 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.160
 of three fingers of four we saw the invention 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.310
 what we did with an alumni vÃ©lez series of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.900
 five and with the theory that if there can be 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.240
 a series of five of those that had 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 repeating of the series of four 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.500
 some of the fingers other than the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.310
 first and last the series with that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.230
 same concept 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.410
 let's work the series of six fingers 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.930
 that although there are many more combinations 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.129
 then they're going to notice that in the series of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.979
 20 were 12 in the 34 in the 24 were 48 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.710
 in series 5 here are 96 combinations 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.860
 different 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.989
 when working as I say one per day there 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.879
 kill yourself because I did not know a laburo 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.350
 long term let's not say 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.360
 necessarily have to do all the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.640
 possible combinations but it is the idea 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.350
 is to create the hand that is me 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.420
 I propose that three three one two three 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:06.049
 four and that you make 321 our four 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.049
 it is understood why if I touch 32 13 4 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:16.429
 between 2 1 2 3 4 is an example but as 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.360
 it was from the beginning we did not say they are 96 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:23.719
 combinations before were 33 from the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.030
 finger 1 with 12 and the series were 6 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.240
 combinations of three fingers from the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.329
 finger 16 of the 26th day of the 13th and from the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.969
 4 in series 4 the same must happen in 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.229
 the 5 were already a little bit more birds are 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:41.360
 24 combinations starting from the finger 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.340
 124 starting from the river 2 of 3 from 4 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.590
 If everyone does not worry they will be 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.470
 written last also to that we have 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.030
 we have them all written here if 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.630
 they want some very close sinks 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.100
 and can freeze the image 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.229
 quietly of the video enlarged the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.710
 screen freeze the same they will have 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.509
 written below if I happen to show you a 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.869
 couple of examples no more so as not to 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.479
 Separate us as much and as I say 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.670
 patience and holy peace and I feel that way 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.650
 for example I have to repeat and 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.950
 risk two fingers I'm going to do the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.950
 easier than everything that would be 12 24 23 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.950
 1 2 3 4 23 do not lift what you do not do 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.209
 missing the 1 and the 2 very its lack lifts or 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.209
 he did not do it 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.110
 yes 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.290
 as it gives us group here I have many more 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.329
 options can group 2004 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.400
 or is accentuated every two and then the 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.400
 four in a row he could do three and three 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.129
 so if I think that the most 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:15.379
 familiar with everything because we have his 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:15.379
 couple 3 and 3 1 2 3 21 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.110
 so I have the seat in 1 and 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.110
 the seat in 4 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.620
 four of the combinations 1 2 3 4 24 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.150
 and so on 12 34 32 this is 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.530
 easy because I'm going flight look is also 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.750
 well that play as I said in another 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.220
 exercise that when they are movements 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.560
 rare out there difficult to the hand 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.049
 think of something that makes the hand if it goes or 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.080
 although then I say I have to do 1 2 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.370
 3 4 3 2 and the hands the fingers are equal 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.370
 in fixes it's as if they bounce 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.389
 ah 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.169
 discover too many ideas because we have 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.919
 all possible combinations 1 2 3 4 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.919
 3 4 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.020
 seats are understood every 333 of what 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.640
 more the more familiar say we can not 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:21.020
 get to sound once we have them 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:23.780
 well sure and the body jumps and 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.990
 mind to do some ago and then it's that 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.360
 someone the combinations are 96 I do not know 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.910
 put evil does not get tense in the last and 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.950
 the first are always the easiest 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:38.630
 continue to be the last one there is 4 3 2 1 2 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:41.890
 3 also think that the fingers are going 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.890
 to one side and back to the other 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.200
 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 6 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.919
 that's how it's like this 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.130
 no more he wants to slow us down in the 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.130
 finger 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.370
 it was understood there they are going to have all 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.639
 writings can be contacted can 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.659
 subscribe to the channel 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.710
 send comments are invited 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:29.169
 they can also have later news 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:33.120
 to be presenting us in future 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.120
