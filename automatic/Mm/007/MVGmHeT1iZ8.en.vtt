00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
finally five to six ounces of spinach
and<00:00:39.090> I've<00:00:39.180> actually<00:00:39.329> used<00:00:39.540> organic<00:00:40.500> baby

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and I've actually used organic baby

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.740 
and I've actually used organic baby
spinach<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.120> think<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.660> is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
spinach for this because I think it is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.990 
spinach for this because I think it is
awesome<00:00:42.960> even<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.070> organic<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.700> still

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
awesome even if it is organic you still

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.729 
awesome even if it is organic you still
should<00:00:45.210> give<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> good<00:00:45.840> wash<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.620> little

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
should give it a good wash a little

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
should give it a good wash a little
scrub<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> dub<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.969> case<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.660> sure

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
scrub a dub just in case just to be sure

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.750 
scrub a dub just in case just to be sure
so<00:00:49.170> depending<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:50.100> juicer<00:00:50.489> calls

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
so depending on what your juicer calls

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.250 
so depending on what your juicer calls
for<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.180> completely<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
for it's completely up to you but what I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
for it's completely up to you but what I
do<00:00:52.379> first<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.370> squeeze<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> half

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
do first is I actually squeeze the half

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.689 
do first is I actually squeeze the half
a<00:00:54.510> lemon<00:00:54.660> juice<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.320> an<00:00:55.620> actual<00:00:55.980> citrus<00:00:56.489> kind

of<00:00:56.850> press<00:00:57.059> thing<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.539> don't<00:00:57.600> actually<00:00:57.840> run<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
of press thing I don't actually run it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
of press thing I don't actually run it
through<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.500> juicer<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.520> would<00:00:59.670> have

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
through my juicer because I would have

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
through my juicer because I would have
to<00:00:59.940> remove<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.020> kind<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.530> fruit<00:01:01.859> from<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
to remove the kind of fruit from the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.889 
to remove the kind of fruit from the
rind<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> long<00:01:03.449> process

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
rind which is just like a long process

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.179 
rind which is just like a long process
and<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.080> feel<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.320> kind<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.589> waste<00:01:04.769> some<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and I feel like kind of waste some of it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.740 
and I feel like kind of waste some of it
so<00:01:05.369> I've<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:05.640> kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> already<00:01:06.299> prepped

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so I've actually kind of already prepped

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
so I've actually kind of already prepped
to<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:07.020> vegetables<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.650> everything<00:01:07.770> come<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
to my vegetables and everything come and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.310 
to my vegetables and everything come and
might<00:01:08.760> prove<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.299> how<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.689> need<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.260> my

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
might prove just how I need it for my

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.810 
might prove just how I need it for my
juicer<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.100> thing<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.340> didn't<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.670> was

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
juicer but the one thing I didn't do was

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
juicer but the one thing I didn't do was
peel<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> ginger<00:01:12.180> which<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.170> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> do

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
peel the ginger which you need to do

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320 
peel the ginger which you need to do
ahead<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> time<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:14.939> wanted<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
ahead of time and I actually wanted to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.490 
ahead of time and I actually wanted to
show<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:15.720> easy<00:01:15.869> way<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> do<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.380> because

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
show you an easy way to do this because

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
show you an easy way to do this because
when<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> first<00:01:16.920> started<00:01:17.310> doing<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.520> juice<00:01:17.909> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
when I first started doing this juice I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
when I first started doing this juice I
always<00:01:18.420> peeking<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.290> my<00:01:19.500> fingers<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
always peeking at it with my fingers and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.050 
always peeking at it with my fingers and

so I'm going to show you a really quick
and<00:01:22.439> easy<00:01:22.619> way<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> peel<00:01:23.369> your

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and easy way that you can peel your

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.690 
and easy way that you can peel your
ginger<00:01:23.909> take<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.540> concave<00:01:25.439> side<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
ginger take the concave side of a just a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
ginger take the concave side of a just a
regular<00:01:27.090> spoon<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.840> you're<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
regular spoon and you're actually just

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.810 
regular spoon and you're actually just
going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> gently<00:01:28.890> drag<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> along<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
going to gently drag it along the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.359 
going to gently drag it along the
outside<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.780> root<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> best

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
outside of the root and this is the best

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.140 
outside of the root and this is the best
way<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.670> my

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
way and my

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.360 
way and my
you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.770> takes<00:01:35.040> away

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
you can do this because it takes away

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.120 
you can do this because it takes away
the<00:01:35.550> least<00:01:35.850> actual<00:01:36.600> root<00:01:36.900> fiber<00:01:37.230> and<00:01:37.620> really

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the least actual root fiber and really

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550 
the least actual root fiber and really
just<00:01:38.400> mostly<00:01:38.970> only<00:01:39.780> takes<00:01:40.020> off<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> skin

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
just mostly only takes off the skin

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.080 
just mostly only takes off the skin
which<00:01:40.800> is<00:01:40.980> excellent<00:01:41.370> so<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.910> you've

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
which is excellent so now that you've

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.490 
which is excellent so now that you've
got<00:01:42.240> everything<00:01:42.330> prepped<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.050> ready<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
got everything prepped and ready the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
got everything prepped and ready the
very<00:01:43.680> next<00:01:43.890> step<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.370> to<00:01:44.640> go<00:01:44.790> ahead<00:01:44.910> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
very next step is just to go ahead and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.160 
very next step is just to go ahead and
start<00:01:45.300> running<00:01:45.450> everything<00:01:45.780> through<00:01:45.930> your

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
start running everything through your

00:01:46.170 --> 00:02:02.120 
start running everything through your
juicer<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.170> final<00:02:01.440> thing<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.980> just

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
juicer so the final thing I kind of just

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
juicer so the final thing I kind of just
wanted<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> share<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.510> guys<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.900> that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.949 
that you use it's very very possible and
also<00:02:14.220> sometimes<00:02:14.580> delicious<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.420> save<00:02:15.690> this

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
also sometimes delicious to save this

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.810 
also sometimes delicious to save this
and<00:02:16.230> make<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.590> into<00:02:16.800> some<00:02:16.980> kind<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.220> cracker<00:02:17.490> so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
and make it into some kind of cracker so

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.190 
and make it into some kind of cracker so
you<00:02:17.880> can<00:02:18.090> even<00:02:18.209> freeze<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:18.930> you're<00:02:19.050> juicing

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you can even freeze it if you're juicing

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.199 
you can even freeze it if you're juicing
some<00:02:19.530> fruits<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:19.980> pickle<00:02:20.220> sorbet<00:02:20.760> or<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.090> can

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
some fruits and pickle sorbet or you can

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.640 
some fruits and pickle sorbet or you can
actually<00:02:21.330> run<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.780> through<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> juicer<00:02:22.230> for<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
actually run it through the juicer for a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.260 
actually run it through the juicer for a
second<00:02:23.100> time<00:02:23.250> which<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.550> what<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> usually<00:02:23.940> do

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
second time which is what I usually do

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.210 
second time which is what I usually do
to<00:02:24.420> get<00:02:24.630> all<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.709> liquids

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
to get all of the liquids

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.190 
to get all of the liquids
out<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.850> recipe<00:02:27.120> makes<00:02:27.600> roughly<00:02:28.020> two

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
out so this recipe makes roughly two

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.570 
out so this recipe makes roughly two
servings<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.040> need<00:02:29.190> more<00:02:29.310> than<00:02:29.459> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
servings so if you need more than that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.830 
servings so if you need more than that
you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.850> always<00:02:29.970> double<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.450> every<00:02:30.630> day<00:02:30.720> just

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you can always double it every day just

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.330 
you can always double it every day just
making<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.380> yourself<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.740> can<00:02:31.950> cut<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.250> in

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
making it for yourself you can cut it in

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.860
