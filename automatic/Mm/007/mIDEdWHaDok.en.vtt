00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.190
 is living right now in the 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.560
 images and it works for all 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.720
 consoles and all the generations we go 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.790
 to be able to model within our quotation marks 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.670
 vehicles like it 's guys here we have the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.280
 bmx with the mini dad in front we're going to 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.050
 can play our weapons and put them in 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.690
 our vehicles are not worth going to 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.610
 to be able to use but there is a fan 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.040
 and glitch pretty pretty handsome and 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.900
 curious then guys I decided 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.790
 upload some of you there will be 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.430
 seen but I think nobody had 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.770
 come up with the mx I loved guys and 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.960
 I wanted to show you what you see is super 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.880
 handsome then the only thing we have to 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.340
 to do guys is to be with a weapon like 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.200
 mission a hand we point the finger and 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.060
 we take the street car voucher 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.280
 we leave the triangle and upload it to 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.530
 The person's car is worth that, yes we have 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.479
 to get a person out of the car 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.740
 and how is it when we get on the trick? 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.530
 done here as you see had the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.299
 machine gun in a hand that is left 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.979
 quite handsome is in the opposite hand 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.080
 where we shoot it if there 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.060
 someone who says he is not the one who has 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.680
 something went out and now I'm going to teach 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.360
 what do I do with other weapons worth 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.210
 so if we are in a new generation 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.310
 we can do it in the first person 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.590
 that is pretty cool and if not then what 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.509
 we do normal as of guys we 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.700
 we put next to the doors that with 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.950
 the weapon is taken out we point and then 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.750
 when we get up we have the mimicry in the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.729
 car then that we are left like 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.399
 Moderate cars are quite new 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.289
 see here we have the buffalo with the 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.909
 mineral in the front were 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.649
 the 'bad guys' I liked this 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.780
 piece of curiosity although we can not 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.909
 shoot but the weapons are left 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.460
 super plays then when we're 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.750
 driving the same here we have it with the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.729
 motorbike guys that is also done 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.619
 completely equal if you do not want 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.569
 do with a motorbike then do it with a 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.340
 friend is worth it if you want to do it with 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.590
 mini dad with some machine gun with 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.909
 anything, you can do it 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.340
 stealing a car from the street worth that yes 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.019
 you have to get someone out of the car with 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.470
 the weapon so that you stay played 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.420

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.640
