long conveyor belts and these send the
parts<00:01:25.039> all<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.399> way<00:01:25.460> down<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.759> their

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
parts all the way down to their

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.999 
parts all the way down to their
designated<00:01:26.270> modules<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.740> look<00:01:27.890> at<00:01:27.950> the

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
designated modules you look at the

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.580 
designated modules you look at the
bottom<00:01:28.310> these<00:01:29.229> modules<00:01:30.229> are<00:01:30.289> actually

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590

arm<00:01:32.509> sorter<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.219> I<00:01:34.219> basically<00:01:34.460> barb<00:01:34.939> the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
arm sorter and I basically barb the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.690 
arm sorter and I basically barb the

getting them credit for it and I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.760 
getting them credit for it and I
basically<00:01:41.030> modified<00:01:41.630> them<00:01:41.840> each<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.289> sort

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
basically modified them each to sort

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.219 
basically modified them each to sort
specific<00:01:43.189> parts<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.969> these<00:01:44.539> all<00:01:44.750> have<00:01:44.990> their

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
specific parts and these all have their

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.499 
specific parts and these all have their
own<00:01:45.259> battery<00:01:46.159> boxes<00:01:46.549> which<00:01:46.909> have<00:01:46.939> to<00:01:47.179> run<00:01:47.390> out

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
own battery boxes which have to run out

own battery boxes which have to run out
over<00:01:47.689> here

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
over here

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.800 
over here
and<00:01:49.810> here's<00:01:50.020> another<00:01:50.260> one

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.430 

so<00:01:54.170> awkward<00:01:54.650> there<00:01:55.520> we<00:01:55.640> are<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.200> machine

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
so awkward there we are so the machine

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.980 
so awkward there we are so the machine
is<00:01:57.470> all<00:01:57.680> turned<00:01:57.890> on<00:01:58.040> now<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:59.570> is<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.810> bin

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
is all turned on now and this is the bin

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.110 
is all turned on now and this is the bin
where<00:02:00.230> the<00:02:00.350> parts<00:02:00.620> go<00:02:00.770> in<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:01.700> just<00:02:01.910> for

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
where the parts go in and just for

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.640 
where the parts go in and just for
demonstration<00:02:02.720> purposes<00:02:02.750> I'll<00:02:03.290> just<00:02:03.410> drop

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
demonstration purposes I'll just drop

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.110 
demonstration purposes I'll just drop
them<00:02:03.830> one<00:02:03.950> at<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> time<00:02:04.190> this<00:02:04.520> we<00:02:04.729> see<00:02:04.940> what's

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
them one at a time this we see what's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.919 
them one at a time this we see what's
going<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.479> okay<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.260> we<00:02:06.470> got<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.620> file<00:02:06.920> piece<00:02:07.929> we

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
going on okay so we got a file piece we

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.880 
going on okay so we got a file piece we
have<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> plate<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:10.429> we<00:02:10.459> have<00:02:11.090> an<00:02:11.180> axle<00:02:11.510> piece

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
have a plate and we have an axle piece

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.740 
have a plate and we have an axle piece
so<00:02:12.890> they<00:02:13.010> go<00:02:13.130> down<00:02:13.310> here<00:02:13.730> naturally<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
so they go down here naturally the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.260 
so they go down here naturally the
bigger<00:02:14.930> place<00:02:15.200> will<00:02:15.380> go<00:02:15.500> down<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:15.830> way

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
bigger place will go down this way

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.790 
bigger place will go down this way
anything<00:02:17.270> smaller<00:02:17.600> than<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.930> will<00:02:18.500> go<00:02:18.620> down

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
anything smaller than that will go down

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.130 
anything smaller than that will go down
this<00:02:18.950> way<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> pass<00:02:21.050> through<00:02:21.200> there

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
this way and the pass through there

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.580 
this way and the pass through there
where<00:02:24.140> do<00:02:24.200> they<00:02:24.290> go

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
where do they go

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.260 
where do they go
okay<00:02:25.130> now<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.430> plate<00:02:25.820> should<00:02:25.970> be<00:02:26.060> dropping

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
okay now the plate should be dropping

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.100 
okay now the plate should be dropping
off<00:02:26.540> really<00:02:26.810> soon<00:02:27.170> okay<00:02:28.330> there's<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.390> plate<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
off really soon okay there's a plate and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.010 
off really soon okay there's a plate and
there's<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> axle<00:02:31.430> piece<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.510> top<00:02:32.750> piece

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
there's the axle piece and the top piece

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.840 
there's the axle piece and the top piece
just<00:02:33.440> went<00:02:33.620> down<00:02:33.830> this<00:02:34.010> way<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.550> goes<00:02:37.670> in

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
just went down this way and it goes in

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.940 
just went down this way and it goes in
through<00:02:38.000> these<00:02:38.120> cups<00:02:38.390> below<00:02:39.580> there<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:41.950> and

through these cups below there it is and
same<00:02:43.160> name<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.400> axle<00:02:43.760> piece<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.660> look

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
same name of the axle piece if you look

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.140 
same name of the axle piece if you look
on<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.080> side<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.560> Prix<00:02:45.770> order<00:02:46.100> there's<00:02:47.060> a

on this side of the Prix order there's a
whole<00:02:47.420> bunch<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.470> thick<00:02:48.830> upper<00:02:49.040> cups<00:02:49.310> yeah<00:02:50.090> I'm

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
I'm making to my really large parts

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.420 
I'm making to my really large parts
order<00:04:06.700> because<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.940> intend<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.840> have<00:04:08.990> it<00:04:09.140> sort

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
order because I intend to have it sort

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.830 
order because I intend to have it sort
just<00:04:10.430> about<00:04:10.610> all<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.450> parts<00:04:11.690> that<00:04:11.720> are

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
just about all the parts that are

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.360 
just about all the parts that are
currently<00:04:12.020> produced<00:04:12.320> but<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.190> going<00:04:13.310> to

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
currently produced but it's going to

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.130 
currently produced but it's going to
take<00:04:13.490> a<00:04:13.520> while<00:04:13.760> maybe<00:04:14.300> in<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.510> next<00:04:14.750> 10<00:04:14.959> 20

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
take a while maybe in the next 10 20

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.830 
take a while maybe in the next 10 20
years<00:04:15.320> who<00:04:15.800> knows<00:04:15.860> but<00:04:16.640> it's<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.359> project<00:04:17.570> that

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
years who knows but it's a project that

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.930 
years who knows but it's a project that
will<00:04:17.959> work<00:04:18.170> on<00:04:18.410> every<00:04:19.190> now<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.489> then<00:04:19.640> just

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
will work on every now and then just

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.000 
will work on every now and then just
updated<00:04:20.390> everything<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.530> can<00:04:21.680> follow<00:04:21.830> it

updated everything and you can follow it

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.720 
updated everything and you can follow it
on<00:04:22.130> my<00:04:22.220> website

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
on my website

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.630 
on my website
and<00:04:23.690> just<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:23.900> give<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.020> a<00:04:24.110> preview<00:04:24.640> here's

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
and just to give you a preview here's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.430 
and just to give you a preview here's
the<00:04:25.820> little<00:04:26.030> mechanism<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.720> made<00:04:26.990> to

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
the little mechanism that I made to

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.470 
the little mechanism that I made to
hopefully<00:04:27.860> sort<00:04:28.280> Technic<00:04:29.090> bricks<00:04:29.300> from

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
hopefully sort Technic bricks from

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.330 
hopefully sort Technic bricks from
regular<00:04:29.840> bricks<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:32.450> you'll<00:04:32.780> see<00:04:33.340> more

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
regular bricks so you'll see more

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.200 
regular bricks so you'll see more
