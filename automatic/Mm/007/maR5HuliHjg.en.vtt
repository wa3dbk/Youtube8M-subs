00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.930 
here and see what happens
and<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.880> designed<00:02:49.250> yeah<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.459> was<00:02:50.609> made

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
and this is designed yeah it was made

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.199 
and this is designed yeah it was made
when<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.359> zoom<00:02:51.600> 30<00:02:51.959> came<00:02:52.260> out<00:02:52.970> or<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.120> know

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
when the zoom 30 came out or you know

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.059 
when the zoom 30 came out or you know
with<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.480> original<00:02:54.540> zoom<00:02:55.139> so<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:55.650> probably

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
with the original zoom so it's probably

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.710 
with the original zoom so it's probably
gonna<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.400> take<00:02:56.609> a<00:02:56.639> little<00:02:56.819> modification

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
gonna have to take a little modification

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.170 
gonna have to take a little modification
or<00:02:57.889> jiggling<00:02:58.889> around<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.400> get<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.700> done<00:02:59.940> so

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
or jiggling around to get that done so

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.390 
or jiggling around to get that done so
we'll<00:03:00.299> go<00:03:00.389> ahead<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.630> put<00:03:00.750> our<00:03:00.870> zoom<00:03:01.220> 30<00:03:02.220> in

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
we'll go ahead and put our zoom 30 in

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.849 
we'll go ahead and put our zoom 30 in
there<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.850> what<00:03:02.970> happens

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
there and see what happens

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.099 
there and see what happens
power<00:03:04.859> it<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:05.450> put<00:03:06.450> some<00:03:06.480> LEDs<00:03:07.109> right<00:03:07.410> there

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
power it on put some LEDs right there

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.910 
power it on put some LEDs right there
those<00:03:10.109> LEDs<00:03:10.620> indicate<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.310> volume<00:03:11.730> yes<00:03:12.920> okay

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
those LEDs indicate the volume yes okay

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.660 
those LEDs indicate the volume yes okay
so<00:03:13.950> let's<00:03:14.549> see<00:03:14.850> here

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:50.629 

see<00:03:22.670> go<00:03:23.670> ahead<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:24.060> shuffle<00:03:24.569> all

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:04:05.220 

therefore<00:04:02.099> I'll<00:04:03.099> throw<00:04:03.340> some<00:04:03.989> information<00:04:04.989> on

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
therefore I'll throw some information on

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.449 
therefore I'll throw some information on
gesund<00:04:05.829> comm<00:04:07.739> take<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.769> look<00:04:08.980> at<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.129> little

gesund comm take a look at a little

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.569 
gesund comm take a look at a little
closer<00:04:09.870> anyway<00:04:10.870> this<00:04:11.079> is<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.579> outset

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
closer anyway this is the outset

closer anyway this is the outset
glancing<00:04:13.150> in<00:04:13.389> 604<00:04:15.750> speaker<00:04:16.750> dock<00:04:17.500> there's<00:04:18.489> a

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
glancing in 604 speaker dock there's a

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.069 
glancing in 604 speaker dock there's a
newer<00:04:18.880> version<00:04:19.150> that<00:04:19.509> just<00:04:19.539> came<00:04:19.870> out

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
recently I'm not sure yet if this is

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.390 
recently I'm not sure yet if this is
gonna<00:04:22.780> fit<00:04:22.990> in<00:04:23.169> there<00:04:23.289> or<00:04:23.440> not<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:23.860> I'm<00:04:24.340> sure

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.520 
gonna fit in there or not but I'm sure
that<00:04:24.699> I<00:04:24.970> will<00:04:25.300> figure<00:04:25.630> out<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:25.870> way<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.139> make<00:04:26.410> it

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
that I will figure out a way to make it

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.120 
that I will figure out a way to make it
happen

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
happen

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.300 
happen
so<00:04:27.880> anyway<00:04:28.509> Chris<00:04:29.080> likeness<00:04:29.440> got<00:04:29.620> zoom<00:04:29.889> comm

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
so anyway Chris likeness got zoom comm

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.650 
so anyway Chris likeness got zoom comm
I'm<00:04:30.490> good<00:04:30.669> all<00:04:30.910> right<00:04:31.030> one<00:04:31.210> more<00:04:31.419> thing<00:04:31.630> before

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
I'm good all right one more thing before

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.510 
I'm good all right one more thing before
we<00:04:32.020> build<00:04:33.030> this<00:04:35.639> insert<00:04:36.639> here<00:04:37.680> take<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.919> out

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
we build this insert here take that out

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.790 
we build this insert here take that out
these<00:04:40.180> may<00:04:40.570> be<00:04:40.599> fits<00:04:40.960> beautifully<00:04:41.169> in<00:04:41.590> there

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
these may be fits beautifully in there

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.000 
these may be fits beautifully in there
then<00:04:42.340> rock<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.699> rock<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.360> little<00:04:43.599> bit<00:04:43.750> but<00:04:44.229> not

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
then rock it rock a little bit but not

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.270 
then rock it rock a little bit but not
much

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
much

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.219 
much
so<00:04:45.960> that's<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:49.360> control<00:04:49.720> remote

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
so that's it and the control remote

00:04:50.229 --> 00:05:03.070 
so that's it and the control remote
patrol<00:04:51.930> controls<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.229> zoom<00:04:53.440> as<00:04:53.680> well

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.249 

anyway<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.830> goo
