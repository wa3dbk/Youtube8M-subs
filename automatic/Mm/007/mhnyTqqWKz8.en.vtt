00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.969
 greetings and welcome now I am going to 

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:07.330
 to be teaching how it is that I fix 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.800
 my hair style of the seventies 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.140
 love this style because I like it 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.870
 have my hair straight sometimes but that 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.850
 have that little bit that goes backwards to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.120
 this I will be using my pincers 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.060
 in measure an inch and a half and started 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.580
 for taking a part of my hair from 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.030
 area in front and I combed it now 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.150
 taking the tongs I begin to roll 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.609
 backwards and one important thing is that 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.690
 placed the clamp down and 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:39.640
 roll it out and this gives me the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.679
 perfect halite that goes backwards that 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.469
 I love that it was so popular in the 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:47.229
 seventies and as I tell you this style of 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.149
 I love hair because my hair is still 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.249
 can look straight 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.499
 but with a little curl in the area 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.979
 in front then now I'm taking 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.839
 another amount of hair that is like 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.209
 it would be like an inch I imagine myself 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:05.110
 then to roll back again 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:08.580
 always remembering that the clamp 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.870
 inward and roll out 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.150
 so now I'm going to take another part and 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.920
 do exactly the same thing other 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.020
 important thing also to mention 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.930
 for this style of hair is that it's going to 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.420
 depend much on the final result of 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.110
 as I do not have my hair cut 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.940
 like to cut my hair in layers then 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.070
 to the area in front of me he cut me 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.110
 layers I have several I imagine as 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.510
 about six layers but nothing else in the area 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.820
 in front of the hair of the part of 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.860
 back nothing else I have two long layers 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.340
 so that's why this is also 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.410
 hairstyle is very good and the truth is 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.600
 that my hair lasts me so hairstyle all the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.490
 day now on the opposite side I'm going to do 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.009
 exactly the same thing but my hair 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.450
 is going to go that way then again 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.759
 I'm making sure that the clamp 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.649
 be to this down and roll it out 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.110
 If a little hair is left outside, it does not 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.820
 worry take it and wind up not the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.009
 same way and you will see that it falls 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.080
 perfectly with the rest of the hair 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.030
 now do the same with this side 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.239
 exactly the same thing another bit what 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.380
 combed and now with the tongs roll 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.750
 toward 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.820
 another thing that I want to mention is 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.670
 that the temperature setting I have it at 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.670
 number 15 but the temperature also I 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.900
 I imagine that it will depend on the pincers 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.960
 that they use 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.700
 I am using one of bremen chan and 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.950
 I love I love using it because I 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.130
 Leaves the hair very shiny is a great 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.320
 difference from when I do not use it and 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.020
 to start this hairstyle something else is 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.600
 I start with my straight hair I have 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.330
 my hair straight now but whenever I use 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.050
 pincers this leaves hair much more 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.030
 bright but I use it too 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.430
 Well, if it's damaging my hair, I do not 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.990
 this hairstyle often but from time to time 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.090
 when if I like my hair to link arme 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.830
 Although I already have it straight and well 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.230
 that's it now everything else what I 'm going to 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.930
 to do is comb my hair back from 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.210
 both sides and my hair lasts so all 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.550
 the day and then the action is kept 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.770
 over the back area but with those 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.990
 bird wings from the front area 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.390
 that this hair style was very popular 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.310
 in the seventies and how can you see here 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.470
 it will look fantastic even if 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.660
 they have their long hair take care 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.210
 much 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.210
 and see you for the next goodbye
