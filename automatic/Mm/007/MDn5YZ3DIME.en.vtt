00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.320
 Good news here. This is a new product sent from familiar io data. 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.840
 It is pawn though 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:24.820
 I don't think what I think or what is this package doing very well 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:28.810
 It feels like an apple product. 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:33.550
 The hardness of the past is very similar. 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:37.750
 The sound heart of it because even Ne'm like really feel that contain apple product user 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:41.530
 It's a sounding package, so what is this and what is this 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.339
 I will show you this kind of switch here 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.829
 I there a hated Hoina do or came out lightning terminal 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:53.629
 And it is falling lapure usb 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.690
 You will already know you already know usb memory and 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.399
 It is memory that can also be used with ios devices 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:06.470
 It 's a bit bigger than similar types of products 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:08.820
 And say what in large or say bought in what I have built-in battery and, for example, 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.500
 When connecting to a package something to iphone 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.060
 Well, maybe because I use a charged book here iphone's battery won't decrease 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.120
 I think there is a merit that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.440
 It is a little jet Daisuke came from the future only Jean a little from the middle 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.130
 Sorry for interrupting 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.320
 I will add a little additional explanation about this battery 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.810
 By using a battery, the communication speed with iphone improves with transfer rate 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.770
 To do 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:41.159
 It do it is not kana that I wish or not do such provided it is was found 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:44.880
 Do you want to allow the connection, of course, yes you will start the app if you do so 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:50.789
 This is similar to other products, though 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.719
 The internal storage and external storage are separated and you can copy files here 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.790
 That's why 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.730
 Contact backup date 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.780
 loan 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:04.460
 You have now backed up your contacts here 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.930
 You can also restore from here Let's take a look at the photo library 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.670
 Photo Library 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.270
 Though it is a camera roll and various photo folders in iphone 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.600
 Ne 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.830
 Oh, I'm glad I didn't have an embarrassing picture 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:23.060
 Now select what you want to copy 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.780
 If you do so, you will be up to where to copy 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.620
 Of course coming out of course I will move to external storage 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.400
 Test folder Let's issue one here 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.600
 Copy here 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:44.000
 During copying the flies now have copied photos 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:48.350
 And this was the Tsu' towards it we entered the personal computer 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.500
 I copied the file from my PC, and copied it from iphone 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:57.980
 It can be used for such things by putting it in a PC 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.590
 You can also copy from your computer to iphone , or you can attach an external video 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.180
 photos 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.390
 It's good as a race, and you're going to be full of clouds 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.310
 It is jet daisuke which will cut in again again 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.880
 there is a thing which is to leave out that it Toka lightning terminal, such as third-party products 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.800
 But in the case of this product 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:26.280
 It can be stored inside, so it can be stored in usb or something 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:30.660
 Never Lightning turn Mr. is no departure It is also safe to put in the bag 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.150
 I mean , the product called i government file is now usb memory 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.720
 You can also connect lightning 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:41.099
 such a ne that even a personal computer even ios 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:45.260
 Was there a memory live storage 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.260
 I think it can be used conveniently
