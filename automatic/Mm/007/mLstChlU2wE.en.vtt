hey everyone and welcome back today I'm

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.210 
hey everyone and welcome back today I'm
going<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.870> be<00:00:04.080> talking<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.589> little<00:00:04.740> bit<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
going to be talking a little bit about a

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.430 
going to be talking a little bit about a
trick<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:05.910> don't<00:00:06.390> know<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.660> name<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.990> but

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
trick that I don't know the name of but

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.770 
trick that I don't know the name of but
I<00:00:07.470> think<00:00:07.740> it's<00:00:07.890> called<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.490> like<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.090> universal

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
I think it's called a like a universal

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.600 
I think it's called a like a universal
weave<00:00:10.019> that's<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.950> had<00:00:11.160> friends

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
weave that's what I have had friends

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.209 
weave that's what I have had friends
call<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.179> when<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.500> don't<00:00:14.099> remember

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
call it when I do it I don't remember

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.150 
call it when I do it I don't remember
where<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> saw<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.030> done<00:00:15.859> but<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> very

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
where I saw it done but it's a very

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.450 
where I saw it done but it's a very
prominent<00:00:17.609> move<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.810> kind<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> flow<00:00:19.680> so

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
prominent move in my kind of flow so

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 
prominent move in my kind of flow so
what<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.539> teach<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.109> trick

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
what I'm going to do is teach the trick

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.630 
what I'm going to do is teach the trick
and<00:00:22.529> I'm<00:00:22.590> also<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.160> some<00:00:23.189> slow

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and I'm also going to have some slow

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.910 
and I'm also going to have some slow
motion<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.269> guys<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.630> really<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.289> how

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
motion so you guys can really see how

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.830 
motion so you guys can really see how
the<00:00:25.980> trick<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.369> done<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.970> let<00:00:27.449> me<00:00:27.539> know<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the trick is done and let me know in the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.980 
the trick is done and let me know in the
comments<00:00:28.289> below<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.920> by<00:00:29.039> liking<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.519> video

comments below or by liking this video

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.240 
comments below or by liking this video
to<00:00:30.990> let<00:00:31.140> me<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.529> guys<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> slow

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
to let me know if you guys like the slow

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.340 
to let me know if you guys like the slow
motion<00:00:32.460> stuff<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.570> helps<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.020> because

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
motion stuff and if it helps you because

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.440 
motion stuff and if it helps you because
if<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> does<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.700> more<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> series

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
if it does I can do more of a series

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.240 
if it does I can do more of a series
with<00:00:36.660> all<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.989> slow<00:00:37.200> motion<00:00:37.410> stuff<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
with all the slow motion stuff just to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
with all the slow motion stuff just to
kind<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.820> help<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.660> moves<00:00:39.899> down<00:00:40.170> in

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
kind of really help get moves down in

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.389 
kind of really help get moves down in
detail<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> move<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.030> pretty<00:00:43.399> simple

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
detail so the move is pretty simple

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.029 
detail so the move is pretty simple
looking<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.289> think

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
looking but it's kind of like a I think

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.240 
looking but it's kind of like a I think
it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.840> illusion<00:00:48.840> II<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.070> kind

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
it's a little illusion II it's what kind

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
it's a little illusion II it's what kind
of<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.460> illusion<00:00:50.760> trick<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
of like an illusion trick but this is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.200 
of like an illusion trick but this is
what<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> also<00:00:55.800> bring<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.460> high

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.620 

or<00:01:00.210> keep<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:01.109> low<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.880> primarily<00:01:05.880> what

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
or keep it really low so primarily what

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.350 
or keep it really low so primarily what
it<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.119> how<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
it is is a but you have to know how to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
it is is a but you have to know how to
backwards<00:01:09.900> weave<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:12.439> then<00:01:13.439> come<00:01:13.680> forward

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
backwards weave and then come forward

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.810 
backwards weave and then come forward
like<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.979> you're<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.549> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
like that so what you're going to do is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.310 
like that so what you're going to do is
spin<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.420> hoop<00:01:19.100> coming<00:01:20.150> backwards<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.540> then

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
spin the hoop coming backwards and then

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
spin the hoop coming backwards and then
do<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:22.890> backwards<00:01:23.369> weave<00:01:25.009> I'm<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> do

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
do your backwards weave I'm going to do

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
do your backwards weave I'm going to do
it<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.670> side<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> guys<00:01:27.659> can

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it on this side actually so you guys can

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.800 
it on this side actually so you guys can
see<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:29.340> when<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.579> come<00:01:29.790> over<00:01:30.000> onto

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
see and then when you come over onto

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.490 
see and then when you come over onto
your<00:01:31.020> left<00:01:31.290> side<00:01:31.619> you're<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> turn<00:01:33.500> palm

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
your left side you're going to turn palm

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.490 
your left side you're going to turn palm
facing<00:01:34.920> down<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.970> when<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.780> turn<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
facing down in and when you turn in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
facing down in and when you turn in
you're<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> continue<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.090> weave

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you're not going to continue the weave

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.730 
you're not going to continue the weave
you're<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> push<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.560> hoop

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you're just going to push the hoop

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.370 
you're just going to push the hoop
through<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> come<00:01:42.659> over<00:01:42.810> your

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
through so it's going to come over your

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.190 
through so it's going to come over your
pinky<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.360> you're<00:01:45.360> turning<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.079> going

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
pinky as you're turning and it's going

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
pinky as you're turning and it's going
to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.560> awkward<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to be a little awkward it's going to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.569 
to be a little awkward it's going to
come<00:01:47.939> over<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.420> pinky<00:01:48.860> into<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> front<00:01:50.369> of

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
come over your pinky into the front of

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.139 
come over your pinky into the front of
your<00:01:50.759> body<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:52.460> then<00:01:53.460> you're<00:01:53.640> back<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.850> this

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
your body and then you're back to this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.920 
your body and then you're back to this
position<00:01:54.420> again<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.490> once<00:01:56.670> again<00:01:56.930> you're

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
position again so once again you're

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.600 
position again so once again you're
coming<00:01:58.409> backwards<00:01:58.920> weave<00:02:00.170> turning<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.350> left

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
coming backwards weave turning the left

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.180 
coming backwards weave turning the left
over<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> pinky<00:02:03.240> awkward<00:02:04.219> switch<00:02:05.219> over<00:02:05.670> so

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
over the pinky awkward switch over so

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.469 
over the pinky awkward switch over so
I'll<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.459> from<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.789> angle<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.300> can

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
I'll do it from this angle so you can

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.410 
I'll do it from this angle so you can
kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.229> awkward<00:02:10.590> motion<00:02:10.830> again

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
kind of see that awkward motion again

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.460 
kind of see that awkward motion again
backwards<00:02:12.420> weave

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
backwards weave

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.630 
backwards weave
turning<00:02:14.430> over<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.600> pinky<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.490> then<00:02:17.490> I'm

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
turning over the pinky and then I'm

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.350 
turning over the pinky and then I'm
about<00:02:17.850> right<00:02:18.120> here<00:02:18.560> palm<00:02:19.560> facing<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.360> then

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
about right here palm facing up and then

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.920 
about right here palm facing up and then
I'm<00:02:21.480> slipping<00:02:22.080> around<00:02:22.440> back<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.700> weave<00:02:26.930> so

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
I'm slipping around back to the weave so

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.840 
I'm slipping around back to the weave so
the<00:02:28.080> only<00:02:28.410> part<00:02:28.740> that's<00:02:28.980> really<00:02:29.610> kind<00:02:29.820> of

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
the only part that's really kind of

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.290 
the only part that's really kind of
difficult<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.080> my<00:02:31.620> opinion<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.300> when

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
difficult in this in my opinion is when

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.060 
difficult in this in my opinion is when
you're<00:02:33.420> coming<00:02:33.840> around<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.530> awkward

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
you're coming around to this awkward

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.630 
you're coming around to this awkward
side<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.000> you're<00:02:36.150> pretty<00:02:36.390> much<00:02:36.570> going<00:02:37.640> you're

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
side so you're pretty much going you're

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.340 
side so you're pretty much going you're
pretty<00:02:38.910> much<00:02:39.000> doing<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.570> weave<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.140> side

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
pretty much doing a weave to the side

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.650 
pretty much doing a weave to the side
like<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:41.690> except<00:02:42.690> you're<00:02:43.050> coming<00:02:44.660> forward

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
like this except you're coming forward

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.550 
like this except you're coming forward
so<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.800> backwards<00:02:47.310> weave<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.290> kind

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
so it's a backwards weave but it's kind

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.040 
so it's a backwards weave but it's kind
of<00:02:49.620> coming<00:02:50.130> around<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.450> you're<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.750> weaving

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
of coming around so you're just weaving

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.420 
of coming around so you're just weaving
backwards<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.890> spinning<00:02:53.370> primarily<00:02:55.430> keeping

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
backwards and spinning primarily keeping

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.850 
backwards and spinning primarily keeping
a<00:02:56.490> nice<00:02:56.700> loose<00:02:57.090> grip<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.780> if<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.650> want<00:02:58.800> to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
a nice loose grip and if you want to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.400 
a nice loose grip and if you want to
come<00:02:59.010> up<00:02:59.130> higher<00:02:59.600> you<00:03:00.600> just<00:03:00.750> kind<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.080> swoop

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
come up higher you just kind of swoop

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.270 
come up higher you just kind of swoop
over<00:03:02.360> your<00:03:03.360> head<00:03:03.570> wherever<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.140> want<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.620> it

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
over your head wherever you want so it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.070 
over your head wherever you want so it
looks<00:03:05.460> really<00:03:05.670> cool<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.120> add<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.900> bunch

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
looks really cool you can add in a bunch

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.200 
looks really cool you can add in a bunch
of<00:03:07.260> different<00:03:07.320> things<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.820> do<00:03:09.060> and

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
of different things I like to do and

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.680 
of different things I like to do and
jump<00:03:09.480> through<00:03:10.910> sometimes<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.300> like<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.540> just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
jump through sometimes I like to just

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.580 
jump through sometimes I like to just
come<00:03:13.110> up<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:15.080> after<00:03:16.080> doing<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:19.200> it's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
come up like this after doing it so it's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.550 
come up like this after doing it so it's
a<00:03:19.650> fun<00:03:19.860> move<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.840> hopefully<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.140> helped<00:03:22.440> you
