00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.160 
a for Ashley unpaid very well today up
from<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.939> left<00:01:36.180> back<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.689> seemed<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:36.990> he

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
from from left back it seemed like he

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.390 
from from left back it seemed like he
plays<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.770> left-back<00:01:38.009> because<00:01:38.280> there

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
plays better at left-back because there

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
plays better at left-back because there
isn't<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.700> much<00:01:38.729> pressure<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.299> him<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.720> attack

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
isn't as much pressure on him to attack

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.410 
isn't as much pressure on him to attack
and<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.740> he's<00:01:40.860> got<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.460> midfielder<00:01:42.299> there

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and then he's got the midfielder there

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.969 
and then he's got the midfielder there
in<00:01:42.540> front<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.810> him<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.079> he<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.290> bum<00:01:43.500> make

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
in front of him so he can bum make

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740 
in front of him so he can bum make
overlapping<00:01:44.430> runs<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.000> suits<00:01:45.360> him<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> lot

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
overlapping runs it suits him a lot

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.690 
overlapping runs it suits him a lot
