00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:40.499 
calories at rest so to start a strength

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.369 
calories at rest so to start a strength
training<00:00:40.649> program<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.579> want<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.449> just<00:00:43.109> start

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
training program you want to just start

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.169 
training program you want to just start
very<00:00:43.589> simply<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.609> have<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
you have the right kinds of resistance

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.200 
you have the right kinds of resistance
to<00:00:59.429> use<00:00:59.609> whether<00:00:59.909> it's<00:01:00.210> dumbbells<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.409> bands

of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> great<00:01:17.219> things<00:01:17.520> about<00:01:17.780> lifting

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
of the great things about lifting

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870 
of the great things about lifting
weights<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.039> know<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:20.640> you're

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
weights is that you know when you're

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
weights is that you know when you're
exerting<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.930> energy<00:01:22.560> exerting<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
exerting your energy exerting the the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
exerting your energy exerting the the
resistance<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.689> pulling<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.409> that's<00:01:26.070> when<00:01:26.399> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
resistance of pulling up that's when you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730 
resistance of pulling up that's when you
want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.820> exhale<00:01:27.479> there's<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.140> trick<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
want to exhale there's a trick to that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.450 
want to exhale there's a trick to that
is<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.460> exhale<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> exertion<00:01:31.189> so<00:01:32.189> whenever

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
is to exhale on the exertion so whenever

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
is to exhale on the exertion so whenever
you're<00:01:32.700> doing<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.359> you're<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.560> proper

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you're doing that you're in the proper

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.639 
you're doing that you're in the proper
form<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.119> breathing<00:01:36.899> for<00:01:36.930> strength<00:01:37.439> training

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
form of breathing for strength training

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.370 
form of breathing for strength training
the<00:01:38.609> other<00:01:38.759> thing<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.149> to<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.479> how<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.259> know

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the other thing is to know how do I know

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.469 
the other thing is to know how do I know
what<00:01:40.859> kind<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> weight<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> should<00:01:41.969> use<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
what kind of weight I should use and

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
what kind of weight I should use and
sometimes<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.530> takes<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.859> little<00:01:44.070> bit<00:01:44.219> of<00:01:44.340> trial

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
sometimes it takes a little bit of trial

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.330 
sometimes it takes a little bit of trial
in<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> beginning<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.960> tip<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
in there in the beginning a tip is to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.840 
in there in the beginning a tip is to
know<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:48.539> last<00:01:48.990> repetition<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.520> few

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
know on your last repetition or the few

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.029 
know on your last repetition or the few
repetitions<00:01:51.240> before<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.109> finish<00:01:52.469> that<00:01:52.500> set

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
repetitions before you finish that set

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.249 
repetitions before you finish that set
so<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.640> you're<00:01:53.789> doing<00:01:54.119> 15<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.219> repetition<00:01:56.219> 12

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
so if you're doing 15 on repetition 12

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.669 
so if you're doing 15 on repetition 12
13<00:01:58.259> 14<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.070> 15<00:01:59.719> they<00:02:00.719> are<00:02:00.869> starting<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> get

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
13 14 and 15 they are starting to get

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.950 
13 14 and 15 they are starting to get
pretty<00:02:02.039> difficult<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:03.119> almost<00:02:03.420> feel<00:02:03.719> like

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
pretty difficult you almost feel like

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.749 
pretty difficult you almost feel like
your<00:02:04.140> your<00:02:04.619> muscles<00:02:04.979> are<00:02:05.070> burning<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.640> little

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
your your muscles are burning a little

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.260 
your your muscles are burning a little
bit<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.600> tells<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.469> are<00:02:07.619> using<00:02:07.829> a

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
bit that tells you you are using a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.930 
bit that tells you you are using a
perfect<00:02:09.270> weight<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.440> exercise<00:02:11.100> if<00:02:11.400> you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
perfect weight for that exercise if you

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.240 
perfect weight for that exercise if you
breeze<00:02:12.270> through<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.780> set<00:02:13.019> you're<00:02:13.800> definitely

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
breeze through the set you're definitely

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.399 
breeze through the set you're definitely
needing<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.760> bump<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.690> weight<00:02:16.019> or<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
needing to bump up the weight or the

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.430 
needing to bump up the weight or the
resistance

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
resistance

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.290 
resistance
and<00:02:17.530> if<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.740> can't<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.220> through<00:02:18.580> five<00:02:18.880> or<00:02:19.060> six

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
and if you can't get through five or six

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.840 
and if you can't get through five or six
repetitions<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.290> know<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.340> weight<00:02:21.610> is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
repetitions you know that that weight is

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.390 
repetitions you know that that weight is
too<00:02:22.300> heavy<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.350> that's<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.680> good<00:02:23.860> way<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.100> be

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
too heavy so that's a good way to be

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.610 
too heavy so that's a good way to be
able<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.640> determine<00:02:25.540> where<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.080> start<00:02:26.380> with

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620

your weights so when you start the
