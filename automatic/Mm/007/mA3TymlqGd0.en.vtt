what's up guys and what's my video this
video<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.230> PC<00:00:07.770> centric<00:00:08.160> rig<00:00:08.460> this<00:00:09.090> rig<00:00:09.389> is

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
video is a PC centric rig this rig is

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.499 
video is a PC centric rig this rig is
using<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.230> new<00:00:10.410> Intel<00:00:10.920> Haswell<00:00:11.330> CPUs<00:00:12.330> and

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
using the new Intel Haswell CPUs and

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.079 
using the new Intel Haswell CPUs and
it's<00:00:13.469> basically<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.219> think<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.880> should

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
that you want to go and get a gaming PC

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.140 
that you want to go and get a gaming PC
and<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.800> know<00:00:25.949> what<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.310> decide<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.699> I'm

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and you know what you decide that I'm

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.519 
and you know what you decide that I'm
going<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.539> using<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> lot<00:00:28.140> it's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
going to be using this a lot it's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.560 
going to be using this a lot it's
probably<00:00:28.830> worth<00:00:29.070> me<00:00:29.369> getting<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.880> sort<00:00:30.449> of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
probably worth me getting the sort of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.410 
probably worth me getting the sort of
best<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.850> definitely

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
best that I can get this is definitely

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.270 
best that I can get this is definitely
the<00:00:33.840> rig<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.380> now<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> first<00:00:34.890> bit<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the rig for you now the first bit of a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.709 
the rig for you now the first bit of a
computer<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.059> course<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> motherboard

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
computer is of course the motherboard

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.170 
computer is of course the motherboard
and<00:00:37.040> because<00:00:38.040> we're<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> haswell

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and because we're going with a haswell

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.130 
and because we're going with a haswell
cpu<00:00:39.590> you're<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> need<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.160> z87<00:00:41.820> board<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
cpu you're going to need a z87 board and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810 
cpu you're going to need a z87 board and
the<00:00:43.469> motherboard<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> I've<00:00:44.100> chosen<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the motherboard that I've chosen is the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.069 
the motherboard that I've chosen is the
msi<00:00:45.680> z87<00:00:46.820> g45<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.270> board<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.690> designed

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
msi z87 g45 and this board is designed

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
msi z87 g45 and this board is designed
around<00:00:49.140> gaming<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> really

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
around gaming but it's not a really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.189 
around gaming but it's not a really
high-end<00:00:50.879> board<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> better

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
high-end board it's got a better

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.319 
high-end board it's got a better
ethernet<00:00:52.739> adapter<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.730> says<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
ethernet adapter and it says that it

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
ethernet adapter and it says that it
prioritizes<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.440> gaming<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.070> voice<00:00:56.309> over

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
prioritizes your gaming and voice over

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.810 
prioritizes your gaming and voice over
IP<00:00:56.930> rather<00:00:57.930> than<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.710> your<00:00:59.280> standard

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

true or not we don't really know but it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
true or not we don't really know but it
is<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> better<00:01:05.339> network<00:01:05.580> card<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> all

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
is a better network card and you all

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.969 
is a better network card and you all
benefit<00:01:06.930> from<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.619> you're<00:01:07.799> playing

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
seat that you can get for gaming

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
seat that you can get for gaming
obviously<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.810> spend<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.590> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
obviously you can spend more and you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.700 
obviously you can spend more and you
will<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.759> little<00:01:53.939> bit<00:01:54.180> extra<00:01:54.299> performance

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
will get a little bit extra performance

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.810 
will get a little bit extra performance
obviously<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.890> spend<00:01:56.159> less<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.430> you'll

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
obviously you can spend less and you'll

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.850 
obviously you can spend less and you'll
get<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.240> less<00:01:57.540> performance<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.680> is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
get a lot less performance but this is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.219 
get a lot less performance but this is
by<00:01:59.070> far<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> best<00:01:59.640> price<00:01:59.939> performance<00:02:00.229> cpu

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
by far the best price performance cpu

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
by far the best price performance cpu
and<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.310> able<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.549> power<00:02:02.909> all

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and it's going to be able to power all

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.490 
and it's going to be able to power all
your<00:02:03.360> games<00:02:03.570> we're<00:02:03.869> running<00:02:04.259> into<00:02:04.469> a

I'd<00:03:15.280> also<00:03:15.520> advise<00:03:15.850> going<00:03:16.090> for<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.420> red<00:03:16.600> color

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
I'd also advise going for the red color

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.990 
I'd also advise going for the red color
because<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> motherboard<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.220> black<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.790> red

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
because the motherboard is black and red

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.660 
because the motherboard is black and red
and<00:03:19.209> once<00:03:19.600> you've<00:03:19.720> put<00:03:19.900> some<00:03:20.019> nice<00:03:20.260> red<00:03:20.890> RAM<00:03:21.370> in

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
and once you've put some nice red RAM in

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.070 
and once you've put some nice red RAM in
there<00:03:21.880> it's<00:03:22.239> going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.510> make<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.780> look<00:03:22.870> even

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
there it's going to make it look even

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.050 
there it's going to make it look even
better<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.250> motherboard<00:03:24.489> now<00:03:24.880> obviously

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
better on the motherboard now obviously

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
going to get a new system I'd definitely

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.510 
going to get a new system I'd definitely
recommend<00:05:53.930> sticking<00:05:54.440> windows<00:05:54.890> 8<00:05:55.070> on<00:05:55.190> it<00:05:55.310> so

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
recommend sticking windows 8 on it so

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.760 
recommend sticking windows 8 on it so
that<00:05:55.550> is<00:05:55.910> it<00:05:55.940> for<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.330> pc<00:05:56.480> centric<00:05:57.080> rig<00:05:57.290> I'm

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
that is it for the pc centric rig I'm

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.380 
that is it for the pc centric rig I'm
sure<00:05:58.250> there<00:05:58.520> are<00:05:58.550> things<00:05:58.670> you<00:05:58.910> might<00:05:59.090> want<00:05:59.300> to

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
sure there are things you might want to

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.120 
sure there are things you might want to
change<00:05:59.540> in<00:05:59.780> it<00:05:59.900> but<00:06:00.230> that's<00:06:00.440> pretty<00:06:00.860> much<00:06:00.980> the

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
change in it but that's pretty much the

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.740 
change in it but that's pretty much the
sort<00:06:01.520> of<00:06:01.610> computer<00:06:01.850> if<00:06:02.150> I<00:06:02.300> was<00:06:02.450> going<00:06:02.540> to<00:06:02.600> go

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
sort of computer if I was going to go

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.750 
sort of computer if I was going to go
out<00:06:02.870> and<00:06:02.960> buy<00:06:03.110> one<00:06:03.350> now<00:06:03.560> that's<00:06:04.100> the<00:06:04.250> one<00:06:04.400> that

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
out and buy one now that's the one that

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.030 
out and buy one now that's the one that
I<00:06:04.820> would<00:06:05.090> buy<00:06:05.240> for<00:06:05.420> myself<00:06:05.740> it's<00:06:06.740> not

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
I would buy for myself it's not

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.130 
I would buy for myself it's not
necessarily<00:06:07.640> the<00:06:07.790> cheapest<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.660> could<00:06:08.900> cut
