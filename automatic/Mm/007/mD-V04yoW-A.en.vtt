00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.530 
sounds good too of course I mentioned
earlier<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.700> controls<00:04:36.270> are<00:04:36.450> a<00:04:36.479> bit

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
earlier that the controls are a bit

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.370 
earlier that the controls are a bit
clunky<00:04:36.660> well<00:04:37.590> that's<00:04:37.740> because<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.820> controls

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
clunky well that's because the controls

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.290 
clunky well that's because the controls
they're<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.410> bit<00:04:40.590> clunky<00:04:41.060> funny<00:04:42.060> how<00:04:42.240> that

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
they're a bit clunky funny how that

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.010 
they're a bit clunky funny how that
works

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
works

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.520 
works
it's<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:43.680> bit<00:04:43.860> floaty<00:04:44.220> it's<00:04:44.669> a<00:04:44.700> bit<00:04:44.850> imprecise

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
it's a bit floaty it's a bit imprecise

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.870 
it's a bit floaty it's a bit imprecise
jumping<00:04:46.530> especially<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.400> can<00:04:47.550> be<00:04:47.640> hard<00:04:47.820> to

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
jumping especially it can be hard to

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.510 
jumping especially it can be hard to
jump<00:04:48.210> with<00:04:48.419> any<00:04:48.570> precision<00:04:49.020> or<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.979> land<00:04:50.280> where

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
jump with any precision or to land where

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.730 
jump with any precision or to land where
you<00:04:50.610> want<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.030> sometimes<00:04:51.440> which<00:04:52.440> makes

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
you want to sometimes which makes

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.040 
you want to sometimes which makes
jumping<00:04:53.250> difficult<00:04:54.150> when<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.479> can't<00:04:54.780> land

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
jumping difficult when you can't land

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.110 
jumping difficult when you can't land
where<00:04:55.320> you<00:04:55.350> want<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.890> and<00:04:56.340> all<00:04:56.669> that<00:04:56.880> stuff

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
where you want to and all that stuff

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.089 
where you want to and all that stuff
that<00:04:57.419> it's<00:04:58.110> sort<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.470> pet<00:04:58.680> peeve<00:04:58.919> of<00:04:59.039> mine

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
that it's sort of a pet peeve of mine

00:04:59.099 --> 00:04:59.730 
that it's sort of a pet peeve of mine
because<00:04:59.430> I

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
because I

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.620 
because I
having<00:05:00.160> grown<00:05:00.340> up<00:05:00.400> with<00:05:00.550> platformers<00:05:01.270> on<00:05:01.510> the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
having grown up with platformers on the

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.190 
having grown up with platformers on the
NES<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.830> Super<00:05:03.160> NES<00:05:03.190> I<00:05:03.910> mean<00:05:04.390> my<00:05:04.540> bar<00:05:04.900> for

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
NES and the Super NES I mean my bar for

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.080 
NES and the Super NES I mean my bar for
how<00:05:05.290> a<00:05:05.320> platformer<00:05:06.010> should<00:05:06.220> control<00:05:06.640> is<00:05:06.940> like

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
how a platformer should control is like

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.140 
how a platformer should control is like
I<00:05:07.390> mean<00:05:07.960> it's<00:05:08.050> it's<00:05:08.410> like<00:05:08.590> Mario<00:05:08.920> Megaman<00:05:09.910> you

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
I mean it's it's like Mario Megaman you

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.400 
I mean it's it's like Mario Megaman you
know<00:05:10.240> games<00:05:10.450> like<00:05:10.660> that<00:05:10.870> just<00:05:11.170> really

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
know games like that just really

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.370 
know games like that just really
responsive<00:05:12.160> really<00:05:12.730> tight<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.840> taut<00:05:14.050> Todd's

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
responsive really tight and taut Todd's

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.350 
responsive really tight and taut Todd's
not<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:14.800> responsive<00:05:15.490> or<00:05:15.790> tight

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
not that responsive or tight

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.620 
not that responsive or tight
I<00:05:16.390> mean<00:05:17.050> he's<00:05:17.170> tight<00:05:17.500> but<00:05:17.860> I<00:05:18.160> mean<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.210> in<00:05:19.510> the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
I mean he's tight but I mean that in the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:32.310 
I mean he's tight but I mean that in the
way<00:05:19.750> wrapper<00:05:20.050> same<00:05:20.820> this<00:05:21.820> pods<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.270> man<00:05:31.320> so

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
way wrapper same this pods the man so

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.830
