00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.170 

the<00:00:30.630> question<00:00:30.930> was<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> best<00:00:31.440> half<00:00:32.000> was<00:00:33.000> a

the question was the best half was a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.520 
the question was the best half was a
relative<00:00:33.540> success<00:00:33.780> there<00:00:34.260> were<00:00:34.320> some

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
relative success there were some

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.320 
relative success there were some
combination<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.400> filter<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.940> happened

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
combination on the filter what happened

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:49.690 
combination on the filter what happened
in<00:00:36.450> fact<00:00:37.640> better<00:00:38.640> than<00:00:48.380> that

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
in fact better than that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.830 
in fact better than that
I<00:00:52.510> forget<00:00:53.510> which<00:00:53.600> delivers<00:00:55.060> yes<00:00:56.060> I<00:00:56.270> agree<00:00:56.330> that

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
I forget which delivers yes I agree that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.220 
I forget which delivers yes I agree that
the<00:00:57.080> best<00:00:57.230> half<00:00:57.530> was<00:00:58.030> was<00:00:59.030> mad<00:00:59.270> we've<00:00:59.540> had<00:01:00.020> some

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
the best half was was mad we've had some

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.170 
the best half was was mad we've had some
combinations<00:01:00.950> there<00:01:01.250> but<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:01.760> think<00:01:01.970> what

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
combinations there but I think what

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.270 
combinations there but I think what
we've<00:01:02.330> left<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.870> team<00:01:03.080> was<00:01:03.320> faith<00:01:03.740> that<00:01:04.100> we

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
we've left the team was faith that we

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.280 
we've left the team was faith that we
can<00:01:04.460> win<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:04.910> I<00:01:05.570> think<00:01:05.780> that<00:01:05.870> was<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.080> problem

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
can win and I think that was the problem

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.130 
can win and I think that was the problem
of<00:01:06.590> believing<00:01:07.160> in<00:01:07.280> ourselves<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.240> when<00:01:08.960> the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
of believing in ourselves so when the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.070 
of believing in ourselves so when the
test<00:01:09.380> once<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:09.979> conceded<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:10.550> does<00:01:10.700> go<00:01:11.080> that's

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
test once you conceded it does go that's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:30.620 
test once you conceded it does go that's
when<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.470> all<00:01:12.620> started<00:01:12.790> depression

is<00:03:40.629> that<00:03:41.629> charade<00:03:41.840> after<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.290> game<00:03:42.579> finishes

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
is that charade after the game finishes

is that charade after the game finishes
with<00:03:43.760> such<00:03:43.939> a<00:03:43.969> result<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.540> is<00:03:44.599> difficult<00:03:44.900> to

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
with such a result it is difficult to

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.500 
with such a result it is difficult to
identify<00:03:45.980> positive<00:03:46.909> moments<00:03:47.299> in<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.480> game
