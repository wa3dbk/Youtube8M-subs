00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.570
 than a red goblet 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.089
 but here it is a bit American ray 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.140
 everything is so you can stay that way 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.340
 can also buy drinks 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.020
 there are so many things that we see in 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.440
 his hand and this is the American and all that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.480
 so I bought some stuff 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.890
 I will show you 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.070
 so the thing that I fell 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.820
 totally addicted the charles lepic then 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.140
 it's an amazing thing because when 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.650
 I started to taste them I find it 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.210
 not good I think it's super sweet here 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.340
 I do not have and more than at home 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.920
 package and more to lead hitch and the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.880
 two boxes of 450 grams 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.730
 I have puffs in two days yeah 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.440
 so that's really done like that 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.580
 so we for him who follow me 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.990
 on Facebook 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.160
 you know that I tried when 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.870
 I 'm trying hard to do that sort of 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.060
 rebalancing food because I have 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.520
 took almost 7 pounds in a few 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.770
 months but it's certainly due in 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.120
 much to my pill that these 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.490
 stopped not for the causes of all this 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.690
 we hear on TV that I get off 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.930
 clearly but because that's me 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.340
 really makes a lot of weight 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.790
 and so here I decide to stop and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.900
 so all that is things 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.210
 that I really eat before me 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.600
 to question and do 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.830
 efforts so that's it 's it's 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.240
 serriers in fact so you have some 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.550
 including basic grains like 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.250
 this is in you have cereals at 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.680
 marches malo and it's too much too much 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.690
 beautiful I think that when I have taken a 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 good pace and I do not adhere to a little bit of 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.260
 weight I would not please I 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150
 will redeem but it is true that in addition 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.560
 she's going to give it's pretty much I believe 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.760
 less than 10 euros a box 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.260
 So yeah that's good but that remains 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.160
 I love there is no equivalence in 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.990
 france in the shops 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.520
 I do not find it so if you 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.040
 know some serial like that 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.600
 find in store I do not speak then 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.650
 big chain stores because I 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.080
 know that apparently we can find in 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.640
 little english shops but me 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.020
 happened in my city so here is 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.650
 it's not a complicated so kind 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.380
 auchan casino crossroads leclerc 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.420
 so if you find serenas that 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.930
 looks like that and we have in France in 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.290
 The stores 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.000
 tell me it would seem so 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.459
 really wise and syral that I loved 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.769
 otherwise I bought myself these too 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.160
 so it's peanut butter with 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.720
 directly in the jam of 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.950
 strawberry has actually picked a little gadget at 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.140
 where do you go from here? 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.239
 to test because that's good with us 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.500
 find peanut butter and 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.080
 strawberry jam but not between 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.489
 dads mix and actually I love it because 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.410
 that in trust in a tale 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.450
 future of strawberries what I hate these 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.620
 the pieces and that we will understand each other 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.200
 with miss test because she 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.830
 hate the pieces too and so 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.290
 suddenly I love you completely 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.120
 see I love a lot even I love 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.549
 the smell in taste there is also in 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.930
 cassis and franck I try because 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.510
 in here you have directly the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.549
 strawberry and it's very well balanced 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.000
 mixes great and you have fans 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.920
 pieces in what and I love it suddenly 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.110
 and it was very well protected the package 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.390
 arrives and super well protected mattresses 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.730
 of foam all to that there at antwerp and 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.370
 is protected in addition to his share and no 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.720
 breaks no problem the fault is 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.080
 still leave and it happened super 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.660
 quick 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.580
 counting the weekend that made 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.010
 between the two less than ten days so 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.260
 where it frankly not bad so that's it 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.700
 it's very good to like the bar 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.350
 peanuts one month cocoa butter 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.010
 all alone I hate I think it's hyper 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.550
 sexy here you're choking with with the 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.940
 jam is a crazy thing 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.640
 two other products the spread 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.310
 river is spread or 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.290
 normal marshmallow and strawberry and 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.480
 it's too good then the 1st time in 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.730
 going to do my shopping so I spent 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.830
 at leclerc I passed in the radius 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.630
 dietary and it's completely con 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.430
 to have a foot like that because you 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.050
 have hockey a lot of dietary 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.280
 evening at spokes and on the other side these 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.080
 kinds of food like what you 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.720
 you find they reminded to 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.190
 dietary and other world 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.120
 still more logical and so you 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.660
 have an English part radius and you 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.130
 find the river so I did not know 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.270
 not that we found so suddenly I 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.350
 not going to ask but good now I 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.420
 will order more info if we 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.530
 so find you have river it's 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.050
 not very expensive I do not remember at all 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.520
 price m but here it can help you 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.220
 in the party and ethical 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.840
 other world you find this where there is by 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.060
 example the Asian part and all that 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.070
 you have an English department could there 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.900
 also sell mini marshmallow so 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.650
 could put in your chocolate too 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.419
 and all that they sell chocolate dom 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.919
 and inside poked marshmallow so 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.169
 I did not buy but it tempted me 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.990
 not bad so here you are interested 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.450
 you can find the river so that 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.400
 like dough as it white 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.260
 it's really good that it's not 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.290
 too sweet and ultimately 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.830
 not that much it's the strawberry is very 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.540
 very good too are so good so 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.130
 here it is really great received by 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.440
 against Italy this super boring but 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.630
 this on the sandwich bread but it sticks 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.650
 but it's still super good I love these 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:07.690
 stuff and products about me fan cd 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.280
 popcap pop tarts I was told 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.750
 could find in France perso I 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.710
 have never seen so here and in fact me 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.210
 I thought it was a biscuit to 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.210
 eat like that but dense to a biscuit 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.820
 precooked that you put either in your 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.230
 microwave waves either in your toaster in 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.910
 did it was marc ela 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.300
 and but except that I had not seen 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.100
 so we have that means it all 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.510
 your gloves so you have some 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.790
 explanations in English but these 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.410
 simple supports to understand it 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:42.230
 present in sachets like these 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.670
 there are two in it and so that's 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.050
 exactly as in the picture actually 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.670
 it's like that and in the 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.260
 Tasty cherry with duck 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.600
 different is there complaint you had wanted 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.130
 test the cherry but it's super sweet 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.260
 so I do not know how are the 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.550
 others but that cherries I you the 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.250
 do not advise they are really too 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.930
 too sweet it's me I think it's hyper 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.930
 recurrent I have trouble finishing them when 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.640
 the games begin and so in fact you 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.660
 take them out of the bag and me 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.860
 advises the state to not grids 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.170
 because suddenly it gives you 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.440
 Costil round lic I think it 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.420
 would give a soft dough here and so 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.270
 you put on so in your scream not 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.830
 on the lowest temperature and 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.720
 you just leave a cycle so you 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.100
 put to you have you lean on 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.190
 your button and once out it's 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.300
 good actually watch out for these shows 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.830
 which you let a little cool 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.100
 and after that remains even if it's 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.790
 crinkle is crispy anyway and 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:38.240
 so suddenly the season but here it is 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:41.870
 said I'm not a fan it is too 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.820
 too sweet so here I think 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.310
 I will iron some small commands 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.350
 goes from time to time the shipping costs 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.110
 I do not know how much they are 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:54.080
 not given either the shipping costs by 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.820
 water and but that's it if you order a 

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.500
 little bit of a while make me 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.730
 the same mistake as me if you have a 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.460
 leclerc to see them before you 

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:04.010
 can find 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.240
 and so do not hesitate do not forget 

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.940
 not if we knew cereals like 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.850

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.360

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.400

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.560

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.370
