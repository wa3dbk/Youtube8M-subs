00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.550
 Holland 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.889
 finally really winter really nice one 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.900
 fairy tale hi i 'm chris find it go 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.789
 for this type of weather 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 you can also appreciate your car 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.260
 slightly less in that they do not 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.390
 completely resistant to summer tires and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.130
 extra wide also so once again 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.180
 gliding and sliding that you like me one 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.769
 of those people who are all 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 I need a winter tire 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.160
 Well so tough I do not know but 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.350
 maybe it will gradually become so 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.079
 I think a bit of time seems true 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.750
 this week i nailed limburg news 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.879
 Some bye bye ya rice rises again 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.260
 as far as nail news 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.180
 yes, and yet this time of equal 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.039
 pretty serious are the length 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.030
 commitments they spoke to am a young 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.280
 has been made final 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.059
 yes we have been through a lot of money and again 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.129
 pushed 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.020
 but I think we can soon 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.329
 results lazy expect them to be ten 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.430
 million euros from invest in spijker nv 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.920
 we're actually going to do them two projects 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.760
 for which they even and very new PVV 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.479
 have established 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.909
 yes the b-to-b eg yes better and beijing 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.710
 add per exactly yes I'll see what is there 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.439
 behind him rides big fat cock 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.740
 how she sees them ready for the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.740
 winter 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:27.400
 nice gas man with your v8 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:30.910
 yes, our four seeds a bit 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.560
 loosely yes but good nail and pity 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.440
 are therefore working on two projects first 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.970
 those beijing toppeers super suv where we 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.730
 are busy but you anticipate 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.320
 projects after years that you come up with 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.040
 someday what will we sing i am that 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.230
 is all 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.790
 high high in the market yes yes where that 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.600
 another project that actually finds one 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.030
 much more interesting 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.040
 that spire phoenix yes that phoenix you 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.500
 are a troll it and pointed out 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.480
 what about that phoenix platform lesson 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.580
 told me in for it because she 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.290
 that they have bought the right from that 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.460
 4x platform but you say oh my too 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.670
 you also say now 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.410
 yes yes it is unclear gino 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.210
 at the right end but the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.720
 planning anyway said nail story yes 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.710
 indeed you know your schimmer and knife 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.720
 market on me a whole 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.190
 sure and solid man that they feel 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.640
 by that they actually know where 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.710
 people are working to nail maarja 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.450
 phoenix also kneels really well so what 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.710
 to me it seems so true that 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.450
 victor muller finally something strange 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.040
 but who could possibly do something with it 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.040
 yes we are going to experience it so it is 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.220
 and then a big Sinterklaas gift this 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.950
 years yes this week to me a new one 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.750
 audi rs6 or a stuff and grab it super 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.790
 work is the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.830
 bit wrong he is quattro in the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.460
 wholly aluminum colored 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.800
 accents 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.210
 yes but that is also typical Audi RS 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
 natural yes hair this 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.080
 it's just part of it but whatever I do 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.100
 played fewer horsepower than the last 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.540
 yes but holland 20p tickets per 500 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.340
 so much that you do not notice that 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.930
 couple has risen of course he is 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.709
 become lighter so count that he 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.120
 again a lot faster 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.010
 that's where my old one was always one 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.200
 we made the protagonist of that pk read 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.940
 a bit boyish, yes 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.440
 did not stop come to an end 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.640
 you smile but you will be him later 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.110
 governs 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.790
 then we talk that they probably 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.600
 send you drooling again I think 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.610
 it does 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.790
 and he looks secretly cool 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.790
 from 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.140
 corel score was a completely new brand 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.280
 new 2007 they are set up a lot 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.010
 brand of sherry 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.830
 you together with israel corporation van 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.470
 better place and that will go next year 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.549
 come to europe to learn what i think 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.450
 I actually like that 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.400
 interesting brand 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.319
 landwind has of course very good 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.450
 show how it's how you don't handle it 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.489
 must pack because yes yes that was I do 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.260
 a fiasco but these really take it 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.720
 serious about war so we take them seriously 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.340
 have to take because they take it whole 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.260
 different to or actually like the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.900
 tackle Koreans in the last few years 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.489
 you just rent elly there are one exactly 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.069
 european designers european technicians who 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.260
 what better what our modern market 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.299
 what my expect yes and there they come 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.370
 therefore not included in the first sketches 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.349
 should i say look really good yes 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.760
 looks absolutely wrong with them 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.799
 also want to go a little high quality 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.479
 is also a lump with the elder and 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.280
 the build quality and all all 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.250
 reputable suppliers 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.660
 I think it's pretty good if it's it 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.639
 is interesting here 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.350
 yes on my it will eventually buy 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.910
 that we really go in two in 14 as 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.169
 I was allowed to enjoy that increased quality 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.030
 a retaining wall of the build quality of 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.110
 such a country in 793 camp then still 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.110
 being a yes there was not good 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.160
 then even more news from German hands 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.690
 bmw 4 series concept 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.520
 I think burial is going to convert things 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.290
 can see him in my two years already that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.780
 this 90 percent sure 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.460
 just the nobody 4 series is yes what you think 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.950
 of that whole thing that suddenly becomes four 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.920
 Syria must eat 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.150
 yes yes yes I think there is not much I 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.740
 I'm actually already used to it 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.840
 yes you a very small me according to my 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.030
 biggest nonsense with young they do 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.800
 of course audina what with the a5 and a4 and 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.420
 more different they can make money again 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.280
 for questions and said yes I understand 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.350
 it but we will soon also have a 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.470
 and that I still have to get used to it 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.060
 that there will be processed it nonsense that 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.480
 you do why should that thing in this 4 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.480
 sine from 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.040
 yes can yes get used no no I think 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.020
 I think it is just common denial 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.430
 it's just typing blah view 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.890
 when I am at my site at the door 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.860
 but my top three over four get up and up 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.160
 nevertheless we become bad just like that 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.410
 to have 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.410
 yes and through 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.170
 it looks a little trouble that 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.170
 place to come 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.400
 I still say is also a bit too 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.650
 from us the tree boomroom you 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.650
 maybe they take that but they do holland 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.440
 still hear a little tricky to do 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.480
 summer slippers looking pretty schedules 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.650
 whether you're doing a set of winter tires 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.650
 the boxes I'll be right back
