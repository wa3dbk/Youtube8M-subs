islands<00:01:00.900> as<00:01:00.989> well<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.650> we<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:01.800> meat<00:01:02.040> nor

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
islands as well but then we got meat nor

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.460 
islands as well but then we got meat nor
i<00:01:02.220> matter<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:02.820> yeah<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> standard<00:01:04.170> was

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
i matter so and yeah the standard was

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
i matter so and yeah the standard was
very<00:01:04.680> high<00:01:04.800> as<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.400> i<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
