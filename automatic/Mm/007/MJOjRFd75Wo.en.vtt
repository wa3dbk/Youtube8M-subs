00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hi what's up, how are you welcome? 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.379
 one day you go to pixel moon last chapter 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.719
 of pixel mones but we enter the league 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.240
 pokemon and you'll see good jobo milk and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.340
 kurumi of luck as you know to see if 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.470
 it brings us luck and let's try 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.660
 to try we are going to try to finish with 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.600
 this as quickly as we can I will 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.870
 draw directly to záiter and consider 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.080
 flamethrower we should end up with this 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.940
 with this guy but easy or I do them 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.030
 a flamethrower to all has not even 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.550
 had time to react and we moved forward 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.160
 goodbye the first one has been very easy the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.500
 second the second the second I hope that 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.500
 also easy to see is a child 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.199
 well this also with flamethrowers and 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.260
 it should be quite easy, because 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.899
 they are also bug type this toxic type and 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.300
 others a chroma of this flying type 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.149
 should fly and tree should also 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.579
 fly like wisin is that it does not 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.869
 they are rival are not rival for me they are not 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.869
 rival for me 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.049
 well here is one of the problems that 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.990
 It is that this door does not open it 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.930
 so the only option I see is 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.649
 break the door pass and go back to 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.649
 change the mode 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.960
 The truth is that he does not find another 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.509
 way is that it's the second time 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.299
 we load this gameplay and I hope this 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.430
 It works well because we're coming 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.840
 a moment in which of the books I have 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.880
 come to tire a bit of this series 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.799
 I want to finish to become 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.330
 especially the pokémon trainer but 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:47.500
 also because sometimes you say fuck is worth 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.200
 he has been nothing to life uncle you see 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.140
 undead dragon tail give fuck 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.899
 attack to death once beach honda 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.050
 igneous march dies is criticized 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.929
 at level 74 with the dragon print and die 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.890
 also the plus size and flamethrower other 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.780
 ok time ok they are not rival they are not rival for 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.060
 visualize I'm really sorry this door 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.440
 so this door opens so I know 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.650
 open this tweet xxix ya green and ok ok 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.230
 kevin level 29 kevin you are going to die 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.590
 very well then we are going there to start the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.910
 battle with zac fight is worth it thrown 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.880
 to speak this is to vary a little 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.880
 ok it's a very cool man the level 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.740
 42 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.440
 that are not a rival for us because 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.390
 they are all level between 40 and 50 those of the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.190
 pokemon league if I remember correctly so 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.350
 we should not have any problem 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.460
 in killing each other one by one come 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.750
 go headbrow damn reign no 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.730
 hidrobombas dies I want him to die now 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.280
 I'm clear, it's worth revenge, dead drap 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.170
 john draper I have no idea what 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.670
 pokemones of the plane right now is that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.270
 It is so dark that nothing is seen here 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.250
 below and uncharted or said order this 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.040
 is a 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.870
 the shark species and a xavi lite 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.550
 well let's see if he also killed him with 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.790
 blast or just be on the verge of 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.060
 killing tells us about this and it is being 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.060
 there 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.140
 probably the blas toys die 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.519
 effectively blas trace has been 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.840
 weakened there's no problem because we're going 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.079
 to take our chari tarte with a 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.590
 flamethrower I send you for your home and purpose 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.470
 it's over I'm still making good progress 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.680
 cure to the maximum to militarize before 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:40.799
 fight against this turkey and I'll start 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:43.739
 to struggling with with a gas leak 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:47.370
 I'm going for you boy I'll start with three 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.079
 rocks climbs rocks to sack zerpa rocks 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.909
 Until the last consequences 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.950

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.670

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.130
 ohio in the beech- I'll die just like that but 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.020

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.180
 with pain 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.160
 scola and debilitated does not matter because if 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.600
 it comes out of a scissor x should kill 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.500
 another dragon is taken out there 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.100

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.100
