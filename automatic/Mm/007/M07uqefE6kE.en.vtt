zoo<00:00:59.480> and<00:01:00.559> just<00:01:01.559> offer<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> top<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
zoo and just offer up to the top and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.560 
zoo and just offer up to the top and
then<00:01:03.300> ease<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.080> band<00:01:04.289> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> sides<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.970> then

matter of easing it on gently and then
making<00:01:15.869> sure<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> silicon<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:19.590> goes

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
making sure that the silicon just goes

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.900 
making sure that the silicon just goes
around<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.610> edges<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.740> iphone<00:01:25.729> just<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
around the edges of the iphone just a

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.609 
around the edges of the iphone just a
matter<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.209> just<00:01:27.270> manipulating<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.349> into

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
matter of just manipulating it into

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.669 
matter of just manipulating it into
place<00:01:28.890> until<00:01:29.300> all<00:01:30.300> of<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.660> green<00:01:31.020> silicon

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
place until all of this green silicon

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.919 
place until all of this green silicon
pops<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:32.940> place<00:01:33.349> and<00:01:34.349> then<00:01:35.690> same<00:01:36.690> on<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
pops into place and then same on the

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.830 
pops into place and then same on the
back<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.920> make<00:01:38.130> sure<00:01:38.160> that<00:01:38.459> all<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.539> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
back just make sure that all of the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.570 
back just make sure that all of the
edges<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.170> pushed<00:01:40.500> around<00:01:40.740> nicely<00:01:46.459> there<00:01:47.459> we

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
edges are pushed around nicely there we

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.570 
edges are pushed around nicely there we
go<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.569> that's<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.050> place<00:01:49.349> now<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.340> can

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
go so that's it in place now as you can

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.999 
go so that's it in place now as you can
see<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.569> offers<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:51.989> protection<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.800> side

type protector on the back of the iphone
4<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.800> tight<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.130> is<00:02:33.460> just

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
4 and it is so so tight that is just

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.370 
4 and it is so so tight that is just
pushing<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.240> film<00:02:34.570> protector<00:02:34.990> up<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.170> little

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
pushing this film protector up a little

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.270 
pushing this film protector up a little
bit<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.740> needs<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> little<00:02:36.100> bit<00:02:36.220> of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
bit so it needs a little bit of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.670 
bit so it needs a little bit of
manipulating<00:02:37.060> around<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.260> stop<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.590> from

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
manipulating around to stop it from

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.070 
manipulating around to stop it from
lifting<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.250> screen<00:02:39.610> protectors<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.750> hasn't

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
lifting up screen protectors it hasn't

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.170 
lifting up screen protectors it hasn't
done<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.320> same<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.770> front<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.520> no<00:02:42.760> problem

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
done the same on the front so no problem

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.910 
done the same on the front so no problem
on<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.420> front<00:02:43.630> at<00:02:43.720> all<00:02:43.900> but<00:02:44.530> overall<00:02:44.800> really

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
on the front at all but overall really

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.030 
on the front at all but overall really
fetching<00:02:45.910> design<00:02:46.270> now<00:02:46.990> obviously<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:47.890> not

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
fetching design now obviously it's not

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.380 
fetching design now obviously it's not
going<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.250> protect<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.790> screen<00:02:49.120> or<00:02:49.360> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
going to protect to the screen or the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.780 
going to protect to the screen or the
back<00:02:49.510> but<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.050> will<00:02:50.260> offer<00:02:50.560> some<00:02:51.040> impact

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
back but it will offer some impact

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.820 
back but it will offer some impact
protection<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.990> drop<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> lands

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
protection if you drop it and it lands

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.160 
protection if you drop it and it lands
on<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.190> side<00:02:54.459> or<00:02:54.490> one<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.090> corners<00:02:55.510> so

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
on the side or one of the corners so

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.630 
on the side or one of the corners so
it's<00:02:56.290> got<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.470> decent<00:02:57.040> amount<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.520> protection

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
it's got a decent amount of protection

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.220 
it's got a decent amount of protection
for<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.120> side<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:58.900> should<00:02:59.080> also

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
for the side and it should also

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.290 
for the side and it should also
alleviate<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.010> problem<00:03:00.400> with<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.850> antenna

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
alleviate that problem with the antenna
