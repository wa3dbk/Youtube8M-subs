hi<00:00:08.639> my<00:00:08.880> name<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.090> Chris<00:00:09.389> sugan<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:10.050> our<00:00:10.230> bikes

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
hi my name is Chris sugan with our bikes

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.079 
hi my name is Chris sugan with our bikes
introducing<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.030> our<00:00:12.179> new<00:00:12.360> jet<00:00:12.719> 9r<00:00:13.259> do

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
introducing you to our new jet 9r do

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.580 
introducing you to our new jet 9r do
basically<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> jetliner<00:00:15.660> do<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> carbon

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
basically the jetliner do is a carbon

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.730 
basically the jetliner do is a carbon
version<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.100> our<00:00:17.670> aluminum<00:00:18.240> jet<00:00:18.660> nine<00:00:18.840> or<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
version of our aluminum jet nine or the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.470 
version of our aluminum jet nine or the
major<00:00:19.949> changes<00:00:20.609> between<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.000> two<00:00:21.119> models

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
major changes between the two models

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.849 
major changes between the two models
other<00:00:21.840> than<00:00:22.109> being<00:00:22.260> made<00:00:22.439> out<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.680> carbon

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
other than being made out of carbon

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.480 
other than being made out of carbon

millimeters in the rear and geometry of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.730 
millimeters in the rear and geometry of
the<00:00:29.490> bike<00:00:29.699> has<00:00:30.119> been<00:00:30.330> optimized<00:00:31.140> around<00:00:31.289> 100

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the bike has been optimized around 100

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.840 
the bike has been optimized around 100
and<00:00:32.090> 120<00:00:33.090> millimeter<00:00:33.480> Forks<00:00:34.579> uses<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.670> new

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
and 120 millimeter Forks uses a new

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.700 
and 120 millimeter Forks uses a new
moniker<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.540> us<00:00:36.660> called<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> cardio<00:00:37.410> which

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
moniker for us called the cardio which

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.530 
moniker for us called the cardio which
is<00:00:37.860> race<00:00:38.100> state<00:00:38.370> optimized<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.120> basically

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
is race state optimized and basically

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.990 
is race state optimized and basically
what<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.840> means<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.680> our<00:00:41.399> highest<00:00:41.790> end

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
what that means is just our highest end

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.020 
what that means is just our highest end
product<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.570> we've<00:00:43.079> designed<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:44.030> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
suspension systems are optimized around

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.840 
suspension systems are optimized around
a<00:01:36.600> certain<00:01:36.869> chain<00:01:37.680> ring<00:01:37.860> size<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> cars

a certain chain ring size but the cars

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.000 
a certain chain ring size but the cars
is<00:01:39.060> changing<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> pen

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
is changing in the pen

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.500 
is changing in the pen
so<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.190> can<00:01:40.370> you'll<00:01:40.880> see<00:01:41.060> if<00:01:41.150> you're<00:01:41.300> in<00:01:41.390> the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
so you can you'll see if you're in the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.090 
so you can you'll see if you're in the
large<00:01:41.690> chain<00:01:41.930> small<00:01:42.530> chain<00:01:42.710> ring<00:01:42.740> that

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
large chain small chain ring that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.840 
large chain small chain ring that
suspension<00:01:43.550> system<00:01:43.930> reacts<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.080> same<00:01:45.110> way

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
suspension system reacts the same way

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.170 
suspension system reacts the same way
the<00:01:47.200> arc<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.470> suspension<00:01:49.190> system<00:01:49.310> keeps

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
the arc of the suspension system keeps

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.060 
the arc of the suspension system keeps
the<00:01:50.450> chain<00:01:50.960> growth<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.410> an<00:01:51.470> absolute<00:01:51.860> minimum

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
the chain growth to an absolute minimum

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.780 
the chain growth to an absolute minimum
so<00:01:52.400> you<00:01:52.490> have<00:01:52.700> almost<00:01:53.240> zero<00:01:53.830> kickback<00:01:54.830> under

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
so you have almost zero kickback under

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.420 
so you have almost zero kickback under
suspension<00:01:56.180> loading<00:01:56.630> no<00:01:57.590> brake<00:01:57.860> jack<00:01:58.130> under

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
suspension loading no brake jack under

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.400 
suspension loading no brake jack under
under<00:01:58.850> braking<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.480> going<00:01:59.870> over<00:01:59.990> staggered

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
under braking and going over staggered

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.220 
under braking and going over staggered
bumps<00:02:00.910> and<00:02:01.910> also<00:02:02.240> very<00:02:02.510> efficient<00:02:02.900> moving

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
bumps and also very efficient moving

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.220 
bumps and also very efficient moving
forward<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.940> main<00:02:05.060> thing<00:02:05.240> we<00:02:05.330> feel<00:02:05.540> about

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
forward so the main thing we feel about

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.630 
forward so the main thing we feel about
our<00:02:06.350> suspension<00:02:06.770> system<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.190> lot<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.430> people
