00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello everyone in this video we are with you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.160
 let's talk which one we should buy 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.780
 multicooker 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.400
 I show this video talking about 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.640
 Multicooker Redmond 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.980
 and rushed so we have a bowl bowl 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.519
 I have three and a half liters but 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.920
 general pan pulls and 4 liters 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 take my first piece of advice as much as possible 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.200
 honestly if you knew i would take 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.110
 probably but maxim there is a maximum of 6 liters 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.719
 1 to 7 am wrong even if you have a family 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.559
 little one or two people anyway 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.660
 take a big pot large 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.300
 because today you have a small family 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.730
 you have a big one tomorrow if you buy 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.210
 you must take a small slow cooker 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.190
 a small multicooker same walls intent 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.469
 that you have on it will be something 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.649
 harvests something or you cook 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.030
 Only porridge because on it you already soup 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.619
 I can't cook my tees too, but I 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.479
 I do not know there sooner or later anyway 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.890
 there will come there friend friends there I don't know 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.930
 relatives and you are on it a lot that is not 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.439
 cook so you need to take in advance 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.750
 already my personal opinion is big either 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.630
 take a little but only for porridge either 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.710
 something on the little things cook so on further 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.360
 by the way when you buy a multivark 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.310
 maybe not for each multicooker will give 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.500
 like this, but a spoon to interfere with and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.380
 will give on the same small white 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.939
 ladle but honestly I can you 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.689
 advise that you can immediately 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.750
 throw out or give the kids a play 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.090
 we donâ€™t need them much 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.399
 why because we have pan up 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.820
 special non-stick so 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.750
 coating very good here I am not in vain 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.990
 bought from such a lady skimmer see 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.930
 yes she goes so rubber she won't 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.810
 Scratch our and, respectively, need 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.440
 take a ladle like that too 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.860
 conveniently 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.260
 prepare a very cool thing and even 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.720
 buying multicookers pay attention 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.770
 so that you have such sections where 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.340
 you can cook manti or steamed 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.600
 prepares vegetables and fish in chicken breasts and 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.640
 so on so the third point when buying 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.460
 multicookers pay attention to 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.610
 so that was a special take that is you 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.160
 put something to cook and set 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.080
 the lock on all the buttons so baby or you 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.350
 inadvertently did not click something he already 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.160
 I repeatedly this was the way I forgot 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.310
 say more about this grid of orders 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.230
 which can fry french fries 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.570
 See that she also came in the kit 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.110
 you as a gift nose and honestly I have never 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.210
 I did not use it, I am sure that it will 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.200
 fry fries good because 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.840
 maximum temperature of 170 degrees 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.680
 here but something not got me by me 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.600
 so much we do not prefer such fried 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.459
 That's basically the multicooker charm in 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.400
 the fact that it is prepared for us very 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.880
 wonderful cereals and cooks there 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.020
 potato works stew so given 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.340
 tour with a bed for extinguishing and for the park 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.360
 steaming she is very good 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.090
 fits this very cool so another 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.380
 take into account when purchasing a multicooker 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.360
 their so that you had with the cord going 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.950
 there was still such an adapter switch 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.800
 the switch here we turned on 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.790
 that's uncomfortable when you constantly menu 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.410
 8 works when you use 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.560
 general you me memory that it is very 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.810
 it is convenient and I think that it is possible 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.510
 the last moment I want you 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.600
 say this is what if you pay 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.050
 attention here is the pan is not present here 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.880
 pens here specially 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.370
 here and here as in a regular saucepan 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.269
 to take away and pull out this huge 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.400
 minus here if I knew all these details 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.220
 us body hands this is my first multicooker 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.150
 then I would certainly take 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.550
 firstly with large volumes and 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.730
 obligatory chop off the pan to 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.650
 she was with handles here in this slow cooker 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.290
 even if I buy a separate pan 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.440
 bitches then she already will not go here she does not 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.700
 it snaps into place because the cutouts are not this 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.460
 huge minus 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.680
 I've already been burned many times on this one 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.640
 pans uncomfortable and we take out and rush 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.790
 there is little towel for what is convenient 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.490
 here that is such a specific minus and 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.610
 when you're her by hand we also don't 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.810
 quite convenient when there is no handle so that 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.540
 hold it with your other hand be ah yes 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.640
 I forgot to say 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.560
 mono my multicooker redmond by 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.540
 maximum temperature at which 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.910
 you can fry meat 170 degrees if you 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.840
 you allow finances take as much as possible 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.560
 more but not lower why because 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.130
 when you put an example temperature 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.080
 210-220 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.770
 firstly the temperature is very fast 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.919
 heats up it is very comfortable in the second 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.870
 sometimes you need something to like 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.140
 Heavy fire straight over high heat 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.940
 let's say when I cook pilaf uncomfortable 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:41.950
 fry meat with onions when I fry on 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.340
 170 degrees tons roasted wrong 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:48.460
 how I want that is reluctant to add heat 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.460
 as let's say in the gas stove there fire in 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.950
 total as much as possible right there not 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.820
 it turns out so take you early or 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.419
 late these degrees will come in handy later 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.850
 menu 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.620
 but there are generally many functions that I 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.800
 I do not use, let's say rice and cereals 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.430
 definitely something to cook porridge Empty 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.060
 yearning too need hot hot i too 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.850
 seldom understood in general remember 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:18.590
 fiddling extinguishing a must 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.100
 milk porridge if you kids have soup and 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:24.560
 sure yogurt do not need baking and 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.460
 very cool thing baking is not 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:32.900
 I use steam steam I have not used yet 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.840
 can not used in general boiling quenching 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.780
 soups and steaming these are 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.120
 the main advantages that need to pay 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.200
 Multicookers we fry less often 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.150
 Of course, but the quenching is generally a topic. 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.169
 health is also useful highlights 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.750
 you and I can understand everything you can run 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.850
 shop boldly take and do your 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.610
 purchase 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.700
 but all on this I finish the video with everything 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.700
 until
