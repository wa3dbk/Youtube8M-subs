let's<00:00:00.329> pretend<00:00:00.690> easier<00:00:01.050> alginate<00:00:01.560> impression

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.360 
let's pretend easier alginate impression

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.269 
let's pretend easier alginate impression
but<00:00:03.360> if<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.780> was<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.049> full<00:00:04.440> denture<00:00:04.680> case<00:00:05.040> what

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
but if this was a full denture case what

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.379 
but if this was a full denture case what
would<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.549> do<00:00:06.500> leaving<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.560> box<00:00:08.150> meeting<00:00:09.150> box

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
would you do leaving the box meeting box

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.410 
would you do leaving the box meeting box
okay<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.710> look<00:00:10.920> at<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> freedom<00:00:11.519> areas<00:00:11.910> you

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
okay and look at the freedom areas you

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.939 
okay and look at the freedom areas you
would<00:00:12.570> follow<00:00:12.840> your<00:00:15.109> profile<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.379> contour<00:00:16.920> of

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
would follow your profile the contour of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.650 
would follow your profile the contour of
your<00:00:21.650> freedom<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> put

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
your freedom here this is when you put

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.070 
your freedom here this is when you put
your<00:00:24.689> beating<00:00:25.140> wax<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.400> shape<00:00:26.730> now<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
your beating wax in that shape now the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.130 
your beating wax in that shape now the
critical<00:00:28.590> point<00:00:28.939> is<00:00:29.939> how<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.260> manage<00:00:31.529> this

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
critical point is how do you manage this

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.610 
critical point is how do you manage this
from<00:00:34.140> happening<00:00:35.780> things<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.320> only

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
from happening things like this only

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.510 
from happening things like this only
maxillary<00:00:41.030> because<00:00:42.030> again<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.520> put

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
maxillary because again if you just put

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.389 
maxillary because again if you just put
stone<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.270> there<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.899> thin<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
stone in there this will be thin so you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.090 
stone in there this will be thin so you
need<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.789> reinforce<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.809> disel<00:00:49.379> extensions

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
need to reinforce this disel extensions

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.389 
need to reinforce this disel extensions
what<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.700> wax<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.469> lot<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> people<00:00:52.860> will

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
what do wax and a lot of people will

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.040 
what do wax and a lot of people will
follow<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.829> just<00:00:55.829> end<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.870> going<00:00:57.870> over

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
follow this and just end up going over

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.490 
follow this and just end up going over
like<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> wrong<00:00:59.840> on<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> horizontal

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
like this which is wrong on a horizontal

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.570 
like this which is wrong on a horizontal
you'd<00:01:02.280> extend<00:01:02.699> your<00:01:02.879> wax<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:04.369> before<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.430> goes

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you'd extend your wax up before it goes

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.510 
you'd extend your wax up before it goes
out<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.960> forms<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> border<00:01:08.040> this

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
out because that forms the border this

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.210 
out because that forms the border this
part<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> impression<00:01:10.220> okay

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
part right here on the impression okay

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.300 
part right here on the impression okay
but<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.780> distal<00:01:13.320> side<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
but as you go to the distal side if you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.600 
but as you go to the distal side if you
don't<00:01:14.549> put<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.090> wax<00:01:15.439> horizontally<00:01:16.460> if<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
don't put the wax horizontally if you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.149 
don't put the wax horizontally if you
just<00:01:17.820> keep<00:01:17.970> following<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.689> height<00:01:19.159> you're

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
just keep following the height you're

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.620 
just keep following the height you're
going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> end<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.820> still<00:01:21.060> very<00:01:21.240> thin

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
going to end up it's still very thin

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.800 
going to end up it's still very thin
distal<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> date<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> transition

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
distal so the date this is a transition

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.480 
distal so the date this is a transition
from<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> horizontal<00:01:28.040> I've<00:01:29.040> been<00:01:29.189> from<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
from a horizontal I've been from a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.940 
from a horizontal I've been from a
vertical<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> horizontal<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.470> distal

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
vertical to a horizontal on the distal

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.010 
vertical to a horizontal on the distal
somewhere<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.090> where<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> start<00:01:33.720> scrubbing

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
somewhere here where you start scrubbing

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.570 
somewhere here where you start scrubbing
in<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.460> go<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.939> here

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
in you go from here

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.600 
in you go from here
extended<00:01:38.580> back<00:01:39.050> okay<00:01:40.220> normally<00:01:41.220> again<00:01:41.550> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
extended back okay normally again I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.990 
extended back okay normally again I
would<00:01:42.120> say<00:01:42.360> quarter-inch<00:01:43.460> give<00:01:44.460> me<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.760> much

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
would say quarter-inch give me that much

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.140 
would say quarter-inch give me that much
of<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.270> stone<00:01:45.570> extension<00:01:46.370> before<00:01:47.370> you<00:01:47.730> build<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
of a stone extension before you build it

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.800 
of a stone extension before you build it
up<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.330> them<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.740> boxing<00:01:50.190> marks<00:01:50.520> okay<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
up with them the boxing marks okay so

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.040 
up with them the boxing marks okay so
reading<00:01:52.260> waxed<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.980> boxing<00:01:53.670> match<00:01:53.930> stick<00:01:54.930> your

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
reading waxed in boxing match stick your

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.500 
reading waxed in boxing match stick your
wax<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.650> put<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.160> together<00:01:56.340> okay<00:01:57.150> so<00:01:57.210> you're

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
wax to put it together okay so you're

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.750 
wax to put it together okay so you're
saying<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> extend<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.160> back<00:01:59.370> with

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
saying you have to extend the back with

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.730 
saying you have to extend the back with
what<00:02:00.000> yes<00:02:01.130> horizontal<00:02:02.480> this<00:02:03.480> one<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:04.440> just

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
what yes horizontal this one with just

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.040 
what yes horizontal this one with just
the<00:02:04.980> beating<00:02:05.310> wats<00:02:05.490> ya<00:02:05.970> have<00:02:06.570> me<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.870> of<00:02:06.900> the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
the beating wats ya have me one of the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.570 
the beating wats ya have me one of the
rope<00:02:07.230> wax<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:07.890> where<00:02:08.040> they<00:02:08.160> are<00:02:08.190> this

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
rope wax you know where they are this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.940 
rope wax you know where they are this
way<00:02:08.850> because<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> rule<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.890> down<00:02:11.130> right

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
way because as a rule you go down right

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.600 
way because as a rule you go down right
then<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.460> would<00:02:14.610> France<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:17.400> see

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
then you would France it you see

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.880 
then you would France it you see
something<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.000> this<00:02:18.410> there's<00:02:19.410> no<00:02:19.590> point

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
something like this there's no point

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.950 
something like this there's no point
letting<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.430> interfere<00:02:21.030> with<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.390> just

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
letting that interfere with you just

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.930 
letting that interfere with you just
cutting<00:02:22.290> across<00:02:23.240> whether<00:02:24.240> it's<00:02:24.510> Elgin<00:02:25.220> on<00:02:26.220> PBS

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
cutting across whether it's Elgin on PBS

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.160 
cutting across whether it's Elgin on PBS
or<00:02:27.210> whatever

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.280 

so<00:02:31.170> now<00:02:31.379> my<00:02:31.620> wax<00:02:31.950> continues<00:02:34.790> horizontally<00:02:36.290> at

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
so now my wax continues horizontally at

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.960 
so now my wax continues horizontally at
the<00:02:37.440> lowest<00:02:37.830> point<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.340> impression<00:02:38.849> is

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
the lowest point of that impression is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.940 
the lowest point of that impression is
where<00:02:39.150> your<00:02:39.299> wax<00:02:39.540> comes<00:02:39.900> up

see their best to go right it's going to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.870 
see their best to go right it's going to
go<00:03:50.569> like<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.319> then<00:03:52.220> we<00:03:52.340> have<00:03:52.519> all<00:03:52.700> this

rise<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.100> want<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.430> see<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:55.819> in<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.269> back

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
rise so you want to see that in the back

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
rise so you want to see that in the back
and<00:03:56.840> just<00:03:57.109> cut<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:57.500> across<00:03:58.090> from<00:03:59.090> here<00:03:59.569> to<00:04:00.139> here

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
and just cut it across from here to here

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.390 
and just cut it across from here to here
is<00:04:00.680> half<00:04:01.040> inch<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:03.019> anything<00:04:03.560> over<00:04:03.769> that<00:04:04.069> is<00:04:04.250> an

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
is half inch so anything over that is an

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.720 
is half inch so anything over that is an
access<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.900> interferes<00:04:06.500> with<00:04:06.709> lab<00:04:06.920> work<00:04:07.160> if

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
access it interferes with lab work if

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.849 
access it interferes with lab work if
you<00:04:07.910> have<00:04:08.030> too<00:04:08.209> much<00:04:08.389> in<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.690> tongue<00:04:08.900> but<00:04:09.680> you

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
you have too much in the tongue but you

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.030 
you have too much in the tongue but you
do<00:04:10.190> need<00:04:10.489> this<00:04:10.850> filled<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.780> because<00:04:12.560> if<00:04:12.799> you

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
do need this filled in because if you

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.440
