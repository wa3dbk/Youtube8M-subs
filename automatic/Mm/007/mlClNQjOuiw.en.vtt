a really quick and easy way to make a

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.020 
a really quick and easy way to make a
vector<00:00:06.029> style<00:00:07.400> illustration<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.519> guess<00:00:08.700> in

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
vector style illustration I guess in

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.799 
vector style illustration I guess in
only<00:00:09.960> Adobe<00:00:10.320> Illustrator<00:00:10.849> so<00:00:11.849> first<00:00:12.360> take

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
only Adobe Illustrator so first take

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.570 
only Adobe Illustrator so first take
your<00:00:12.929> photo<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.530> anything<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.920> like<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.400> you

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
want to go to window go down and open

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.939 
want to go to window go down and open
the<00:00:17.070> image<00:00:17.100> trace<00:00:17.730> window<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.830> it's<00:00:19.830> going

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the image trace window here it's going

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.950 
the image trace window here it's going
to<00:00:20.010> bring<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.369> little<00:00:20.520> box<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.060> you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
to bring out this little box and you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.450 
to bring out this little box and you
have<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.109> whole<00:00:22.320> bunch<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.769> presets<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.340> can

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
have a whole bunch of presets you can

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
have a whole bunch of presets you can
use<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.570> kind<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.140> get<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> nice<00:00:26.510> art<00:00:27.510> style<00:00:27.689> but

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
use to kind of get a nice art style but

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:39.860 
use to kind of get a nice art style but
we're<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> use<00:00:29.160> six<00:00:29.519> colors<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.150> now

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.740 

all<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.190> once<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.480> can

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
all right so once we have this you can

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.180 
all right so once we have this you can
see<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.140> put<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> six<00:00:43.980> different

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
see it's put it down to six different

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
see it's put it down to six different
tones<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.809> also<00:00:46.519> located<00:00:47.519> for<00:00:48.120> us<00:00:48.269> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
tones and it's also located for us and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.030 
tones and it's also located for us and
the<00:00:48.660> different<00:00:48.989> patches<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.440> color<00:00:49.589> so<00:00:49.890> it's

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
the different patches of color so it's

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.689 
the different patches of color so it's
split<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.399> up

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
split it up

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.000 
split it up
it's<00:00:51.449> called<00:00:51.660> tracing<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:52.860> this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it's called tracing so here with this

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.889 
it's called tracing so here with this
slider<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.519> can<00:00:53.550> actually<00:00:53.730> edit<00:00:54.030> how<00:00:54.690> many

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
slider you can actually edit how many

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.889 
slider you can actually edit how many
colors<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.879> processing<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:57.149> take<00:00:57.720> into

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
colors the processing will take into

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.990 
colors the processing will take into
account<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:58.979> we<00:00:59.070> slide<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.790> about

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
account so if we slide that up to about

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.490 
account so if we slide that up to about
20

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.170 

so<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.190> will<00:01:12.310> see<00:01:12.430> now<00:01:12.580> there's<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.910> lot<00:01:13.090> more

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
so you will see now there's a lot more

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.910 
so you will see now there's a lot more
depth<00:01:13.480> in<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.960> color<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.350> then<00:01:14.440> we'll<00:01:14.500> stick

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
depth in the color and then we'll stick

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.890 
depth in the color and then we'll stick
with<00:01:14.980> this<00:01:15.190> one<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:15.580> once<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:16.420> have<00:01:16.510> that<00:01:16.570> and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
with this one so once you have that and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.580 
with this one so once you have that and
you<00:01:17.410> want<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.620> turn<00:01:17.770> it<00:01:17.950> into<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.310> vector<00:01:19.590> open

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
you want to turn it into a vector open

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.550 
you want to turn it into a vector open
the<00:01:20.680> object<00:01:20.800> window<00:01:21.580> go<00:01:22.390> down<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.960> image<00:01:23.230> trace

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
the object window go down to image trace

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.410 
the object window go down to image trace
and<00:01:23.860> hit<00:01:24.640> expand<00:01:26.310> okay<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.820> now<00:01:27.970> it's<00:01:28.120> sliced

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
and hit expand okay so now it's sliced

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.420 
and hit expand okay so now it's sliced
it<00:01:28.630> up<00:01:28.720> into<00:01:29.020> paths<00:01:29.290> it's<00:01:30.010> going<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.250> right

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
it up into paths it's going to right

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.910 
it up into paths it's going to right
click<00:01:30.460> hit<00:01:31.330> ungroup<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.020> from<00:01:32.530> here<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:32.830> can

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
click hit ungroup and from here you can

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.340 
click hit ungroup and from here you can
just<00:01:32.980> go<00:01:33.250> around<00:01:33.810> delete<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> little<00:01:35.080> bit<00:01:35.200> C

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
just go around delete a little bit C

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.270 
just go around delete a little bit C
don't<00:01:35.500> want<00:01:37.560> clean<00:01:38.560> up<00:01:38.710> all<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.010> little

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
don't want clean up all the little

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.010 
don't want clean up all the little
pixels<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:42.340> you're<00:01:43.180> left<00:01:43.450> with<00:01:43.930> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
pixels and then you're left with a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.060 
pixels and then you're left with a
vector<00:01:47.020> cut<00:01:47.200> out<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.530> image<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:47.950> with

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
vector cut out of the image and with

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.950 
vector cut out of the image and with
that<00:01:48.280> obviously<00:01:48.510> you<00:01:49.510> know<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.690> can<00:01:49.840> do<00:01:49.930> it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
that obviously you know you can do it

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.650 
that obviously you know you can do it
with<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.140> lot<00:01:50.350> more<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:50.770> can<00:01:50.860> create<00:01:51.660> basically

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
with a lot more you can create basically

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.960 
with a lot more you can create basically
a<00:01:52.750> piece<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.110> artwork<00:01:53.380> it's<00:01:53.860> kind<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.729> cheating

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
a piece of artwork it's kind of cheating

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.580 
a piece of artwork it's kind of cheating
how<00:01:55.540> easy<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.900> is<00:01:55.990> but<00:01:56.530> let's<00:01:57.310> heat<00:01:57.550> it
