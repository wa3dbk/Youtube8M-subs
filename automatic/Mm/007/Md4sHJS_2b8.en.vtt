00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 so much to aboard rockets are miss that 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.609
 we're here in a new video this time 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.730
 in the apple world 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.170
 we will analyze the iPhone 6 s 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.690
 a device that has yet to come out 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.929
 will most likely be announced on 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.449
 September 9th the apple conference but already 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 on the internet as they do every year 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.050
 lots of information about this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.289
 device then we go to discover them 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.289
 together 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.519
 the first information that comes to us 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.979
 talk about the camera camera that 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:45.739
 still on aicon 6 it is about 8 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.780
 megapixel a sensor man a very good one 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.729
 sexual that barbarous replaced with one 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.399
 12 megapixel camera 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:54.530
 this will guarantee us really photos 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.839
 best not only with regard to i 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.839
 megapixels that don't make a camera 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.799
 but need more details in the 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.780
 photo 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.000
 but the important thing will be the sensor 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.950
 which will be replaced and will allow us to 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.350
 take photos in low light 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.539
 very much more beautiful another thing 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.929
 much talk is the new standard 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.789
 4k and with it does not record in 4k then 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.619
 most likely it will be introduced 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.959
 together maybe an imovie update 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.659
 to allow precisely to achieve 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.610
 really phenomenal clips too 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.259
 front camera will be changed yes 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.750
 talks about a 2 megapixel camera 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.940
 which will allow us to do self i 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.549
 best and calls maybe in face 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.709
 time with exceptional quality 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.200
 obviously the second novelty that will come 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.920
 introduced will be a better processor 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.890
 it will come to the chip at 9 we talk about 2 gb 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.840
 of ram will be very fast not so much for 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.369
 daily use but above all in use 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.399
 games like every year for sure 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.229
 will not fail together with the presentation of 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.329
 this chip a real demonstration 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.579
 of the potential of this processor 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.189
 maybe we 'll see him accompanied by the 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.070
 usually infinity blade or some other 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.950
 brand well known novelty instead of 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.229
 resonates everywhere is the force touch 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.120
 when it was introduced by apple watch 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.239
 a new type of was introduced 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.390
 touch that is a long press that there 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.609
 allows you to push the screen and had 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.410
 a much better tactile sensation 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.630
 will also be introduced on iphone ne 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.920
 may be affected a little by the thickness and the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.650
 however, dimensions will not come 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.959
 so maybe change a little bit more 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.940
 this would also partially solve the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.609
 problem of the well gates that has formed 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.410
 with the iPhone 6 what happened to me 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.780
 also to me then with this new one 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.180
 introduction we will also solve a 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.510
 well known problem but it is not only this 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.670
 the novelty that will come 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.069
 not just a shell on the body anymore 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.980
 big but a new color indeed will not be 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.680
 much loved by us men but women 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.799
 were crazy talk about a new color 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.620
 golden a rose a lot very pink 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.260
 refined and precisely recommended ho 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.970
 addressed to the female version 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.280
 many of the news we see on the buoys 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.709
 places like serious and animated backgrounds 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.959
 will be introduced in the new iphone with 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.459
 the new diary update s9 yes 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.609
 rumor that we will have the possibility of 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.769
 have precisely the animated backgrounds what 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.159
 which lately has never been 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.069
 updated by about us 7 that there are i 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.900
 usual two dynamic backgrounds than with the 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.989
 balls that turn then new backgrounds 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.120
 animated a new siri not by chance in the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.489
 presentation of the business card 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.159
 in the September 9 event a 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.299
 hint Assiri this thing is not from 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.540
 ignore 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.930
 probably there will be a serious 2.0 maybe 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.730
 more autonomous more friend we say that there 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.769
 will give advice based on where there is 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.049
 we will find and based on what we are 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.169
 doing regarding the piece 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.780
 sacred and iphone so the battery from 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.609
 some items 16 that will be reduced one 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.980
 something not very nice though with 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.650
 introduction of ios and 9 there will be one 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.510
 energy saving mode they say 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.209
 which will help a great deal 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.750
 the average user then with this new one 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.879
 mode we could last until evening to 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.180
 who want a much bigger battery 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.019
 and durable I highly recommend iphone 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.910
 6 plus 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.340
 I forgot to tell you that this too 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.229
 passed update to version s 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.180
 finally we talk about prices this year not 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.970
 they should vary so we will talk 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.150
 however, 729 euros for the market 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.380
 Italian while 839 for the plus version 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.599
 as for the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.820
 marketing in italy as 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.340
 we know we are always in the second 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.070
 part well way out then calculating that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.639
 the 9 September presentation is the date 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.800
 the most likely trade is 18 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.479
 September in Italy we will see it 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.020
 certainly before October 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.810
