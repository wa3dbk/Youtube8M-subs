 as important as the decor is the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 organization of house environments 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.570
 store things in a way 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.899
 increases the service life of the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.640
 objects saves time and ensures a clean 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.180
 faster and more effective 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.710
 in addition, the organization of 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 provides more free space in the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.780
 minnozzi age and prevents people from 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 lose things inside the house 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.559
 We know this happens but it will 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.539
 we put this old board into practice 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.059
 and look around you 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.100
 take note of the tips and put into practice 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.260
 the organization in your home 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 Let's start with the kitchen rule 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.940
 cooking with any other 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.409
 environment is to leave the objects that are 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.610
 most frequently used 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:08.330
 the nearest and most accessible unlike the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.130
 that many make the ideal is to keep the 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.620
 appliances outside the box and leave 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080
 Always in sight but be careful 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.820
 if the devices are under the web 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.850
 watch out for possible leaks 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.640
 which may damage the appliances in the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.870
 service and dispenses the organization 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.020
 it is also fundamental 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.040
 never put food next to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.500
 cleaning material in dispensing the candy 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.080
 should always be kept in view in order to 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.420
 the ants are easily perceived 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.160
 the newer products should be 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.070
 always behind the older products 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.750
 so that they never win before 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.000
 consumed 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.400
 leaving for the living room avoid objects 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.470
 small scattered for example 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.250
 provides a tray for storing the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.190
 tea pot 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.190
 magazines and newspapers should be 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.400
 stacked or magazine rack remember if 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.450
 periodically follow them 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.550
 to the bathroom 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.670
 the most important is to leave the bench 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.709
 as free as possible, use 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.680
 whatever you want 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.530
 the organization is also a word of order 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.930
 in the office, choice of color passes 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.250
 documents to save documents 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.130

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.290

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.170
 suffers from clutter the fourth 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.140
 the bedroom cabinet best separates the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.850
 clothes by color is always a good line 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.420

 always put clothes that are closer than 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.420
 You most often wear boxed shoes. 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.920
 confuse and bring about a drawback of 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.170
