00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello people I hope I'm very good at 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.250
 today I'm going to bring you a video here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.340
 or rather I bring you a video with a 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.920
 topic that is to reflect lately 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.980
 in a forum I received no call racing 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.719
 center level a very controversial issue and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.670
 this controversial issue came about because 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.650
 some scans of the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.470
 gameinformer magazine that where in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.670
 November will inform us more 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 details of what was rescinded a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.860
 revelations 2 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.930
 In that forum there have been disputes over 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.210
 know who will be the villainous woman of 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.210
 resident evil revelations 2 there are names 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 like annette birkin elisa clover peron and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.080
 boxes word the grandmother of the law of alexia 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.839
 and of alfred also load radamés excel 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.239
 to scripts or characters that have 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.070
 died earlier in the saga but that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.690
 people think that capcom is going to revive 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.410
 to these characters to put them in 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.619
 filling a new game a game that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.270
 never seen it or is it I see it very 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:04.840
 impossible 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.360
 starting with the net birkin jane birkin 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.150
 the wife of William Birkin who 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.860
 they die in resident evil revelations 2 yes 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.450
 I'm waiting for you, forgive me, but I have 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.250
 what do I have to tell you what happened 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.110
 with this character and the why I say that 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.880
 will not appear the memories go the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.210
 common virgin I think he dropped a 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.340
 metal post on top or birkin and has 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.890
 mutated completely from the chinga but 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.900
 it did not look very good in the birkin I think 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.360
 is discarded for me but nick 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.430
 ashford the grandmother of alfred and alexia al 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.810
 short who is mentioned in resident 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.840
 evil code veronica x is the supposed 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.180
 grandmother of the family the older who 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.720
 she is currently supposed to be dead 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.940
 veronica that revived is the most 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.250
 crazy that I've heard of a character 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.000
 that has never been seen 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.890
 lisa trevor impossible line trevor I do not know 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.280
 how he did not speak 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.630
 also as you hear in the trailer of or 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.220
 in the advance they show us of 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.100
 reception in a lesson 2 where it 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.900
 he clearly hears a woman talking not 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.929
 I think it's smooth trevor because if you 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.070
 Lisa agrees tribes just and said mom 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.050
 I do not think he says a total phrase 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.230
 I do not think it 's a whole whole phrase 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.390
 with his voice as it is true so 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.770
 for me lisa trevor discarded 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.420
 they carry it and we presume that in the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.150
 2008 or 2009 new the receipt and 5 died at 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.280
 hands of chris and sheva after that 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.390
 websites that he injected the virus now borox 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.110
 it was transformed I do not accept the parasite 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.530
 and then ended up mounted and died in the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.530
 history died 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.860
 Carla Radames can possibly do 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.290
 although I doubt that capcom wants 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.209
 fill in in received revelation 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.010
 2 get in full to understand 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.170
 better the character that appears in 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.330
 received 6 although I do not think so 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.270
 because capcom 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.390
 does not usually make fillers in some of 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.400
 your games but if you prequel another 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.010
 character that they say could appear 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.040
 it's jessica sherawat who is double 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.660
 waste agent revelations where 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.590
 it is mainly for the time it is done 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.080
 and then ends up betraying sometimes to 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.720
 his part of the investigation that touched him 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.870
 to do is more or less like a fairy wong 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.260
 but from revelations another character that 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.170
 it stands out in the theories of this page 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.450
 It is Alfred Axford who died in racing and 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.970
 looked for veronica after having 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.730
 reactivated his sister alexia ashford 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.910
 after being 15 years in hibernation 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.709
 so that the veronica virus is 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.330
 will adapt well to your body but as 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.010
 will be many count after that 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.100
 when he arrives at the laboratory where he was 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.080
 alexia alfred is inside the capsule 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.959
 where was alexia is to say that alexia 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.390
 put inside that alfred capsule and 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.720
 possibly it is not had not mentioned 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.700
 there possibly is that álex already I have 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.460
 injected something similar to the halo that 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.610
 injected albert wesker receives 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.520
 so that after so many years 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.770
 time revives normally but well then 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.750
 no it's not weird not the same is possible 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.100
 possible alex jones for is ruled out 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.720
 because that shit was left in 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.240
 we resist with veronicas so I see it 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.070
 impossible and the last crazy theory 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.370
 that I've heard apart from that of 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.050
 verónica short is that of álex wesker 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.300
 who would not be a man if as well as 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.150
 you are listening to it alex wesker 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.110
 it would not be man but a woman called 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.700
 alexandra wesker this theory was taken out 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.190
 on that page I'm going to the exercise 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.170
 of the video if they want to go to discuss 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.580
 with them you tell them to me 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.050
 do not say anything but 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.849
 I think they have not had enough 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.979
 value to upload a video like that and 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.470
 upload their own theories but here 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.990
 I'm the guy who uploads theories to each 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.419
 while on YouTube but well you are going to 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.360
 give your opinion that has been all theories 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.349
 crazy waste revelations 2 and 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.659
 take care not later until then there but 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.090
 before they leave to leave their like and 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:16.030
 comment left them in the description of 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.129
 video the invader game links so much of 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.810
 facebook and its official page in bear 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.330
 games are the creators of we received two 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.969
 is this robot that is the remastering 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.699
 of we received two on its cover of 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.440
 facebook says that it will be on the 31st of this 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.000
 month although we are still not given 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.979
 details of how we can download the 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.800
 game we can already know the exact date 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:40.469
 what day will this game many 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.469
 thanks for giving me your time and vice
