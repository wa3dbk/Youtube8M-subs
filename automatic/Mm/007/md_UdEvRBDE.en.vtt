through the back we can see the i/o port

through the back we can see the i/o port
and<00:02:55.819> down<00:02:55.940> here<00:02:56.209> we<00:02:56.299> can<00:02:56.480> see<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.130> Wi-Fi

think<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.630> is<00:03:02.780> some<00:03:03.130> 5dbi<00:03:04.239> which<00:03:05.239> could<00:03:05.959> be

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
think this is some 5dbi which could be

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.080 
think this is some 5dbi which could be
better<00:03:06.290> i<00:03:06.349> mean<00:03:06.530> i<00:03:06.709> would<00:03:07.010> i<00:03:07.280> would<00:03:07.340> prefer<00:03:07.670> 10

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
better i mean i would i would prefer 10

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
keyboard so again if i just go over what

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.210 
keyboard so again if i just go over what
i<00:03:27.410> plan<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.769> do<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.340> an<00:03:28.609> AMD<00:03:29.180> a8<00:03:29.829> 3.6<00:03:30.829> gigahertz

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
i plan to do is an AMD a8 3.6 gigahertz

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.949 
i plan to do is an AMD a8 3.6 gigahertz
quad-core<00:03:31.989> processor<00:03:32.989> um<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:34.630> could<00:03:35.630> have<00:03:35.840> gone

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
quad-core processor um I could have gone

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.509 
quad-core processor um I could have gone
with<00:03:36.019> an<00:03:36.200> a-10<00:03:36.560> but<00:03:36.829> I<00:03:36.859> think<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.250> area<00:03:37.400> is

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
with an a-10 but I think the area is

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.190 
with an a-10 but I think the area is
good<00:03:37.790> enough<00:03:38.000> as<00:03:38.209> well<00:03:38.389> don't<00:03:38.600> forget<00:03:38.690> guys<00:03:39.019> to

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
good enough as well don't forget guys to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.000 
good enough as well don't forget guys to
city<00:03:39.440> budget<00:03:39.980> gaming<00:03:40.400> pc<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.840> i<00:03:41.870> think<00:03:42.010> 3.6

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
city budget gaming pc so i think 3.6

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.690 
city budget gaming pc so i think 3.6
gigahertz<00:03:43.340> quad-core<00:03:43.639> is<00:03:44.389> more<00:03:44.780> than<00:03:44.870> enough

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
gigahertz quad-core is more than enough

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.610 
gigahertz quad-core is more than enough
now<00:03:46.700> here<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.180> most<00:03:47.600> important<00:03:48.109> but<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
now here is the most important but the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.449 
now here is the most important but the
graphics<00:03:49.840> right<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.650> if<00:03:51.709> i<00:03:51.829> just<00:03:51.859> get<00:03:52.250> two<00:03:52.370> for
