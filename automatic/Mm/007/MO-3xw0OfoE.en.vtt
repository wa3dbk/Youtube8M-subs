stuff so for me to just say that it's
the<00:01:45.090> middle<00:01:45.329> register<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.320> hair<00:01:46.649> would<00:01:46.950> be

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
the middle register on my hair would be

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.810 
the middle register on my hair would be
inaccurate<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.659> don't<00:01:49.079> know<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.549> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
inaccurate I don't know what it is but I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.569 
inaccurate I don't know what it is but I
do<00:01:51.299> feel<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.170> has<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.250> length

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
do feel like it's it's has more length

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.690 
do feel like it's it's has more length
than<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:55.100> did<00:01:56.100> before

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
than it did before

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.950 
than it did before
um<00:01:58.009> it's<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.030> could<00:02:00.210> always<00:02:00.360> tell<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:00.810> my

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
um it's and I could always tell well my

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.709 
um it's and I could always tell well my
hair<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.950> growing<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> always<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.540> this

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
hair is growing because I always do this

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.399 
hair is growing because I always do this
and<00:02:04.140> usually<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.329> able<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> notice

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and usually I can see I'm able to notice

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.900 
and usually I can see I'm able to notice
a<00:02:07.469> difference<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.890> mean<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.369> has<00:02:08.399> grown

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.699 
a difference I mean that it has grown
but<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.450> said<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.950> just

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
but like I said it just

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.789 
but like I said it just
it<00:02:12.489> feels<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.480> lot<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.900> thinner<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.650> I

okay<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.460> that<00:03:26.910> was<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.120> helling<00:03:27.540> check<00:03:27.840> like

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
okay so that was the helling check like

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.560 
okay so that was the helling check like
I<00:03:28.080> said<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:29.130> back<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.700> looks<00:03:29.850> really<00:03:30.210> thin

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
I said the back of it looks really thin

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.610 
I said the back of it looks really thin
and<00:03:31.110> just<00:03:31.740> I<00:03:32.220> don't<00:03:33.180> know<00:03:33.300> what's<00:03:34.200> going<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.560> I

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
and just I don't know what's going on I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.710 
and just I don't know what's going on I
think<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.160> definitely<00:03:35.280> need<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.060> trim<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
think that I definitely need to trim it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.020 
think that I definitely need to trim it
um<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:39.450> think<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.960> I<00:03:39.990> need<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:41.030> probably

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
um and I think that I need to probably

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.390 
um and I think that I need to probably
not<00:03:42.780> keep<00:03:43.050> it<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.650> for<00:03:43.890> too<00:03:44.100> much

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
not keep it like this for too much

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.340 
not keep it like this for too much
longer<00:03:44.460> I'm<00:03:44.940> definitely<00:03:45.360> I'm<00:03:45.480> not<00:03:45.960> going<00:03:46.260> to

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
longer I'm definitely I'm not going to

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.190 
longer I'm definitely I'm not going to
be<00:03:46.440> straightening<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.070> with<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.490> flat<00:03:47.910> iron

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
that when I this may be a little

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.430 
that when I this may be a little
inappropriate<00:04:14.660> but<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.690> usually<00:04:15.930> get<00:04:16.140> really

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
inappropriate but I usually get really

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.740 
inappropriate but I usually get really
bad<00:04:16.650> cramps<00:04:16.860> when<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:18.120> know<00:04:18.239> it's<00:04:18.420> that<00:04:18.540> time

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
I don't know if it was I guess it was

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.890 
I don't know if it was I guess it was
the<00:04:24.930> vitamin<00:04:25.260> b12<00:04:25.830> or<00:04:26.160> what<00:04:26.760> was<00:04:26.940> in<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.270> but<00:04:27.600> I

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
when I was taking that I noticed that my

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.600 
when I was taking that I noticed that my
cramps<00:04:30.120> were<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:31.230> know<00:04:31.350> less<00:04:31.620> severe<00:04:32.220> than

cramps were you know less severe than

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.180 
cramps were you know less severe than
they<00:04:32.820> usually<00:04:33.060> are<00:04:33.480> because<00:04:33.690> they're<00:04:33.960> usually
