00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.830
 in the last episode we have 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.930
 modeled the items today we 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.930
 let's confide season 2 with the particles 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.920
 on trial but all these signals are at 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.340
 red for the last tutorial of the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.360
 season 2 of minecraft of a cinema 4d 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.250
 so today we will have two cases 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.210
 concrete about the particles hours and 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.260
 particles in minecraft it's some 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.760
 something that is really very important 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 since we are pretty sure all 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.989
 blogs ie we here we will take 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.400
 the case of landers is as well as the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.559
 gate of an error but we have 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.800
 really especially about the torches on the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.940
 crazy on any portal finally 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.200
 short in junior cinema we have 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 tools to make particles 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.780
 especially here all that is loved 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.220
 time so we will see 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 three little things about emitters 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.970
 so first of all we'll have a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.730
 issuer of bazouges is deleted all 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.220
 that then an issuer what is it 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.780
 so it's just an unusual here I 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.350
 creates a transmitter when we are going to do 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.030
 wounds 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.070
 you will see that he will issue 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.350
 particles hitherto an emitter cm of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.280
 particles no problem now seen 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.500
 we are in minecraft we want to see 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.549
 particles that looks like overcoming a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 so to make particles that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.049
 looks like minecraft and nothing more 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.430
 simple one will take a plan here then 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.770
 particles in general they make a 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.210
 maximum of 4 pixels per pixel case 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.240
 greatness so here we are going to put in 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.000
 four sets of four pixels that is 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.340
 four I said you see here we have a 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.440
 flat particle what we will do is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.180
 we're going to pass it a table edit mode and 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.190
 we will cut small bits here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.980
 by that a little bit anyhow 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.440
 see the paf paf that one we go the 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.270
 delete that one why not and that one 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.910
 here it is now I select everything 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.520
 but everything has particles I do mt for 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.430
 the extrusion of 10 cm I put him a 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.110
 cover and we have a faso particle 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.910
 minecraft that's just how 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.650
 to create a particle so we have to 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.820
 obviously it looks exactly like 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.890
 to minecraft since we will not see almost 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.150
 not resold so then we put them a 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.680
 texture so the view that my work 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.220
 on lander piece I put him a texture 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.349
 earlier rape is clear and we will want 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.239
 that our issuer and puts our 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.180
 particles of bad drag the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.170
 particle in the beanbag transmitter and that's 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.670
 not enough since it is necessary 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.349
 check that in the transmitter on and 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.250
 click on show objects here 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.569
 now that i have clicked show 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.280
 the objects when I'm going to put my 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.410
 particles you see that my emitters 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.510
 will put my little particles there so 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.950
 there at the res looks not at all like 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.800
 minecraft particles simply already 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.650
 because in turn 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.910
 so we will change that for Easter more 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.200
 in addition that they are under right in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.110
 the rotation here we will put for example 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.490
 90 never forget to come back to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.050
 early to redo complain because 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.150
 if not that current news say not the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.130
 particles so that's better already but 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.510
 my transmitters liked very much 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.370
 too many particles so here in the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.740
 generation will put it for example to 2 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.460
 so here it is going to emit a lot 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.520
 fewer particles 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.780
 it's already much better and one thing 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.220
 which is very important in general in 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.990
 the minecraft animations is that the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.970
 final size here we will go through 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.800
 example at 0.2 not 00 22 and you go 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.960
 see here zoom in as you go 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.620
 as my particles see get to 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.270
 their end of life 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.620
 they will become smaller and smaller 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.030
 rent that basically they are pretty 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.130
 big and there they will become more 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.570
 smaller then there they are really 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.190
 long arrival small because they have 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.600
 a long life so here in the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.810
 life time we will change it by 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.190
 example to 30 frame here and now 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.330
 we already have something that is a lot 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.650
 better this shot than my particles 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.120
 disappear a little fade 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.620
 like that in two years more and more 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.640
 little what could we change 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.930
 others maybe a little bit 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.650
 speed because do not go fast enough we 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.080
 will put them back 300 cm here my emitters 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.070
 did not like 70 you see 450 fremm he 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.730
 will stop broadcasting so we will 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.720
 put for example at 300 frame that's it and 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.790
 it's much better 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.739
 so now that we have a transmitter at 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.760
 pretty much suitably set so 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.320
 you can play with all these settings 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.180
 who are the soul what we are going to do is 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.950
 that we will want to move 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.440
 particles towards our enders is then 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.920
 for that already we will shift here our 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.160
 transmitter 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.440
 oops to the outside of lander tx is to 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.180
 pretty much for example here and we're going 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.830
 enlarge it we will enlarge it so here we 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.310
 not english emitters we're going to grow up 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.810
 we will put it for example 180 180 that 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.720
 looks good to me it is two pixels more 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.739
 great that the dhj is here and 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.870
 now you see that the problem 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.270
 it's that my particles go through my 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.859
 chest seller but they are not going towards 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.660
 in fact she's going through it all 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.919
 right without really being drawn to 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.630
 jazz as in minecraft 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.400
 so to do that we will use here 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.210
 in the emitters menu we will use 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.980
 an attraction 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.240
 so we put the traction in the center of the 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.100
 scene well at the language center of 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.410
 sorry and now if we do not and 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.540
 we see that our particles are a small 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.440
 little attracted to the green the blood of which I 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.680
 will be moving a little less 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.360
 transmitter for we see it better 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.889
 we have the impression that they are a 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.210
 little bit attracted so if they are not 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.220
 enough shot like that I see they 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.110
 are not enough attracted enough yet 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.520
 wants to increase if the intensity of our 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.410
 bonuses and hours for example at 50 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.759
 and there you see that if I redo play 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.139
 they will be downright attracted to 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.300
 inside of lander piece it's this 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.039
 we want to be here so that's it 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.320
 finish here our under chest it's just going 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.850
 we just need to duplicate this transmitter 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.250
 all around for lander chairs 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.180
 particles that emit who knows 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.310
 put on all sides towards 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.509
 the inside of lander gesture and we will have 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.850
 something drinking 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.169
 we will pass our second concrete case 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.280
 on the particles we will move to 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.449
 desert gate so here it is a 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.509
 little bit more complicated because you 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.970
 see that I disable and that you see 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.259
 that if I leave that way they go 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.820
 to be attracted to the interior of the portal 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.470
 they will do anything 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.940
 simply because once they 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.020
 are in the center and basel are going to turn 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.310
 around the pull and after them 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.630
 will be expelled to the outside of which 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.740
 it's because we want we want 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.599
 that once she arrives at the central 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.949
 disappear in the portal so for 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.810
 do that we will use a new object 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.009
 it's the destruction object so all of you 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.300
 and you can find it here at the same 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.180
 place in the transmitter you have 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.349
 the destruction object right there then 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.060
 the object of instructions what is it 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.530
 will do it already we will give him 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.789
 a size so there you see it's 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.520
 the little voice of young people I gave 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.870
 the whole stack size of the portal of a 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.760
 heather I would even go back one 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.199
 little bit and so all the particles 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.479
 that will happen inside the 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.669
 box of destruction are going to be 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.229
 destroyed what makes that so now 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.139
 I'm coming back and I'm doing 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.000
 full memé particles are always going to be 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.680
 attracted to the center because me 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.199
 I have an attraction here in the center of my 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.430
 gate of an error but they will be 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.080
 destroyed when they will arrive in 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.520
 the little yellow box that's right there 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.750
 you see up the particle arrives paf 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.280
 she is destroyed when she arrives on 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.430
 the portal simply to avoid 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.810
 she leaves a little bit anywhere 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.580
 so that's not much else to 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.530
 tell about the particles you can 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.080
 also play with so the traction on 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.159
 saw the destruction did not see the deviation 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.870
 it's something that will allow you to 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.520
 to bounce the particles is 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.919
 interesting if you do an animation 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.780
 bull kraft or mac not like you're 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.610
 quito feed the beast if you make 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.659
 pipes and you have items that 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.770
 circulate in the pipes you can the 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.870
 do with deviations and 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.039
 emitters gravity is something 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.530
 which will allow to bring down the 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.000
 particles the rest friction rotation 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.169
 turbulence ventilation is it 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.630
 thing that allow you to manage a little 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.120
 more more 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.950
 do already make some particles a little 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.240
 more forgiveness but we will not go 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.760
 serve in minecraft animations in 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.550
 general and so that's what I had to 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.380
 tell about particles and it was this 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.380
 little relatively short tutorial is 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.510
 relatively informative which concludes and 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.190
 the season 2 of minecraft in cinema 4d 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.900
 and season 3 so I have it from 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.670
 now will be devoted to animation 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.720
 because it's all well and good to do 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.980
 modeling but now we're going 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.170
 move on to animation 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.580
 here it is it was so enders for the 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.830
 end of season 2 of minecraft in 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.120
 cinema 4d we'll be back soon for the 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.120
 season 3 went to greet
