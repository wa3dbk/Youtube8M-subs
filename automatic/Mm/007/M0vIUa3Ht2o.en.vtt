00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
has your take a look at this model this

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.800 
has your take a look at this model this
is<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.829> complete<00:00:02.250> model<00:00:02.429> with<00:00:02.820> both<00:00:03.149> lungs<00:00:03.540> and

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
is a complete model with both lungs and

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.570 
is a complete model with both lungs and
heart<00:00:04.140> but<00:00:04.770> we<00:00:04.890> start<00:00:05.130> off<00:00:05.220> here<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
heart but we start off here with the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.309 
heart but we start off here with the
larynx<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.210> as<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.540> take<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.720> look<00:00:06.930> at<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.140> air

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
larynx and as we take a look at the air

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.020 
larynx and as we take a look at the air
coming<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.859> from<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.069> larynx<00:00:08.550> well<00:00:08.760> again

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
coming in from the larynx well again

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.610 
coming in from the larynx well again
notice<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.570> different<00:00:09.870> cartilages<00:00:10.410> here

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
notice the different cartilages here

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.980 
notice the different cartilages here
here<00:00:11.130> rasili<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> thyroid<00:00:12.179> cartilage<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
here rasili the thyroid cartilage the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.020 
here rasili the thyroid cartilage the
cricoid<00:00:13.620> cartilage<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.490> then<00:00:14.759> on<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
cricoid cartilage and then on the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.090 
cricoid cartilage and then on the
posterior<00:00:15.420> side<00:00:15.870> if<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.230> kind<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.529> lifted<00:00:16.920> this

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
posterior side if we kind of lifted this

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.450 
posterior side if we kind of lifted this
off<00:00:17.400> we'll<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.180> able<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.420> see<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
off we'll be able to see the just a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.769 
off we'll be able to see the just a
little<00:00:20.699> bit<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.939> hint<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> arch<00:00:21.510> annoyed

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
little bit of hint of the arch annoyed

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.340 
little bit of hint of the arch annoyed
and<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> tips<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.820> way<00:00:23.820> at<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.990> tips

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and then the tips here way at the tips

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.859 
and then the tips here way at the tips
of<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.849> arch<00:00:27.000> annoyed<00:00:27.330> being<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> core

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
of the arch annoyed being the core

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.660 
of the arch annoyed being the core
niculae<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:28.920> tiny<00:00:29.130> little<00:00:29.400> dot

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
niculae just a little tiny little dot

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.130 
niculae just a little tiny little dot
there<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.150> arch<00:00:30.480> annoyed<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.810> covered<00:00:31.080> over

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
there the arch annoyed is covered over

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.630 
there the arch annoyed is covered over
by<00:00:31.230> muscles<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.800> will<00:00:31.890> help<00:00:32.040> control<00:00:32.219> our

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
by muscles that will help control our

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.850 
by muscles that will help control our
vocal<00:00:33.210> production<00:00:33.480> you'll<00:00:34.260> see<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
vocal production you'll see that in the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920 
vocal production you'll see that in the
top<00:00:35.100> flap<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.730> being<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> epiglottis<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
top flap here being the epiglottis and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.900 
top flap here being the epiglottis and
then<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.440> course<00:00:37.469> leading<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.579> larynx

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
then of course leading all the larynx

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.569 
then of course leading all the larynx
going<00:00:39.239> into<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.410> call<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> trachea<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
going into what we call the trachea and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
going into what we call the trachea and
so<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> trachea<00:00:42.960> we'll<00:00:43.860> find<00:00:44.100> them<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
so with the trachea we'll find them the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.459 
so with the trachea we'll find them the
trachea<00:00:44.730> leading<00:00:45.539> into<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> lungs<00:00:46.170> what

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
trachea leading into the lungs what

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
trachea leading into the lungs what
we'll<00:00:46.620> find<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.250> two<00:00:47.610> lungs<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.120> right

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we'll find is we have two lungs a right

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.170 
we'll find is we have two lungs a right
in<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> left<00:00:49.170> lung<00:00:49.730> currently<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.969> type

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
in the left lung currently in this type

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.510 
in the left lung currently in this type
of<00:00:51.210> view<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:52.280> many<00:00:53.280> different

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
of view we can see many different

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.100 
of view we can see many different
structures<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> first<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.870> just

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
structures the first of which is just

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
structures the first of which is just
the<00:00:55.320> overall<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> structures<00:00:56.760> we'll

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the overall kind of structures we'll

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
the overall kind of structures we'll
find<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> base<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> lungs<00:00:58.710> will<00:00:59.399> find<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
find the base of the lungs will find the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
find the base of the lungs will find the
tips<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> lungs<00:01:00.390> being<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> tops<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tips of the lungs being or the tops of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.260 
tips of the lungs being or the tops of
the<00:01:01.829> lungs<00:01:01.859> being<00:01:02.280> called<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> apex<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the lungs being called the apex of the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
the lungs being called the apex of the
lungs<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.229> different<00:01:04.530> lobes

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
lungs and then we have different lobes

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.090 
lungs and then we have different lobes
both<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.119> left<00:01:06.390> lung<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.100> superior

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
both right and left lung have a superior

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
both right and left lung have a superior
lobe<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.760> these<00:01:08.880> are<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.299> left<00:01:09.510> superior<00:01:09.900> lobe

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
lobe so these are the left superior lobe

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.170 
lobe so these are the left superior lobe
right<00:01:10.260> superior<00:01:10.650> lobe<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.040> inferior<00:01:12.030> lobe

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
right superior lobe and inferior lobe

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
right superior lobe and inferior lobe
this<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> left<00:01:13.110> inferior<00:01:13.350> lobe<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:14.010> down

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this is the left inferior lobe here down

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.700 
this is the left inferior lobe here down
here<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.820> right<00:01:15.270> inferior<00:01:15.869> lobe<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
here is the right inferior lobe the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
here is the right inferior lobe the
right<00:01:16.920> lobe<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:17.880> lung<00:01:18.090> actually<00:01:18.570> has

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
right lobe the right lung actually has

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
right lobe the right lung actually has
an<00:01:18.869> additional<00:01:19.290> lobe<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.830> call<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
an additional lobe what we call the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.749 
an additional lobe what we call the
middle<00:01:21.030> lobe<00:01:21.650> denoted<00:01:22.650> by<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.950> kind<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
middle lobe denoted by this kind of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
middle lobe denoted by this kind of
fissures<00:01:24.119> both<00:01:24.479> lungs<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.200> oblique

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
fissures both lungs have oblique

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.830 
fissures both lungs have oblique
fissures<00:01:26.250> cutting<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> separated<00:01:27.780> out

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
fissures cutting and separated out

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.330 
fissures cutting and separated out
between<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> inferior<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.829> superior<00:01:28.979> lobe

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
between the inferior and superior lobe

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.060 
between the inferior and superior lobe
but<00:01:29.939> then<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> middle<00:01:30.630> lobe<00:01:30.869> gets<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.500> extra

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
but then the middle lobe gets this extra

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.120 
but then the middle lobe gets this extra
or<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> right<00:01:32.640> lung<00:01:32.850> gets<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:34.130> horizontal

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
or the right lung gets this horizontal

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.819 
or the right lung gets this horizontal
fissure<00:01:35.340> helping<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> denote<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.110> middle

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
fissure helping to denote the middle

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
fissure helping to denote the middle
lobe<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.119> these<00:01:39.270> different

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
lobe so we have all these different

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.630 
lobe so we have all these different
lobes<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> continue<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.280> pull<00:01:41.490> on

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
lobes if we kind of continue to pull on

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920 
lobes if we kind of continue to pull on
the<00:01:41.790> side<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.240> could<00:01:42.329> actually<00:01:42.420> see<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the side we could actually see the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
the side we could actually see the
continuation<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.860> these<00:01:44.009> kind<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.369> fissures

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
continuation of these kind of fissures

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.749 
continuation of these kind of fissures
here<00:01:45.200> notice<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> left<00:01:46.710> lung<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.549> left

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
here notice on the left lung if the left

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.600 
here notice on the left lung if the left
lung<00:01:47.909> doesn't<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> third<00:01:49.079> lobe<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.040> has

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
lung doesn't have a third lobe it has

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
lung doesn't have a third lobe it has
Adan<00:01:51.210> cut<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> heart<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.470> I

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
Adan cut out for the heart because I

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.929 
Adan cut out for the heart because I
always<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:53.040> since<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> heart<00:01:53.610> bends<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
always think since the heart bends to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
always think since the heart bends to
the<00:01:54.030> left<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.390> has<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.689> less<00:01:54.869> lobe<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.560> that's

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the left it has one less lobe so that's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.899 
the left it has one less lobe so that's
why<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.920> get<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.130> little<00:01:56.280> cardiac<00:01:56.729> notch

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
why we get this little cardiac notch

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.789 
why we get this little cardiac notch
here<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.930> would<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> cardiac<00:01:58.680> notch

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
here and that would be the cardiac notch

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.340 
here and that would be the cardiac notch
in<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.520> lung<00:01:59.759> itself<00:02:00.149> as<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.930> explore<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
in the lung itself as we explore a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.410 
in the lung itself as we explore a
deeper<00:02:01.799> will<00:02:02.040> find<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.579> trachea<00:02:03.090> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
deeper will find that the trachea is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810 
deeper will find that the trachea is
still<00:02:03.930> exposed<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:04.979> split<00:02:05.250> into<00:02:05.399> two

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
still exposed here and is split into two

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.520 
still exposed here and is split into two
primary<00:02:06.360> bronchi<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.869> here's<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> primary

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530

the right here's one two and then if I
were<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.210> cover<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.630> little<00:02:18.930> line<00:02:19.170> up

were to cover this little line up

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.370 
were to cover this little line up
there's<00:02:19.680> three<00:02:20.190> altogether

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
there's three altogether

there's three altogether
clearly<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.980> church<00:02:23.910> secondary<00:02:24.450> bronchi

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
clearly this church secondary bronchi

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.750 
clearly this church secondary bronchi
splits<00:02:25.110> into<00:02:25.320> tertiary<00:02:25.590> bronchi<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.490> then<00:02:26.640> we

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
splits into tertiary bronchi and then we

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.520 
splits into tertiary bronchi and then we
get<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.090> left<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.990> right

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
get the left the right

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.010 
get the left the right
tertiary<00:02:29.100> bronchus<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.030> model<00:02:30.510> of

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
tertiary bronchus in this model of

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.810 
tertiary bronchus in this model of
course<00:02:31.320> bronchioles<00:02:31.890> continue<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.610> extend

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
course bronchioles continue to extend

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.430 
course bronchioles continue to extend
into<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> lungs<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.870> all<00:02:34.080> these<00:02:34.230> would<00:02:34.410> be

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
into the lungs so all these would be

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.140 
into the lungs so all these would be
considered<00:02:34.590> bronchioles<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:35.910> what<00:02:36.030> we

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
considered bronchioles and then what we

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.120 
considered bronchioles and then what we
find<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.510> some<00:02:36.690> veins<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.530> see<00:02:37.770> this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
find is some veins that we can see this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.160 
find is some veins that we can see this
red<00:02:38.490> one<00:02:38.700> here<00:02:38.940> forces<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> pulmonary<00:02:39.900> vein

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
red one here forces the pulmonary vein

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.170 
red one here forces the pulmonary vein
and<00:02:40.440> then<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.770> blue<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.670> pulmonary

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and then the blue is the pulmonary

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.750 
and then the blue is the pulmonary
artery<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:43.410> then<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.770> see<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.070> aortic

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
artery and then we can see the aortic

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.930 
artery and then we can see the aortic
arch<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:46.020> thoracic<00:02:46.740> aorta<00:02:47.040> with<00:02:47.760> the
