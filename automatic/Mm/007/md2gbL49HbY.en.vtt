00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.180
 hello god i am doctor christoph 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.300
 metzler established children's and 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.919
 I welcome you here in 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:29.210
 I would like my practice in this video 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:33.020
 but talk about the subject of nutrition 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.059
 not in shape as you would in books 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.540
 and read in the many counselors 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.239
 can 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:46.060
 no, but as I have mine 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:49.760
 Office hours experience out first, 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.220
 there are and in germany 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.130
 of course in my practice more 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.880
 Problems with overweight children as 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.010
 with underweight that has to do with it 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.939
 do that with us in germany 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:09.280
 just eat more than enough to buy 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:13.130
 and so that ours 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.329
 We have changed living conditions 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.569
 Everyone just moves us a lot less 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.569
 as previously 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:26.749
 I see underweight children in the 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.639
 Talk less often and then 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:33.109
 is there an underlying one for this 

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:35.990
 For example, a cause of illness 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.939
 problem of the digestive organs or a 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.840
 problem of psyche as with the 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.600
 Anorexia secondly, the kind of 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.779
 Nourishment itself is when you 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.529
 reasonably varied and not 

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:53.979
 too one-sided is usually not the 

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:56.709
 reason for problems 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.649
 Exceptions are food 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:03.130
 incompatibilities such as lactose 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:07.579
 fructose and gluten intolerance 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.490
 to call the most common it is for 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.010
 some parents are very amazing when I am 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.470
 at preventive examinations 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.069
 find that your children are completely normal 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.920
 big and quite normal are heavy 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.519
 although in the eyes of the parents a lot 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.340
 too little and if at all only one 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:33.549
 vegetables and almost no fruit 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.810
 third, healthy children of normal 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.609
 Parents eat what they want 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.670
 need 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.640
 because eat a normal 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.150
 the basic need of us humans is that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.540
 The biggest problem is often that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.099
 meals in a completely unnecessary 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.889
 degenerate stress for everyone if of the 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.800
 Parents are prescribed how much 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:06.250
 to be eaten 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.740
 Unfortunately, this leads to the opposite of the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.900
 so I want it 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.780
 basically advise against 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.780
 to force a child to eat 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.300
 also it does not make sense to the child 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.720
 always only to cook what it has 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.570
 it would always be that way 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.630
 want to have a favorite dish and so 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.790
 the principle of diversification would not be 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:41.490
 Satisfied hunger is the best cook 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:44.050
 This saying is as old as he is 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.070
 in my speech I notice 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.590
 that diet-related problems up on 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.070
 the above exceptions clearly 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.160
 less common than the concerned ones 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.320
 accept parents 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.310
 I would like to simplify everything in 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.640
 to summarize a sentence 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.230
 a child who is normally physically 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.720
 has developed and is healthy 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.340
 most likely no problem with 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.060
 the nutrition no matter what and how much 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.060
 it is 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.730
 I wish that with this 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.840
 video can contribute to unnecessary 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:35.340
 fears of parents and unnecessary drama 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.990
 to prevent at table 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.500
 However, this video can of course 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.440
 no substitute for an individual 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.890
 consultation and or one 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.110
 investigation 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:54.210
 I thank you for listening and wish you 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.210
 and your family all the best
