Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.920
This is Joao from Kenhub and welcome to another
anatomy tutorial where this time we’re going

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.350
to be talking about the muscles of your hands,
specifically about the muscles or the intrinsic

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.120
muscles of the hand as you can see here on
this image.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.880
So as you notice here on this image, we just
strip all the skin, fat, and a lot of other

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.910
tissues to just leave the bones and muscles
and a lot of the ligaments that you can see.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.180
And notice that we’re looking from a palmar
view of the hand.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.710
On this tutorial, we’re going to be describing
all of these muscles including their attachment

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.059
points, innervation, and functions.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.010
First point I would like to mention is that
the intrinsic muscles of the hand, they can

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.100
be divided into five groups specifically – the
dorsal interossei, the palmar interossei,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.030
the lumbricals, the hypothenar, and the thenar
muscles.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.330
Keep in mind that the first three…

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.940
