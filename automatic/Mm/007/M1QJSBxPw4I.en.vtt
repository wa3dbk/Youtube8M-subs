00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
how to do this centered double decrease

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.630 
how to do this centered double decrease
which<00:00:22.660> is<00:00:22.840> very<00:00:23.320> popular<00:00:23.860> in<00:00:24.130> lace<00:00:24.850> knitting

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
which is very popular in lace knitting

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.370 
which is very popular in lace knitting
so<00:00:27.640> we're<00:00:27.820> going<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.180> knit<00:00:28.390> to<00:00:28.960> where<00:00:29.140> we're

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
so we're going to knit to where we're

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.549 
so we're going to knit to where we're
going<00:00:29.410> to<00:00:29.860> start<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.250> decrease<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.810> this<00:00:32.410> is

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
going to start the decrease now this is

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.939 
going to start the decrease now this is
the<00:00:32.710> slip<00:00:33.010> part<00:00:33.340> you<00:00:33.760> slip<00:00:34.410> purl<00:00:35.410> wise<00:00:35.620> with

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
the slip part you slip purl wise with

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.100 
the slip part you slip purl wise with
yarn<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.309> back<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:37.360> you<00:00:37.449> just<00:00:37.600> always<00:00:37.720> leave

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
yarn in back so you just always leave

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.540 
yarn in back so you just always leave
the<00:00:38.260> yarn<00:00:38.470> in<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.620> back<00:00:38.860> on<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.190> knit<00:00:39.340> side

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
the yarn in the back on the knit side

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.470 
the yarn in the back on the knit side
you're<00:00:40.300> going<00:00:40.390> to<00:00:40.449> knit<00:00:40.750> two<00:00:40.780> together<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
you're going to knit two together and

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.899 
you're going to knit two together and
then<00:00:43.690> you're<00:00:43.840> going<00:00:44.020> to<00:00:44.110> reach<00:00:44.320> back<00:00:44.909> grab

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
then you're going to reach back grab

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.509 
then you're going to reach back grab
that<00:00:46.210> slip<00:00:46.600> stitch<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:49.140> pass<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.500> over<00:00:50.710> the

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
that slip stitch and pass it over the

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.509 
that slip stitch and pass it over the
knit<00:00:51.820> two<00:00:52.059> together<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.559> now<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:53.860> can<00:00:54.250> see

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
knit two together so now you can see

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.070 
knit two together so now you can see
this<00:00:54.729> is<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:54.970> we've<00:00:55.360> decreased<00:00:55.809> two

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
this is that we've decreased two

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
this is that we've decreased two
stitches<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:59.140> reason<00:00:59.470> it's<00:00:59.589> centered<00:00:59.949> is

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
stitches and the reason it's centered is

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.680 
stitches and the reason it's centered is
the<00:01:00.280> knit<00:01:00.460> two<00:01:00.580> together<00:01:00.699> goes<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.479> right

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
the knit two together goes to the right

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.560 
the knit two together goes to the right
the<00:01:02.199> slip<00:01:02.500> stitch<00:01:02.799> goes<00:01:03.339> to<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:03.640> left<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.269> it

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
the slip stitch goes to the left and it

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.110 
the slip stitch goes to the left and it
centers<00:01:05.260> it<00:01:05.560> centers<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.430> decrease<00:01:06.850> right

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
centers it centers that decrease right

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.910 
centers it centers that decrease right
over<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.479> single<00:01:08.020> stitch<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:11.530> want<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.799> see

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
over that single stitch you want to see

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.230 
over that single stitch you want to see
it<00:01:12.010> again<00:01:12.100> let's<00:01:12.580> do<00:01:12.760> it<00:01:12.880> again

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
it again let's do it again

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.660 
it again let's do it again
so<00:01:14.020> we'll<00:01:14.380> knit<00:01:14.590> two<00:01:14.799> where<00:01:14.979> we<00:01:15.100> want<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.430> do

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
so we'll knit two where we want to do

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.330 
so we'll knit two where we want to do
the<00:01:16.119> double<00:01:16.450> decrease<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.830> we're<00:01:21.100> going<00:01:21.250> to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
the double decrease now we're going to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.710 
the double decrease now we're going to
slip<00:01:21.940> purl<00:01:22.930> wise<00:01:23.170> with<00:01:23.470> yarn<00:01:23.770> in<00:01:24.010> back<00:01:24.720> knit

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
slip purl wise with yarn in back knit

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.480 
slip purl wise with yarn in back knit
two<00:01:25.960> together<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:29.290> grab<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.980> slip<00:01:30.220> stitch

and<00:01:30.820> pull<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:31.900> over<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.490> yarn<00:01:33.700> stays<00:01:34.060> in

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
and pull it over so the yarn stays in

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.030 
and pull it over so the yarn stays in
back<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.660> entire<00:01:34.930> time<00:01:35.260> so<00:01:36.660> close<00:01:37.660> up<00:01:38.040> one

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040

back the entire time so close up one
more<00:01:39.340> try<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.310> knit<00:01:45.520> two<00:01:45.730> where<00:01:45.880> we<00:01:45.910> want<00:01:46.210> to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
more try so we knit two where we want to

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.340 
more try so we knit two where we want to
decrease<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.810> stitches<00:01:49.140> we're<00:01:50.140> going<00:01:50.290> to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
decrease the stitches we're going to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.190 
decrease the stitches we're going to
slip<00:01:50.710> purl<00:01:51.340> wise<00:01:51.640> yarn<00:01:52.390> in<00:01:52.540> back<00:01:54.750> knit<00:01:55.750> two

slip purl wise yarn in back knit two

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.160 
slip purl wise yarn in back knit two
stitches<00:01:56.920> together<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:04.659> go<00:02:04.930> back<00:02:05.140> and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170

right over the top as if you were
binding<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.530> off<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.640> here's<00:02:15.849> an<00:02:16.000> example<00:02:16.360> of

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
binding it off so here's an example of

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.360 
binding it off so here's an example of
where<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.989> would<00:02:17.110> use<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.530> Center<00:02:17.830> decrease

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
where you would use that Center decrease

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.259 
where you would use that Center decrease
it's<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.940> between<00:02:19.300> two<00:02:19.780> yarn<00:02:20.140> over<00:02:20.319> holes<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
it's in between two yarn over holes and

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.050 
it's in between two yarn over holes and
it<00:02:22.269> creates<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:22.780> nice<00:02:23.170> even<00:02:23.739> Ridge<00:02:24.340> that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
it creates that nice even Ridge that

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.520 
it creates that nice even Ridge that
isn't<00:02:25.389> going<00:02:25.689> to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
