it just to meet makes us more efficient
as<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.420> photographers<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.290> can

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
as you know photographers because we can

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.070 
as you know photographers because we can
do<00:01:07.560> things<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:09.540> allows<00:01:09.750> us<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
do things like this and it allows us to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
do things like this and it allows us to
do<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.439> things<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:11.970> certain

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
do more things but there is that certain

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.810 
do more things but there is that certain
aspect<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.130> having<00:01:14.430> something

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
aspect of you know having something

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.679 
aspect of you know having something
tangible<00:01:15.360> having<00:01:16.049> something<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:17.100> hold<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
tangible having something to hold that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120 
tangible having something to hold that
was<00:01:18.840> missing<00:01:19.229> from<00:01:19.259> darell<00:01:19.650> technology

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
was missing from darell technology

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.890 
was missing from darell technology
because<00:01:20.430> after<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:21.150> digital

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
because after you know digital

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.640 
because after you know digital
technology<00:01:22.470> um<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.180> bloomed

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
technology um you know bloomed

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.020 
technology um you know bloomed
everything<00:01:25.650> was<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> internet<00:01:26.430> or

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
everything was just on the internet or

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.600 
everything was just on the internet or
on<00:01:27.090> our<00:01:27.330> computers<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.950> pictures<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
on our computers just pictures on the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.990 
on our computers just pictures on the
screen<00:01:29.729> they're<00:01:30.360> basically<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.490> code<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
screen they're basically just code that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.719 
screen they're basically just code that
lives<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.930> world<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.460> can't

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
lives in a world that you know we can't

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.429 
lives in a world that you know we can't
go<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:35.970> they're<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.780> stuck<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> virtual

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
go to they're just stuck in the virtual

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.100 
go to they're just stuck in the virtual
world<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> solve

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
world and that's it but one way to solve

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.770 
world and that's it but one way to solve
that<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.619> through<00:01:40.920> doing<00:01:41.189> prints<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.180> only

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that is through doing prints now I only

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
that is through doing prints now I only
started<00:01:43.020> doing<00:01:43.290> print<00:01:43.500> recently<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.100> to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
zeros that live in a world that you know

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.240 
zeros that live in a world that you know
we<00:03:17.910> can't<00:03:18.240> go<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:19.260> can't<00:03:19.500> interact<00:03:19.830> with

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
we can't go to we can't interact with

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.450 
we can't go to we can't interact with
besides<00:03:20.970> on<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.600> computer<00:03:22.050> screen<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.650> that's

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
besides on the computer screen so that's

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.330 
besides on the computer screen so that's
really<00:03:23.610> mainly<00:03:23.970> why<00:03:24.210> I<00:03:24.270> print<00:03:24.660> my<00:03:24.750> photos

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
really mainly why I print my photos

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.950 
really mainly why I print my photos
here's<00:03:26.340> another<00:03:26.580> one<00:03:26.880> they're<00:03:27.570> just<00:03:27.600> eight

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
here's another one they're just eight

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.130 
here's another one they're just eight
prints<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.970> think<00:03:30.210> you<00:03:30.510> know<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.630> really

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
prints and I think you know I really

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.400 
prints and I think you know I really
like<00:03:31.290> how<00:03:31.500> they<00:03:31.650> turned<00:03:31.890> out<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.930> yeah<00:03:34.110> that's

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
like how they turned out so yeah that's

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.620 
like how they turned out so yeah that's
why<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.680> print<00:03:35.040> my<00:03:35.130> photos<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.730> that's<00:03:36.420> why<00:03:36.600> I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
why I print my photos and that's why I

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.090 
why I print my photos and that's why I
think<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.200> should<00:03:37.350> at<00:03:37.710> least<00:03:37.860> consider

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
think you should at least consider

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.270 
think you should at least consider
