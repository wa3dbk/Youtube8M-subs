hi<00:00:01.230> I'm<00:00:01.709> algae<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.790> I'm<00:00:03.000> an<00:00:03.179> audit<00:00:03.570> row<00:00:03.750> and

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
hi I'm algae and I'm an audit row and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.750 
hi I'm algae and I'm an audit row and
I'm<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.279> Batman<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:06.089> I'm<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.589> heterotroph<00:00:07.760> an

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
I'm the Batman and I'm a heterotroph an

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.820 
I'm the Batman and I'm a heterotroph an
artichoke<00:00:09.170> would<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.200> mean<00:00:10.500> you're<00:00:10.740> an

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
artichoke would it mean you're an

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.740 
artichoke would it mean you're an
artichoke<00:00:11.870> no<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.380> an<00:00:13.620> artichoke<00:00:14.040> an

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
artichoke no not an artichoke an

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.150 
artichoke no not an artichoke an
autotroph<00:00:15.750> oh<00:00:16.310> well<00:00:17.310> what's<00:00:18.000> an<00:00:18.180> autotroph

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
autotroph oh well what's an autotroph

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.540 
autotroph oh well what's an autotroph
ask<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.670> voices<00:00:22.699> an<00:00:25.010> autotroph<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.220> an

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
ask the voices an autotroph is an

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.849 
ask the voices an autotroph is an
organism<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.630> capture<00:00:27.900> energy<00:00:28.260> from

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
organism that can capture energy from

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.460 
organism that can capture energy from
sunlight<00:00:29.279> or<00:00:29.730> chemicals<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.689> use<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
sunlight or chemicals and use it to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.680 
sunlight or chemicals and use it to
produce<00:00:31.830> its<00:00:32.189> own<00:00:32.250> food<00:00:32.759> from<00:00:33.360> inorganic

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
produce its own food from inorganic

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
produce its own food from inorganic
compounds<00:00:34.620> also<00:00:34.770> called<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> producer<00:00:37.250> okay

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
compounds also called the producer okay

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.860 
compounds also called the producer okay
but<00:00:39.950> what<00:00:40.950> does<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.760> mean<00:00:42.030> simply<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> Sun

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
but what does it mean simply the Sun

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.270 
but what does it mean simply the Sun
drops<00:00:46.770> energy<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.670> its<00:00:47.850> sunlight<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.280> algae

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
drops energy in its sunlight and algae

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.330 
drops energy in its sunlight and algae
captures<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.320> then<00:00:52.320> speaking<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
captures it then speaking you that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.979 
captures it then speaking you that
energy<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.910> make<00:00:54.239> food<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:57.530> makes<00:00:58.530> sense<00:00:58.859> now

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
energy to make food that makes sense now

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
energy to make food that makes sense now
well<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:01.949> autotroph<00:01:02.550> is

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
well now you know what an autotroph is

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.609 
well now you know what an autotroph is
but<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> still<00:01:03.840> don't<00:01:03.989> know<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> hairy

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
but I still don't know what a hairy

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.969 
but I still don't know what a hairy
chosen<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:08.840> heterotroph<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.080> an<00:01:10.260> organism<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
chosen a heterotroph is an organism that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.160 
chosen a heterotroph is an organism that
obtains<00:01:11.790> energy<00:01:12.360> from<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.840> food<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
obtains energy from this food and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.359 
obtains energy from this food and
consumed<00:01:13.590> also<00:01:14.430> called<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.939> consumer<00:01:16.369> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
consumed also called a consumer so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.090 
consumed also called a consumer so
heterotrophs<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.780> consumers<00:01:19.439> eat<00:01:19.890> their

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
heterotrophs or consumers eat their

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.030 
heterotrophs or consumers eat their
energy<00:01:20.490> yes<00:01:21.710> show<00:01:22.710> me<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> Sun<00:01:25.680> provides

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
energy yes show me the Sun provides

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429 
energy yes show me the Sun provides
energy<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:26.850> algae<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
energy for algae and when the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.249 
energy for algae and when the
caterpillar<00:01:28.680> eats<00:01:29.100> algae<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.479> energy<00:01:30.990> is

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
caterpillar eats algae the energy is

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.929 
caterpillar eats algae the energy is
that<00:01:33.290> furthermore<00:01:34.290> when<00:01:34.950> Batman<00:01:35.460> eats<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that furthermore when Batman eats the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.889 
that furthermore when Batman eats the
caterpillar<00:01:36.150> more<00:01:37.020> energy<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.590> passed<00:01:41.899> that's

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
caterpillar more energy is passed that's

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
caterpillar more energy is passed that's
rude<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:45.149> there<00:01:45.689> another<00:01:46.170> way<00:01:48.500> well<00:01:49.850> monsey

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
rude is there another way well monsey

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.880 
rude is there another way well monsey
the<00:01:51.000> mushroom<00:01:51.509> gets<00:01:51.840> her<00:01:52.049> energy<00:01:52.290> by

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the mushroom gets her energy by

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.160 
the mushroom gets her energy by
decomposing<00:01:53.250> other<00:01:53.909> organisms<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.930> this

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
decomposing other organisms like this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.390 
decomposing other organisms like this
duck

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.890 

that's<00:02:01.400> more<00:02:01.760> like<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.890> yes<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.430> what<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.570> this

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
that's more like it yes but what is this

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.820 
that's more like it yes but what is this
talk<00:02:06.320> about<00:02:07.310> energy
