00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
turn right here how much angle can get

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.749

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
just because how big it is maybe on a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.660 
just because how big it is maybe on a
long<00:02:06.360> scale<00:02:07.200> track<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.979> could<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.190> good<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.610> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
long scale track it could be good but I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.340 
long scale track it could be good but I
do

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
do

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.230 
do

recommend this on fuji me just because

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.090 
recommend this on fuji me just because
this<00:02:11.780> thing<00:02:11.960> is<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.110> freaking<00:02:12.470> tank<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:12.980> you're

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
this thing is a freaking tank and you're

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.470 
this thing is a freaking tank and you're
going<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.370> hitting<00:02:13.550> unless<00:02:14.090> if<00:02:14.300> you're

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
going to be hitting unless if you're

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.620 
going to be hitting unless if you're
really<00:02:15.080> really<00:02:15.260> good<00:02:15.650> at<00:02:16.640> controlling<00:02:16.910> cars

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
really really good at controlling cars

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.690 
really really good at controlling cars
and<00:02:17.960> crap<00:02:18.140> especially<00:02:18.590> big<00:02:18.830> ones<00:02:18.860> take<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.580> on

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
and crap especially big ones take it on

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.360 
and crap especially big ones take it on
there<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.150> still<00:02:20.570> you'd<00:02:21.440> be<00:02:21.560> better<00:02:21.770> off<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.280> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
there but still you'd be better off in a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.070 
there but still you'd be better off in a
smaller<00:02:22.730> car<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.480> smaller<00:02:23.780> tracks

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
smaller car on the smaller tracks

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.540 
smaller car on the smaller tracks
because<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.770> actually<00:02:24.950> get<00:02:25.160> some<00:02:25.400> more

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
because you can actually get some more

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.980 
because you can actually get some more
angle<00:02:25.880> you're<00:02:26.240> not<00:02:26.360> going<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.600> be<00:02:26.660> as<00:02:26.750> cautious

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
angle you're not going to be as cautious

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.290 
angle you're not going to be as cautious
you<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.590> actually<00:02:27.740> take<00:02:28.580> risks<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.270> know

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
you can actually take risks you know

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.930 
you can actually take risks you know
