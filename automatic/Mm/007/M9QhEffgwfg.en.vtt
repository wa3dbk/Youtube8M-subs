00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:10.849
 It is the next 20 years ago I won a race in the 24-hour endurance race 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:14.929
 Mazda 787 b is a moment when the rotary engine has won the world 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:18.460
 We went public in Hiroshima for the first time last Sunday 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.460
 It is the coverage of the unhappy photographer 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.910
 Unique coloring to green to orange 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:33.440
 Mazda 787 b with the number 55 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.780
 At the motor festival that the Hiroshima City Traffic Science Museum covers 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.750
 Kuroshima's first public driving 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.500
 The theme of this year's event is Sueza 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.570
 Successive Mazda cars gathered at the venue 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.740
 Is that I want to see is that the running after all actually went to see'm a 78 today 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.630
 It was possible 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:58.630
 Most of the attention was gathered to 10 o'clock even First 787 b 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:05.199
 This car is 1991 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.690
 Won the world's largest race 24 hours endurance race equipped with a rotary engine 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.900
 Was 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.250
 It seems to be the first Japanese maker to be good 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.600
 It is a moment when Mazda's rotary engine technology stands at the top of the world 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.240
 Good morning 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.369
 Shitsumo N 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.180
 At the event, I acted as a driver in all races where Matsuda challenged Le Mans 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:33.590
 Mr. Yojiro Terada also rushed 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.590
 Why did this car 20 years ago come to the limelight again 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.470
 If the subject of April woman this year 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:46.150
 In commemoration of the 20th anniversary to win Masuda 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:50.740
 The letter came to invite the Mazda 787 b to this year's race 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:56.820
 Mazda receives this invitation and repairs the 787 b 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:02:01.130
 The test synthesis has been restored to almost the same state as 20 years ago. 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.240
 In public driving that took place before the June Mans race 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.750
 While a crowd of 200,000 looks at it 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.460
 Driver who received a checkered flag when winning in 1991 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.870
 Johnny Harvard grabbed the handle 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.590
 Mr. Terada is accompanied to Le Mans and talks about the situation at that time 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.780
 Actually, that Johnny is also a big fan 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:28.319
 Since everyone is 20 years old, each is also a middle-aged man 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:33.959
 Racing suit has become a little more crackling , but 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:38.430
 I was really happy because I just enjoyed running in my subordinates 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.580
 Mr. Harvard collapsed with dehydration after 20 years ago 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.870
 To stand on the podium 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:49.670
 I finally wish has come true at but could not over 20 years 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:54.769
 The Fit had said cramp I was flowing in the award finally in 20 years 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:03:01.580
 Takara Dora I is probably still too early pets Zu' is willing 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:04.790
 The Mazda 787 b's run is said to be deeply inscribed in the memories of the Mans audience 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:10.340
 Especially this car has its rotary engine 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:17.060
 Very Nde different from other reciprocating also the only rotary engine and then the sound is anything 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:21.130
 It is true to say that everyone heard that sound again when it says that it is left in memory 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.130
 I think that I was pleased with that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.940
 It is turn of 787 b which becomes Hiroshima 8 run 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.170
 It was called Mistarman to hold the handle 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.170
 It is Yojiro Terada 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.310
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.640
 Is it a free action 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:51.270
 Terada's driving showed 787 b various running 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.270
 Sound straight high pitched rotary sound 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.519
 After all Mazda technology can still run at the post 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.640
 I think that Rotary is the best. 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:09.790
 Over over was Mr. I open Thank You 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:15.400
 Thank beneath it by I was a good sound department 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:19.350
 Words too, so gyoza There was an amazing sound just like the 6 minicar that resonated with the body 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.350
 Nya N It was messed up parenthesis good 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:27.590
 Horse Impressions with Glory History Rotary Engine 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.760
 The memory is still inscribed in the hearts of fans 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:36.920
 But last weekend is the only rotary engine car 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:44.060
 rx 8 announced in June that production will be accommodated 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:46.200
 Costs to meet new national crash safety standards and environmental standards in the United States Europe 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:53.700
 It is because 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:58.569
 A new step to that next step I have not pessimistic at all And then unfortunately I once 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:02.229
 I do not know that that production will be discontinued, but this next 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.350
 When I put out , I can not give more written oath 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:09.950
 It is roundabout 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:13.670
 I believe that I should have been there for a long time and I believe Mazda will not lose it 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.360
 Participated in the development of rotary engines from the beginning 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:24.140
 In the case of Le Mans, we spread the people who are qualified to develop Mazda technology 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:25.670
 Kobayakawa Takaharu is Mr. various tricks Tsukai again and again and again really difficult aspect taken in its history 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.940
 Than have also been overcome 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:33.220
 So Iuko and whether it was longer this would give up completely the rotary 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:37.000
 It's probably not something like that 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.740
 Every time Mazda engineers go over adversity 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.080
 Practical use of the rotary engine Now the next generation of god technology 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.729
 Sky Active has created 21 years of real life that will last forever 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.870
 A rotary engine that can go Ya 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:58.300
 It's not just a survival but it can lead the 21st century 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:00.910
 Fu say things that the rotary engine is a thing that will be its development I definitely 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.729
 I will do that kind of innovation 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.070
 rotary 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:09.340
 The pioneers brought up to the top of the engine world 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:14.760
 I was looking forward to the next generation of engineers 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.760
 Mazda fans gathered at this event may have the same thought
