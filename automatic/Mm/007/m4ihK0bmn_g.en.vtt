00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.290 

I<00:00:00.560> had<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:01.680> little<00:00:01.890> walkthrough<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.909> smart

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
I had this little walkthrough of a smart

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.360 
I had this little walkthrough of a smart
kegerator<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:03.929> I've<00:00:04.020> been<00:00:04.110> working<00:00:04.350> on<00:00:04.470> so

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
kegerator that I've been working on so

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.610 
kegerator that I've been working on so
this<00:00:05.520> system<00:00:05.730> uses<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> Raspberry<00:00:06.899> Pi<00:00:06.930> running

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
this system uses a Raspberry Pi running

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.129 
this system uses a Raspberry Pi running
a<00:00:07.770> interface<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.580> I've<00:00:08.700> written<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.059> QT<00:00:09.480> and

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
a interface that I've written in QT and

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.249 
a interface that I've written in QT and
uses<00:00:10.500> flowmeters<00:00:11.070> NADH<00:00:11.670> 2d<00:00:12.630> h20<00:00:13.139> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
uses flowmeters NADH 2d h20 to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.490 
uses flowmeters NADH 2d h20 to
temperature<00:00:13.710> sensor<00:00:14.269> so<00:00:15.269> once<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.900> start<00:00:16.199> or

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
temperature sensor so once a start or

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.519 
temperature sensor so once a start or
whatsapp<00:00:16.949> or<00:00:17.190> starts<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.810> camera<00:00:19.170> kicks<00:00:19.380> on

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
whatsapp or starts the camera kicks on

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.230 
whatsapp or starts the camera kicks on
as<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.859> see<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.820> starts<00:00:21.090> running

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
as you can see and it starts running

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.990 
as you can see and it starts running
facial<00:00:22.199> detection<00:00:22.730> eventually<00:00:23.730> it'll<00:00:23.910> be

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
facial detection eventually it'll be

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.910 
facial detection eventually it'll be
facial<00:00:24.330> recognition<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.590> isn't

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
facial recognition but that isn't

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.310 
facial recognition but that isn't
working<00:00:26.010> quite<00:00:26.250> yet<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:27.990> now<00:00:28.140> I'll

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
working quite yet so here for now I'll

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.479 
working quite yet so here for now I'll
just<00:00:28.349> manually<00:00:28.920> set<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.580> name<00:00:29.789> but

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
just manually set this to my name but

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.430 
just manually set this to my name but
eventually<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.820> will<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.090> automatic<00:00:33.690> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
eventually that will be automatic so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.959 
eventually that will be automatic so
here<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.040> see<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.550> coming<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:35.850> on

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
here you can see that we're coming up on

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.670 
here you can see that we're coming up on
the<00:00:36.059> end<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> pour<00:00:40.730> oops<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.379> got

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
the end of the pour oops so here you got

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.440 
the end of the pour oops so here you got
a<00:00:43.739> few<00:00:43.950> full<00:00:44.370> beer<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:45.870> will<00:00:46.140> keep<00:00:46.440> track<00:00:46.500> of

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
a few full beer it will keep track of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.479 
a few full beer it will keep track of
the<00:00:48.450> poor<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:50.190> go

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the poor and so now if I actually go

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520 
the poor and so now if I actually go
into<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> log<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.960> most<00:00:52.170> recent

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
into the log I can see this most recent

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
into the log I can see this most recent
port<00:00:52.770> when<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.760> actually<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:54.149> through<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
port when I can actually go through the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360 
port when I can actually go through the
pictures<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.960> were<00:00:55.260> recorded<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> pour

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
pictures that were recorded of that pour

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.740 
pictures that were recorded of that pour
and<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.670> could<00:00:56.820> manually<00:00:57.120> change<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> name<00:00:57.629> if

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and I could manually change the name if

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.830 
and I could manually change the name if
I<00:00:57.840> needed<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.730> also<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.510> users

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
I needed to I can also go to the users

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.660 
I needed to I can also go to the users
and<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.109> could<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:01.649> account<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.579> how

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and I could go to my account and see how

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
and I could go to my account and see how
much<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.149> owe<00:01:03.350> now<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> I've<00:01:04.589> added<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
much that I owe now that I've added that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820 
much that I owe now that I've added that
extra<00:01:04.949> beer<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.080> whole<00:01:07.260> system<00:01:07.470> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
extra beer so this whole system is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.940 
extra beer so this whole system is
running<00:01:08.580> off<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.030> Raspberry<00:01:09.510> Pi<00:01:09.799> which<00:01:10.799> I've

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
running off of a Raspberry Pi which I've

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.440 
running off of a Raspberry Pi which I've
got<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> velcro<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
got kind of velcro to the back of the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.070 
got kind of velcro to the back of the
kegerator<00:01:12.659> I've<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.270> USB<00:01:15.270> hub<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.750> powers

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
kegerator I've got a USB hub that powers

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080 
kegerator I've got a USB hub that powers
everything<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.920> GPIO<00:01:17.280> breakout<00:01:17.820> board

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
everything and a GPIO breakout board

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.260 
everything and a GPIO breakout board
that<00:01:18.840> goes<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> 10<00:01:19.740> pin<00:01:19.950> ribbon<00:01:20.250> cable<00:01:20.610> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that goes to a 10 pin ribbon cable that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.649 
that goes to a 10 pin ribbon cable that
runs<00:01:21.299> inside<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.200> cabinet<00:01:23.509> inside<00:01:24.509> the

runs inside the cabinet inside the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.510 
runs inside the cabinet inside the
cabinet<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.650> flow<00:01:25.860> sensors<00:01:26.310> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
cabinet we have two flow sensors that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
cabinet we have two flow sensors that
are<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.119> line<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.659> both<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> taps

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
are actually in line on both of the taps

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.310 
are actually in line on both of the taps
as<00:01:28.890> well<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> D<00:01:30.150> H<00:01:30.210> 22<00:01:30.630> temperature<00:01:31.020> sensor

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and a fan that helps keep everything

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.590 
and a fan that helps keep everything
circulating<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:35.970> actually<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.540> that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
circulating and then actually now that

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.719 
circulating and then actually now that
we<00:01:36.960> chart<00:01:37.590> temperature<00:01:37.979> humidity<00:01:38.070> over<00:01:38.520> time

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
we chart temperature humidity over time

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.179 
we chart temperature humidity over time
you<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.390> spike<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> end<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you can see the spike here at the end of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.359 
you can see the spike here at the end of
the<00:01:41.400> temperature<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.939> humidity

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
the temperature and humidity

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.580 
the temperature and humidity
representing<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.490> door<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:44.939> opened<00:01:45.590> so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
representing that the door was opened so

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.190 
representing that the door was opened so
the<00:01:46.979> next<00:01:47.159> things<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.549> I'm<00:01:47.729> working<00:01:47.759> on

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the next things that I'm working on

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.539 
the next things that I'm working on
there's<00:01:49.200> going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.710> new<00:01:49.890> UI<00:01:50.070> that's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
there's going to be a new UI that's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.370 
there's going to be a new UI that's
coming<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> better

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
coming out I'm going to do a better

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.830 
coming out I'm going to do a better
mount<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:52.979> camera<00:01:53.570> I'm<00:01:54.570> eventually

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
mount for the camera I'm eventually

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.330 
mount for the camera I'm eventually
going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> use<00:01:55.320> weight<00:01:55.560> sensors<00:01:56.009> underneath

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
going to use weight sensors underneath

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.819 
going to use weight sensors underneath
the<00:01:56.520> kegs<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.149> hopefully<00:01:57.750> see<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> two<00:01:58.079> co2

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the kegs and hopefully see a two co2

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.580 
the kegs and hopefully see a two co2
tank<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.369> measure<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.810> volume<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.439> bit

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
tank to measure the volume a little bit

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
tank to measure the volume a little bit
more<00:02:01.950> accurately<00:02:02.640> than<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.060> by<00:02:03.210> how<00:02:03.869> much

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
more accurately than just by how much

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
more accurately than just by how much
has<00:02:04.170> been<00:02:04.290> flowed<00:02:04.560> through<00:02:04.950> I'm<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
has been flowed through I'm going to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.850 
has been flowed through I'm going to
switch<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.540> new<00:02:07.079> IR<00:02:07.590> camera

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
switch to a new IR camera

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.920 
switch to a new IR camera
to<00:02:08.950> help<00:02:09.130> with<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.340> low<00:02:09.490> light<00:02:09.700> situations<00:02:10.330> as

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
to help with the low light situations as

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.440 
to help with the low light situations as
well<00:02:11.170> as<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.410> some<00:02:11.680> IR<00:02:12.550> illumination<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.300> help

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
well as you some IR illumination to help

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.900 
well as you some IR illumination to help
with<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.660> facial<00:02:13.810> recognition<00:02:14.110> and

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
with the facial recognition and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.190 
with the facial recognition and
eventually<00:02:15.910> all<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.270> source<00:02:16.510> will<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.840> public

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
eventually all the source will be public

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.050 
eventually all the source will be public
so<00:02:17.950> everybody<00:02:18.190> else<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.580> start<00:02:18.760> hacking<00:02:18.970> on

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
so everybody else can start hacking on

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.660 
so everybody else can start hacking on
it<00:02:19.090> thank<00:02:19.600> you
