yeah her gear their redstone
they<00:05:03.640> which<00:05:03.850> will<00:05:03.970> power<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.330> piston<00:05:04.720> right

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
they which will power that piston right

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.310 
they which will power that piston right
there<00:05:05.500> and<00:05:06.430> then<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.610> repeater<00:05:06.970> just<00:05:07.600> right

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
there and then a repeater just right

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.340 
there and then a repeater just right
there<00:05:08.830> which<00:05:09.580> car<00:05:09.760> is<00:05:09.790> that<00:05:09.910> piston<00:05:10.390> so<00:05:11.290> now

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
there which car is that piston so now

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.070 
there which car is that piston so now
you<00:05:11.410> should<00:05:11.470> have<00:05:11.620> all<00:05:11.920> nine<00:05:12.190> Pistons<00:05:12.700> out<00:05:13.080> and

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
you should have all nine Pistons out and

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.410 
you should have all nine Pistons out and
start<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.950> blocks<00:05:15.190> now<00:05:15.370> so<00:05:16.210> now<00:05:16.300> if<00:05:16.360> you

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
start to the blocks now so now if you

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.970 
start to the blocks now so now if you
want<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.660> test<00:05:16.810> it<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:17.320> come<00:05:17.530> down<00:05:17.710> right<00:05:17.860> here

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
want to test it and come down right here

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.330 
want to test it and come down right here
is<00:05:18.310> your<00:05:18.490> torch<00:05:18.730> go<00:05:19.600> one<00:05:19.810> under<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:21.190> then

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
is your torch go one under it and then

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.780 
is your torch go one under it and then
put<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.550> hole<00:05:21.700> right<00:05:21.730> there<00:05:23.160> right<00:05:24.160> there<00:05:24.430> right

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
put a hole right there right there right

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.330 
put a hole right there right there right
there

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
there

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:34.510 
there
you<00:05:27.340> know<00:05:27.400> letter

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.659 

down<00:05:35.180> there<00:05:35.389> tested

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
down there tested

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.300 
down there tested
perfect

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
perfect

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.890 
perfect
just<00:05:39.910> like<00:05:40.050> okay<00:05:41.050> sets<00:05:41.860> the<00:05:42.040> basic<00:05:42.900> sliding

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
just like okay sets the basic sliding

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.080 
just like okay sets the basic sliding
door<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:45.520> next<00:05:45.550> episode<00:05:46.060> wheel<00:05:46.960> between

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
door and the next episode wheel between

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.250 
door and the next episode wheel between
buttons<00:05:49.090> in<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.540> pressure<00:05:49.750> plates<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.200> all

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
buttons in and pressure plates and all

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.520 
buttons in and pressure plates and all
that<00:05:50.410> so<00:05:51.400> this<00:05:51.700> is<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.910> shuffling<00:05:52.330> zombie<00:05:52.720> 13-14

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
that so this is a shuffling zombie 13-14

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.550 
that so this is a shuffling zombie 13-14
signing<00:05:54.430> off
