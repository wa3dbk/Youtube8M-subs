remember Rob Varley joined us back in
April<00:00:07.470> well<00:00:08.130> we<00:00:08.250> have<00:00:08.370> some<00:00:08.490> good<00:00:08.610> news<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.849> it

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
April well we have some good news and it

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.970 
April well we have some good news and it
it<00:00:09.570> really<00:00:09.719> makes<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.019> change<00:00:10.200> particular<00:00:10.889> as

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
it really makes a change particular as

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.320 
it really makes a change particular as
you<00:00:11.099> say<00:00:11.250> after<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.490> last<00:00:11.610> couple<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.000> summers

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
you say after the last couple of summers

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.180 
you say after the last couple of summers
which<00:00:12.480> were<00:00:12.690> disappointing<00:00:13.620> over<00:00:13.769> many<00:00:13.920> parts

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
which were disappointing over many parts

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.460 
which were disappointing over many parts
of<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.370> UK<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> signs<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.289> coming

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
of the UK so the signs for the coming

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.380 
of the UK so the signs for the coming
summer<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:17.100> much<00:00:17.490> more<00:00:17.640> promising<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.270> can

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
summer are much more promising we can

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.910 
summer are much more promising we can
expect<00:00:18.660> times<00:00:18.960> when<00:00:19.199> temperatures<00:00:19.710> would<00:00:19.800> be

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
expect times when temperatures would be

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.679 
expect times when temperatures would be
well<00:00:20.100> above<00:00:20.220> average<00:00:20.460> perhaps<00:00:20.910> even<00:00:21.029> above<00:00:21.300> 30

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
well above average perhaps even above 30

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.660 
well above average perhaps even above 30
at<00:00:21.930> times<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.130> look<00:00:23.279> over<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> whole

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
at times and if you look over the whole

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.220 
at times and if you look over the whole
of<00:00:23.880> last<00:00:24.029> two<00:00:24.300> summers<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.689> was<00:00:24.779> hardly<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.050> day

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
of last two summers it was hardly a day

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.740 
of last two summers it was hardly a day
when<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> temperature<00:00:25.890> came<00:00:26.130> above<00:00:26.340> 30<00:00:26.750> so

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
when the temperature came above 30 so

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.359 
when the temperature came above 30 so
generally<00:00:28.140> dryer<00:00:28.439> generally<00:00:28.890> warmer<00:00:29.220> than

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
beginning of September how do you

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
beginning of September how do you

summer<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.479> over<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.799> at

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860

summer is over and I think if we look at
the<00:01:07.979> statistics<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.939> actually

but<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.450> worth<00:01:30.600> pointing<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.950> summer

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
but it's worth pointing out the summer

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.160 
but it's worth pointing out the summer
of<00:01:32.250> two<00:01:32.430> thousand<00:01:32.880> nine<00:01:32.909> was<00:01:33.329> both<00:01:33.600> warmer<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
of two thousand nine was both warmer and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.840 
of two thousand nine was both warmer and
drier<00:01:34.680> than<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> last<00:01:35.189> two<00:01:35.369> summers<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.790> the

disappointing summers of 2007 and 2008

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.760 
disappointing summers of 2007 and 2008
it's<00:01:39.210> also<00:01:39.360> worth<00:01:39.750> pointing<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it's also worth pointing out that as you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.399 
it's also worth pointing out that as you
at<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.979> first<00:01:41.220> clip<00:01:41.600> from<00:01:42.600> Rob<00:01:42.990> who<00:01:43.200> said

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
average with previous years what are we

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.340 
average with previous years what are we
really<00:02:05.549> looking<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.210> how<00:02:06.960> did<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.740 
think what we said in the original
forecast<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.790> weren't<00:02:12.090> expecting<00:02:12.300> very

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
in the second half of august I think

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.869 
in the second half of august I think
there<00:03:14.200> will<00:03:14.290> be<00:03:14.349> longer<00:03:14.980> spells<00:03:15.340> of<00:03:15.639> fine

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
there will be longer spells of fine

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.599 
there will be longer spells of fine
weather<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.560> towards<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.590> end<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:18.040> August<00:03:18.459> we

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
weather and towards the end of August we

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.490 
weather and towards the end of August we
could<00:03:18.849> get<00:03:19.000> some<00:03:19.299> perhaps<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.079> or<00:03:20.109> two<00:03:20.290> quite

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
could get some perhaps one or two quite

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.180 
could get some perhaps one or two quite
warm<00:03:20.889> days<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.489> overall<00:03:22.109> not<00:03:23.109> too<00:03:23.139> bad<00:03:23.859> month
