00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.299
 well in this video of the boxing review of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.189
 a screen protector for iphone 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.189
 who sent me the company you will bris 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.760
 so I'll put my iphone aside 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 the moment and this is the product that I 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.349
 they sent as I mentioned before is a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 screen protector and together with the 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.099
 product the company also sent me 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.199
 this letter which is a detail that 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.779
 thanks as you can see it is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.310
 personalized and basically what it says 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.080
 is that they expect me to enjoy the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 product and that if I have any doubt 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.250
 I can communicate with briana to which 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 I also thank you very much for having me 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.199
 sent this screen protector and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.480
 here is the product as I mentioned 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.909
 before it is a screen saver but 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 it's not like any other protector this one 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.640
 is of a very high quality here can 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.690
 see the product specifications 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.760
 mentions that it offers protection 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.799
 excellent to the screen that the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.500
 visibility through it is very clear 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.510
 and sharp that fits perfectly to 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.269
 the iphone screen and that is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.049
 Scratch- resistant here you can see 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.119
 the name of the product are the and in the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.340
 bottom part says protect your check 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.670
 in style which means protect your 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.500
 technology in style or with style this 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.550
 protector is made of glass 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.710
 tempered 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.470
 and as the specifications mention 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.840
 must be very resistant something that calls 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.970
 my attention is the quality of the packaging is 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.370
 extremely elegant and has lyrics 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.380
 bright in relief so this does not 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.910
 will make the product better or worse but it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.940
 appreciates the effort and quality that 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.310
 they put in the packaging by the way this 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.100
 Product is compatible with iphone 4 and 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.380
 4 s in the back come more 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.660
 specifications and colors in the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.750
 which is this product available 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.460
 they sent me is gray now 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.550
 let's open the package to see what it is 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.250
 what includes 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.320
 here is the screen saver and it 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.060
 You can notice the quality even to the touch 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.979
 it's not the typical delgadito protector 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.229
 in the box also include this 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.289
 microfiber orange color which is 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.770
 thanks and it 's all as you can see longer 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.770
 there is nothing else 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.430
 I'm going to take out the microfiber and this one either 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.130
 it's a common microfiber it feels 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.320
 different I know it's difficult to explain this 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.380
 but it really feels of a quality 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.110
 higher than average 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.880
 and here is the screen saver the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.620
 which also includes this kind of 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.550
 mini protector for our button 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.560
 iphone main draw and I will 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.330
 As you can see it is not as thin as 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.460
 the common screen protectors 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.380
 I hope this does not harm the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.790
 sensitivity of the screen at the time of 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.829
 touch the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.019
 I will install the product on my iphone 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.469
 so advance the process to not 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.469
 bore them 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.790
 and ready and finished installing the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.890
 screen saver and despite not 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.750
 be so thin the fluidity with which you 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.420
 can operate the device continues 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.580
 being practically the same everything 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.770
 it responds very normally and it is 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.720
 true what the packaging mentioned this 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.240
 protector makes everything look extremely 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.160
 clear and very bright I hope this 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.810
 can be noticed in the video because of 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.700
 you can truly see a change 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.010
 as for the thickness that adds this 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.130
 protector to the device is actually 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.900
 very little here can you appreciate let's say 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.660
 which is like double a protector of 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.970
 normal screen is not really very 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.040
 notoriously the difference of fact I put 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.489
 the case that I usually use my iphone 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.290
 and everything in a perfect way 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.440
 conclusion it seems to me that this protector 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.670
 of the screen is very different from the ordinary 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.290
 starting by letting you change 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.690
 the color of the front of your 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.060
 iphone and apart offers a protection 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.920
 extreme if you are someone to whom you 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.350
 worries about having the maximum protection 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.180
 possible on your device without a doubt this 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.790
 based product is tempered glass 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.070
 for you and something I want to highlight from 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.570
 new is the quality in every aspect that 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.030
 gives to the company that sent us this 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.160
 product from the packaging can be noticed 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.350
 the quality and the fact of sending a 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.270
 personalized letter to the user too 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.820
 is something that adds positive points to the 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.710
 shopping experience in the description 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.419

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.240
 this product in case you want 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.130
 Acquiring it is not a cheap product but 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.440
 In case you buy it, believe me 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.350
 it's worth every penny they pay 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.690
