laptop speakers they can't be pretty
loud<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> definitely<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> little

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
loud and there is definitely a little

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.999 
loud and there is definitely a little
bit<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.119> bass<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.630> there<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.380> basically<00:01:16.560> you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
bit of bass in there so basically you

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.920 
bit of bass in there so basically you
can<00:01:17.159> say<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.580> they<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.700> not<00:01:17.820> crappy<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.750> all

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
can say that they are not crappy at all

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.410 
can say that they are not crappy at all
as<00:01:19.170> far<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.830> connectivity<00:01:20.310> goes<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.939> was<00:01:21.150> very

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
as far as connectivity goes I was very

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.469 
as far as connectivity goes I was very
satisfied<00:01:21.830> it<00:01:22.830> has<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.250> built-in<00:01:23.640> power<00:01:24.030> supply

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
satisfied it has a built-in power supply

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.210 
satisfied it has a built-in power supply
so<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.080> connect<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.530> standard<00:01:26.009> power

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so you just connect your standard power

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.789 
so you just connect your standard power
cable<00:01:26.700> directly<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.600> display<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
cable directly to the display was I

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.830 
cable directly to the display was I
thought<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.280> very<00:01:29.549> convenient<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.689> it's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
thought was very convenient because it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.679 
thought was very convenient because it's
much<00:01:30.990> easier<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.680> replace<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:33.000> regular<00:01:33.420> power

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
much easier to replace a regular power

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
much easier to replace a regular power
cable<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.770> spending<00:01:35.250> quite<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> money

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
cable and spending quite a lot of money

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.840 
cable and spending quite a lot of money
on<00:01:36.420> external<00:01:37.079> power<00:01:37.290> supply<00:01:37.680> there's<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.549> very

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
on external power supply there's a very

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.510 
on external power supply there's a very
wide<00:01:39.210> variety<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:40.049> video<00:01:40.500> inputs<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.340> have

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
wide variety of video inputs we have

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.249 
wide variety of video inputs we have
DisplayPort<00:01:42.350> HDMI<00:01:43.350> DVI<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.549> VGA<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> can

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
DisplayPort HDMI DVI and VGA so you can

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
DisplayPort HDMI DVI and VGA so you can
easily<00:01:46.770> plug<00:01:47.070> pretty<00:01:47.369> much<00:01:47.549> anything<00:01:47.939> in

pointed towards gamers since the
response<00:02:47.380> time<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.890> two<00:02:48.190> milliseconds<00:02:48.940> but

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
response time is two milliseconds but

you can use it for whatever you want the
only<00:02:52.030> complaints<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:53.140> are<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
only complaints that I have are the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.580 
only complaints that I have are the
built-in<00:02:54.220> webcam<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:55.270> not<00:02:55.810> compatible<00:02:56.170> with<00:02:56.440> a

Mac<00:02:56.980> which<00:02:57.310> did<00:02:57.459> really<00:02:57.760> surprised<00:02:58.180> me<00:02:58.390> since

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
Mac which did really surprised me since

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.280 
Mac which did really surprised me since
Asus<00:02:59.200> manufactures<00:03:00.100> PC<00:03:00.580> components<00:03:01.290> another

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
downside is that there's not a built-in

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.170 
downside is that there's not a built-in
microphone<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:05.230> goes<00:03:05.260> with<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.980> webcam<00:03:06.459> but
