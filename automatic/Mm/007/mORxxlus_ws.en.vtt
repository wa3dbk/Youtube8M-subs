00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.430 
pretty clear water they can see and know
your<00:00:41.969> baits<00:00:42.210> they're<00:00:42.450> way<00:00:42.690> better<00:00:43.020> than<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
your baits they're way better than you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
your baits they're way better than you
than<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> think<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.550> think<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
than you think I think I'm one of the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.330 
than you think I think I'm one of the
biggest<00:00:45.809> things<00:00:45.960> also<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.559> getting<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
biggest things also is getting the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.610 
biggest things also is getting the
relative<00:00:47.820> height<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.140> where<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> fish<00:00:49.469> are

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
relative height of where the fish are

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040 
relative height of where the fish are
willing<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.820> bite<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.300> bait<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.539> don't<00:00:51.870> want

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
willing to bite the bait you don't want

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
willing to bite the bait you don't want
it<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.680> times<00:00:52.860> most<00:00:53.100> bass<00:00:53.399> anglers

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it like a lot of times most bass anglers

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.250 
it like a lot of times most bass anglers
when<00:00:54.090> they<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.539> fish<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.110> their

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
when they see the fish down on their

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.810 
when they see the fish down on their
their<00:00:55.500> electronics<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.670> they

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
their electronics what they do is they

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
their electronics what they do is they
drop<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> bait<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.440> what

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
drop the bait right down to them what

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.290 
drop the bait right down to them what
we're<00:00:58.949> doing<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.430> we're<00:00:59.609> holding<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> bait

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
we're doing is we're holding the bait

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
we're doing is we're holding the bait
above<00:01:01.109> them<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> distance<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.039> forcing<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
above them a distance and forcing the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
above them a distance and forcing the
fish<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.030> come<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> strike<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> bait

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
fish to come up and strike the bait

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.030 
fish to come up and strike the bait
and<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.640> big<00:01:05.850> big<00:01:06.360> part<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and that's a big big part of it this is

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
and that's a big big part of it this is
why<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.580> hard<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.970> people<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.659> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
why it's so hard for people to do this

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.330 
why it's so hard for people to do this
because<00:01:09.960> we're<00:01:10.170> actually<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.710> jigging<00:01:11.220> it's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
because we're actually not jigging it's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
because we're actually not jigging it's
you<00:01:11.790> hold<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.270> thing<00:01:12.570> there<00:01:12.810> let<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.350> hover

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
you hold that thing there let it hover

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.770 
you hold that thing there let it hover
and<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> bite<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> feels<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and you get a bite and it feels like a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
and you get a bite and it feels like a
bluegill<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> lot<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.740> time<00:01:16.920> yeah<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.250> nothing

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
bluegill a lot of time yeah it's nothing

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.240 
bluegill a lot of time yeah it's nothing
and<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:17.970> when<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> set<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> hook<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.990> like

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
and but when you set the hook it's like

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.010 
and but when you set the hook it's like
wow<00:01:20.250> he<00:01:20.850> wakes<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> hurry<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.960> know

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.440 

three<00:01:32.280> three<00:01:32.759> inches<00:01:33.090> under<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.360> surface

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
three three inches under the surface

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.590 
three three inches under the surface
here<00:01:34.189> one<00:01:35.189> thing<00:01:35.369> about<00:01:35.579> these<00:01:35.759> small<00:01:36.090> MOS<00:01:36.299> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
here one thing about these small MOS is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.899 
here one thing about these small MOS is
they<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.070> these<00:01:38.310> when

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
they when you get them out on these when

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.219 
they when you get them out on these when
they're<00:01:39.000> suspended<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.840> they're<00:01:40.110> not

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they're suspended like this they're not

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.520 
they're suspended like this they're not
by<00:01:40.470> themselves<00:01:40.680> they're<00:01:41.220> no<00:01:42.030> drift<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:43.049> well

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
by themselves they're no drift up well

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
by themselves they're no drift up well
that's<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.979> that's<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.549> interesting<00:01:44.939> thing

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that's the that's the interesting thing

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.240 
that's the that's the interesting thing
this<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.229> you're<00:01:46.350> talking<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.890> big

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
this is like what you're talking is big

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.219 
this is like what you're talking is big
schools<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.479> fish<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.840> mean<00:01:48.869> tremendous

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
schools of these fish I mean tremendous

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.429 
schools of these fish I mean tremendous
schools<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.159> bass<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.479> once<00:01:52.259> we

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
schools of bass and it's once we

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.260 
schools of bass and it's once we
actually<00:01:52.649> got<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.460> technique<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.180> we

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
actually got on this technique and we

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
actually got on this technique and we
started<00:01:54.570> messing<00:01:54.930> around<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.320> took<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.590> number

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
started messing around it took a number

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.010 
started messing around it took a number
of<00:01:55.950> years<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.520> guys<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:57.119> fine-tune<00:01:57.509> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
of years for guys to really fine-tune it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.760 
of years for guys to really fine-tune it
and<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.070> big<00:01:59.280> part<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.990> presentation

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and a big part of it is the presentation

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950 
and a big part of it is the presentation
the<00:02:01.920> subtlety<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> presentation<00:02:03.420> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the subtlety of the presentation you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.450 
the subtlety of the presentation you
know<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.259> mean<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.770> you'll<00:02:04.979> see<00:02:05.219> what

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
know what I mean we as you'll see what

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.609 
know what I mean we as you'll see what
we're<00:02:05.640> doing<00:02:05.850> we're<00:02:06.270> literally<00:02:06.600> taking<00:02:06.899> this

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
we're doing we're literally taking this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.430 
we're doing we're literally taking this
is<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> trigger<00:02:08.129> X<00:02:08.399> minnow<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
is a trigger X minnow and it's on a a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.770 
is a trigger X minnow and it's on a a
smooching<00:02:11.430> head<00:02:11.670> within<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.360> want<00:02:12.629> this

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
smooching head within what you want this

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.220 
smooching head within what you want this
bait

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
bait

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.589 
bait
do<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.709> hover<00:02:13.920> vertically<00:02:14.610> above<00:02:14.849> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
do is just hover vertically above the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.800 
do is just hover vertically above the
fish<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.459> thing<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:18.209> figuring<00:02:18.690> out

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
fish but the thing is is figuring out

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.449 
fish but the thing is is figuring out
the<00:02:19.019> fact<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.530> don't<00:02:19.650> jig<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.190> that's

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
the fact that you don't jig it that's

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.100 
the fact that you don't jig it that's
one<00:02:20.700> thing<00:02:20.849> for<00:02:21.030> bass<00:02:21.239> anglers<00:02:21.810> because

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
one thing for bass anglers because

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.720 
one thing for bass anglers because
they're<00:02:22.230> always<00:02:22.409> doing<00:02:22.769> something<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
they're always doing something with the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.449 
they're always doing something with the
bait<00:02:23.909> imparting<00:02:24.510> action<00:02:25.080> into<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.470> bait<00:02:25.650> but

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
bait imparting action into the bait but

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.190 
bait imparting action into the bait but
the<00:02:26.549> thing<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.360> actually<00:02:27.659> watch

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the thing is is if you actually watch

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.740 
the thing is is if you actually watch
these<00:02:29.040> minnows<00:02:29.370> they're<00:02:30.330> not<00:02:30.569> always

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
these minnows they're not always

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.420 
these minnows they're not always
scurrying<00:02:31.230> around<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.830> lot<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.099> times<00:02:32.250> they're

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
scurrying around a lot of times they're

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
scurrying around a lot of times they're
just<00:02:32.459> sitting<00:02:32.879> suspended<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.959> yeah

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
just sitting suspended like this yeah

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.800 
just sitting suspended like this yeah
and<00:02:34.500> they're<00:02:35.010> very<00:02:35.190> very<00:02:35.549> easy<00:02:35.819> meals<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.569> think

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
and they're very very easy meals I think

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:47.059 
and they're very very easy meals I think
for<00:02:37.019> bass<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.230> they<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:46.799> know<00:02:46.829> in<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
for bass and they know it you know in a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.530 
for bass and they know it you know in a
lot<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.250> these<00:02:47.400> buddy<00:02:47.700> tournaments<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:48.390> is

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
lot of these buddy tournaments this is

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.839 
lot of these buddy tournaments this is
the<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.410> first<00:02:49.680> thing<00:02:49.860> we<00:02:50.010> do<00:02:50.220> when

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
the this is the first thing we do when

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.059 
the this is the first thing we do when
we<00:02:51.000> hook<00:02:51.150> one<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.390> these<00:02:51.480> fish<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.989> yeah<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
we hook one of these fish is yeah the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.240 
we hook one of these fish is yeah the
other<00:02:53.220> guy<00:02:53.540> drops<00:02:54.540> right<00:02:55.500> down<00:02:55.560> there<00:02:56.010> because

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
other guy drops right down there because

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.630 
other guy drops right down there because
it<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.819> gets<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.269> other<00:02:57.390> ones<00:02:57.720> hot<00:02:58.019> yeah<00:02:58.709> in<00:02:59.549> a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
it it gets the other ones hot yeah in a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.430 
it it gets the other ones hot yeah in a
lot<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.910> times<00:03:00.060> you'll<00:03:00.239> double<00:03:00.569> up<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.840> me<00:03:01.019> table

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
lot of times you'll double up a me table

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.589 
lot of times you'll double up a me table
up<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.799> normal<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.400> mean<00:03:02.549> that's<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.910> beaut<00:03:03.359> more

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
up is normal I mean that's a beaut more

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.140 
up is normal I mean that's a beaut more
so<00:03:03.750> these<00:03:03.870> fish<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.560> double<00:03:04.920> up<00:03:05.120> they<00:03:06.120> are

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
so these fish you can double up they are

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.710 
so these fish you can double up they are
not<00:03:06.480> alone<00:03:06.780> down<00:03:07.019> there<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:09.120> it's<00:03:09.269> probably<00:03:09.660> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
not alone down there and it's probably a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.539 
not alone down there and it's probably a
team<00:03:10.019> deal<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.530> get<00:03:10.739> these<00:03:10.890> beat<00:03:11.220> where<00:03:11.430> they

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
team deal to get these beat where they

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.460 
team deal to get these beat where they
want<00:03:11.879> them<00:03:12.030> where<00:03:12.150> they<00:03:12.269> can<00:03:12.329> where<00:03:13.109> they<00:03:13.290> can

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
want them where they can where they can

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.729 
want them where they can where they can
catch<00:03:13.680> them<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.010> eat<00:03:14.129> them<00:03:14.930> yeah<00:03:15.930> yeah

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
catch them and eat them yeah yeah

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.589 
catch them and eat them yeah yeah
they're<00:03:16.920> using<00:03:17.340> their<00:03:17.489> hunt<00:03:17.700> they're<00:03:18.180> hunting

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
they're using their hunt they're hunting

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.120 
they're using their hunt they're hunting
the<00:03:18.750> fish<00:03:18.900> together<00:03:19.319> yeah

the fish together yeah

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:29.560 
the fish together yeah
we're<00:03:20.609> hunting<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.090> prey

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.610 

locationally<00:03:30.570> we're<00:03:30.720> targeting<00:03:30.930> baths<00:03:31.410> that

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
locationally we're targeting baths that

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.230 
locationally we're targeting baths that
are<00:03:31.740> positioned<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.310> sunken<00:03:32.760> humps<00:03:33.090> and

one<00:04:12.270> thing<00:04:12.450> that's<00:04:12.660> really<00:04:12.870> critical<00:04:13.470> is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
one thing that's really critical is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.680 
one thing that's really critical is
actually<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.160> head<00:04:14.460> you<00:04:15.030> want<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.450> want<00:04:15.630> a

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
actually the head you want you want a

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.140 
actually the head you want you want a
head<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.080> actually<00:04:16.500> hangs<00:04:16.799> vertical<00:04:17.580> what

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
head that actually hangs vertical what

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.880 
head that actually hangs vertical what
you<00:04:18.270> want<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.660> bait<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.080> do<00:04:19.230> is<00:04:19.380> hang<00:04:19.590> like

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
you want that bait to do is hang like

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.560 
you want that bait to do is hang like
this<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.530> this<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.770> smoochin<00:04:23.460> head<00:04:23.730> VMC

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
this so this is a smoochin head VMC

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.940 
this so this is a smoochin head VMC
smoochin<00:04:25.110> head<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.440> what<00:04:25.560> we're<00:04:25.650> gonna<00:04:25.740> do

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
smoochin head and what we're gonna do

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.330 
smoochin head and what we're gonna do
the<00:04:26.100> biggest<00:04:26.310> thing<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.700> when<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.360> dress<00:04:27.750> them

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
the biggest thing is when you dress them

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.890 
the biggest thing is when you dress them
the<00:04:29.340> bait<00:04:29.700> on<00:04:29.730> there<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.360> want<00:04:30.570> to<00:04:30.690> make<00:04:30.870> sure

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
the bait on there you want to make sure

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.990 
the bait on there you want to make sure
it's<00:04:31.320> straight<00:04:31.740> you<00:04:32.190> wouldn't<00:04:32.460> believe<00:04:32.580> you

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
it's straight you wouldn't believe you

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.330 
it's straight you wouldn't believe you
would<00:04:33.090> think<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.450> if<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.720> was<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:35.100> wouldn't

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
would think that if it was it wouldn't

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.640 
would think that if it was it wouldn't
make<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.550> big<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.240> difference<00:04:36.660> but<00:04:37.470> it

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
make that big of a difference but it

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.470 
make that big of a difference but it
really<00:04:38.220> does<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.430> you'll<00:04:39.000> have<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.240> lot<00:04:39.450> more

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
really does that you'll have a lot more

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.420 
really does that you'll have a lot more
drive-bys<00:04:40.320> but<00:04:40.650> do<00:04:40.770> you<00:04:40.860> want<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.100> make<00:04:41.220> sure

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
drive-bys but do you want to make sure

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.610 
drive-bys but do you want to make sure
that<00:04:41.700> the<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.540> bait<00:04:42.750> is<00:04:42.930> dressed<00:04:43.230> on<00:04:43.380> there

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.450 
that the the bait is dressed on there
really<00:04:43.830> straight<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.820> really<00:04:45.210> critical<00:04:46.460> today

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460
