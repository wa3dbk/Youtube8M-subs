hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.839
we're going to make a dish before you
make the you may have to cry a little

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.230
bit because the amount of onions we're going to cut. Today we're going to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.350
make Egg Roast, a favorite from Kerala

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.199
first we're going to add some oil into a
hot pan and add mustard seeds

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:39.120
once the mustard seeds crackling add
sliced garlic and also sliced ginger now

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.219
add sliced onion lot of them when you
add so much onions

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.329
you need to add salt to bring out the
moisture and cook fast and salt

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.489
we're going to cook this onions till
they're slightly golden in color

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.140
while these onions get brown let me tell
you that i have learned this recipe from

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.960
Dolly Syriac from Pepper county

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.100
It's a great place to stay and they
serve really awesome food

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.240
oh baby you want to play with Nana come
on baby come on

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.080
- what can we do you want to play with
Nana

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080
yeah I know you want to be on the show

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.180
yes you're the show you know I promised
you to put on the show

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.490
only when you stop sucking milk and now
you're a grown up baby you have to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.030
start drinking milk from the bottle and
glasses..ding ding ding...ok now i need to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.950
cook go back to mummy.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.759
now you see how these onions are
slightly golden in color

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.720
you don't want them to become really
dark brown but you know traces of nice

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.970
brown color now add curry leaves and
sliced green chillies and turmeric and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.970
mix all of it nicely

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.329
seeing this recipe i added slices of
garlic and ginger

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.710
you know i love that freshly crushed our
slices of fresh ginger

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.660
you know rather than using ginger garlic
paste because it adds to the taste

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.410
little bit and that little bit of taste
makes a lot of difference

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:23.540
coriander powder, chilli powder, a little
bit of garam masala powder you know

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.400
garam masala powder that they use in
Kerala is slightly different and they

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.599
use a little bit of saunf in it that
gives little extra flavor to this dish

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:41.810
to this add slices of tomato and we're
going to let this cook for another 3-4

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.880
minutes till this tomatoes become little bit soft. A good cook is one who

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.360
cooks it and modify the taste to suit
their tastes

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.950
you know in Kerala some people like to
add little bit of coconut milk into

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.930
this to make a little bit of sauce

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.370
it's up to you if you want to add you
can do that. At pepper county they say

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.750
they had a little bit of tomato ketchup
and chili sauce because that's how their

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.650
daughter anu loves it, anyway modify
to the way you like it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.130
now I'm going to add eggs into this. The dish is all ready. You can finish it off

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.200
with some chopped coriander

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.680
isn't it amazing the egg by many is
considered to be a vegetarian

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.489
even though it comes from the behind of
a chicken and also some Bengalis

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.500
consider fish as a vegetarian

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.799
who cares let's try this awesome dish

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.269
hmm

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.709
you can serve it with the paratha which I
have shown yesterday

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.150
also you can serve it with Appam but by
tradition

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.290
they love to serve it with puttu,  i'm
going to show how to make that in

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.280
