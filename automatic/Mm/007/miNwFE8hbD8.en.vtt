00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
adding a row of square stitch you have

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.420 
adding a row of square stitch you have
to<00:00:59.390> add<00:00:59.510> two<00:00:59.930> rows<00:01:00.200> you<00:01:00.560> can't<00:01:00.890> ever<00:01:01.130> add<00:01:01.400> a

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
to add two rows you can't ever add a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.020 
to add two rows you can't ever add a
single<00:01:01.820> row<00:01:02.150> so<00:01:02.840> here<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.320> have<00:01:03.590> two<00:01:04.580> beads<00:01:04.820> in

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
single row so here you have two beads in

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.999 
single row so here you have two beads in
first<00:01:05.600> row<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.020> two<00:01:06.229> beads<00:01:06.410> in<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.649> second

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
the same row and work across and do the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.300 
the same row and work across and do the
same<00:01:17.540> thing<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.080> other<00:01:18.110> side<00:01:18.560> now<00:01:19.280> let's

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
same thing on the other side now let's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.070 
same thing on the other side now let's
move<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.880> beadwork<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.570> I'll<00:01:20.780> show<00:01:21.020> you

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
move to the beadwork and I'll show you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.389 
move to the beadwork and I'll show you
what<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:21.410> looks<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:21.770> when<00:01:21.950> when<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.130> do<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
what it looks like when when you do the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.380 
what it looks like when when you do the
beads<00:01:23.500> here<00:01:24.500> we<00:01:24.680> have<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.280> piece<00:01:25.550> with<00:01:26.210> your

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
beads here we have the piece with your

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.100 
beads here we have the piece with your
three<00:01:26.720> rows<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.799> can<00:01:28.010> see<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.430> I<00:01:28.460> have

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
three rows and you can see that I have

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.450 
three rows and you can see that I have
four<00:01:30.110> beads<00:01:30.409> ready<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:31.010> go<00:01:31.159> here<00:01:36.310> now<00:01:37.310> I'm

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
four beads ready to go here now I'm

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.390 
four beads ready to go here now I'm
going<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.670> do<00:01:37.820> this<00:01:38.030> two<00:01:38.630> at<00:01:38.900> a<00:01:38.960> time

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
going to do this two at a time

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.950 
going to do this two at a time
just<00:01:40.400> for<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.610> time<00:01:40.909> saver<00:01:41.270> here<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:41.810> actually

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
just for a time saver here it's actually

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.200 
just for a time saver here it's actually
called<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.740> drop<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:46.310> can<00:01:46.490> see<00:01:46.790> how<00:01:47.030> they

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
called to drop and you can see how they

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.020 
called to drop and you can see how they
sit<00:01:47.600> right<00:01:47.930> on<00:01:48.530> top<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:49.040> each<00:01:49.159> other<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.909> you

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
can kind of nudge them with your finger

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.560 
can kind of nudge them with your finger
there's<00:01:54.439> your<00:01:54.710> extension<00:01:55.369> if<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.090> look<00:01:56.299> back

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
there's your extension if you look back

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.500 
there's your extension if you look back
at<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.049> diagram<00:01:57.680> now<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:58.670> see<00:01:58.939> these<00:01:59.150> are

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
at the diagram now you can see these are

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.920 
at the diagram now you can see these are
the<00:01:59.540> beads<00:01:59.930> we<00:02:00.409> just<00:02:00.770> added<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.939> back<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
the beads we just added and back to the

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.980 
the beads we just added and back to the
beadwork<00:02:03.700> here<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:04.880> go<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.420> you're<00:02:05.810> going<00:02:05.930> to

do the same thing now I'm using size 10

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.699 
do the same thing now I'm using size 10
cylinder<00:02:23.600> beads<00:02:23.810> here<00:02:24.079> they<00:02:24.260> fit<00:02:24.560> together

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
cylinder beads here they fit together

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.120 
cylinder beads here they fit together
really<00:02:25.160> nicely<00:02:25.519> in<00:02:25.850> square<00:02:26.239> stitch<00:02:27.130> needle

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130

sets it through the holes here you can
use<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> size<00:02:30.500> 10<00:02:30.890> or<00:02:31.220> 12<00:02:31.610> needle<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.959> use<00:02:33.230> a

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
use a size 10 or 12 needle and I use a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.440 
use a size 10 or 12 needle and I use a
braided<00:02:34.099> beading<00:02:34.640> thread<00:02:34.880> because

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
braided beading thread because

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.420 
braided beading thread because
it's<00:02:35.510> very<00:02:35.720> strong<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.010> thing<00:02:37.220> about

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
it's very strong and the thing about

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.979 
it's very strong and the thing about
cylinder<00:02:37.940> beads<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.300> they<00:02:38.420> have<00:02:38.510> nice<00:02:38.720> big

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
cylinder beads is they have nice big

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.360 
cylinder beads is they have nice big
holes<00:02:39.290> because<00:02:39.769> you're<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.129> pass

is<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.299> do<00:03:26.420> increase<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.140> decrease<00:03:28.299> now<00:03:29.299> I'm

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
is to do increase in decrease now I'm

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.500 
is to do increase in decrease now I'm
working<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.590> beautiful<00:03:31.519> iridescent<00:03:31.910> green

here's<00:03:41.569> very<00:03:41.989> tiny<00:03:42.410> little<00:03:42.829> seed<00:03:43.190> beads<00:03:43.519> these

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
here's very tiny little seed beads these

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.140 
here's very tiny little seed beads these
are<00:03:44.150> cylinder<00:03:44.959> beads<00:03:45.139> also<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:46.069> they're<00:03:46.250> 15s

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
are cylinder beads also but they're 15s

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.349 
are cylinder beads also but they're 15s
so<00:03:48.109> that's<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.310> increase<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.090> decrease

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359
