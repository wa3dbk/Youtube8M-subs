00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
actually not that clear you specialized

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.429

specializations each specialization is

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.320 
specializations each specialization is
different<00:01:26.470> but<00:01:26.950> at<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.189> same<00:01:27.369> time<00:01:27.580> each<00:01:27.939> rank

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
different but at the same time each rank

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.270 
different but at the same time each rank
when<00:01:28.720> you're<00:01:28.840> specializing<00:01:29.530> takes<00:01:29.920> about<00:01:30.070> as

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
when you're specializing takes about as

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.490 
when you're specializing takes about as
