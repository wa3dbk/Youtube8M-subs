00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.980
 Hello dear friends today will 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.540
 video about the knife to be provided 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.849
 for review Novosibirsk store knives 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.870
 the blade will be this knife companies kirsha 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.160
 he is called here and so freefall 3840 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 free fall if i 'm not mistaken then 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.180
 so should be translated 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 let's see another knife from 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.449
 kirsha's chinese series company 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.340
 Generally, I understand that but 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.470
 relatively not so long ago 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.590
 produced judging by the box at 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.780
 least this copy is not very old 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 now such are used lining 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.660
 multi-letter quiche companies 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.730
 kei as a dark hole 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.219
 here is made such a loop in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.489
 spacer spicer such a rich steel 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.620
 apparently and he notice 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.870
 in a slightly blue tint, I think that in the frame 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.629
 also it is marvelous that he is not black here 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.390
 such with a slightly blue tint 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.219
 completely secret clip here such here 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.350
 set on this knife let's 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.890
 probably see how he looks at 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890
 pocket 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.159
 what is typical is such a small clips 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.899
 on the pocket looks like you can see pretty 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.490
 well and more than that but pretty 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.409
 not bad working on this knife here 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.680
 there is just as a clip but not 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.450
 less not perfect well let's say 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 clips such on thursday but nevertheless in 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.439
 the difference is valid from the kirshin mura 3 with 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.570
 half that i have for too 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.850
 Chinese Keshir series companies here you 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.009
 Do tear bend the pants clip using 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.509
 the plates don't have to be here when everything is in 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.869
 In general, in this regard, I normally did 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.429
 Immediately flipper fin so here now 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.810
 done on chinese kirshi midi series 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.610
 devoid of any cuts 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.429
 it is processed well enough 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.200
 very nice because the argument is specific 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.209
 so easy it opens enough and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.610
 you have to dance on glue 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:02.720
 could put traditionally as far as I know 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.069
 8 May 13 here is such a finish processing 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.530
 this is also very pleasant then i am so 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:11.330
 I see see tired so this is correct 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.250
 just call this refer to the reference 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.370
 pin on the disclosure there working such 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.500
 because the look so it's all about here 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.560
 as for grip 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.010
 but now just shot one more 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.390
 overview 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.209
 I must say that such a small 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.269
 a clip in a little just enough even in a very 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.859
 hard hands are not felt at all in 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.200
 the opposite is enough is another matter 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.480
 because I personally have this finger 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.920
 It falls right in here that's at the edge 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.780
 any such hit 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.670
 It may turn out that thing 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.150
 time occurred with a knife coat of arms 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.940
 folder 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.680
 that as much as possible possible in general clip 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.180
 very cool to get a finger to get 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.709
 there is such a solid bruise or 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.780
 bruise something like that 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.250
 for the rest, and the mechanics are here for such 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.470
 knives traditionally i'm basically nothing 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.720
 new likely to say they can not 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.430
 the only thing I have to say is that 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.230
 the last time knives of the chinese wall are three 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.870
 Company Kirsch became so some sort of 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.700
 something softer for a hand that is not 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.200
 here from some sharp angles of something 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.389
 that clings to the pocket and not at all 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.310
 somewhere all this did very neatly well 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.889
 and of course pay attention that 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.180
 Klim knife out of the box does not even 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.440
 center so well because you can see 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.060
 such a knife, but still pretty 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.069
 still works well here everything is clear 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.890
 tent lovers go for quite inexpensive 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.519
 can pay attention to this our well 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.160
 as if 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.220
 for understanding next to the famous knife 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.470
 size of course 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.900
 slate pencils are low more and somewhat 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.660
 less hanging in what you can be sure 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.010
 they kept saying it weighs about 100 13 12 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:53.000
 grams here in this case free 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.700
 drop the whole 123 grams by about 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.400
 12 grams more, that is, but somehow 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.950
 he say nevertheless under in same 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.840
 of this size this weight seems tangible 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.810
 that is honest when you killed the sound you got 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.489
 the eye feels like a mass 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.510
 the knife should have some other but i 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.069
 I think what happens mostly 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.660
 thanks to this steel 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.629
 really spacey he's not plastic 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.630
 that's why it is actually such a weight 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.579
 accordingly the balance of the knife is very much so 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.810
 specifically in the handle directly and in her 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.430
 the back of u somehow made such here 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.590
 way but nonetheless I will say that 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.180
 such a balance I love it even perhaps 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.190
 like that is necessary so it becomes 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.050
 easy to handle with his tip 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.250
 differently its there as it turns in 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.750
 some kind of my time because balance 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.039
 hair deep in the palm grip 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.960
 you can grab a little name 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.610
 perhaps a bit short but nonetheless 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.169
 for my hand there is still somehow all 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.720
 more or less thumb fits like 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.360
 it's not very convenient but you can 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.810
 shove in general is such another 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.530
 modelka from the Chinese company cache 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.849
 I hope that tank lovers can 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.979
 look if you want there for 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.270
 inexpensively 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.380
 I hope that you were interested in a lot 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.380
 thanks for watching bye
