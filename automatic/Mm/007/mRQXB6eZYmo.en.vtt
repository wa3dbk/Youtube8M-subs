00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.740 

the<00:00:01.140> key<00:00:01.380> of<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.620> major<00:00:01.829> has<00:00:02.220> three<00:00:02.639> sharps<00:00:03.090> an<00:00:03.300> F

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
the key of a major has three sharps an F

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.579 
the key of a major has three sharps an F
sharp<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:04.290> C<00:00:04.350> sharp<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.700> G<00:00:06.000> sharp<00:00:06.290> and<00:00:07.290> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
sharp a C sharp and a G sharp and the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.530 
sharp a C sharp and a G sharp and the
finger<00:00:07.950> pattern<00:00:08.280> actually<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.760> very<00:00:09.120> similar

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
finger pattern actually is very similar

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.470 
finger pattern actually is very similar
at<00:00:09.900> first<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.889> what<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:11.160> did<00:00:11.340> for<00:00:11.519> D<00:00:11.700> major<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
at first to what we did for D major the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.030 
at first to what we did for D major the
only<00:00:12.690> difference<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.110> we're<00:00:13.290> starting<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
only difference is we're starting on the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.310 
only difference is we're starting on the
g<00:00:14.190> string<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.759> we've<00:00:14.910> got<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.690> two<00:00:15.719> four<00:00:16.170> with

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
g string so we've got one two four with

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.890 
g string so we've got one two four with
an<00:00:16.440> extension<00:00:16.850> next<00:00:17.850> string<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.180> go<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> again

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
an extension next string we go to again

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.410 
an extension next string we go to again
we've<00:00:19.500> got<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.830> extension<00:00:20.240> we're<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.359> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
we've got that extension we're going to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.560 
we've got that extension we're going to
close<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:21.900> then<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.350> use<00:00:22.590> open<00:00:23.519> one<00:00:23.850> three

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
close it up then and use open one three

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.150 
close it up then and use open one three
and<00:00:24.990> then<00:00:25.350> since<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.769> further<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> go

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
and then since we have further to go

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.279 
and then since we have further to go
we're<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.580> start<00:00:26.640> shifting<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:28.109> my

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
we're going to start shifting so my

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.859 
we're going to start shifting so my
first<00:00:28.560> shift<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> put<00:00:30.090> my<00:00:30.269> first

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
first shift I'm going to put my first

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.959 
first shift I'm going to put my first
finger<00:00:31.080> where<00:00:31.470> my<00:00:31.650> fourth<00:00:31.949> finger<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.610> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
finger where my fourth finger was we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.479 
finger where my fourth finger was we
would<00:00:33.090> call<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:34.140> replace<00:00:34.620> four<00:00:35.010> shift

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
would call this a one replace four shift

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.450 
would call this a one replace four shift
okay<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.870> played<00:00:37.050> open<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.829> three

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
okay so I just played open one three

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.729 
okay so I just played open one three
instead<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.450> playing<00:00:39.719> my<00:00:39.870> fourth<00:00:40.110> finger<00:00:40.290> I'm

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
instead of playing my fourth finger I'm

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.750 
instead of playing my fourth finger I'm
going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> put<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.160> first<00:00:41.340> finger<00:00:41.550> there

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
going to put my first finger there

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.750 
going to put my first finger there
instead<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.300> play<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.410> three

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
instead and play one three

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.670 
instead and play one three
now<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> next<00:00:45.600> shift<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.079> actually<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
now the next shift I'm actually going a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.290 
now the next shift I'm actually going a
little<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:47.129> further<00:00:47.460> than<00:00:47.670> where<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.030> fourth

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
little bit further than where my fourth

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.560 
little bit further than where my fourth
finger<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.809> I'm<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:49.559> f-sharp

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
finger is I'm going up to an f-sharp

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.330 
finger is I'm going up to an f-sharp
then<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.829> reach<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
then I'm going to kind of reach up a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.130 
then I'm going to kind of reach up a
little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.640> similar<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.210> an<00:00:54.449> extension<00:00:54.809> same

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
little bit similar to an extension same

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.849 
little bit similar to an extension same
kind<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> idea<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.489> J<00:00:56.879> sharp<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:58.230> day

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
kind of idea for my J sharp and my day

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.939 
kind of idea for my J sharp and my day
okay<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.420> finger<00:01:00.809> spacing<00:01:01.440> idea<00:01:01.739> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
okay and this finger spacing idea is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
okay and this finger spacing idea is
really<00:01:02.280> quite<00:01:02.670> important<00:01:03.210> once<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:04.049> into

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
really quite important once you get into

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.890 
really quite important once you get into
the<00:01:04.439> higher<00:01:04.619> positions<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.820> past<00:01:06.570> fourth

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the higher positions because past fourth

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.780 
the higher positions because past fourth
position<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.500> pretty<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:07.799> don't<00:01:08.220> use<00:01:08.490> our

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
position we pretty much don't use our

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
position we pretty much don't use our
fourth<00:01:09.090> finger<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.600> mean<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.229> very<00:01:10.290> rare

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
fourth finger I mean just it's very rare

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
fourth finger I mean just it's very rare
that<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> use<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.490> once<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.270> to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that you use it so once you get up to

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.429 
that you use it so once you get up to
here<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.110> start<00:01:13.260> thinking

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
here you have to just start thinking

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.920 
here you have to just start thinking
about<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.310> where<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.939> half<00:01:15.180> steps<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.750> my

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
about so where are my half steps and my

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.710 
about so where are my half steps and my
whole<00:01:16.110> steps<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.820> little<00:01:17.820> more<00:01:17.909> careful<00:01:18.240> all

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
whole steps a little more careful all

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.880 
whole steps a little more careful all
right<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.110> more<00:01:19.140> time<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> string

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
right so one more time on that a string

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
right so one more time on that a string
we<00:01:20.009> had<00:01:20.159> open<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:21.229> three<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:23.159> three<00:01:24.110> one

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
we had open one three one three one

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.420 
we had open one three one three one
reach<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.520> two<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.090> three

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
reach up for two and three

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.560 
reach up for two and three
okay<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.490> let's<00:01:29.759> pluck<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> whole<00:01:30.329> thing

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
okay so let's pluck the whole thing

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.100 
okay so let's pluck the whole thing
together

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
together

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
together
starting<00:01:31.890> first<00:01:32.189> finger<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> g<00:01:33.600> string

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
starting first finger on the g string

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.710 
starting first finger on the g string
and<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:35.159> will<00:01:35.369> say<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> note<00:01:35.939> names<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.509> finger

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
and I will say the note names and finger

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.810 
and I will say the note names and finger
numbers<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> join<00:01:37.920> me<00:01:38.100> I'm<00:01:38.340> saying

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
numbers you want to join me I'm saying

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.999 
numbers you want to join me I'm saying
the<00:01:39.000> note<00:01:39.630> names<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.290> great<00:01:40.530> okay

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the note names that would be great okay

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.620 
the note names that would be great okay
here<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.630> first<00:01:42.630> finger<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:44.390> second<00:01:45.390> finger

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
here we go first finger a second finger

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.280 
here we go first finger a second finger
B<00:01:46.549> fourth<00:01:47.549> finger<00:01:47.909> C<00:01:48.149> sharp<00:01:49.310> open<00:01:50.310> D<00:01:51.290> first
