00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 

well<00:01:42.509> these<00:01:42.750> wood<00:01:43.020> chip<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.829> come<00:01:44.069> from

well these wood chip actually come from

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
well these wood chip actually come from
wood<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.390> use<00:01:45.569> anymore

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
wood we don't use anymore

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.240 
wood we don't use anymore
so<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.159> recycle<00:01:47.729> these<00:01:47.850> things<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:49.159> we<00:01:50.159> have

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
so we recycle these things and we have

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.389 
so we recycle these things and we have
developed<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.819> so<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.659> use<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.020> as

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
developed this so you can use this as

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.819 
developed this so you can use this as
like<00:01:53.399> an<00:01:53.520> approach<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.780> garden

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
like an approach for your garden

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.940 
like an approach for your garden
it<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> also<00:01:56.700> used<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.689> parking<00:01:58.109> areas<00:01:58.500> because

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it is also used at parking areas because

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.479 
it is also used at parking areas because
you<00:01:59.819> can<00:01:59.969> actually<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.530> very<00:02:01.829> large<00:02:02.099> scar

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
you can actually have a very large scar

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.740 
you can actually have a very large scar
on<00:02:02.819> top<00:02:03.239> of<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.599> can<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:04.670> around<00:02:05.670> 1.5<00:02:06.270> ton

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
on top of it you can have around 1.5 ton

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.779 
on top of it you can have around 1.5 ton
so<00:02:06.959> it's<00:02:07.110> should<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.619> no<00:02:07.829> problem<00:02:08.250> he's<00:02:08.399> got<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so it's should be no problem he's got a
