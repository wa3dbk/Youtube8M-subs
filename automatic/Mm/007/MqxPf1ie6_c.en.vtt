the<00:00:25.019> gameplay<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.680> fairly<00:00:26.039> simple<00:00:26.400> when<00:00:26.699> you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the gameplay is fairly simple when you

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.609

race you must tap on the gas to start at

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.470 
race you must tap on the gas to start at
an<00:00:28.740> optimal<00:00:29.160> rpm<00:00:29.640> then<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> matter<00:00:30.359> of

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
an optimal rpm then it's a matter of

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.089 
an optimal rpm then it's a matter of
tapping<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:30.990> shift<00:00:31.289> buttons<00:00:31.650> at<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.830> best

other<00:00:34.500> than<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.399> really

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
other than that it's just a really

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.250 
other than that it's just a really
simple<00:00:35.820> drag<00:00:36.180> race<00:00:36.420> down<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.660> straight<00:00:37.020> road

one<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> best<00:00:38.070> parts<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.579> there<00:00:38.820> is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
one of the best parts is that there is

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.729 
one of the best parts is that there is
no<00:00:39.090> turning<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.750> you're<00:00:39.960> doing<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.350> racing

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
no turning all you're doing is racing

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.139 
no turning all you're doing is racing
straight<00:00:41.040> ahead<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.760> no<00:00:41.910> weird

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
straight ahead so there is no weird

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.639 
straight ahead so there is no weird
physics<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.690> deal<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> while<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> game

does<00:00:43.680> require<00:00:44.250> good<00:00:44.520> timing<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> actually

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
does require good timing it actually

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.660 
does require good timing it actually
doesn't<00:00:45.989> take<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.350> much<00:00:46.559> focus<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.430> just

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
doesn't take that much focus you just

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.040 
doesn't take that much focus you just
have<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> wait<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> green<00:00:48.600> lights<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
have to wait for the green lights and
