00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
of the box you can buy the touch itself

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.319 
of the box you can buy the touch itself
you<00:01:48.070> can<00:01:48.100> feel<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.640> this<00:01:48.759> is<00:01:48.820> not<00:01:49.119> your

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
you can feel that this is not your

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.050 
you can feel that this is not your
regular<00:01:49.479> TPU<00:01:50.409> or<00:01:50.560> silicone<00:01:50.979> case<00:01:51.189> the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
regular TPU or silicone case the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.330 
regular TPU or silicone case the
material<00:01:52.540> that<00:01:52.689> it's<00:01:52.869> made<00:01:52.930> up<00:01:53.259> out<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.560> is

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
material that it's made up out of is

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.330 
material that it's made up out of is
basically<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.149> combination<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:56.130> TPU<00:01:57.130> and

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
basically a combination of TPU and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.160 
basically a combination of TPU and
rubber<00:01:57.579> so<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.060> has<00:01:58.270> that<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:01.360> has<00:02:01.570> an<00:02:01.750> extra

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
rubber so it has that it has an extra

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.160 
rubber so it has that it has an extra
strip<00:02:02.439> feeling<00:02:02.860> as<00:02:03.009> compared<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.579> regular

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
strip feeling as compared to the regular

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.630 
strip feeling as compared to the regular
TPU<00:02:05.170> case<00:02:05.409> I<00:02:05.619> don't<00:02:05.950> know<00:02:06.009> how<00:02:06.130> well<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.460> that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
TPU case I don't know how well it that

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.789 
TPU case I don't know how well it that
it<00:02:06.759> will<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.119> will<00:02:07.149> show<00:02:07.630> on<00:02:07.810> camera<00:02:08.110> but<00:02:08.440> if

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
it will it will show on camera but if

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.650 
it will it will show on camera but if
you<00:02:09.070> see<00:02:09.220> if<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.399> flex<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.119> very<00:02:10.420> very

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
you see if I flex it it's very very

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.030 
you see if I flex it it's very very
rigid<00:02:11.110> it's<00:02:11.590> not<00:02:11.829> as<00:02:12.100> soft<00:02:12.459> as<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.470> TPU

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
rigid it's not as soft as a as a TPU

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.150 
rigid it's not as soft as a as a TPU
case<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:16.390> definitely<00:02:16.930> not<00:02:17.530> as<00:02:17.739> soft<00:02:17.980> as

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
case and definitely not as soft as

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.300 
case and definitely not as soft as
silicone<00:02:18.639> case<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.870> gives<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.380> extra<00:02:20.859> bit

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
silicone case so it gives the extra bit

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.450 
silicone case so it gives the extra bit
of<00:02:21.340> protection<00:02:21.609> as

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
of protection as

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.390 
of protection as
to<00:02:22.820> TPU<00:02:23.780> cases<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:26.450> field<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:27.320> also<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:28.010> bit

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
to TPU cases and the field is also a bit

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.100 
to TPU cases and the field is also a bit
more<00:02:28.580> premium<00:02:28.880> than<00:02:29.150> regular<00:02:29.360> TPU<00:02:29.870> case

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
more premium than regular TPU case

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.230 
more premium than regular TPU case
because<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:30.890> has<00:02:31.010> at<00:02:31.160> matte<00:02:31.400> finish<00:02:31.760> all<00:02:31.940> over

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
because it has at matte finish all over

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.000 
because it has at matte finish all over
as<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:32.870> see<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.170> has<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.470> matte<00:02:33.650> finish

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
as you can see it has that matte finish

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.010 
as you can see it has that matte finish
on<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.280> back<00:02:34.490> as<00:02:34.700> well<00:02:34.730> as<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.600> inside

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
on the back as well as the on the inside

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.070 
on the back as well as the on the inside
so<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.560> feels<00:02:36.770> really<00:02:37.100> really<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:38.020> premium<00:02:39.020> in

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
so it feels really really a premium in

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.530 
so it feels really really a premium in
the<00:02:39.200> hand<00:02:41.080> also<00:02:42.080> this<00:02:42.920> matte<00:02:43.280> finish<00:02:43.640> makes<00:02:44.360> it

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the hand also this matte finish makes it

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.330 
the hand also this matte finish makes it
a<00:02:44.750> bit<00:02:45.050> more<00:02:45.080> slippery<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.860> hand<00:02:46.130> as

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
a bit more slippery in the hand as

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.970 
a bit more slippery in the hand as
compared<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.820> something<00:02:47.150> like<00:02:47.680> TPU<00:02:48.680> or

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
compared to something like TPU or

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.740 
compared to something like TPU or
silicone<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:49.970> tends<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.300> slip<00:02:50.570> off

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
silicone so it tends to slip off

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.990 
silicone so it tends to slip off
surfaces<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.470> your<00:02:51.620> hand<00:02:51.860> pretty<00:02:52.130> easily<00:02:52.370> in

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
surfaces and your hand pretty easily in

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.810

comparison<00:02:53.720> but<00:02:54.320> nevertheless<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.460> pretty

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
comparison but nevertheless it is pretty

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.080 
comparison but nevertheless it is pretty
premium<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.510> touch<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.830> cutouts<00:02:58.640> are<00:02:58.970> all

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
premium to touch and the cutouts are all

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.390 
premium to touch and the cutouts are all
well<00:02:59.330> done<00:02:59.600> as<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.470> can<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:00.740> there<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> huge

screen protector say from speaking sgp
which<00:04:24.650> will<00:04:24.860> go<00:04:25.010> really<00:04:25.130> well<00:04:25.400> with<00:04:25.460> this<00:04:25.730> case

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
which will go really well with this case

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.070 
which will go really well with this case
and<00:04:28.840> it's<00:04:29.840> it's<00:04:30.410> really<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:31.570> premium<00:04:32.570> case

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
and it's it's really a premium case

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.930 
and it's it's really a premium case
outside<00:04:33.590> because<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:34.250> feel<00:04:34.430> in<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.640> hand<00:04:34.669> is

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
outside because the feel in the hand is

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.980 
outside because the feel in the hand is
great

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
great

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.780 
great
it<00:04:36.170> gives<00:04:36.560> decent<00:04:36.800> amount<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.280> protection<00:04:37.430> it

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
it gives decent amount of protection it

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.850 
it gives decent amount of protection it
doesn't<00:04:38.030> add<00:04:38.090> too<00:04:38.270> much<00:04:38.390> bulk<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.020> everything

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
doesn't add too much bulk and everything

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.070 
doesn't add too much bulk and everything
is<00:04:39.980> pretty<00:04:40.130> much<00:04:40.220> accessible<00:04:40.940> I've<00:04:41.330> had<00:04:41.690> no

although<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.330> would<00:04:44.930> like<00:04:45.490> this<00:04:46.490> case<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:47.450> cover

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
although I would like this case to cover

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.270 
although I would like this case to cover
up<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:50.780> cross<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.260> this<00:04:51.380> case<00:04:51.590> are<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.800> bit<00:04:52.070> too

up the cross on this case are a bit too

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.000 
up the cross on this case are a bit too
large<00:04:52.570> if<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.750> see<00:04:53.930> there's<00:04:54.380> still<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.710> lot<00:04:54.980> of

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
large if you see there's still a lot of

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.940 
large if you see there's still a lot of
area<00:04:55.430> exposed<00:04:55.820> around<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.710> all<00:04:57.710> the

around micro USB and microphone that

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.060 
around micro USB and microphone that
this<00:05:04.610> is<00:05:04.760> a<00:05:04.880> lot<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.270> leaves<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.960> lot<00:05:06.590> of<00:05:06.740> area

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
this is a lot it leaves a lot of area

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.100 
this is a lot it leaves a lot of area
exposed<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.670> I<00:05:08.300> would<00:05:08.420> like<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:08.810> cutout

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
exposed and I would like the cutout

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.930 
exposed and I would like the cutout
should<00:05:09.350> be<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.470> bit<00:05:09.650> more<00:05:09.830> smaller<00:05:10.160> than<00:05:10.700> what

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
should be a bit more smaller than what

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.030 
should be a bit more smaller than what
they<00:05:11.060> are<00:05:11.180> other<00:05:11.990> than<00:05:12.140> that<00:05:12.200> I<00:05:12.620> have<00:05:12.980> no

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
they are other than that I have no

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.560 
they are other than that I have no
gripes<00:05:13.430> against<00:05:14.470> on<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.650> case<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.610> yeah<00:05:17.300> this

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
gripes against on the case and yeah this

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.990 
gripes against on the case and yeah this
is<00:05:17.750> basic<00:05:18.050> just<00:05:18.340> personal<00:05:19.340> preference<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:19.880> if

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
is basic just personal preference so if

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.470 
is basic just personal preference so if
you<00:05:20.120> find<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.450> cutouts<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:20.870> be<00:05:21.050> fine

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
you find the cutouts to be fine

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.870 
you find the cutouts to be fine
basically<00:05:23.480> it's<00:05:23.690> a<00:05:23.750> great<00:05:23.930> case<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:25.580> doesn't

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
basically it's a great case it doesn't

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.020 
basically it's a great case it doesn't
have<00:05:25.970> too<00:05:26.150> much<00:05:26.240> bulk<00:05:26.570> so<00:05:27.340> it's<00:05:28.340> really<00:05:28.700> really

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
have too much bulk so it's really really

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.720 
have too much bulk so it's really really
great<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.660> is<00:05:29.900> a<00:05:30.110> slightly<00:05:30.590> expensive<00:05:31.190> I

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
great it is a slightly expensive I

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.650 
great it is a slightly expensive I
