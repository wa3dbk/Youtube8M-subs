so<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.709> video<00:00:02.100> I'm<00:00:02.340> going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.580> do<00:00:02.790> a

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
so in this video I'm going to do a

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.410 
so in this video I'm going to do a
drawing<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:04.259> really<00:00:04.770> wide<00:00:05.279> or<00:00:05.670> panoramic

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
drawing of really wide or panoramic

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.350 
drawing of really wide or panoramic
skyline<00:00:07.140> or<00:00:07.379> cityscape<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.880> could<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.210> this

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
skyline or cityscape you could do this

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.240 
skyline or cityscape you could do this
in<00:00:09.540> pencil<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:10.530> I'm<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.769> be<00:00:10.889> doing<00:00:11.130> it

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
in pencil but I'm going to be doing it

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.799 
in pencil but I'm going to be doing it
with<00:00:11.280> pen<00:00:12.320> because<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.469> want<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.759> or<00:00:15.240> keep

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
with pen because I want to have or keep

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.750 
with pen because I want to have or keep
like<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.289> sketchy<00:00:16.770> kind<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> feel<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.460> it

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
like this sketchy kind of a feel to it

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.939 
like this sketchy kind of a feel to it
but<00:00:18.359> if<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.600> want<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.020> could<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.410> know<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
but if you want you could you know do a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.830 
but if you want you could you know do a
little<00:00:20.220> layout<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:20.850> sketch<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.750> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
little layout or sketch out of what it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.140 
little layout or sketch out of what it
would<00:00:21.900> look<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.439> pencil<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.070> then<00:00:23.699> you

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
would look like in pencil and then you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.349 
would look like in pencil and then you
know<00:00:24.590> do<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.800> final<00:00:26.070> rendering<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:28.220> pen<00:00:29.359> but

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
know do the final rendering in pen but

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.840 
know do the final rendering in pen but
I'm<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.500> everything<00:00:32.040> with

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
I'm just going to do everything with

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.500 
I'm just going to do everything with
pencil<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.899> pen<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> reasons

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
pencil with pen and one of the reasons

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.270 
pencil with pen and one of the reasons
why<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:37.020> doing<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.559> pen<00:00:37.829> also<00:00:38.010> is

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
why I'm doing it with pen also is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.459 
why I'm doing it with pen also is
because<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.239> makes<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.140> bit<00:00:40.290> more

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
because it it makes it a little bit more

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.729 
because it it makes it a little bit more
more<00:00:41.100> sketchy<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.989> because<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
more sketchy and because of that it's a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.290 
more sketchy and because of that it's a
little<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:44.040> more<00:00:44.219> dynamic<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.180> me<00:00:45.590> more

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
little bit more dynamic to me more

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.729 
little bit more dynamic to me more
lifelike<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> sense<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.050> know<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.440> it's

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
lifelike in a sense you know so it's

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
lifelike in a sense you know so it's
it's<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.210> has<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> lot<00:00:51.600> more

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
it's it's I think it has a lot more

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
it's it's I think it has a lot more
character<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.800> ink<00:00:53.399> as

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
character when you do it with ink as

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
character when you do it with ink as
opposed<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.780> pencil<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.890> there's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
opposed to with pencil but there's

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.680 
opposed to with pencil but there's
nothing<00:00:56.370> wrong<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.760> doing<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.300> way

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
nothing wrong with doing it that way

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.819 
nothing wrong with doing it that way
either<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:59.570> of<00:01:00.570> course<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.020> always<00:01:01.230> best<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
either and of course it's always best to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.799 
either and of course it's always best to
draw<00:01:02.100> from<00:01:02.309> life<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.850> know<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
draw from life you know if you have the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.530 
draw from life you know if you have the
opportunity<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> actually<00:01:04.830> visit<00:01:05.700> cities<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
opportunity to actually visit cities and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.719 
opportunity to actually visit cities and
places<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.200> draw<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:07.740> them<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.220> always

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
places and draw from them it's always

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
places and draw from them it's always
the<00:01:09.000> best<00:01:09.180> experience<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.869> don't<00:01:10.439> be

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the best experience and don't be

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
the best experience and don't be
intimidated<00:01:10.680> by<00:01:11.130> life<00:01:11.520> ok<00:01:11.909> that's<00:01:12.150> ultimately

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
intimidated by life ok that's ultimately

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.380 
intimidated by life ok that's ultimately
the<00:01:12.780> best<00:01:13.260> way<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> learn<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> draw<00:01:14.369> study<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the best way to learn to draw study and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
the best way to learn to draw study and
draw<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.140> life<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.619> much<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.159> possibly

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
draw from life as much as you possibly

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
draw from life as much as you possibly
can<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.119> will<00:01:18.330> enable<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> draw<00:01:19.080> from

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
can and it will enable you to draw from

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.219 
can and it will enable you to draw from
the<00:01:19.350> imagination<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.570> lot<00:01:21.570> better<00:01:21.900> trust<00:01:22.590> me<00:01:22.850> so

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
the imagination a lot better trust me so

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.810 
the imagination a lot better trust me so
I'm<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.770> playing<00:01:26.040> along<00:01:26.220> some

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I'm just going to be playing along some

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.630 
I'm just going to be playing along some
of<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.540> doing<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> fly

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
of it I'm going to be doing on the fly

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.190 
of it I'm going to be doing on the fly
I'm<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.030> making<00:01:30.240> some<00:01:30.630> some<00:01:30.990> stuff

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
I'm going to be making some some stuff

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
I'm going to be making some some stuff
up<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.680> along<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
up as I go along but it's really just to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
up as I go along but it's really just to
give<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> an<00:01:33.750> idea<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.520> really

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
give you an idea of how to have a really

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.260 
give you an idea of how to have a really
sketchy<00:01:36.950> fun<00:01:37.950> approach<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.670> drawing<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
sketchy fun approach to drawing a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.340 
sketchy fun approach to drawing a
cityscape<00:01:39.900> I'm<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.680> concerned<00:01:40.890> with

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
cityscape I'm not so concerned with

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.380 
cityscape I'm not so concerned with
perspective<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:44.070> accurate<00:01:44.640> renderings<00:01:45.180> it's

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
perspective or accurate renderings it's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.569 
perspective or accurate renderings it's
just<00:01:45.509> about<00:01:45.659> capturing<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.350> few<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.159> city<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
just about capturing a few the city so

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.770 
just about capturing a few the city so
most<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:47.939> lines<00:01:48.270> I'm<00:01:48.479> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.689> do

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
most of my lines I'm going to do

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
most of my lines I'm going to do
freehand<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.380> stuff<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
freehand and stuff like that but as I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
freehand and stuff like that but as I
said<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.329> more<00:01:51.450> comfortable<00:01:51.630> using<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
said if you're more comfortable using a
