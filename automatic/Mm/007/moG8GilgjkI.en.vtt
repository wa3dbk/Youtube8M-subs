00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
is the 2004 and the guy said there's a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.470 
is the 2004 and the guy said there's a
federal<00:00:31.769> problem<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:32.970> I<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.090> looking<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
federal problem but I was looking at the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.080 
federal problem but I was looking at the
throttle<00:00:33.660> he<00:00:34.350> said<00:00:34.559> that's<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.769> cable<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.969> was

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
throttle he said that's the cable it was

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.220 
throttle he said that's the cable it was
broken<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.539> something<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.019> I<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.170> like

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
broken or something and then I was like

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.959 
broken or something and then I was like
gonorrhea<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.190> cable<00:00:38.519> for<00:00:38.820> isn't

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
gonorrhea the cable for isn't

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.009 
gonorrhea the cable for isn't
broken<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.269> thinking<00:00:42.300> maybe<00:00:42.690> it's

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
broken and so I was thinking maybe it's

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.619 
broken and so I was thinking maybe it's
just<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.760> end<00:00:44.760> he<00:00:44.879> said<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> car<00:00:45.359> needs<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.570> be

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
just the end he said the car needs to be

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.150 
just the end he said the car needs to be
clean<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:46.019> like<00:00:46.140> maybe<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> carbon<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
clean I'm like maybe it's the carbon the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
clean I'm like maybe it's the carbon the
outflow<00:00:47.850> air<00:00:48.089> filter<00:00:48.539> maybe<00:00:48.809> squawking

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
outflow air filter maybe squawking

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.180 
outflow air filter maybe squawking
something<00:00:49.620> maybe<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.160> water<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:53.160> I

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
something maybe you have water and but I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.810 
something maybe you have water and but I
wasn't<00:00:53.519> he<00:00:53.640> had<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.079> carburetor<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:57.109> on<00:00:58.160> and

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.630 

it's<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.359> can't<00:01:03.629> basically<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's you can't basically get it out so I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.390 
it's you can't basically get it out so I
was<00:01:05.930> in<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.110> video<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:07.620> guess<00:01:07.980> you<00:01:08.100> cut<00:01:08.280> me

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
was in your video so guess you cut me

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.000 
was in your video so guess you cut me
out<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.470> as<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.620> can<00:01:10.830> see<00:01:12.740> there<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
out with this as you can see there it is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.670 
out with this as you can see there it is
right<00:01:14.250> there

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.210 

the<00:01:17.130> car<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> bull<00:01:18.740> but<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.040> see

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the car that's the bull but you can see

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.280 
the car that's the bull but you can see
only<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.660> it<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.020> probably

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
only way to get to it is probably

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.720 
only way to get to it is probably
removing<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.890> thing<00:01:23.360> removing<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.510> and

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
removing this thing removing that and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.130 
removing this thing removing that and
Sony<00:01:26.730> get<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.690> out

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.950 
there's the water that was right there
but<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.340> this<00:01:32.340> goes<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.630> up

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
