00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
introduced quicks into the equation so

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.309 
introduced quicks into the equation so
guys<00:02:55.579> it's<00:02:55.790> important<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.510> let<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.810> lady<00:02:57.019> know

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
almost like pushing a grocery cart

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.569 
almost like pushing a grocery cart
you've<00:03:05.959> got<00:03:06.140> your<00:03:06.290> hands<00:03:06.560> on<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.799> cart<00:03:07.040> you're

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
using pressure through the hands and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.729 
using pressure through the hands and
through<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.340> legs<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:11.239> create<00:03:11.750> movement<00:03:12.290> or

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
through the legs to create movement or

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.819 
through the legs to create movement or
space<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.610> then<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.720> fill<00:03:15.079> that<00:03:15.110> space

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
space and then you can fill that space

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.830 
space and then you can fill that space
that's<00:03:16.190> been<00:03:16.340> vacated<00:03:17.030> in<00:03:17.150> this<00:03:17.299> case<00:03:17.569> by<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
that's been vacated in this case by the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.740 
that's been vacated in this case by the
lady<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.889> if<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.130> just<00:03:19.370> accelerate<00:03:20.180> without

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
lady so if you just accelerate without

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.390 
lady so if you just accelerate without
that<00:03:21.019> pressure<00:03:21.380> you'll<00:03:21.799> knock<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.190> lady

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
that pressure you'll knock the lady

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.340 
that pressure you'll knock the lady
backwards<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.090> she<00:03:23.600> won't<00:03:23.750> be<00:03:23.870> your<00:03:24.049> partner

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
keeping our arms very firm so that we

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.180 
keeping our arms very firm so that we
can<00:03:29.000> feel<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.480> message<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:30.139> when<00:03:30.889> it<00:03:31.040> gets

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
can feel the message and when it gets

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.770 
can feel the message and when it gets
quick<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:31.760> you're<00:03:31.880> moving<00:03:32.180> back<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.569> almost

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
quick and you're moving back it almost

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.470 
quick and you're moving back it almost
feels<00:03:33.049> like<00:03:33.109> you're<00:03:33.319> running<00:03:33.910> backwards<00:03:34.910> so

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
feels like you're running backwards so

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.610 
feels like you're running backwards so
you're<00:03:35.600> staying<00:03:35.750> on<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.049> balls<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.319> your<00:03:36.470> feet

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
you're staying on the balls of your feet

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.530 
you're staying on the balls of your feet
and<00:03:36.799> running<00:03:37.100> backwards<00:03:37.549> so<00:03:37.970> as<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.239> do<00:03:38.389> your

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
and running backwards so as you do your

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.270 
and running backwards so as you do your
slow<00:03:38.780> walks<00:03:39.049> we're<00:03:39.440> using<00:03:39.650> what<00:03:39.950> we<00:03:40.040> called

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
slow walks we're using what we called

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.160 
slow walks we're using what we called
CBM<00:03:40.790> contra<00:03:41.269> body<00:03:41.420> movement<00:03:41.840> that's<00:03:41.989> the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
CBM contra body movement that's the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.990 
CBM contra body movement that's the
slight<00:03:42.530> rotation<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.310> body<00:03:43.430> towards<00:03:43.880> the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
slight rotation of the body towards the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.949 
slight rotation of the body towards the
leg<00:03:44.180> that's<00:03:44.329> moving<00:03:44.859> slow<00:03:45.970> slow<00:03:46.970> as<00:03:47.269> we<00:03:47.750> dance

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
leg that's moving slow slow as we dance

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.300 
leg that's moving slow slow as we dance
the<00:03:48.170> quicks<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.739> balls<00:03:48.950> of<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.280> feet

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
the quicks on the balls of the feet

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.809 
the quicks on the balls of the feet
we're<00:03:50.299> going<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.780> just<00:03:51.019> less<00:03:51.560> than<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.950> quick

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
we're going to just less than that quick

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.750 
we're going to just less than that quick
quick<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.600> then<00:03:54.230> bring<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.680> back<00:03:54.709> in<00:03:55.160> as<00:03:55.400> we<00:03:55.609> do

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
quick and then bring it back in as we do

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.449 
quick and then bring it back in as we do
the<00:03:55.910> slow<00:03:56.209> walks<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:57.799> other<00:03:57.980> point<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.340> was

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
the slow walks the other point I was

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.620 
the slow walks the other point I was
going<00:03:58.579> to<00:03:58.700> make<00:03:58.849> is<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.060> even<00:03:59.480> though<00:03:59.599> you

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
going to make is that even though you

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.530 
going to make is that even though you
dancing<00:04:00.230> toe<00:04:00.590> really<00:04:01.519> just<00:04:01.880> danced<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.269> onto

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
dancing toe really just danced it onto

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.300 
dancing toe really just danced it onto
the<00:04:02.660> ball<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.019> foot<00:04:03.200> don't<00:04:03.470> push<00:04:03.799> right<00:04:04.099> up

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
the ball of the foot don't push right up

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.430 
the ball of the foot don't push right up
because<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.940> whole<00:04:05.120> dance<00:04:05.389> the<00:04:05.630> stylistic

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
because the whole dance the stylistic

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.500 
because the whole dance the stylistic
approach<00:04:06.950> is<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.160> we're<00:04:07.370> moving<00:04:07.519> along<00:04:07.880> the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
approach is that we're moving along the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.599 
approach is that we're moving along the
floor<00:04:08.810> gliding<00:04:09.620> along<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:10.099> dance<00:04:10.310> floor

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
floor gliding along the dance floor

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.130 
floor gliding along the dance floor
rather<00:04:11.120> than<00:04:11.389> showing<00:04:11.720> elevation<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.799> pause
