00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
of tape and set it on too low you're

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.880 
of tape and set it on too low you're
working<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> low<00:00:32.489> temperature<00:00:33.090> mark

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
working on the low temperature mark

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.979 
working on the low temperature mark
now<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> wax<00:00:35.160> should<00:00:35.430> melt<00:00:35.760> easily<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:36.960> not

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
now the wax should melt easily but not

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
now the wax should melt easily but not
be<00:00:37.260> running<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.620> over<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.890> place<00:00:38.190> obviously

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
be running all over the place obviously

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
be running all over the place obviously
you<00:00:38.820> hold<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> arm<00:00:39.239> flat<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.899> put<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.290> into

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you hold the arm flat and put it into

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.119 
you hold the arm flat and put it into
this<00:00:40.620> area<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> first<00:00:41.850> experiments<00:00:43.129> now

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
this area for the first experiments now

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.619 
this area for the first experiments now
with<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.640> color<00:00:44.910> let's<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.329> look<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
with one color let's just look at the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.240 
with one color let's just look at the
four<00:00:45.840> effects<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.410> smoothing<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
four effects as smoothing for the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.360 
four effects as smoothing for the
horizon<00:00:47.930> lifting<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.649> foliage<00:00:49.980> effect

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
horizon lifting for the foliage effect

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
horizon lifting for the foliage effect
the<00:00:51.360> edge<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> iron<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.050> pushed<00:00:52.320> through

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
the edge of the iron is pushed through

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.520 
the edge of the iron is pushed through
to<00:00:53.250> create<00:00:53.399> grasses<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to create grasses and the point of the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.610 
to create grasses and the point of the
iron<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.489> touched<00:00:56.730> into<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> wax

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
iron is just touched into the wax

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
iron is just touched into the wax
touched<00:00:58.620> onto<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> card<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> make<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> spot<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
touched onto the card to make a spot and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.119 
touched onto the card to make a spot and
then<00:01:00.690> flicked<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.140> win<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> other<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
then flicked one win the other for the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670 
then flicked one win the other for the
bird<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.539> horizon<00:01:04.110> foliage

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
bird so you have your horizon foliage

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.460 
bird so you have your horizon foliage
and<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> details<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.869> four<00:01:07.110> sorts<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and the details there are four sorts of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.000 
and the details there are four sorts of
horizons<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.280> flat<00:01:09.030> low<00:01:09.540> hills<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.830> high

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
horizons really flat low hills the high

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
horizons really flat low hills the high
hills<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:12.330> course<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.869> peaky<00:01:13.170> mountains

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
hills and of course the peaky mountains

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.870 
hills and of course the peaky mountains
all<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.400> made<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> iron

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
all can be made with the iron

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.950 
all can be made with the iron
progression<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.939> landscape<00:01:18.479> goes<00:01:18.720> through

landscape all made with the eye on the
details<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.330> flowers<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.259> developed

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
details of flowers can then be developed

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.940 
details of flowers can then be developed
water<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> added<00:01:30.750> other<00:01:31.110> things<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
water can be added other things and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.770 
water can be added other things and
eventually<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.000> come<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.390> your<00:01:33.509> full

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
eventually you come with your full

this one right now though to start off

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.030 
this one right now though to start off
with<00:01:39.150> you've<00:01:40.020> got<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.259> make<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> sky<00:01:40.770> need

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
with you've got to make the sky need

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.639 
with you've got to make the sky need
lots<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.579> white<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.270> we're<00:01:42.570> working<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
lots of white and we're working in a in

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
like this not too much colour mind
because<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.490> very<00:01:50.579> strong<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.360> when

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
because it's very strong so that when

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
because it's very strong so that when
you<00:01:51.689> pull<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.470> yarn<00:01:52.590> across<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.250> point<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.700> at

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you pull the yarn across the point is at

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.240 
you pull the yarn across the point is at
the<00:01:53.939> bottom<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.470> any<00:01:55.710> trailing

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the bottom so as not to get any trailing

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.450 
the bottom so as not to get any trailing
point<00:01:56.759> marks<00:01:57.149> through<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> wax<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.189> go

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
point marks through the wax you can go

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.399 
point marks through the wax you can go
over<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.790> as<00:01:59.939> often<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.229> more

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
over it as often as you like the more

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.929 
over it as often as you like the more
often<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.399> mixed<00:02:02.820> up

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
often you go over it the more mixed up

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.620 
often you go over it the more mixed up
it<00:02:03.060> becomes<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.009> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:06.479> make

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it becomes and if you go over it to make

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.630 
it becomes and if you go over it to make
it<00:02:06.810> liquid<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.500> warm<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.220> sort<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it liquid and warm and then sort of

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.180 
it liquid and warm and then sort of
swish<00:02:09.239> through<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:10.110> an<00:02:10.259> angle<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.830> can

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
swish through it at an angle you can

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.580 
swish through it at an angle you can
create<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> bit<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.090> direction

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
create a bit more direction

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
create a bit more direction
so<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.550> these<00:02:14.730> sort<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.380> oblique<00:02:16.610> paths

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
so you get these sort of oblique paths

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.920 
so you get these sort of oblique paths
of<00:02:18.380> movement<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> sky<00:02:20.450> now<00:02:21.450> using<00:02:21.750> two

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
of movement in the sky now using two

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.440 
of movement in the sky now using two
colors<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.739> olive<00:02:22.980> green<00:02:23.160> number<00:02:23.400> 23<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.300> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
colors the olive green number 23 and the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.920 
colors the olive green number 23 and the
brown<00:02:24.660> or<00:02:24.900> 45<00:02:25.380> sage<00:02:25.650> green<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.640> number<00:02:27.630> 14

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
brown or 45 sage green and number 14

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.580 
brown or 45 sage green and number 14
Brown<00:02:29.330> load<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.569> part<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.110> iron<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
Brown load that part of the iron and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.740 
Brown load that part of the iron and
then<00:02:31.680> smooth<00:02:32.190> gently<00:02:33.060> right<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.599> way<00:02:33.720> across

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
then smooth gently right the way across

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.400 
then smooth gently right the way across
the<00:02:34.140> card<00:02:34.410> back<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.040> across<00:02:35.910> again<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:37.230> that

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
the card back and across again so that

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.160 
the card back and across again so that
you<00:02:37.560> lay<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.370> color<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.970> at<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.959> same

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
you lay on the color and at the same

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.930 
you lay on the color and at the same
time<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.620> create<00:02:40.860> different<00:02:41.370> thicknesses<00:02:41.760> of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
time you create different thicknesses of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.970 
time you create different thicknesses of
that<00:02:42.090> color<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.959> gives<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.319> sort<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.620> depth

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that color so it gives a sort of depth

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.940 
that color so it gives a sort of depth
to<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.190> landscape<00:02:45.200> hold<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.380> card<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.830> your

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
to the landscape hold the card in your

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.250 
to the landscape hold the card in your
hand<00:02:47.220> when<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.790> do<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.060> dabbing<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.630> avoid

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
hand when you do the dabbing and avoid

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.990 
hand when you do the dabbing and avoid
touching<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.890> top<00:02:50.160> edge<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.730> iron

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
touching the top edge of the iron

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.020 
touching the top edge of the iron
otherwise<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.140> get<00:02:52.260> arc<00:02:52.470> marks<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.130> then<00:02:53.730> put

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
otherwise you get arc marks and then put

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.059 
otherwise you get arc marks and then put
in<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.390> color<00:02:54.720> harmony<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.440> add<00:02:55.620> colors

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
in the color harmony just add colors

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.590 
in the color harmony just add colors
that<00:02:56.220> are<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.489> sky<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.970> already<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
that are in the sky and already in the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.140 
that are in the sky and already in the
picture<00:02:57.989> like<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.260> brown<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.830> blue<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.940> sort

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
picture like the brown a blue the sort

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.960 
picture like the brown a blue the sort
of<00:03:00.209> Sri<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.900> pink<00:03:01.200> color<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.799> dab<00:03:02.459> those<00:03:02.730> on

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
of Sri see pink color and dab those on

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.210 
of Sri see pink color and dab those on
so<00:03:03.180> they<00:03:03.330> blend<00:03:03.660> into<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.080> foreground<00:03:04.470> this

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
so they blend into the foreground this

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.850 
so they blend into the foreground this
gives<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.549> far<00:03:05.760> better<00:03:05.910> color<00:03:06.269> harmony<00:03:06.860> then

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
gives a far better color harmony then

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.009 
gives a far better color harmony then
again<00:03:08.190> using<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.760> edge<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.330> iron<00:03:09.480> make

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
again using the edge of the iron make

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.630 
again using the edge of the iron make
sure<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.440> wax<00:03:10.680> doesn't<00:03:10.950> ribble<00:03:11.340> out<00:03:11.459> as

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
sure that wax doesn't ribble out as

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.220 
sure that wax doesn't ribble out as
you're<00:03:11.760> doing<00:03:11.849> this<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.299> clean<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.660> first<00:03:12.930> just

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
you're doing this so clean it first just

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.949 
you're doing this so clean it first just
slide<00:03:14.069> up<00:03:14.250> through<00:03:14.519> some<00:03:14.880> sort<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.660> random

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
slide up through some sort of random

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.580

colors of green and brown for the bird

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.910 
colors of green and brown for the bird
just<00:03:21.570> make<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> spot<00:03:22.200> remember<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.829> then

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
just make the spot remember and then

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.220 
just make the spot remember and then
flick<00:03:23.130> one<00:03:23.340> way<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.850> other<00:03:24.000> way<00:03:24.230> again

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
flick one way and the other way again

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.530 
flick one way and the other way again

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
end to make sure it's clean before you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.340 
end to make sure it's clean before you
start<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.459> for<00:03:29.819> these<00:03:29.940> flowers<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.780> as<00:03:30.900> random

as you can in doing the dots otherwise

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.650 
as you can in doing the dots otherwise
it<00:03:33.359> looks<00:03:33.569> a<00:03:33.840> little<00:03:33.959> bit<00:03:34.519> preconceived

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
it looks a little bit preconceived

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.539
