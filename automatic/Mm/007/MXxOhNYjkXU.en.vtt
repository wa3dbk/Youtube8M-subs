00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
weapon I don't use her very often so I

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.659

works<00:03:51.000> exactly<00:03:51.419> but<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.650> you're<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.069> fan<00:03:53.190> of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
works exactly but if you're a fan of

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.539 
works exactly but if you're a fan of
flame<00:03:53.790> weapons<00:03:54.269> then<00:03:55.079> I<00:03:55.470> think<00:03:55.919> Nadi<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.519> a

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
flame weapons then I think Nadi is a

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.970 
flame weapons then I think Nadi is a
good<00:03:56.819> choice<00:03:57.030> I'm<00:03:57.900> not<00:03:58.260> particularly<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.919> fan

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980

of lean weapons I like them but I

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.879 
of lean weapons I like them but I
actually<00:04:03.120> try<00:04:03.629> to<00:04:03.690> weave<00:04:04.079> them<00:04:04.379> out<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.680> mine

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889
