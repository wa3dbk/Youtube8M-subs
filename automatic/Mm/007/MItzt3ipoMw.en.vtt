00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.999 
bottom right over there will fill by
picking<00:01:49.030> up<00:01:49.119> green<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.689> red<00:01:49.840> energy<00:01:50.350> cubes<00:01:50.710> to

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
picking up green and red energy cubes to

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.130 
picking up green and red energy cubes to
stabilize<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.460> platforms<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.240> buy<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.630> some

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
stabilize the platforms and buy you some

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.109 
stabilize the platforms and buy you some
extra<00:01:53.560> time<00:01:53.950> alright<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:54.729> we're<00:01:54.850> going<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.030> get

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
extra time alright so we're going to get

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.249 
extra time alright so we're going to get
right<00:01:55.270> into<00:01:55.450> here<00:01:55.659> I'm<00:01:55.780> just<00:01:55.840> going<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.079> play<00:01:56.229> a

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
right into here I'm just going to play a

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.600 
right into here I'm just going to play a
little<00:01:56.409> bit<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> demo<00:01:56.920> here<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.430> guys

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
little bit of a demo here so you guys

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.490 
little bit of a demo here so you guys
can<00:01:57.729> see<00:01:57.939> it<00:01:58.240> does<00:01:58.420> not<00:01:58.570> move<00:01:58.780> until<00:01:59.049> I<00:01:59.229> touch

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
can see it does not move until I touch

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.080 
can see it does not move until I touch
screen<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.040> moving<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.490> direction<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:01.030> will

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
screen and moving in a direction it will

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.730 
screen and moving in a direction it will
continue<00:02:01.420> until<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.869> lift<00:02:02.170> my<00:02:02.229> finger<00:02:02.350> off<00:02:02.710> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
continue until I lift my finger off the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.490 
continue until I lift my finger off the
screen<00:02:03.189> so<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.759> starts<00:02:04.000> off<00:02:04.149> very<00:02:04.240> very<00:02:05.170> very

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
screen so it starts off very very very

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.190 
screen so it starts off very very very
slow<00:02:05.950> that's<00:02:06.790> one<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.270> cons<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.719> I<00:02:07.899> have

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
slow that's one of the cons that I have

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.410 
slow that's one of the cons that I have
about<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:08.709> game<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.190> like<00:02:09.820> I'm<00:02:10.000> going<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.209> use

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
about this game is like I'm going to use

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.449 
about this game is like I'm going to use
the<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.869> boosting<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.470> power<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:12.040> make<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.250> go

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
the the boosting the power to make it go

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.280 
the the boosting the power to make it go
a<00:02:12.489> little<00:02:12.640> bit<00:02:12.790> faster<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.329> I<00:02:13.540> would<00:02:14.019> wish<00:02:14.260> that

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
a little bit faster I I would wish that

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.020 
a little bit faster I I would wish that
it<00:02:14.590> would<00:02:14.799> start<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.190> little<00:02:15.370> bit<00:02:15.459> quicker<00:02:15.670> and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
it would start a little bit quicker and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.390 
it would start a little bit quicker and
wow<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.959> already<00:02:17.170> fell<00:02:17.440> off<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.799> edge<00:02:17.920> what<00:02:18.190> an

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
wow I already fell off the edge what an

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.819 
wow I already fell off the edge what an
epic<00:02:18.549> fail<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.239> anyway<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:20.140> think<00:02:20.590> if<00:02:20.709> it

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
epic fail but anyway I think if it

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.110 
epic fail but anyway I think if it
started<00:02:21.100> off<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> little<00:02:21.310> bit<00:02:21.549> faster<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.970> game

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
started off a little bit faster the game

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.220 
started off a little bit faster the game
would<00:02:22.269> be<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.420> little<00:02:22.690> bit<00:02:22.810> more<00:02:22.930> interesting

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
would be a little bit more interesting

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.770 
would be a little bit more interesting
it<00:02:23.709> does<00:02:23.980> get<00:02:24.280> more<00:02:24.730> fast-paced<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.329> you<00:02:25.600> get

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
it does get more fast-paced as you get

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.190 
it does get more fast-paced as you get
further<00:02:25.989> down<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:27.880> just<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.780> takes<00:02:29.079> a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
further down but it's just it takes a

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.720 
further down but it's just it takes a
while<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.590> get<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.799> that<00:02:30.040> point<00:02:30.250> like<00:02:30.370> see<00:02:30.640> I'm

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
while to get to that point like see I'm

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.860 
while to get to that point like see I'm
going<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.940> use<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.150> speed<00:02:31.390> up<00:02:31.510> thing<00:02:31.690> now

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
going to use the speed up thing now

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.780 
going to use the speed up thing now
maybe<00:02:32.410> I'm<00:02:32.680> not<00:02:32.890> very<00:02:33.040> skilled<00:02:33.370> maybe<00:02:33.640> I'm

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
maybe I'm not very skilled maybe I'm

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.009 
maybe I'm not very skilled maybe I'm
supposed<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.150> be<00:02:34.239> using<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.570> speed<00:02:34.780> up<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
supposed to be using the speed up the

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.210 
supposed to be using the speed up the
entire<00:02:35.230> way<00:02:35.410> I'm<00:02:35.590> going<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.739> pick<00:02:35.890> up<00:02:36.010> some

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
entire way I'm going to pick up some

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.890 
entire way I'm going to pick up some
energy<00:02:36.430> things<00:02:36.940> pick<00:02:37.239> up<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.480> thing<00:02:37.690> Oh

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
energy things pick up this thing Oh

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.320 
energy things pick up this thing Oh
picked<00:02:38.769> up<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.010> turbo<00:02:39.310> oh<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.489> like<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.090> turbo

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
picked up the turbo oh I like the turbo

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.880 
picked up the turbo oh I like the turbo
I've<00:02:40.569> never<00:02:40.720> gotten<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.050> turbo<00:02:41.349> before<00:02:41.680> and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
I've never gotten the turbo before and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.020 
I've never gotten the turbo before and
if<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.280> can<00:02:42.430> line<00:02:42.580> things

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
if you can line things

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.220 
if you can line things
where<00:02:43.240> you<00:02:43.300> can<00:02:43.390> follow<00:02:43.600> through<00:02:43.840> multiple

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
where you can follow through multiple

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.320 
where you can follow through multiple
holes<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.740> is<00:02:44.920> always<00:02:45.340> good<00:02:45.640> as<00:02:45.790> well<00:02:45.940> and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
holes that is always good as well and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.370 
holes that is always good as well and
I'm<00:02:46.569> going<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.780> do<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.260> for

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
I'm going to do this just for

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.130 
I'm going to do this just for
demonstration<00:02:47.650> purposes<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.550> guys<00:02:48.670> see<00:02:48.940> that

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
demonstration purposes you guys see that

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.809 
demonstration purposes you guys see that
that<00:02:50.140> thing<00:02:50.709> right<00:02:50.830> there<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.220> was<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.400> virus

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
that thing right there that was a virus

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.610 
that thing right there that was a virus
I<00:02:51.940> should<00:02:52.150> not<00:02:52.300> have<00:02:52.360> touched<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.959> because

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
I should not have touched that because

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.780 
I should not have touched that because
that<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:53.950> not<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.160> good<00:02:54.250> thing<00:02:54.400> I'm<00:02:54.640> going<00:02:54.730> to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
that is not a good thing I'm going to

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.160 
that is not a good thing I'm going to
touch<00:02:54.970> another<00:02:55.120> one<00:02:55.450> here<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:56.140> what

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
touch another one here and see what

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.170 
touch another one here and see what
happens<00:02:56.620> when<00:02:56.830> i'll<00:02:56.950> touch<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.370> energy

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
happens when i'll touch that energy

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.110 
happens when i'll touch that energy
drain<00:02:58.540> as<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.870> guys<00:02:59.020> can<00:02:59.200> see<00:02:59.260> as<00:03:00.120> probably

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
drain as you guys can see as probably

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.880 
drain as you guys can see as probably
see<00:03:01.330> in<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.600> bottom<00:03:01.690> right<00:03:01.959> corner<00:03:01.989> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
see in the bottom right corner the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.410 
see in the bottom right corner the
energy<00:03:03.250> has<00:03:03.370> gone<00:03:03.550> down<00:03:03.790> every<00:03:04.060> time<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.239> hit

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
energy has gone down every time I hit

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.690 
energy has gone down every time I hit
that<00:03:04.480> if<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:05.020> get<00:03:05.350> down<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.739> zero<00:03:06.010> energy<00:03:06.190> it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
that if I get down to zero energy it

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.580 
that if I get down to zero energy it
will<00:03:06.970> kill<00:03:07.209> me<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.840> get<00:03:07.989> three<00:03:08.260> lap<00:03:08.440> so

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
will kill me and you get three lap so
