00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.059
 sliding loop will not ask 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.490
 together with 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.450
 from the air loops so that there is not 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 holes show you two options 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.930
 sliding pique 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.050
 the first version of the classic but 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.360
 the free end of the thread here I have it two 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:44.489
 times wrapping around your finger 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:52.059
 1 2 I put the hook under the two threads and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:55.720
 pull out and then knit in 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:01:01.360
 in general, as already on the motive scheme, we 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.699
 usually it's a lifting loop and let's be 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.130
 Knit with crochets can be looped 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.280
 off the finger but still need to 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.620
 gently hold her because I link 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.440
 some number of single crochets 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.270
 to show something worth doing 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.700
 farther from this sliding loop in this 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 the number of bars is not important for us 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:30.060
 Well, let's say that I linked the necessary 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:36.329
 the number of columns without nakida now I 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:41.350
 connect with the beginning of our knitting 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:45.719
 so we do everything we hold 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.140
 joint loop scream whether lifting 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.080
 compound 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.860
 and now this sliding loop need 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.860
 tighten 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.610
 that is, we pull pretty strongly 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:12.660
 since there are two turns of force needed 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.150
 attach good well that's how you see even 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.800
 did not watch even though I 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.060
 took 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.720
 mercerized cotton ie thread 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.500
 thin and slippery to me in general is 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:33.150
 manages to be done with great difficulty 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:40.760
 here you can see that the holes are not the middle here 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.760
 we all have a hole we tightened it 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.239
 but I repeat once again that I took 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.220
 mercerized cotton 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.850
 it is a durable slippery thread but if you 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.739
 try to make a sliding loop 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.670
 of more fluffy not so you hardly and and 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.850
 tighten 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.480
 There wool acrylic with what addition 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.799
 otgadki so I'll show you another 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.340
 the way in which the sliding loop 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:20.120
 drags on 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:25.340
 from any yarn, I specifically took this 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:30.450
 bulky thread means doing the same but 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.299
 wrap once that is one turn 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.610
 it will be easier to tighten only 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.310
 that here is a nuance we grab 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.090
 not so that's how you do it when 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:47.100
 the classic way but a little bit with 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:52.320
 turn like this on and captured the worker 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.400
 thread and secured this whole 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.410
 the design is still pretty 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.000
 unstable but not bad either 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:07.410
 make an air loop and knit the posts 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.510
 without nakida or whatever it will be according to the picture 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.139
 in this case, just posts without 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.720
 nakida see for speed to carry 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:20.390
 it was all quick 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:25.580
 here is some amount we tied also 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:31.710
 we find lifting loops doing 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:35.669
 connecting it overturns 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.350
 our construction and also theory to me 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.820
 wheelbarrow also have to attach 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.520
 some effort 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:51.050
 but agree that in this case 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:55.380
 much less then there are two turns 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:05:00.360
 on such a yarn will be very 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.360
 difficult to fix the only 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.169
 lack of a sliding loop 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.169
 what if that's when we cut on a chain and 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.770
 tail tie in the first row we can 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.340
 immediately here elms cut it here this 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.910
 tail will need to fasten 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.169
 fasten properly 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.729
 do here a knot here 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:30.200
 and fill it up on the other side with us 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.200
 practically no hole 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:41.110
 you can pull up more, and that's so secure 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:45.470
 that there were no holes at all 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:49.010
 fasten here better with a needle that is so 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.910
 so that it was found but this 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.910
 sliding hinge
