00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
performance everything how kweli turned

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.000 
performance everything how kweli turned
I<00:00:44.750> like<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:45.899> better<00:00:46.200> than<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.590> Randalls

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I like these better than the Randalls

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.540 
I like these better than the Randalls
I've<00:00:47.129> ridden<00:00:47.370> both<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.940> lot<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.649> I<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:50.399> that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I've ridden both a lot and I think that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
I've ridden both a lot and I think that
these<00:00:50.670> are<00:00:50.730> more<00:00:50.969> responsive<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.750> turn

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
these are more responsive they turn

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.250 
these are more responsive they turn
better<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.420> around<00:00:54.570> these

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
better you know just all around these

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.770 
better you know just all around these
trucks<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.710> better<00:00:55.860> than<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> Randalls<00:00:56.780> all

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
trucks are better than the Randalls all

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.880 
trucks are better than the Randalls all
right<00:00:57.930> well<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.199> you're<00:00:58.350> considering<00:00:58.770> buying

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
right well if you're considering buying

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310 
right well if you're considering buying
these<00:00:59.340> trucks<00:00:59.640> they're<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.180> $50<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.289> set

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
these trucks they're about $50 for a set

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.770 
these trucks they're about $50 for a set
of<00:01:01.590> two<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.270> would<00:01:03.270> definitely<00:01:03.660> recommend

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
of two I would definitely recommend

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.260 
of two I would definitely recommend
buying<00:01:04.290> separate<00:01:04.920> bushings<00:01:05.309> because<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
buying separate bushings because the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
buying separate bushings because the
bushes<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.630> come<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.049> them<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.500> 90<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
bushes that come with them about 90 a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
bushes that come with them about 90 a
very<00:01:08.880> hard<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.420> good<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.780> turning<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:11.840> yeah

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
very hard not good for turning I yeah

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.750 
very hard not good for turning I yeah
they're<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> best<00:01:13.710> ones<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.580> fit

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
they're just not the best ones to fit

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
they're just not the best ones to fit
