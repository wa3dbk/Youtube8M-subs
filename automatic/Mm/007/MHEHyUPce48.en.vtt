Morgan Dollars you know the the Eagles

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.590 
Morgan Dollars you know the the Eagles
that<00:01:27.220> have<00:01:27.369> errors<00:01:27.820> you<00:01:28.060> know<00:01:28.180> things<00:01:28.450> like

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
that have errors you know things like

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.560 
that have errors you know things like
that<00:01:28.930> so<00:01:29.799> for<00:01:30.130> me<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:30.640> general<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.900> think<00:01:32.340> having

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that so for me in general I think having

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.660 
that so for me in general I think having
some<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.840> everything<00:01:35.290> is<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.220> best<00:01:36.430> policy

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
some of everything is the best policy

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.460 
some of everything is the best policy
but<00:01:37.119> that's<00:01:37.299> just<00:01:37.450> my<00:01:37.689> opinion<00:01:37.930> of<00:01:38.409> course

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
but that's just my opinion of course

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.999 
but that's just my opinion of course
there<00:01:39.250> are<00:01:39.430> those<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:41.170> strictly<00:01:41.619> for

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
there are those that go strictly for

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.980 
there are those that go strictly for
weight<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.400> want<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.119> get<00:01:43.240> their<00:01:43.420> metal<00:01:43.750> for

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
weight and want to get their metal for

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.539 
weight and want to get their metal for
the<00:01:44.020> lowest<00:01:44.350> possible<00:01:44.830> cost<00:01:45.250> per<00:01:46.210> ounce<00:01:46.509> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the lowest possible cost per ounce and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.630 
the lowest possible cost per ounce and
then<00:01:48.549> there's<00:01:48.880> are<00:01:49.180> those<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:50.189> want<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.369> get

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
then there's are those that want to get

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.830 
then there's are those that want to get
the<00:01:52.000> highest<00:01:52.330> quality<00:01:53.820> numismatics<00:01:54.820> for<00:01:55.540> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the highest quality numismatics for the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.200 
the highest quality numismatics for the
highest<00:01:57.509> investment<00:01:58.509> potential<00:01:59.520> on<00:02:00.520> those

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
highest investment potential on those

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.630 
highest investment potential on those
items<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.380> what<00:02:02.680> do<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.799> guys<00:02:02.920> think<00:02:02.979> tell<00:02:03.549> me

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.960 
I mean Buffalo rounds and silver bars
they've<00:02:54.400> been<00:02:54.520> around<00:02:54.700> forever<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:57.070> don't

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
they've been around forever and I don't

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.090 
they've been around forever and I don't
think<00:02:58.210> either<00:02:58.600> one<00:02:58.990> is<00:02:59.170> going<00:02:59.380> anywhere<00:02:59.710> but

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
think either one is going anywhere but

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.280 
think either one is going anywhere but
of<00:03:00.190> course<00:03:00.430> that's<00:03:00.610> just<00:03:00.760> my<00:03:01.030> opinion<00:03:01.290> then

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
of course that's just my opinion then

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.080 
of course that's just my opinion then
you<00:03:02.380> have<00:03:02.500> silver<00:03:02.950> eagles<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.430> middle

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
you have silver eagles in the middle

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.970 
you have silver eagles in the middle
there<00:03:04.240> there's<00:03:04.930> always<00:03:05.200> going<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.500> be<00:03:05.560> silver

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
there there's always going to be silver

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.530 
there there's always going to be silver
eagles<00:03:06.340> as<00:03:06.520> long<00:03:07.480> as<00:03:07.900> they<00:03:08.890> can<00:03:09.100> sell<00:03:09.540> 40

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
eagles as long as they can sell 40

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.630 
eagles as long as they can sell 40
million<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:11.020> year<00:03:11.050> plus<00:03:11.500> they're<00:03:12.190> always<00:03:12.370> going

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
million a year plus they're always going

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.380

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
to be there and actually even if it goes

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.449 
to be there and actually even if it goes
down<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:17.050> lot<00:03:17.740> they're<00:03:17.950> still<00:03:18.160> going<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.370> be

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
down a lot they're still going to be

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.800 
down a lot they're still going to be
there<00:03:18.490> because<00:03:19.560> no<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:20.830> selling<00:03:21.750> at<00:03:22.750> a

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
for those items and that's just how the

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.040 
for those items and that's just how the
cycle<00:04:10.570> goes<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.890> right<00:04:12.880> now<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.690> is<00:04:13.870> what
