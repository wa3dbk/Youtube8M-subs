00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
there are these two marbles that are
wanting<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.870> fed<00:00:55.050> right<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.680> they're

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
wanting to be fed right now so they're

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
wanting to be fed right now so they're
not<00:00:55.949> showing<00:00:56.340> off<00:00:56.520> real<00:00:57.140> pretty<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.699> are

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
not showing off real pretty but they are

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.610 
not showing off real pretty but they are
10<00:01:00.090> months<00:01:00.420> old<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> they've<00:01:01.289> been<00:01:01.440> breeding

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
10 months old and they've been breeding

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.100 
10 months old and they've been breeding
for<00:01:01.859> about<00:01:02.039> five<00:01:02.280> months<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.750> that's<00:01:03.899> why

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
for about five months so that's why

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.830 
for about five months so that's why
they're<00:01:04.290> still<00:01:04.500> pretty<00:01:04.680> small<00:01:05.240> if<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.510> were<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
they're still pretty small if I were to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.830 
they're still pretty small if I were to
separate<00:01:07.260> them<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.770> might<00:01:08.040> grow<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.840> little

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
separate them they might grow a little

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.120 
separate them they might grow a little
bit<00:01:09.960> faster<00:01:11.150> but<00:01:12.470> don't<00:01:13.470> plan<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.770> doing<00:01:13.979> that

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
bit faster but don't plan on doing that

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.800 
bit faster but don't plan on doing that
and<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.700> nine<00:01:17.700> pure<00:01:18.540> platinum
