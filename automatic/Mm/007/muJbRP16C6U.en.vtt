to push this button called clone what
clone<00:02:00.689> does<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> allows<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> pick<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
clone does is it allows you to pick a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.819 
clone does is it allows you to pick a
spot<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> photo<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.719> copy<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.350> spot<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
spot on the photo and copy that spot and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.370 
spot on the photo and copy that spot and
paste<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.549> directly<00:02:05.700> somewhere<00:02:06.360> else<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.290> I'm

going<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.590> make<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.890> brush<00:02:08.160> big<00:02:08.610> enough<00:02:08.879> to

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
going to make my brush big enough to

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.910 
going to make my brush big enough to
clone

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
clone

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.510 
clone
bigger<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:12.120> clone<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:13.020> these<00:02:13.860> bubbles

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
bigger to clone one of these bubbles

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.110 
bigger to clone one of these bubbles
okay<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.860> love<00:02:17.310> bigger<00:02:17.819> still<00:02:19.550> perfect<00:02:20.550> okay

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
okay so love bigger still perfect okay

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.320 
okay so love bigger still perfect okay
well<00:02:21.300> teeny<00:02:21.750> bit<00:02:21.870> bigger<00:02:22.050> okay<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:24.030> I'm<00:02:24.209> going

well teeny bit bigger okay so I'm going

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.320 
well teeny bit bigger okay so I'm going
to<00:02:24.390> take<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.630> right<00:02:24.780> here<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:26.069> then<00:02:26.190> click<00:02:26.489> ok

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
to take it right here and then click ok

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.050 
to take it right here and then click ok
now<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.590> accepted<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> spot

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
now it is accepted that that is the spot

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.610 
now it is accepted that that is the spot
I'm<00:02:30.180> cloning<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:31.020> put<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.380> in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
I'm cloning and I can put this in

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.860 
I'm cloning and I can put this in
wherever<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.340> want<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:32.910> maybe<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.209> want<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.569> bubble

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
wherever I want so maybe I want a bubble

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.949 
wherever I want so maybe I want a bubble
right<00:02:34.050> there<00:02:34.520> okay<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.209> push<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.569> once<00:02:36.750> it

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
right there okay if you push it once it

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.570 
right there okay if you push it once it
kind<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.350> clones<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.069> if<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.250> push<00:02:38.430> it

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
kind of clones it in but if you push it

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.430 
kind of clones it in but if you push it
a<00:02:38.640> couple<00:02:38.819> times<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.390> gets<00:02:39.480> more<00:02:39.750> distinct<00:02:40.319> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
a couple times it gets more distinct and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.530 
a couple times it gets more distinct and
darker<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.489> really<00:02:41.670> want<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.090> bubble<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
darker so we really want that bubble to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.910 
darker so we really want that bubble to
be<00:02:42.660> more<00:02:42.810> distinct<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.350> clicked<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.739> about

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
be more distinct so I clicked it about

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.250 
be more distinct so I clicked it about
three<00:02:44.220> times<00:02:44.250> now<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.239> don't<00:02:45.720> want<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.959> same

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
three times now I don't want that same

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.350 
three times now I don't want that same
bubble<00:02:46.680> everywhere<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.459> I'm<00:02:47.970> going<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.239> make

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
bubble everywhere so I'm going to make

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.390 
bubble everywhere so I'm going to make
my<00:02:48.569> brush<00:02:48.840> size<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.080> little<00:02:49.290> smaller<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:50.250> get

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
my brush size a little smaller to get

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.210 
my brush size a little smaller to get
this<00:02:50.610> bubble<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:52.019> what<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.380> need<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.680> do<00:02:52.890> is

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
this bubble but what you need to do is

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.340 
this bubble but what you need to do is
if<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> new<00:02:54.360> source<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.170> you're

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
if you have a new source that you're

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.960 
if you have a new source that you're
going<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.799> new<00:02:56.040> click<00:02:56.280> source<00:02:56.670> because

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
going to a new click source because

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.030 
going to a new click source because
we're<00:02:57.120> going<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.269> click<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.410> pick<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
we're going to click and it can pick a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.740 
we're going to click and it can pick a
different<00:02:59.340> bubbles<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.150> not<00:03:00.239> pasting

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
different bubbles so it's not pasting

darker okay so i can just kind of add

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.970 
darker okay so i can just kind of add
more<00:03:11.610> bubbles<00:03:12.060> where<00:03:12.390> i<00:03:12.420> want<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:15.680> but<00:03:16.680> what<00:03:16.859> it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
more bubbles where i want to but what it

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
more bubbles where i want to but what it
does<00:03:17.160> here<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:18.150> see<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.630> relationship

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
does here is it see the relationship

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.710 
does here is it see the relationship
between<00:03:19.320> this<00:03:19.829> one<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.670> one<00:03:20.730> they<00:03:21.510> say

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
between this one and this one they say

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.300 
between this one and this one they say
that<00:03:21.750> same<00:03:22.109> distance<00:03:22.500> apart<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:23.160> I'm

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
that same distance apart so if I'm

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.460 
that same distance apart so if I'm
cloning<00:03:23.820> it's<00:03:24.030> going<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.570> take<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.019> copy<00:03:25.260> of

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
cloning it's going to take the copy of

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.949 
cloning it's going to take the copy of
whatever's<00:03:25.799> here<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.400> put<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.970> here<00:03:27.120> does

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
whatever's here and put it here does

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.680 
whatever's here and put it here does
that<00:03:28.109> make<00:03:28.290> sense<00:03:28.320> so<00:03:29.310> if<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.640> want<00:03:30.359> something

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
that make sense so if I want something

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.360 
that make sense so if I want something
specifically<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.500> need<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.739> start<00:03:32.040> over<00:03:32.340> again

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
specifically I need to start over again

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.090 
specifically I need to start over again
and<00:03:32.940> clone<00:03:33.600> exactly<00:03:34.200> what<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.590> i'm<00:03:34.739> looking

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
and clone exactly what it is i'm looking

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.650 
and clone exactly what it is i'm looking
for<00:03:35.400> like<00:03:35.430> gonna<00:03:35.910> make<00:03:36.090> my<00:03:36.209> brush<00:03:36.480> bigger

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
for like gonna make my brush bigger

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
looks like a better shot because bubbles

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.539 
looks like a better shot because bubbles
are<00:03:52.290> something<00:03:52.560> that's<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.829> little<00:03:52.980> bit<00:03:53.220> tricky

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
are something that's a little bit tricky

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.789 
can apply burning burning makes your
picture<00:04:03.390> darker<00:04:03.870> around<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.170> edges<00:04:04.350> and

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
picture darker around the edges and

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.050 
picture darker around the edges and
there's<00:04:04.980> an<00:04:05.130> effect<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.640> here<00:04:05.850> called

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
however burning allows you to do it

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.930 
however burning allows you to do it
yourself<00:04:10.319> where<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.739> want<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.639> instead<00:04:11.850> of

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
yourself where you want it so instead of

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.240 
yourself where you want it so instead of
darkening<00:04:12.480> around<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.870> whole<00:04:13.079> photo<00:04:13.440> since

darkening around the whole photo since
