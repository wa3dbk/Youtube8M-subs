104<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.550> keyboard<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.150> almost<00:00:27.869> identical<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
104 this keyboard is almost identical to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.859 
104 this keyboard is almost identical to
the<00:00:28.740> customizer<00:00:29.220> 104<00:00:29.760> except<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.750> you'll

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the customizer 104 except that you'll

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.690 
the customizer 104 except that you'll
notice<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.470> casing<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.579> bit

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
notice the casing is a little bit

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.970 
notice the casing is a little bit
smaller<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.239> border<00:00:33.690> around<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.559> actual

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
smaller the border around the actual

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.420 
smaller the border around the actual
keys<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.579> less<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.200> takes<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.680> less<00:00:38.219> space

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
keys is less so it takes up less space

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.000 
keys is less so it takes up less space
on<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.120> desk<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.930> therefore<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.860> why

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
on your desk and therefore that's why

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850 
on your desk and therefore that's why
they<00:00:41.190> call<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> space<00:00:42.090> saver<00:00:42.680> it's<00:00:43.680> kind

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
they call it the space saver it's kind

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.459 
they call it the space saver it's kind
of<00:00:43.890> nice<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> little<00:00:44.610> bit<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of nice to have a little bit of a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.650 
of nice to have a little bit of a
slimmer<00:00:46.890> smaller<00:00:47.219> keyboard<00:00:47.879> especially<00:00:48.600> if

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
slimmer smaller keyboard especially if

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.760 
slimmer smaller keyboard especially if
you<00:00:48.750> use<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> mouse<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> lot<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.590> your

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
you use the mouse a lot because your

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
you use the mouse a lot because your
mouse<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:51.059> bit<00:00:51.149> closer<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
mouse is a little bit closer to you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.600 
mouse is a little bit closer to you
which<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.309> bit<00:00:53.460> more

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
which can be you know a little bit more

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.600 
which can be you know a little bit more
comfortable<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> keys<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.280> does

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
comfortable but as for the keys it does

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.250 
comfortable but as for the keys it does
have<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> buckling<00:00:57.300> spring<00:00:57.570> technology<00:00:57.809> let

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
have the buckling spring technology let

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
have the buckling spring technology let
me<00:00:58.379> type<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.760> sense<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
me type on it so you can get a sense of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
me type on it so you can get a sense of
how<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> sounds<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.930> feels<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.590> got<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> nice

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
how it sounds and feels it's got a nice

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:13.280 
how it sounds and feels it's got a nice
tactile<00:01:02.520> feel<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:11.630> um<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.990> got<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
tactile feel to it so um it's got a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.730 
tactile feel to it so um it's got a
clicky<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.430> feel<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.350> I<00:01:16.350> really

clicky you know feel to it and I really

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.990 
clicky you know feel to it and I really
highly<00:01:16.920> recommend<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.430> buckling<00:01:17.729> spring

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
highly recommend the buckling spring

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490 
highly recommend the buckling spring
technology<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.720> keyboards<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.350> they've

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
technology for keyboards I think they've

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620 
technology for keyboards I think they've
got<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> best<00:01:20.070> feel<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.820> any<00:01:21.150> keyboard<00:01:21.509> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
got the best feel of any keyboard that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.010 
got the best feel of any keyboard that
I've<00:01:21.750> tried<00:01:22.020> before<00:01:22.729> let<00:01:23.729> me<00:01:23.820> go<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> little

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
bit and you can see how it looks on my

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.510 
bit and you can see how it looks on my
desk<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:27.720> particular<00:01:28.229> space<00:01:28.470> saver<00:01:28.950> people

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520

I<00:01:29.670> mean<00:01:29.820> yeah<00:01:30.000> keyboard<00:01:30.360> comes<00:01:31.259> also<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950

black<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.610> grey<00:01:36.090> keys<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.600> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
black with the grey keys because it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390 
black with the grey keys because it

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.390 
IBM model M the IBM model M keyboard I
think<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.260> about<00:02:26.440> five<00:02:26.650> pounds<00:02:26.890> or<00:02:27.160> maybe<00:02:27.310> even

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
think is about five pounds or maybe even

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.150 
think is about five pounds or maybe even
over<00:02:27.700> five<00:02:27.970> pounds<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:29.319> one<00:02:29.470> has<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.620> you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
over five pounds so that one has a you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.670 
over five pounds so that one has a you
know<00:02:30.280> super<00:02:30.610> sturdy<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.180> solid<00:02:31.390> feel<00:02:31.750> of

know super sturdy and solid feel of

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.930 
know super sturdy and solid feel of
course<00:02:32.860> they<00:02:33.010> don't<00:02:33.100> make<00:02:33.280> those<00:02:33.430> exactly

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
course they don't make those exactly

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.050 
course they don't make those exactly
anymore<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.600> have<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.989> find<00:02:35.470> old<00:02:35.769> ones

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
anymore so you have to find old ones

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.780 
anymore so you have to find old ones
they<00:02:37.060> only<00:02:37.239> made<00:02:37.450> those<00:02:37.660> from<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.040> mid<00:02:39.220> 80s<00:02:39.549> to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
they only made those from the mid 80s to

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.090 
they only made those from the mid 80s to
you<00:02:40.030> know<00:02:40.120> mid<00:02:40.299> 90s<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:40.989> but<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.980> know

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
you know mid 90s or so but you know

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.520 
you know mid 90s or so but you know
these<00:02:42.310> are<00:02:42.370> roughly<00:02:43.299> equivalent<00:02:43.540> made<00:02:44.260> by<00:02:44.470> the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
these are roughly equivalent made by the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.630 
these are roughly equivalent made by the
same<00:02:45.160> company

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
same company

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.770

well not the same company but the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.839 
well not the same company but the

the buckling spring keyboards now they

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.550 
the buckling spring keyboards now they
actually<00:02:51.160> acquired<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.360> lot<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.140> tooling

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
actually acquired a lot of the tooling

and<00:03:58.720> then<00:03:59.319> I'm<00:03:59.440> going<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.889> also<00:04:00.100> use<00:04:00.639> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
and then I'm going to also use the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.870 
and then I'm going to also use the
automatic<00:04:01.540> volume<00:04:01.959> adjustment<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.310> the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
automatic volume adjustment so that the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.370 
automatic volume adjustment so that the
audio<00:04:04.359> is<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:04.510> little<00:04:04.780> bit<00:04:04.870> louder<00:04:05.019> you'll

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
audio is a little bit louder you'll

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.020 
audio is a little bit louder you'll
probably<00:04:05.500> notice<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:06.040> audio<00:04:06.280> sounds<00:04:06.609> really

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
probably notice the audio sounds really

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.839 
probably notice the audio sounds really
nice<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.540> crisp<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:07.989> loud<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:09.189> iPhone<00:04:09.489> 3GS

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
nice and crisp and loud the iPhone 3GS

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.789 
nice and crisp and loud the iPhone 3GS
does<00:04:10.090> not<00:04:10.330> give<00:04:10.629> you<00:04:10.780> audio<00:04:10.959> like<00:04:11.319> this<00:04:11.530> right

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
does not give you audio like this right

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.250 
does not give you audio like this right
out<00:04:11.920> of<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.189> you<00:04:12.610> know

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
out of the you know

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.979 
out of the you know
right<00:04:13.379> out-of-the-box<00:04:13.530> stock<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.640> I'm<00:04:15.090> going

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
right out-of-the-box stock so I'm going

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.170 
right out-of-the-box stock so I'm going
to<00:04:16.079> process<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.739> little<00:04:16.889> bit<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.280> I'm<00:04:17.970> using

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
to process it a little bit and I'm using

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.140 
to process it a little bit and I'm using
an<00:04:18.389> application<00:04:18.600> that's<00:04:19.320> free<00:04:19.709> called<00:04:20.400> MPEG

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
an application that's free called MPEG

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.670 
an application that's free called MPEG
stream<00:04:21.780> clip<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.790> you<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.660> download<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.229> at

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
stream clip and you can download that at

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.350 
stream clip and you can download that at
I<00:04:25.979> believe<00:04:26.490> it's<00:04:26.669> squared<00:04:27.419> by<00:04:28.260> squared<00:04:29.010> v<00:04:29.760> so

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
I believe it's squared by squared v so

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.310 
I believe it's squared by squared v so
squared<00:04:30.840> then<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.800> number<00:04:32.039> five<00:04:32.250> comm<00:04:33.320> it's

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
squared then the number five comm it's

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.230 
squared then the number five comm it's
pretty<00:04:34.560> easy<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.830> do<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.880> just<00:04:36.060> basically

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
pretty easy to do and I just basically

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.629 
pretty easy to do and I just basically
save<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.930> video<00:04:37.169> out<00:04:37.380> with<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:39.050> h.264<00:04:40.050> codec

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
save the video out with the h.264 codec

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.090 
save the video out with the h.264 codec
and<00:04:41.639> I<00:04:42.630> use<00:04:42.930> and<00:04:43.199> then<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.410> just<00:04:43.680> adjust<00:04:43.979> the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
and I use and then I just adjust the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.810 
and I use and then I just adjust the
audio<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:44.610> it's<00:04:44.729> got<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.630> auto<00:04:45.810> auto<00:04:46.820> volume

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
audio so it's got the auto auto volume

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.310 
audio so it's got the auto auto volume
adjustment<00:04:48.300> which<00:04:48.449> yields<00:04:48.960> for<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.169> much

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
adjustment which yields for a much

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.270 
adjustment which yields for a much
better<00:04:49.470> audio<00:04:49.830> I<00:04:50.120> will<00:04:51.120> leave<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:52.070> with<00:04:53.070> this

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
better audio I will leave you with this

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.490 
better audio I will leave you with this
on<00:04:53.789> this<00:04:53.940> video<00:04:54.180> with<00:04:54.330> me<00:04:54.479> typing<00:04:54.900> let<00:04:55.320> me<00:04:55.380> get
