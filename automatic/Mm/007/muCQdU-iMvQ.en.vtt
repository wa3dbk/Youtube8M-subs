it's what was left the miners would call

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.710 
it's what was left the miners would call
this<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.169> final<00:00:31.619> cut<00:00:32.090> when<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.210> mine<00:00:33.480> this

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
this the final cut when they mine this

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.240 
this the final cut when they mine this
is<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.050> hole<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.530> left<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> coal

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
is the hole that was left from the coal

that's<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.480> natural<00:00:54.630> progress<00:00:54.990> that<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.590> here

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that's a natural progress that was here

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
that's a natural progress that was here
hundreds<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.850> years<00:00:57.000> ago<00:00:57.240> it's<00:00:57.540> called<00:00:57.780> a

hundreds of years ago it's called a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.230 
hundreds of years ago it's called a

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
kinds of grasses that are there they

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.349 
kinds of grasses that are there they
come<00:01:03.330> back<00:01:03.510> every<00:01:03.780> year<00:01:03.810> we<00:01:04.969> we<00:01:05.969> built

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:06.359 
come back every year we we built

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:09.620 
come back every year we we built
literally<00:01:07.079> and<00:01:07.350> restored<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.219> wetlands<00:01:08.759> we

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
literally and restored to wetlands we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.700 
literally and restored to wetlands we
start<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> project<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.740> about<00:01:10.979> 2003<00:01:11.969> and<00:01:12.710> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
start that project in about 2003 and it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.179 
start that project in about 2003 and it
had<00:01:13.890> been<00:01:14.070> farmed<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> had<00:01:15.119> been<00:01:15.299> mined<00:01:16.189> and

had been farmed it had been mined and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.130 
had been farmed it had been mined and
when<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.789> built<00:01:17.999> the<00:01:18.119> dam<00:01:18.329> we<00:01:18.570> let<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.899> water

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
when we built the dam we let the water

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200 
when we built the dam we let the water
fill<00:01:19.409> up<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.280> was<00:01:20.429> in<00:01:20.579> the<00:01:20.670> middle<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> summer

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
fill up it was in the middle of summer

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
fill up it was in the middle of summer
it<00:01:21.479> looked<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.350> looked<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.859> open<00:01:23.460> dirt<00:01:23.670> what
