00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.139
 Y 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.210
 Hello Today I'll share 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.889
 how did I recreate this sweater 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.090
 which is inspired by the designer 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.090
 christopher kane 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.380
 you can use a sweater that you already have 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.509
 or how do I make a new one use the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.730
 same pattern and follow the same steps 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.470
 that in the video of the roses sweater if 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.689
 they have not seen it I leave the link in the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.689
 description box and you have to admit 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.940
 having my sweater put it on the mannequin 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 and it was marking the space where the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.559
 hollow embroidered application is used 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.559
 that I will put as a guide to draw 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.770
 then I put the sweater on a surface 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.050
 flat folding the sleeve very well by 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.890
 half and rectifying that the shape of 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:07.530
 hollow this uniform and aesthetic 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.530
 Well, pins around and cut it 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.200
 in total the little circle that I cut him 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.950
 It was 12 centimeters long and 6 and a half 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.950
 for each side 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.270
 to give it finished in the hole you can 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.480
 put a video or fold and pass a 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.620
 seam or as in this case using 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.900
 glues for this I'm bending the 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.500
 in front of a fabric centimeter and subject 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.500
 with pins 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.110
 and how is the embroidered app here 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:48.119
 the use of the glue will not be noticed 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.770
 a little carton below and I start 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.770
 paste the fold of a centimeter 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.259
 my love 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.330
 When I finish I put the sweater back on 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.649
 the mannequin and I'm arranging the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.649
 applications with pins 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.980
 good 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.349
 how my applications did not reach 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.569
 joining I started folding the fabric doing 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.230
 some folds that made the circle 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.230
 smaller 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.050
 and as an extra detail use the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.970
 chain types that I already had around here 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.670
 just like the embroidered apps 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.060
 Loose hold them using the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.060
 pins 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.440
 I'm looking for a way to accommodate the 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:13.290
 way that I like the most 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:15.450
 once he was left behind 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.760
 then with transparent threads and a 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.379
 very thin needle I was taking all the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.810
 outer and inner edge of the 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.469
 applications as well as each end of 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.469
 the chains 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.189
 to harass them I went putting the needle 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.920
 holding a tiny part of the sweater 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:36.360
 and at the time of raising the needle held 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.360
 a part of the application 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.180
 when I had little thread on the needle 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.190
 made three knots getting the needle 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.069
 the circle of the thread before closing the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.270
 stitch 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.640
 ah 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.160
 ah 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.720
 and already with that I continued it until 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.970
 finish both contours of the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.690
 applications as well as the ends of 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.690
 each chain 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.640
 and me 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.980
 and anything that you like or that 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.980
 always want you can always create it 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:22.069
 gifts 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.289
 no hardware 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:42.349
 if not 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.349
 It was putter children
