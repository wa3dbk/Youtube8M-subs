00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.240 
we didn't know it could be a theme but
it<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.570> um<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.140> also<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.619> splinter

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it is um we also don't see splinter

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.520 
it is um we also don't see splinter
anywhere<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.969> also<00:01:57.299> tons<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.840> lens<00:01:58.020> flare

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
anywhere in this also tons of lens flare

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.920 
anywhere in this also tons of lens flare
now<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.130> probably<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.640> use<00:01:59.850> from<00:02:00.420> TGR

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
now that's probably in the use from TGR

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.830 
now that's probably in the use from TGR
I<00:02:00.960> yeah<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.740> actually<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> design

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
I yeah that's actually in all the design

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.719 
I yeah that's actually in all the design
that's<00:02:04.020> changed<00:02:04.560> since<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.890> first<00:02:04.920> series<00:02:05.549> in

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that's changed since the first series in

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.380 
that's changed since the first series in
this<00:02:05.880> one

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this one

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.839 
this one
that's<00:02:06.960> strikingly<00:02:07.829> similar

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that's strikingly similar

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.099 
that's strikingly similar
um<00:02:09.409> so<00:02:10.409> there's<00:02:11.629> eternal<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.719> think<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:12.959> leave

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.109 
um so there's eternal I think it's leave

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.530 
um so there's eternal I think it's leave
