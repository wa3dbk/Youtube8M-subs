are<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> older<00:00:31.260> releases<00:00:31.740> from<00:00:32.279> about

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
are one of the older releases from about

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.020 
are one of the older releases from about
four<00:00:33.600> years<00:00:33.930> ago<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.350> believe<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.280> they<00:00:35.820> don't

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
four years ago I believe so they don't

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.920 
four years ago I believe so they don't
have<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.860> MU<00:00:37.860> hoses<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.820> cut<00:00:39.270> levers<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
have the MU hoses and cut levers and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.790 
have the MU hoses and cut levers and
stuff<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.920> detailing<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.760> good<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.800> one

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
stuff but the detailing is good and one

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.080 
stuff but the detailing is good and one
neat<00:00:44.070> thing<00:00:44.399> about<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:47.719> this<00:00:48.719> model<00:00:50.090> well

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
neat thing about this this model well

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.229 
neat thing about this this model well
it's<00:00:51.390> sort<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.809> neat<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.590> sort<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> not

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
it's sort of neat but it's sort of not

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.990 
it's sort of neat but it's sort of not
the<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.420> after<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.050> wired<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.160> lights<00:00:56.520> they

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the way after and wired the lights they

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.020 
the way after and wired the lights they
wired<00:00:57.329> them<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> series<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.559> believe<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
wired them in series I believe with the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.329 
wired them in series I believe with the
motors<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.219> on<00:01:02.219> DC<00:01:02.789> control<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> allows<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
motors and on DC control this allows you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.100 
motors and on DC control this allows you
to<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.840> full<00:01:06.840> bright<00:01:07.909> lights<00:01:08.909> without<00:01:09.659> even

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
to get full bright lights without even

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.620 
to get full bright lights without even
moving<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.650> locomotive<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.390> see

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
moving the locomotive as you can see

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.580 
moving the locomotive as you can see
right<00:01:12.840> now<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:14.220> problem<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:16.350> they

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
right now the problem is is because they

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.060 
right now the problem is is because they
did<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.070> way<00:01:17.390> they<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.869> run<00:01:19.229> with

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
did it this way they will not run with

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.719 
did it this way they will not run with
any<00:01:20.369> other<00:01:20.610> unit<00:01:21.830> okay<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.250> let's<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.670> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
any other unit okay so now let's do a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.469 
any other unit okay so now let's do a
close<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:25.520> these<00:01:26.520> there's<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> couple<00:01:27.270> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
close up these there's a couple of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.880 
close up these there's a couple of
differences<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.850> noticed<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.890> it's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
differences that I just noticed and it's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.450 
differences that I just noticed and it's
going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.400> renumber<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:34.439> last<00:01:34.920> unit

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
going to make renumber the last unit

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.330 
going to make renumber the last unit
which<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> an<00:01:35.970> unnumbered<00:01:36.390> unit<00:01:37.020> after<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
which is an unnumbered unit after and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
which is an unnumbered unit after and
only<00:01:38.640> release<00:01:39.090> two<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.540> these<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.930> numbers

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
only release two of these with numbers

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.730 
only release two of these with numbers
and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.159> did<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.490> unnumbered<00:01:41.909> unit<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
and then they did an unnumbered unit and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.190 
and then they did an unnumbered unit and
the<00:01:43.740> problem<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.640> no<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.630> makes<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.079> correct

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the problem is no one makes a correct

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.719 
the problem is no one makes a correct
decal<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.159> sure<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.640> I'm

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
decal for this so I'm not sure what I'm

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.230 
decal for this so I'm not sure what I'm
gonna<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:52.140> anyway<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.799> noticed<00:01:53.670> one

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
gonna do but anyway I noticed one

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.039 
gonna do but anyway I noticed one
difference<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:55.350> sure<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.509> if<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
difference for sure and if you see the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.310 
difference for sure and if you see the
SD<00:01:58.560> 70<00:01:59.219> down<00:01:59.490> there<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.719> black<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.880> this

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
SD 70 down there it is black on this

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.609 
SD 70 down there it is black on this
25:57

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
25:57

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.050 
25:57
and<00:02:05.840> when<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:08.009> next<00:02:08.340> unit<00:02:08.520> which<00:02:08.879> is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and when we go to the next unit which is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.339 
and when we go to the next unit which is
25<00:02:09.569> 72<00:02:10.580> you'll<00:02:11.580> notice<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.209> white<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
25 72 you'll notice it's white in it

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.170 
25 72 you'll notice it's white in it
so<00:02:13.469> it<00:02:13.680> looks<00:02:13.859> like<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.219> slightly<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:15.090> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so it looks like it's slightly in a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.459 
so it looks like it's slightly in a
different<00:02:15.569> spot<00:02:17.120> let's<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.359> just<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.200> close

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
different spot let's do a just a close

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.379 
different spot let's do a just a close
up<00:02:19.769> here<00:02:20.189> with<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> fuel<00:02:20.999> tank<00:02:23.090> these<00:02:24.090> are<00:02:24.299> the

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
up here with a fuel tank these are the

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:32.270 
up here with a fuel tank these are the
radial<00:02:25.370> HTC<00:02:26.370> -<00:02:27.359> our<00:02:27.719> trucks<00:02:30.620> few<00:02:31.620> differences

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
radial HTC - our trucks few differences

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.050 
radial HTC - our trucks few differences
from<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.579> standard<00:02:33.920> conventional<00:02:34.920> like<00:02:35.280> 50

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
from the standard conventional like 50

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.459 
from the standard conventional like 50

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.640 
series 60 series 40 series the way this
cab<00:02:40.829> this<00:02:41.730> bulges<00:02:42.540> right<00:02:42.810> here<00:02:43.169> and<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.349> believe

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
cab this bulges right here and I believe

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.289 
cab this bulges right here and I believe
it<00:02:43.859> has<00:02:44.040> something<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.549> do<00:02:44.760> with<00:02:44.790> either<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
it has something to do with either the

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.979 
it has something to do with either the
cab<00:02:45.510> signaling<00:02:46.290> or<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.639> computer<00:02:48.510> control

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
cab signaling or the computer control

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.899 
cab signaling or the computer control
system<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.709> I'm<00:02:49.769> not<00:02:49.950> sure<00:02:50.159> exactly<00:02:50.549> what

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
system and I'm not sure exactly what

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.740 
system and I'm not sure exactly what
this<00:02:51.060> box<00:02:51.389> is<00:02:51.799> here<00:02:52.849> but<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:53.909> think<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.359> has<00:02:54.540> to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
this box is here but I think it has to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.030 
this box is here but I think it has to
do<00:02:54.900> with<00:02:55.079> one<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.709> those<00:02:55.859> things<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.730> well<00:02:58.040> and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
do with one of those things as well and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.819 
do with one of those things as well and
you'll<00:02:59.219> also<00:02:59.400> notice<00:02:59.669> that<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.750> hand<00:03:01.560> rail

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
you'll also notice that the hand rail

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.539 
you'll also notice that the hand rail
does<00:03:02.819> not<00:03:03.060> go<00:03:03.359> into<00:03:03.689> the<00:03:03.840> cab<00:03:04.199> like<00:03:05.129> it<00:03:05.310> does<00:03:05.519> on

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
does not go into the cab like it does on

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.409 
does not go into the cab like it does on
the<00:03:06.120> 50<00:03:06.510> series<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.379> 60<00:03:08.069> series<00:03:08.419> locomotives

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
the 50 series and 60 series locomotives

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:15.439 
the 50 series and 60 series locomotives
so<00:03:10.349> it's<00:03:10.590> sort<00:03:10.949> of<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.250> isolated<00:03:13.549> for<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.579> quieter

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:15.449 
so it's sort of a isolated for a quieter

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:21.030 
so it's sort of a isolated for a quieter
ride

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.949 

anyway<00:03:21.849> it<00:03:22.060> has<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.940> front<00:03:25.269> dynamic

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
anyway it has the the front dynamic

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.809 
anyway it has the the front dynamic
brakes<00:03:26.290> like<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.220> 60<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.760> 50<00:03:28.120> series<00:03:29.819> has

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
brakes like the 60 and 50 series has

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:39.449 
brakes like the 60 and 50 series has
very<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:35.879> lot<00:03:36.879> of<00:03:37.140> similarities<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:39.250> other

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
very a lot of similarities the other

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.460 
very a lot of similarities the other
thing<00:03:39.849> that's<00:03:40.030> slightly<00:03:40.390> different<00:03:40.780> between

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
thing that's slightly different between

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.949 
thing that's slightly different between
this<00:03:41.680> model<00:03:42.040> in<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> 60<00:03:42.849> series<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.480> this<00:03:43.660> top

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
this model in the 60 series is this top

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.339 
this model in the 60 series is this top
cover<00:03:44.319> is<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:45.250> little<00:03:45.519> lower<00:03:45.989> you'll<00:03:46.989> notice

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
cover is a little lower you'll notice

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.390 
cover is a little lower you'll notice
there's<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.769> exhaust<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.549> turbo<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:50.400> you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
there's the exhaust and turbo and you

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.460 
there's the exhaust and turbo and you
can<00:03:51.579> see<00:03:51.760> how<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.090> drops<00:03:52.420> down<00:03:52.659> a<00:03:52.900> little<00:03:53.230> bit

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
can see how it drops down a little bit

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.569 
can see how it drops down a little bit
right<00:03:53.709> there<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.319> trait<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:57.069> 70

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
right there that is a trait of a 70

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:06.500 
right there that is a trait of a 70
series<00:03:58.000> locomotive<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:03.150> moving<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.299> down<00:04:04.629> to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
series locomotive and moving on down to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:14.190 
series locomotive and moving on down to
2572<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.910> was<00:04:13.150> what<00:04:13.359> I<00:04:13.390> was<00:04:13.569> talking<00:04:14.109> about

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
2572 that was what I was talking about

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.759 
2572 that was what I was talking about
with<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:15.299> yes<00:04:16.299> T<00:04:16.510> 70<00:04:16.959> down<00:04:17.229> there<00:04:17.500> I'm<00:04:17.620> gonna

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
with the yes T 70 down there I'm gonna

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.060 
with the yes T 70 down there I'm gonna
spin<00:04:18.160> around<00:04:18.190> for<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.880> better<00:04:19.209> angle<00:04:20.039> so<00:04:21.039> you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
spin around for a better angle so you

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.510 
spin around for a better angle so you
can<00:04:21.190> see<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:21.669> better<00:04:22.680> okay<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.070> from<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
can see it better okay and from the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.680 
can see it better okay and from the
other<00:04:24.729> angle<00:04:26.310> now<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.340> better<00:04:27.820> close<00:04:28.240> up<00:04:28.510> of

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
other angle now a better close up of

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.969 
other angle now a better close up of
that<00:04:28.750> SD<00:04:29.440> 70<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.190> white<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:32.380> now<00:04:32.560> I'll<00:04:32.740> have<00:04:32.950> to

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
that SD 70 and white so now I'll have to

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.210 
that SD 70 and white so now I'll have to
look<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.490> see<00:04:33.550> which<00:04:33.880> ones<00:04:34.180> were<00:04:34.389> different

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
look and see which ones were different

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.300 
look and see which ones were different
this<00:04:36.220> also<00:04:36.460> has<00:04:36.880> cab<00:04:37.289> interior<00:04:38.289> you<00:04:38.800> can<00:04:39.010> kind

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
this also has cab interior you can kind

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.600 
this also has cab interior you can kind
of<00:04:39.400> see<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.729> through<00:04:39.970> there<00:04:40.300> on<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:42.310> other

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
of see it through there on the other

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.760 
of see it through there on the other
unit<00:04:43.060> you<00:04:43.180> could<00:04:43.360> see<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.660> control<00:04:44.110> stand<00:04:44.500> but

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
unit you could see the control stand but

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.779 
unit you could see the control stand but
it's<00:04:44.919> it's<00:04:45.310> tough<00:04:45.610> because<00:04:45.910> it's<00:04:46.240> dark<00:04:46.599> and

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
it's it's tough because it's dark and

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:58.540 
it's it's tough because it's dark and
the<00:04:48.789> battery<00:04:49.180> boxes

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.339 

and<00:04:59.020> then<00:05:00.020> down<00:05:00.349> to<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:00.919> last<00:05:01.639> unit<00:05:02.210> which<00:05:03.139> is

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
and then down to the last unit which is

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.290 
and then down to the last unit which is
an<00:05:03.500> unnumbered<00:05:04.539> and<00:05:05.539> that<00:05:06.440> has<00:05:06.710> white<00:05:07.300> so

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
an unnumbered and that has white so

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.600 
an unnumbered and that has white so
that's<00:05:08.660> going<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.930> limit<00:05:09.229> my<00:05:09.590> numbers<00:05:10.069> that<00:05:10.550> I

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
that's going to limit my numbers that I

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.210 
that's going to limit my numbers that I
can<00:05:10.910> use<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:11.419> I'll<00:05:11.539> have<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.840> research<00:05:12.319> what

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
can use so I'll have to research what

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.760 
can use so I'll have to research what
ones<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.550> can<00:05:13.729> use<00:05:13.940> but<00:05:14.419> again<00:05:14.720> as<00:05:15.620> I<00:05:15.740> mentioned

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
ones I can use but again as I mentioned

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.640 
ones I can use but again as I mentioned
before<00:05:16.220> nobody<00:05:16.940> makes<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.330> decal<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.139> that<00:05:18.319> kind

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
before nobody makes a decal so that kind

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.809 
before nobody makes a decal so that kind
of<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:20.120> clincher<00:05:21.340> because<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.460> don't<00:05:22.639> want<00:05:22.759> to

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
of is a clincher because I don't want to

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.430 
of is a clincher because I don't want to
put<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.120> wrong<00:05:23.300> ones<00:05:23.660> on<00:05:23.930> because<00:05:24.169> then<00:05:24.319> it's

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
put the wrong ones on because then it's

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.659 
put the wrong ones on because then it's
going<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.620> look<00:05:24.710> funny<00:05:25.990> so<00:05:27.130> not<00:05:28.130> sure<00:05:28.370> what<00:05:28.550> I'm

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
going to look funny so not sure what I'm

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.520 
going to look funny so not sure what I'm
gonna<00:05:28.819> do<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.150> might<00:05:29.569> do<00:05:29.780> something<00:05:30.110> on<00:05:30.410> the

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
gonna do I might do something on the
