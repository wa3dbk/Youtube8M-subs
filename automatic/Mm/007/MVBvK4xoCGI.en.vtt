00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.190

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.369
 long bath for you previous episodes 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.930
 just because this week 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.990
 are only seven players but waited 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.230
 attention be careful do not go all of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.740
 after 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.750
 this week I decided to do this 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.279
 purchase resale in selection by the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 selecting forgiveness of the kinds 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.730
 particular once again that you 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 go right now 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 so that's seven days this week and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.040
 I decided to opt for isf players 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.820
 so here I already want to clarify 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.980
 that his players felt very very 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 very quickly compared to the old 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.030
 episodes the days frankly there are 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.399
 for the resale purchase it's huge and I 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.879
 already want to tell you that I believe 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.109
 that with these seven days I did 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.329
 clearly I made more profits 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.430
 that in the healthy people dpc episode 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.380
 I had more than twenty players or 10.9 and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.909
 of August or frankly just with seven 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.460
 players I think I did more than 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.189
 twenty thousand or even packed by the 25 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 profit meters what so that's so 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.770
 we will start without further delay for 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.900
 this week 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 we only have to laugh because there is also see 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.350
 apply to actually left the week 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 last last week he was 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.759

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 alas this week went on sale 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.750
 at 18,255 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.430
 imagine you so north compared a small 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 little in last week and this 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 week if I would have put this week 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.610
 again I would have done 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.400
 frankly more than 8,000 credit from 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.840
 benefits that here is perillaud still a 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.310
 it's a day that me it works 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.470
 very well so I advise you 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.960
 again then we have some 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.750
 cuevas and las cuevas i'm not sure how 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.680
 it is pronounced cuevas breeds 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.740
 frankly I did I do not do it 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.119
 Spanish so 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.310
 excuse me for my action and we 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.290
 so let's help to launch the like 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.350
 you want so it's a player eev 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.790
 money and sold a lot if I 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.740
 buy I believe in the ten thousand 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.509
 credit is frozen resold at fourteen thousand 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.239
 five hundred and fifty years and we are waiting 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.760
 give shame we break up like you 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.950
 lick not again so here's the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.780
 high 6th and sold very quickly 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.760
 did all genres have made themselves very 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.400
 quickly so here it is players 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.530
 that I advise you so here is finally 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.300
 1500 credit here we are quiet in 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.730
 falling to a more course but was 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.380
 I have huge and I did a great of on 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.330
 him I think I bought them day at 15 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.760
 but the few and I sold them to 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.000
 25 really feel good 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.630
 then we go to gaitan and donovan and finally 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.390
 to me 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.880
 so here are some players here that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.610
 are huge again on each 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.860
 day you can do more of that 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.840
 but credit or ten miles here we go 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.450
 depends on the players and frankly if 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.959
 you make the right choices with these 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.489
 players there 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.580
 these seven players frankly need and 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.440
 make them good big profits what 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.670
 these huge his players simply 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.470
 in any case I do not know if you 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.900
 find these interesting videos for 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.820
 me me who offers you this video I 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.260
 think for beginners of the 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.030
 resale chair even to go a little 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.590
 more experienced I think you 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.819
 suggest the people who worked 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.769
 for me 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.930
 during this week I think it 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.700
 can be beneficial for you but 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.069
 here you can take me back 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.790
 players and buy them back on sale 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.290
 and the cua more easily and the story 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.590
 do not want to look for which players he 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.269
 you have to go buy and sell 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.920
 and sometimes it does not work and everything and 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.389
 all lastly point not files if you me 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.639

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.400
 wanted to propose 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.049
 So here so that's it for me 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.519
