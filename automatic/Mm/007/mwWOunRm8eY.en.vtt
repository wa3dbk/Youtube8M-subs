00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.770
 relatively recently, ubisoft 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.530
 launched its own line of souvenirs 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.690
 under the brand of south collectives an important nuance 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.279
 all these things do not coincide with the fact that 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.900
 can be found in various 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.570
 collectible editions from the same 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.180
 companies and most interest in the series 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.310
 represent character figures so here 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.199
 as you remember hunting was one of 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.550
 quite important components of such a game 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.710
 like assassin's creed 3 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.140
 the figure that hit us today on 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.680
 review and it is called for hunter 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.180
 although as a figure of the figure start with soup 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.500
 the boxes 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.629
 sustained in absolutely traditional for 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.170
 family style on the right side see 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.989
 very beautiful and on the back of the box 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.640
 hefty inscription rice why year what 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.489
 much more important here are listed 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.320
 and main characteristics height 25 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.900
 centimeters pvc material 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.269
 that is plastics well let's pull out 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.309
 our plastic is complete the first thing 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.290
 striking the hero himself and he 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.960
 is in this somewhat when bent 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.180
 condition is only 50 percent of the figurines 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.340
 the remaining 50 takes some 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.420
 American snag however it is impossible 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.460
 say it is a minus 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.460
 this whole marvelous construction is the opposite 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.770
 successfully complements and shabby 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.320
 aggressiveness and good athletic 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.479
 abilities hero poses characters this 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.100
 In general, a separate topic is often similar 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.380
 figures is a piece 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.930
 the plastic that stands here is wide 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.940
 spread in the arms and legs and besovka 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.450
 questions came anyway breast bags 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.369
 one feels the power the power of life as for 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.080
 Conor then looking at it is generally created 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.570
 the impression that now he will break with 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.210
 places and deftly zafigachit arrow straight into 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.399
 your cat's eye is worth noting and common 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.649
 by looking at the conor in detail 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.869
 words plastic starts to sound like something 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.600
 even abusive folds on clothes 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.820
 arrows in the quiver assassin sign on 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.990
 sleeve all work is done extremely 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.869
 diligent and subtle 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.970
 this is not a cheap fake only 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.500
 puncture can be detected by looking to the hole 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.500
 under the hood and there 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.629
 and there in the eyes clearly frightened 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.489
 student 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.040
 although the hero can hunt him 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.379
 the bear runs as well as a whole carp 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.300
 nothing what they wanted for a bowstring but even she 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.459
 made of thin rope 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.590
 one more thing is related to the fact that the figure 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.450
 flexible enough part if desired 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.860
 snags can even take a little 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.810
 side so if during 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.150
 some kind of carbon party your 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.340
 figure swept away to the dogs off the shelf there 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.830
 high probability that she will survive 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.299
 in general, the conor is so cool that we even 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.579
 advise you to take it with you to 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.010
 travel and then posting on facebook 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.000
 pasts name even figure connor 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.690
 spent the summer 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.690
 cooler than you
