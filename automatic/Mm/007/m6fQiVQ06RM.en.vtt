00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
put it back into the water trough and

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.860 
put it back into the water trough and
left<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.379> for<00:03:01.590> another<00:03:01.799> full<00:03:02.129> day<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.790> we<00:03:03.629> put

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.949 
got another 24 hours to fall the next
day<00:03:11.700> which<00:03:12.060> would<00:03:12.209> have<00:03:12.299> been<00:03:12.420> Thursday

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
day which would have been Thursday

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.289 
day which would have been Thursday
morning<00:03:13.470> we<00:03:13.709> pulled<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.220> out<00:03:14.370> now<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.120> was

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
morning we pulled it out now it was

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.090 
morning we pulled it out now it was
perfect<00:03:15.780> everything<00:03:16.170> was<00:03:16.319> nice<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:17.069> was

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
perfect everything was nice and it was

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.129 
perfect everything was nice and it was
really<00:03:17.489> cold<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:18.090> was<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:19.019> know

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
really cold it was like you know

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.170 
really cold it was like you know
probably<00:03:19.350> fifty<00:03:19.799> degrees<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.639> really<00:03:20.880> made

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
probably fifty degrees so it really made

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.370 
probably fifty degrees so it really made
it<00:03:21.650> helpful<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:23.549> extend<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.690> time<00:03:24.989> frame<00:03:25.260> we

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
it helpful to extend the time frame we

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.300 
it helpful to extend the time frame we
needed<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.709> make<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.010> mole<00:03:26.160> because

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
needed to make the mole because

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.759 
needed to make the mole because
obviously<00:03:26.790> spoilage<00:03:27.599> is<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.750> concern<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.590> we

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
obviously spoilage is a concern and we

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.860 
obviously spoilage is a concern and we
didn't<00:03:28.980> want<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> lose<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.730> know<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.389> fish<00:03:30.630> to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
didn't want to lose you know the fish to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.280 
didn't want to lose you know the fish to
spoilage<00:03:31.200> before<00:03:31.739> we<00:03:31.799> got<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.069> mold
