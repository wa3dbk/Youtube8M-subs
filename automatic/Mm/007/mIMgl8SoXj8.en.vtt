00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
multimedia interface is there very

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.280 
multimedia interface is there very
impressive<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.070> wasn't<00:01:53.399> expecting<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.000> but

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
impressive I wasn't expecting this but

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
impressive I wasn't expecting this but
it's<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:55.829> thing<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.189> only<00:01:56.310> draw<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it's a very good thing the only draw is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.580 
it's a very good thing the only draw is
that<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> open<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.200> close<00:01:58.259> this

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that you have to open and close this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
manually it's not automated the sunroof

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
manually it's not automated the sunroof
which<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.649> standard<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.189> it's

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
which is here it's not standard but it's

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850 
which is here it's not standard but it's
an<00:02:02.549> option<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> q3<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.710> finally<00:02:04.710> these

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
an option on the q3 and finally these

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
an option on the q3 and finally these
climate<00:02:05.430> change<00:02:05.670> switches<00:02:06.030> are<00:02:06.270> very<00:02:06.719> unique

seat very forward because this actually

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.030 
seat very forward because this actually
goes<00:02:50.730> very<00:02:51.120> forward<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:52.079> might<00:02:52.379> make<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.739> very

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
goes very forward it might make it very

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.349 
goes very forward it might make it very
uncomfortable<00:02:53.189> for<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.849> person<00:02:54.090> sitting<00:02:54.150> on

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
uncomfortable for the person sitting on

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.699 
uncomfortable for the person sitting on
the<00:02:54.419> front<00:02:54.480> seat<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.019> if<00:02:55.109> no<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:55.349> is<00:02:55.379> sitting

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.179 
the front seat but if no one is sitting
there<00:02:55.889> then<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.639> will<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.849> quite<00:02:57.000> only<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:58.769> q3

is 4.4 meters long and that means the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.309 
is 4.4 meters long and that means the
