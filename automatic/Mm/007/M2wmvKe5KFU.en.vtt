00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.850
 and 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.860
 I have baked a cake and I want that 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.629
 like to lubricate with the canoes and 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.639
 there must first make canoes and then 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.830
 I need for that 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.720
 chocolate and whipped cream 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.220
 now I have to cook the whipped cream and 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.260
 then do the layout 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.250
 the chocolate with a pretty powerful one 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.720
 continue to stir 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.720
 so I'm going to cook the whipped cream now 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.790
 so whipped cream 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.790
 boils 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.050
 sweet aside 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 and what I am going to do now is that this classification 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.910
 add the chocolate to the whipped cream 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.970
 and then stir well as you dissolved 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:05.519
 is 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:01:07.560
 then you do the rest at nick it 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.170
 down the recipe use 200 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.820
 milliliters of whipped cream on 200 grams of pure 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.800
 chocolate 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 You can also do a milk chocolate canoe 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.690
 make or white chocolate canoes 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.960
 then the recipe is 200 milliliters 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.500
 whipped cream on 300 grams of milk chocolate and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.560
 do you want to make white then there is 200 grams or 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.380
 200 milliliters of whipped cream at 400 grams 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.420
 you simply make white chocolate with it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.500
 Likewise, you buy then whipped 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.960
 in parts 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 add the chocolate well now is all 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 chocolate dissolved and what you still have to do 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.539
 to do 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.459
 so that you get ten minutes very quickly 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.459
 with the whisk must go hungry in the pan 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.210
 well you can the hot channel can you 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.640
 Use it to make a cake or a cookie 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.080
 to dip and already gull four tasks 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.270
 then you really have to leave it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.280
 cool because this is still much to do 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.990
 to cover your cake 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.700
 so if you want to do your cake then you have to 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.560
 really let him cool off for a few hours 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.670
 a cool place not in the fridge because 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.620
 then he really knocks hard and 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.890
 Carnism just got me cool 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.940
 place on your counter and then you can just 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.930
 as a butter cream 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.930
 grease your cakes 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.080
 I have some prepared this canoe 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.080
 this is what it looks like when it has cooled 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.910
 so really nice and thick 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.680
 chocolate paste thickness here can therefore 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.680
 just spend more well paid 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.250
 card there what you can do if you 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.420
 cabinet is a bit too thick to 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.830
 lubricate 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.450
 put that whole dish for 10 seconds 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.310
 in the microwave it will be something again 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.580
 softer and then you can go a little easier 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.580
 lubricate 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.080
 what I'm going to do now is the top first 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.080
 a good thick layer on top 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.409
 so 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.610
 and that may be a bit over the top 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.610
 protruding edges 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.360
 and then I grab the sides 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.070
 no and then keep it rather time yet 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.220
 palette knife upright and that I then this 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.220
 make a move 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.769
 look around four of mine 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.769
 Finally 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.480
 what you can do to make a hamill beautiful 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.280
 is smooth with this it is one 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.140
 site scraper 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.300
 is that you are next to your cake in a corner of 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.190
 45 degrees 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.870
 And then it's handy if you put your hand to it 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.600
 you can keep this side in one 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.600
 time was completely withdrawn 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.670
 I put the scraper on it 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.670
 a corner 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.310
 one attracts around 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.780
 top just a moment 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.730
 stays very long saw so if you were there 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.790
 just have a piece that you think 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.320
 well here to be dissatisfied with your there 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.020
 just lubricate a little canoe again 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.160
 and then do again from scratch 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.160
 Prepare along with those sites 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.420
 if it does this way then you get it 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.040
 nice tight corners 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.620
 of course you can now just use the card like this 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.180
 eat or decorate with whipped cream 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.580
 you can also let him go up in the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.170
 fridge and then very nice tight 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.860
 cover with fondant or marzipan net 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.860
 what you like
