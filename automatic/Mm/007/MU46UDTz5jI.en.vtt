this<00:00:00.539> lesson<00:00:00.810> we're<00:00:01.140> going<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.410> talk<00:00:01.680> about

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:02.179 
this lesson we're going to talk about

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.280 
this lesson we're going to talk about
odd-even<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.389> prime<00:00:03.750> numbers<00:00:04.910> okay<00:00:06.290> even

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
odd-even and prime numbers okay even

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.400 
odd-even and prime numbers okay even
numbers<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.980> in<00:00:08.280> one<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.639> these<00:00:08.940> digits<00:00:09.540> and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
numbers and in one of these digits and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499 
numbers and in one of these digits and
odd<00:00:10.679> numbers<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.790> these<00:00:11.910> digits

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
odd numbers and in one of these digits

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.240 
odd numbers and in one of these digits
right<00:00:13.580> odd<00:00:14.580> numbers<00:00:15.389> can't<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.410> divided

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
right odd numbers can't be divided

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.320 
right odd numbers can't be divided
exactly<00:00:18.090> by<00:00:18.750> two<00:00:19.640> even<00:00:20.640> numbers<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.300> be

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
exactly by two even numbers can be

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.250 
exactly by two even numbers can be
divided<00:00:21.990> exactly<00:00:22.769> by<00:00:22.980> two<00:00:23.359> they<00:00:24.359> such<00:00:25.050> will

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
divided exactly by two they such will

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.290 
divided exactly by two they such will
open<00:00:25.560> even<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.070> though<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.430> know<00:00:26.880> I'm<00:00:27.090> talk

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
open even of a though I know I'm talk

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.290 
open even of a though I know I'm talk
about<00:00:27.539> prime<00:00:27.840> numbers<00:00:34.760> okay<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:35.790> what's<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
about prime numbers okay so what's a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100 
about prime numbers okay so what's a
prime<00:00:36.600> number

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
prime number

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.799 
prime number
well<00:00:38.100> prime<00:00:38.460> number<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.120> only<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.450> divided<00:00:40.079> by

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
well prime number can only be divided by

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.529 
well prime number can only be divided by
1<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.890> number<00:00:44.070> itself<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.590> example<00:00:47.539> 2

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
1 and the number itself so for example 2

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.380 
1 and the number itself so for example 2
the<00:00:48.840> prime<00:00:49.500> number<00:00:50.039> because<00:00:50.760> tail<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.360> be

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the prime number because tail can be

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.010 
the prime number because tail can be
divided<00:00:52.110> by<00:00:52.350> 1<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.610> 2<00:00:55.640> 3<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:57.360> also<00:00:57.600> another

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
divided by 1 and 2 3 is also another

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.790 
divided by 1 and 2 3 is also another
prime<00:00:58.440> number<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.399> 3<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.570> divided<00:01:01.410> by

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
prime number because 3 can be divided by

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.050 
prime number because 3 can be divided by
1<00:01:02.730> +<00:01:03.199> 3<00:01:05.869> 5<00:01:06.869> there's<00:01:07.830> another<00:01:08.100> prime<00:01:08.520> number

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
1 + 3 5 there's another prime number

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.890 
1 + 3 5 there's another prime number
because<00:01:09.990> 5<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.619> divided<00:01:11.130> by<00:01:11.310> 1<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.330> 5

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
because 5 can be divided by 1 and 5

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.520 
because 5 can be divided by 1 and 5
night<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.130> now<00:01:14.250> let<00:01:14.490> us<00:01:14.520> write<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.060> few

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
night so now let us write down a few

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.200 
night so now let us write down a few
numbers<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.860> we'll<00:01:17.159> check<00:01:17.430> whether<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.820> prime

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
numbers now we'll check whether a prime

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
numbers now we'll check whether a prime
numbers<00:01:18.659> or<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:28.100> right<00:01:29.100> okay<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> want<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
numbers or not right okay so want to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.090 
numbers or not right okay so want to
check<00:01:33.600> whether<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.170> numbers<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.829> prime

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
check whether these numbers are prime

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.600 
check whether these numbers are prime
numbers<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:37.670> right<00:01:40.040> when<00:01:41.040> all<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.280> one

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
numbers or not right when all that one

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.660 
numbers or not right when all that one
and<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> number<00:01:42.119> itself<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:44.040> also<00:01:44.220> be

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and the number itself all can also be

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.870 
and the number itself all can also be
defied<00:01:45.060> always<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.740> divided<00:01:47.369> into<00:01:47.549> them

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
defied always be divided into them

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.350 
defied always be divided into them
exactly<00:01:48.479> right

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
exactly right

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.670 
exactly right
what<00:01:51.360> 17<00:01:52.079> cannot<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.619> divided<00:01:53.159> by<00:01:53.369> 2<00:01:54.380> 3<00:01:56.329> 4<00:01:57.680> 5

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
what 17 cannot be divided by 2 3 4 5

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.530 
what 17 cannot be divided by 2 3 4 5
only<00:01:59.280> number<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.939> 17<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.750> prime<00:02:04.909> 10<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.329> be

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
only number so 17 is prime 10 can be

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.110 
only number so 17 is prime 10 can be
divided<00:02:06.960> by<00:02:07.320> 2<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.369> 10<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.840> going

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.250 

fifteen<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.750> be<00:02:16.930> divided<00:02:17.349> by<00:02:17.849> three<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.260> five

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
fifteen can be divided by three and five

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:30.229 
fifteen can be divided by three and five
so<00:02:21.220> 15<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:21.970> also<00:02:22.269> not<00:02:22.840> prime<00:02:27.480> okay

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
so 15 is also not prime okay

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.080 
so 15 is also not prime okay
seven<00:02:31.739> seven<00:02:32.739> cannot<00:02:33.130> be<00:02:33.280> divided<00:02:33.700> by<00:02:34.030> two

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
seven seven cannot be divided by two

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.910 
seven seven cannot be divided by two
that<00:02:34.360> would<00:02:34.750> leave<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.170> remainder

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
that would leave the remainder

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.309 
that would leave the remainder
it<00:02:36.280> can't<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:36.790> divided<00:02:37.209> by<00:02:37.540> three<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.200> would

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
it can't be divided by three that would

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.479 
it can't be divided by three that would
also<00:02:38.530> leave<00:02:38.980> remainder<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.750> four<00:02:41.440> five<00:02:42.190> and

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
also leave remainder so four five and

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.229 
also leave remainder so four five and
six<00:02:42.790> can<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.330> also<00:02:44.670> don't<00:02:45.670> numbers<00:02:46.090> are

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
six can it also don't numbers are

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.830 
six can it also don't numbers are
dividing<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.840> seven<00:02:47.290> or<00:02:47.470> one<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.400> seven<00:02:49.060> so

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
dividing the seven or one and seven so

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.210 
dividing the seven or one and seven so
seven<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.799> a<00:02:50.860> prime<00:02:50.950> number

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
seven is a prime number

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:02.480 
seven is a prime number
okay<00:02:56.250> right

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.970 

so<00:03:04.790> prime<00:03:05.790> numbers<00:03:06.330> can<00:03:06.630> only<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.960> divided<00:03:07.560> by

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
so prime numbers can only be divided by

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.570 
so prime numbers can only be divided by
1<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.060> itself<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:10.380> also<00:03:10.590> want<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.160> let<00:03:11.430> you

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
1 and itself and also want to let you

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:23.530 
1 and itself and also want to let you
know<00:03:11.610> what<00:03:11.820> up<00:03:11.940> one<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:13.850> not<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:16.130> prime<00:03:17.130> number

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.740 

ok<00:03:24.540> why<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.900> not<00:03:25.200> one<00:03:25.560> not<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.860> prime<00:03:26.280> number

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
ok why is not one not a prime number

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.610 
ok why is not one not a prime number
well<00:03:27.750> because<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.910> prime<00:03:29.910> number<00:03:30.590> can<00:03:31.590> be

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
well because a prime number can be

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.620 
well because a prime number can be
divided<00:03:32.280> by<00:03:32.700> 1<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.540> itself<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:35.400> one<00:03:35.820> can<00:03:36.270> only

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
divided by 1 and itself but one can only

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.840 
divided by 1 and itself but one can only
be<00:03:37.530> divided<00:03:38.040> by<00:03:38.520> one<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.590> therefore<00:03:41.220> one<00:03:41.490> isn't

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
be divided by one so therefore one isn't

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.840 
be divided by one so therefore one isn't
a<00:03:41.940> prime<00:03:42.240> number<00:03:42.800> ok<00:03:43.800> that's<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.190> mistake<00:03:44.340> that

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
a prime number ok that's a mistake that

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.060 
a prime number ok that's a mistake that
lots<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.270> people<00:03:45.660> make<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.440> learn<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.950> to

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
lots of people make one to learn and to

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.730 
lots of people make one to learn and to
think<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.520> one's<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.970> prime<00:03:48.270> number<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:49.590> it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
think that one's a prime number but it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.940 
think that one's a prime number but it
isn't<00:03:50.100> ok<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.860> anyway<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.670> if<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.060> know<00:03:54.330> a

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
isn't ok so anyway just to if you know a

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.950 
isn't ok so anyway just to if you know a
prime<00:03:55.950> number<00:03:56.690> can<00:03:57.690> be<00:03:57.720> divided<00:03:58.380> by<00:03:59.600> 1<00:04:00.600> and

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
prime number can be divided by 1 and

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.020 
prime number can be divided by 1 and
itself<00:04:01.860> if<00:04:02.990> it<00:04:03.990> can<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.410> divided<00:04:04.800> by<00:04:05.130> any<00:04:05.460> of<00:04:05.880> a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
itself if it can be divided by any of a

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.410 
itself if it can be divided by any of a
number<00:04:06.560> then<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:07.740> not<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.400> prime<00:04:08.820> number<00:04:09.410> ok
