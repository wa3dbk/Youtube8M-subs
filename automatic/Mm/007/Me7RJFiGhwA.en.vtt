hi I'm Todd Hurley from Marion Indiana

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.030 
hi I'm Todd Hurley from Marion Indiana
I'm<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> plane<00:00:08.970> maker<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.480> over<00:00:09.690> 20<00:00:10.050> years<00:00:10.080> and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
I'm a plane maker for over 20 years and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.490 
I'm a plane maker for over 20 years and
I've<00:00:11.160> designed<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.849> made<00:00:12.110> many<00:00:13.110> different

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
I've designed and made many different

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.620 
I've designed and made many different
types<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.860> planes<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.460> one<00:00:14.969> thing<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.330> found

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
types of planes and one thing I found

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.779 
types of planes and one thing I found
that<00:00:15.960> whenever<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.619> trying<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.190> repair<00:00:17.550> or

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
that whenever I'm trying to repair or

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.179 
that whenever I'm trying to repair or
work<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.779> an<00:00:18.900> antique<00:00:19.320> sometimes<00:00:19.920> there's<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
work on an antique sometimes there's a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.160 
work on an antique sometimes there's a
missing<00:00:20.550> molding<00:00:20.939> perhaps<00:00:21.689> you've<00:00:21.869> been<00:00:22.050> in

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
missing molding perhaps you've been in

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.849 
missing molding perhaps you've been in
that<00:00:22.260> situation<00:00:22.980> you're<00:00:23.490> looking<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.359> repair

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
that situation you're looking to repair

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.320 
that situation you're looking to repair
something<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> copy<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.550> moulding<00:00:27.000> you're

something and copy a moulding you're

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.910 
something and copy a moulding you're
looking<00:00:27.689> through<00:00:27.869> all<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> router<00:00:28.349> bits<00:00:28.710> you

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
looking through all the router bits you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.310 
looking through all the router bits you
just<00:00:29.160> can't<00:00:29.369> find<00:00:29.609> anything<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.119> fits<00:00:30.480> well

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just can't find anything that fits well

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.569 
just can't find anything that fits well
why<00:00:31.470> don't<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.800> try<00:00:32.009> making<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.460> own

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
why don't you try making your own

and<00:00:47.090> design<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.270> plane<00:00:48.539> around<00:00:49.110> that

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and design your plane around that

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.520 
and design your plane around that
molding<00:00:49.969> from<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:51.210> you'll<00:00:52.110> take<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
molding from there you'll take that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.790 
molding from there you'll take that
drawing<00:00:52.860> apply<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.930> template<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.170> can

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
drawing apply it to a template that can

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.790 
drawing apply it to a template that can
be<00:00:55.949> applied<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.579> your<00:00:56.699> plane<00:00:58.070> and<00:01:00.140> serves<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
be applied to your plane and serves as a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.399 
be applied to your plane and serves as a
tracing<00:01:02.399> guide<00:01:02.640> where<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.660> trace<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
tracing guide where you can trace the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.370 
tracing guide where you can trace the
profile<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.220> each<00:01:05.339> end<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> plane<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
profile in each end of the plane and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.740 
profile in each end of the plane and
then<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.189> howls<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.820> rounds<00:01:09.210> like

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
then you can use howls and rounds like

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.179 
then you can use howls and rounds like
I've<00:01:09.930> taught<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.409> make<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.770> my<00:01:10.920> first
