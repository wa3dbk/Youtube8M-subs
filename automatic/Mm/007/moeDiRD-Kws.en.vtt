122<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:28.930> started<00:04:29.380> at<00:04:29.500> about<00:04:29.740> three<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.100> half

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
122 I started at about three and a half

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.790 
122 I started at about three and a half
hours<00:04:30.490> that's<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.729> little<00:04:30.940> bit<00:04:31.030> about<00:04:31.800> two

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
hours that's a little bit about two

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.290 
hours that's a little bit about two
hours<00:04:32.950> my<00:04:33.880> math<00:04:34.120> is<00:04:34.150> over<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:36.250> here's<00:04:37.000> what

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
hours my math is over but here's what

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.769 
hours my math is over but here's what
it's<00:04:37.450> starting<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.810> look<00:04:37.930> like

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:44.779 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:50.290 

so<00:04:45.779> this<00:04:46.559> is<00:04:46.740> getting<00:04:47.099> really<00:04:47.400> tender

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.170 

videotaping<00:04:51.300> stars<00:04:51.809> tennis<00:04:52.379> parking<00:04:53.149> you<00:04:54.149> can

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
videotaping stars tennis parking you can

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.149 
videotaping stars tennis parking you can
see<00:04:54.509> how<00:04:54.599> that's<00:04:54.749> already<00:04:55.139> like<00:04:55.409> breaking

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
see how that's already like breaking

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.859 
see how that's already like breaking
apart<00:04:57.199> just<00:04:58.199> by<00:04:58.409> touching<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:59.449> we've<00:05:00.449> got<00:05:00.689> one

00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:00.869 
apart just by touching it we've got one

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:05.510 
apart just by touching it we've got one
of<00:05:00.960> these<00:05:01.020> marathons<00:05:01.619> in<00:05:01.860> here<00:05:02.009> somewhere

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.950 

so<00:05:06.090> you'll<00:05:06.360> see<00:05:06.539> how<00:05:06.660> that's<00:05:06.900> starting<00:05:07.050> to

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
so you'll see how that's starting to

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.290 
so you'll see how that's starting to
break<00:05:09.960> down<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.349> narrow<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:11.370> that's<00:05:11.639> my

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
break down the narrow and that's my

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.860 
break down the narrow and that's my
favorite<00:05:12.509> part<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.930> whole<00:05:13.020> dish<00:05:13.259> so<00:05:13.669> once

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
favorite part of the whole dish so once

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.480 
favorite part of the whole dish so once
once<00:05:15.870> that's<00:05:16.139> all<00:05:16.410> cooked<00:05:16.740> down

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
once that's all cooked down

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.029 
once that's all cooked down
I'll<00:05:17.789> take<00:05:18.030> those<00:05:18.180> out<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.630> don't<00:05:18.830> kind<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:19.919> like
