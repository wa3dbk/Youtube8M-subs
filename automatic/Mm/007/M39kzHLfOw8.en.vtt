00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello friends today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.629
 make this origami star well 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.760
 let's see how it is done to make 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.250
 this star we are going to need 8 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.009
 squares of paper can be the same 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.379
 color or different we're going to fold it 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.769
 down the diagonal 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.769
 in this way we turn our figure of 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:27.029
 this way and then we're going to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.079
 open bearing a diamond bearing this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.079
 side to center 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 and this tip to the top we 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.450
 it stays this way well we turn it on 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.850
 we stay like this 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.360
 and now let's take this shore to 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.360
 center 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.129
 We take this shore to where it 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.129
 find this other shore 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.939
 so we will do the same with this shore 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.939
 taking her to this shore 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.760
 but this is going to double 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.760
 backward 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 and we unfolded it in such a way that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.079
 there is a tab this is one of the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.420
 pieces to put together our star let's go 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.400
 to perform the same procedure with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.110
 the other squares 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.990
 well as you can see we already have 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.960
 made our 8 pieces the following 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.900
 step is to unite the following way 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.790
 let's take a piece where it is 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.270
 find the tip that we bend towards 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.440
 forward and backward that is this and the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.660
 another where the bent tip is 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.530
 well what we are going to do is put this 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.860
 tip 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.290
 inside this slot and let's do 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 that this point coincide with this 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.310
 tip 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:18.040
 in this way well and this other tip the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.730
 let's fold in this slot 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.159
 well we have already stuck two pieces we take 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.650
 another piece and we repeat the procedure 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.610
 getting in 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.430
 and aligning these two points once 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.540
 dress 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.110
 this is going to go in this slot 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.010
 and so we will continue with all the rest 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.740
 pieces we will do the same with the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.890
 last piece 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.890
 to fix what is our star 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.050
 and good friends as you can see we have already 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.560
 finished our star if I 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.330
 they make all the pieces red 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.000
 You can put it to decorate your parties 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.860
 in this Christmas season I hope that you 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.620
