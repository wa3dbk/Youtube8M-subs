00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 were 145 machines on display in the 3rd 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.670
 shows of machines and inventions for 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.410
 family farming but only five 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.290
 were selected by the committee 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.179
 judgment as differentials for the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.190
 agricultural activity here of our 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.619
 region 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.779
 after 16 years of waiting 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.760
 pelotas became the capital of the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.550
 rural inventors 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.449
 an integrated action between the university 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.140
 federal in Braga's temperate climate in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.010
 a land with a proposal to reverse the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.590
 logic of the source of knowledge and 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.950
 meet the demands of the field and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.789
 trends in family farming 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.730
 teaching research and rural extension 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.879
 gathered inventors in capable events 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.829
 increase productive efficiency and 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.980
 reduce the city penalty were gathered in the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.010
 event center of the sweet antenna about 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.170
 of 150 machine inventions and 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.450
 equipment 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.159
 origin of the inventive capacity of the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.130
 family farmers 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.869
 industry often fails to 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.360
 specific aspects of some 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.070
 need for control of another 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.390
 and here as producers who 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.250
 simply show me that he 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.520
 including for others to benefit 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.930
 copinh multiply the satisfaction idea 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.060
 it efe 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.939
 as we have those who also wind in 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.630
 adapt and also produce to sell or 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.840
 that puts in contact with who produces 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.100
 Do you want to show to divulge and why? 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.049
 find the one who produces what he wants 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.380
 sell that makes it a living and 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.180
 the two parts issuing beyond the other 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.950
 general aspect of the event day and 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.750
 possibly a company in the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.759
 research can and does improve 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.439
 what was once invented conceived 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.450
 with a producer who can give a 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.310
 portfolio of more worked material 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.930
 until a possible patent in this 2014 year 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.580
 family farming 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.680
 the inventors have provided 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.710
 before agricultural machinery and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.600
 equipment with good ideas 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.500
 knowledge and information were 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.860
 socialized by exchanges of 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.240
 experiences between farmers and the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.670
 public present 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.910
 a judging committee chose the five 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.730
 best inventions from the 3rd 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.710
 show of machines at events for 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.930
 family agriculture to intensify 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.680
 fifth 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.450
 the machine to remove bed of aviary and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.540
 feather burner 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.209
 the machine works to facilitate the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.130
 the farmer's work it would take a 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.320
 day to do a day and a half to do 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.880
 the whole of the aviary with this 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.770
 brand with this event he can do 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.600
 in 15 minutes 20 minutes 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.760
 then it becomes enough yield 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.390
 of work becomes very promising 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.610
 you see here is a set that the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.470
 burner is coupled to the tractor is a 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.900
 tractor and with that he can 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.860
 automate can be done in a way that 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.510
 manual with a simple 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.350
 pushing the cart is with the two 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.950
 Fourth place cylinder machine tip 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.950
 Belletti 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.720
 the principle of peace in the world 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.470
 thirdly the hay loader 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.959
 was from the need of time 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.380
 today everyone has a little time and hand 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.709
 is also becoming scarce. 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.740
 so it eliminates certain jobs the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.610
 manual seaming and loading 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.350
 manual 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.300
 she already collects hay 15 in reading the duel 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.670
 on top of the trailer only the need to 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.420
 load and once the load is 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.330
 ready 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.640
 if the farmer has more than one trailer 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.060
 it can wear hitch another trailer 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.380
 makes one more charge does and then starts to 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.210
 download then delete the service then 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.210
 and it ends up saving time, right? 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.230
 second place his hydraulic strength 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.960
 articulated to seas 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.610
 the idea was to reduce our service 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.730
 that we did everything in the area just want 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.220
 bet landis not to suffer a 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.110
 a little less and can do more 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.240
 area on a single day that is also the family is 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.240
 very big so help me 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.130
 so here it has a whole joint 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.190
 it advances with up to one meter out 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.590
 of the tractor she is under five feet and 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.080
 through here about 45 degrees or so 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.890
 to have more rope angle in the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.530
 herb improved in the case the question of time 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.990
 because before it was done with brushcutter 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.850
 manual and now with the tractor 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.360
 easier and easier now is much more 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.910
 on account not the least people do more 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.860
 service and also the one who works 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.060
 less could walk on the tractor and 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.419
 ytalo and the first feeder 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.600
 firewood furnace she is a machine 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.380
 with high technology takes 45 seconds 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.490
 to supply the law and the 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.760
 farmer no longer needs to get up in the 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.490
 night and weekend he can leave 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.220
 a party at a wedding anyway without 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.810
 worry about the Syrians have at home that 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.020
 this machine working for him straight 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.090
 24 hours there and personal ball show has 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.430
 have better known how it works with 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.100
 the law the goal of 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.860
 and demonstrate events created or 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.280
 adapted by farmers was 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.480
 achieved by the organizers 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.910
 institutions are now tasked with 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.240
 catalog and make machines available 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.590
 on events in publication form from here 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.400
 we have some challenges ahead 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.690
 It is fundamental to see that this is 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.870
 transformed into documents and publications 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.420
 public becomes visible that 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.750
 there are equipment that needs to be 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.290
 multiplied and teacher and above 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.540
 all begin to think of mechanisms of 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.420
 research to improve them 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.090
 from now on it is looking at the theme of 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.130
 mechanization of family agriculture with 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.460
 a public policy and with that 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.930
 develop equipment and machinery and 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.360
 equipment that effectively improves 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.890
 work speed slows down. 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.220
 efficiency of agricultural production 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.220
 family 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:58.659
 all the initiatives of the inventors 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:01.900
 participants of the show were successful 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:04.669
 because they are machines and implements 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.759
 by the need of families 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:12.580
 improve the conditions of 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:12.580
 quality of life in the countryside
