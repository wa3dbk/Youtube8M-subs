Ford Ranger for the years 93 to 97 if

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.099 
Ford Ranger for the years 93 to 97 if
I'm<00:00:13.799> correct<00:00:13.980> these<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.109> headlights

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
I'm correct these are the headlights

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.790 
I'm correct these are the headlights
with<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> optional<00:00:16.980> projectors<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.800> haven't

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
with the optional projectors I haven't

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.250 
with the optional projectors I haven't
seen<00:00:19.949> many<00:00:20.100> videos<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.670> YouTube<00:00:21.260> showcasing

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
seen many videos on YouTube showcasing

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109 
seen many videos on YouTube showcasing
them<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.830> figure<00:00:23.340> most<00:00:23.519> people<00:00:23.789> thinking

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
them so I figure most people thinking

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.630 
them so I figure most people thinking
about<00:00:24.180> buying<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> patties<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:26.490> can

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
about buying the patties and they can

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.679 
about buying the patties and they can
see<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.090> close

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
see them up close

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.700 
see them up close

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
vandalized so as you can see on this one

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.090 
vandalized so as you can see on this one
the<00:00:38.460> Nance<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> broken<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.809> applied<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
plastic so I'm probably be salvaged your

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.750 
plastic so I'm probably be salvaged your
knees<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.910> for<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:46.160> projector<00:00:47.160> lens<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
knees just for the projector lens and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.970 
knees just for the projector lens and
fired<00:00:48.210> along<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.050> other<00:00:49.680> than<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
fired along with it other than that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.840 
fired along with it other than that
these<00:00:50.190> are<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:51.239> decent<00:00:52.199> quality<00:00:52.920> although<00:00:53.550> most

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
these are a decent quality although most

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
these are a decent quality although most
people<00:00:53.940> say<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.960> styling<00:00:55.530> our

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
people say they just for styling our

people say they just for styling our
function<00:00:56.390> from<00:00:57.390> using<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> pass

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
function from using on for the pass

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.510 
function from using on for the pass
where<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.449> they're<00:01:01.520> they're

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
where I'm have here now they're they're

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.000 
where I'm have here now they're they're
actually<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> decent<00:01:03.690> quality<00:01:04.019> as<00:01:04.290> long<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
actually a decent quality as long as you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
actually a decent quality as long as you
I<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:06.299> recommend<00:01:06.450> using<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:09.000> projectors

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
I would recommend using the projectors

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.440 
I would recommend using the projectors
also<00:01:10.140> at<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> same<00:01:10.560> time<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.970> using<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
also at the same time so if using a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.830 
also at the same time so if using a
regular<00:01:12.689> headlights<00:01:13.229> also<00:01:13.799> used<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.630> project

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
regular headlights also used to project

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.740 
regular headlights also used to project
the<00:01:16.170> beams<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.040> obvious<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.400> use<00:01:17.640> those<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.119> as

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the beams so obvious I use those as as

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380 
the beams so obvious I use those as as
if<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.290> truck<00:01:19.650> landfall<00:01:20.100> lights<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
if the truck landfall lights on so and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.469 
if the truck landfall lights on so and
it<00:01:21.840> gives<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> wider<00:01:22.350> spread<00:01:23.040> pattern<00:01:23.580> unless

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it gives a wider spread pattern unless

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.899 
it gives a wider spread pattern unless
you<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> use<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:26.159> here<00:01:26.640> so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you was just going to use some here so

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.210 
you was just going to use some here so
some<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:27.750> obviously<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.829> can't<00:01:29.040> use

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
some on it then obviously you can't use

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.280 
some on it then obviously you can't use
regular<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.900> regular<00:01:30.930> hair<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:33.290> my

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
regular the regular hair like so my

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.830 
regular the regular hair like so my
selves<00:01:34.710> Dannette<00:01:34.979> probably<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.909> these<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
selves Dannette probably are these and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.399 
selves Dannette probably are these and
they<00:01:37.350> other<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.970> style<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:39.960> have

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
they other than with style they do have

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.940 
they other than with style they do have
function<00:01:41.009> also<00:01:41.189> took<00:01:41.909> most<00:01:42.119> people<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.509> bad

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
function also took most people just bad

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.980 
function also took most people just bad
bad<00:01:43.950> things<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.799> then<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.810> only<00:01:48.810> for

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
bad things and then we have only for

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.219 
bad things and then we have only for
style<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> no<00:01:49.680> function<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.490> some<00:01:51.229> well

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
style and no function is with some well

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.050 
style and no function is with some well
a<00:01:52.409> decent<00:01:53.070> projector<00:01:53.610> on

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:05.630 

it's<00:01:57.060> rh3<00:01:58.730> projected<00:01:59.730> a<00:01:59.820> ch3<00:02:00.120> boat<00:02:04.640> almere

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it's rh3 projected a ch3 boat almere

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.880 
it's rh3 projected a ch3 boat almere
pretty<00:02:05.940> much<00:02:06.180> also<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.620> have<00:02:07.740> any

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
pretty much also so you have any

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.710 
pretty much also so you have any
questions<00:02:08.490> anything<00:02:08.790> like<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.119> about<00:02:09.420> these

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
questions anything like that about these

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.580 
questions anything like that about these
headlights<00:02:10.260> on<00:02:10.770> Oh<00:02:11.690> for<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> installation<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
headlights on Oh for the installation of

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.940 
headlights on Oh for the installation of
almost<00:02:14.190> organic

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
almost organic

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.500 
almost organic
so<00:02:16.950> installation<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.580> pretty<00:02:17.610> similar<00:02:19.310> as<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
so installation is pretty similar as the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.510 
so installation is pretty similar as the
stock<00:02:21.510> ones<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.140> will<00:02:22.470> recommend<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.220> little
