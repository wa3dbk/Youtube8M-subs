00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.769
 breakthrough 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.690
 what if you want to get tasty 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.960
 use quality food 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.229
 out of nothing something comes in oil i 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.079
 I use olive 1 is better extra extra virgin 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.329
 This of course in ideal But in reality you 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.780
 you can take any vegetable oil 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.719
 as regards seasoning do in 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.600
 Generally half the sauce but if the hoof 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.670
 seasoning you have no added 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.159
 nothing especially terrible will and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.440
 Also, instead of all these, you can perfectly 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.110
 use a mixture of Provencal herbs 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.720
 it's practically the same tomatoes 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.940
 you need to wash well and remove the core 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:31.380
 I make a deep cut but not to the end and 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:35.750
 just crush his hand and redo it to 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.750
 in the future, the tomato was easier fighters 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:51.329
 garlic also do not cut just long ago 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.030
 it is necessary with a saucepan and a little heat is not 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.490
 olive oil do not overheat the oil if 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.920
 you have extra virgin she is not high derst 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.460
 temperatures started to burn 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.750
 indulge vegetable oil 1 garlic 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.440
 dishes of course better to use with 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.420
 good coating that does not burn 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.180
 when the mind is the usual pot can 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.569
 use even an ambulance when garlic 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.190
 a series of grents and fold to tula 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:26.410

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:26.410
 [music] 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.959
 first look at them a little bit 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.599
 stir as soon as the tomato juice boils 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:46.010
 I pour out all the seasonings here 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:49.370
 I mix the lid and I can 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.590
 forget about them for 40 seconds 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.700

 Blender grind all this mass so 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.760

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.049

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.209
 through a sieve 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.430
 it's not difficult to make it like sauce for now 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.260
 still pretty liquid i will pass 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:25.770
 through a sieve 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.770
 [music] 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.570
 received itself everyone returns the same 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.840
 the dishes where the tomato was stewed 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.210
 bring to a boil 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.400
 reduce heat and now with 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:45.170
 open lid on can warmed up 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.540
 cooked to the desired thickness of the same 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.190
 amount is difficult to do not only fresh but 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.310
 if served them will lead 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.200
 it is of course easier then you just need 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.870
 mix canned tomatoes 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.710

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.440

 this is for your taste I use red 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.420

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.420

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.010
 if tomatoes you very dump then 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.290
 you can and not add try to taste 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.870

 extend one more minute and can 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.690
 remove split split and note that when 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.610
