so let's have a quick game of bread now
sitting<00:04:00.950> in<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.130> cockpit<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.640> game<00:04:01.819> should

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
sitting in the cockpit the game should

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.420 
sitting in the cockpit the game should
react<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.390> my<00:04:02.660> head<00:04:02.840> movements<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:03.770> let's<00:04:04.190> turn

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
react to my head movements so let's turn

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.030 
react to my head movements so let's turn
left<00:04:04.760> let's<00:04:05.690> turn<00:04:05.990> right<00:04:06.319> look<00:04:07.100> up<00:04:07.540> look<00:04:08.540> down

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
left let's turn right look up look down

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.730

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
if I move forward i zoom in and that's

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.050 
if I move forward i zoom in and that's
pretty<00:04:12.920> much<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.130> with<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.490> few<00:04:13.640> head<00:04:13.790> bobs
