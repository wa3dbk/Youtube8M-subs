usually unfortunately it's without the
keys<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.140> that's<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> case<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:38.340> these

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
keys and that's the case with these

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
keys and that's the case with these
three<00:00:38.850> these<00:00:39.000> came<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.780> my<00:00:39.930> boxes

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
three these came out of one of my boxes

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
three these came out of one of my boxes
I<00:00:40.620> dug<00:00:41.370> them<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.640> got<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:42.059> old<00:00:42.480> one

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I dug them out I got a really old one

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.350 
I dug them out I got a really old one
here<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.579> side<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.030> same

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
here and then on this side is the same

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150 
here and then on this side is the same
model<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:45.870> updated<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.559> one's<00:00:46.739> only<00:00:46.860> about

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
model but updated this one's only about

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.130 
model but updated this one's only about
I<00:00:47.430> don't<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.090> less<00:00:48.360> than<00:00:48.570> ten<00:00:48.750> years<00:00:48.899> old

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I don't know less than ten years old

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.900 
I don't know less than ten years old
this<00:00:49.260> one's<00:00:49.469> probably<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:50.039> more<00:00:50.340> than<00:00:50.370> 40<00:00:50.820> or

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
this one's probably well more than 40 or

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.720 
this one's probably well more than 40 or
50<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.899> old<00:00:52.110> logo<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
50 with that old logo and then this is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.810 
50 with that old logo and then this is
the<00:00:53.879> larger<00:00:54.300> model<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> Wilson<00:00:55.379> Bohannon<00:00:55.829> most

the larger model of Wilson Bohannon most
common<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.780> only<00:00:57.930> thing<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.170> need<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> watch

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
common the only thing we need to watch

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.819 
common the only thing we need to watch
on<00:00:58.739> these<00:00:58.890> I'll<00:00:59.609> tell<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.620> key

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
on these I'll tell you are they the key

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
on these I'll tell you are they the key
ways<00:01:02.039> themselves<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:03.600> there<00:01:03.780> any<00:01:03.899> secrets

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
ways themselves are there any secrets

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
ways themselves are there any secrets
well<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.640> secret<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.299> would<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
well the secret on these would be the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.359 
well the secret on these would be the
key<00:01:06.900> way<00:01:07.110> choosing<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.159> tension

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
key way choosing the right tension

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.060 
key way choosing the right tension
wrench<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> these<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.500> aren't<00:01:10.710> picky

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
wrench a lot of these just aren't picky

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.460 
wrench a lot of these just aren't picky
for<00:01:11.340> example<00:01:11.790> there's<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.600> medium<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
for example there's a medium one and the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170 
for example there's a medium one and the
large<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.950> works<00:01:14.159> just<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.700> well<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.060> only

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
large one works just as well the only

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
large one works just as well the only
one<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.450> can't<00:01:15.659> use<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.860> course<00:01:16.920> would

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
one we can't use on this of course would

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.429 
one we can't use on this of course would
be<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.520> small<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> turns<00:01:18.180> around<00:01:18.570> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
be this small one it turns around so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.870 
be this small one it turns around so
that's<00:01:19.590> not<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> secret<00:01:20.430> here's<00:01:20.759> the

security<00:01:39.780> pins<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.470> these<00:01:40.680> they're<00:01:41.040> only

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
security pins in these they're only

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
security pins in these they're only
protection<00:01:41.820> security<00:01:42.450> protection<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.290> course

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
protection security protection of course

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.190 
protection security protection of course
is<00:01:43.939> pretty<00:01:44.939> tight<00:01:45.420> tolerances<00:01:46.049> on

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
is pretty tight tolerances on

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.039 
is pretty tight tolerances on
manufacture<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> way<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.659> get<00:01:48.899> these

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
manufacture so the way we can get these

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
manufacture so the way we can get these
pins<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> go<00:01:49.590> home<00:01:49.740> fairly<00:01:50.130> quickly<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.579> we<00:01:50.700> put

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
pins to go home fairly quickly as we put

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.280 
pins to go home fairly quickly as we put
a<00:01:50.909> lot<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> tension<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> tension<00:01:52.079> wrench

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
a lot of tension on the tension wrench

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.700 
a lot of tension on the tension wrench
and<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:53.250> mean<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> lot<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.869> than<00:01:55.079> moderate<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and I mean a lot more than moderate a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.380 
and I mean a lot more than moderate a
very<00:01:55.979> considerable<00:01:56.549> amount<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.850> tension<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
very considerable amount of tension and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.810 
very considerable amount of tension and
then<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.469> simply<00:01:58.829> put<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> pick<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.610> start

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
then we simply put the pick in and start

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.969 
then we simply put the pick in and start
moving<00:01:59.969> pin<00:02:00.360> by<00:02:00.540> pin<00:02:00.680> literally<00:02:01.680> trying<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
moving pin by pin literally trying to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.490 
moving pin by pin literally trying to
force<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.549> into<00:02:02.759> place<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> reaches

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
force it into place and when it reaches

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.340 
force it into place and when it reaches
the<00:02:04.680> shear<00:02:04.920> line<00:02:05.240> when<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.659> when<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the shear line when you know when you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
the shear line when you know when you
push<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.590> it'll<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> shear<00:02:08.670> line<00:02:08.849> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
push it it'll go to the shear line and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.510 
push it it'll go to the shear line and
usually<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.539> will<00:02:09.720> set<00:02:10.020> itself<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
usually it will set itself there and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.220 
usually it will set itself there and
usually<00:02:11.700> I'll<00:02:11.940> go<00:02:12.090> through<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> stack

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
usually I'll go through the stack

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.680 
usually I'll go through the stack
a<00:02:13.290> couple<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.860> times<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.700> if<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:15.180> get<00:02:15.569> it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
a couple of times and if I don't get it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.399 
a couple of times and if I don't get it
if<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.290> don't<00:02:16.349> get<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.709> an<00:02:17.340> open<00:02:18.000> after<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.569> what

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
if I don't get a an open after that what

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:25.160 
if I don't get a an open after that what
I'll<00:02:19.500> usually<00:02:20.010> reset<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:24.450> I'll<00:02:24.569> give<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.840> only

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
I'll usually reset and I'll give it only

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.850 
I'll usually reset and I'll give it only
one<00:02:25.349> more<00:02:25.590> try<00:02:25.920> going<00:02:26.489> clockwise<00:02:27.620> now<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> lot

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
one more try going clockwise now a lot

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.309 
one more try going clockwise now a lot
of<00:02:28.890> times<00:02:29.269> locks<00:02:30.269> don't<00:02:30.599> like<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.989> open

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
of times locks don't like to open

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.880 
of times locks don't like to open
clockwise<00:02:32.160> sometimes<00:02:32.989> they<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.230> open<00:02:34.680> if

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
clockwise sometimes they like to open if

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.530 
clockwise sometimes they like to open if
they're<00:02:35.099> if<00:02:35.370> they<00:02:35.489> open<00:02:35.760> bi-directional

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
they're if they open bi-directional

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.030 
they're if they open bi-directional
sometimes<00:02:37.140> they'll<00:02:37.349> open<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.739> other<00:02:37.860> way

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
sometimes they'll open the other way

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.940 
sometimes they'll open the other way
easier<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.900> try<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.260> twice<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.860> it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
easier so if I try it twice and it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.830 
easier so if I try it twice and it
doesn't<00:02:41.220> work<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.329> didn't<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.750> it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
doesn't work and this one didn't and it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.650 
doesn't work and this one didn't and it
wasn't<00:02:43.019> scripted<00:02:43.349> this<00:02:43.709> way<00:02:44.000> also<00:02:45.000> he<00:02:45.329> put<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
wasn't scripted this way also he put the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.300 
wasn't scripted this way also he put the
tension<00:02:45.870> wrench<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.319> backwards<00:02:46.799> or<00:02:47.129> in<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
tension wrench in backwards or in the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.250 
tension wrench in backwards or in the
opposite<00:02:47.730> direction<00:02:47.879> using<00:02:48.660> my<00:02:48.780> thumb<00:02:49.019> and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
opposite direction using my thumb and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.380 
opposite direction using my thumb and
then<00:02:49.950> I'll<00:02:50.069> move<00:02:50.280> through<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.640> stack<00:02:50.879> again

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
then I'll move through the stack again

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.720 
then I'll move through the stack again
and<00:02:51.840> again<00:02:52.799> I'll<00:02:52.890> give<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.190> couple<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.519> tries

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
and again I'll give it a couple of tries

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.309 
and again I'll give it a couple of tries
trying<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.269> find<00:02:55.310> which<00:02:56.310> pins<00:02:56.640> are<00:02:57.060> gonna

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
trying to find which pins are gonna

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.819 
trying to find which pins are gonna
yield<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.709> go<00:02:58.859> to<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.120> shear<00:03:00.120> line<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:01.349> there

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
yield and go to the shear line and there

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.770 
yield and go to the shear line and there
we<00:03:01.980> go<00:03:02.129> this<00:03:02.340> one<00:03:02.519> happens<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.150> opening

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
we go this one happens to like opening

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.699 
we go this one happens to like opening
counterclockwise<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:05.970> go<00:03:06.709> okay

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
counterclockwise so there you go okay

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.729 
counterclockwise so there you go okay
let's<00:03:07.890> try<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.069> old<00:03:08.340> one<00:03:08.549> now<00:03:09.379> in<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.590> old

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
let's try this old one now in the old

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.099 
let's try this old one now in the old
one<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.400> old<00:03:11.579> keyways<00:03:12.090> they<00:03:12.390> might<00:03:12.569> be<00:03:12.750> worn

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
one the old keyways they might be worn

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.430 
one the old keyways they might be worn
like<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.660> when<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.200> put<00:03:16.410> your

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
like this one and so when you put your

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.780 
like this one and so when you put your
tension<00:03:16.950> wrench<00:03:17.040> you're<00:03:17.340> right<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.639> know

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
tension wrench you're right you know

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.920 
tension wrench you're right you know
right<00:03:18.000> away<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.389> not<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.750> work<00:03:18.870> for

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
right away it's not going to work for

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.800 
right away it's not going to work for
you<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.160> case<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:21.269> only<00:03:21.450> secret

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
you so in that case the only secret

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.470 
you so in that case the only secret
there<00:03:21.989> would<00:03:22.139> be<00:03:22.169> try<00:03:22.410> some<00:03:22.620> top<00:03:22.799> tension<00:03:23.480> so

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
there would be try some top tension so

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.120 
there would be try some top tension so
we'll<00:03:24.630> try<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.410> again<00:03:25.829> we're<00:03:25.980> going<00:03:26.069> to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
we'll try that and again we're going to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.860 
we'll try that and again we're going to
put<00:03:26.220> an<00:03:26.459> extraordinary<00:03:26.940> amount<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.599> pressure

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
put an extraordinary amount of pressure

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.839 
put an extraordinary amount of pressure
onto<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.290> tension<00:03:28.650> wrench<00:03:28.829> all<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.700> way<00:03:29.790> to

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
onto the tension wrench all the way to

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.180 

sometimes<00:03:43.129> it<00:03:43.280> works<00:03:43.489> sometimes<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:45.739> doesn't

there<00:03:46.340> we<00:03:46.430> go<00:03:46.580> we<00:03:46.700> got<00:03:46.790> no<00:03:46.970> hoops<00:03:47.120> we<00:03:47.390> got

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
the same way except the key ways are a

the same way except the key ways are a
good<00:03:52.640> amount<00:03:52.819> tighter<00:03:53.209> so<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.840> don't

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
good amount tighter so you don't

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.839 
good amount tighter so you don't
necessarily<00:03:54.260> have<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.890> go<00:03:55.040> with<00:03:55.190> top<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.700> can

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
necessarily have to go with top you can

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.550 
necessarily have to go with top you can
use<00:03:56.030> them<00:03:56.180> again<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.629> medium<00:03:56.959> or<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.260> can<00:03:57.410> use

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
use them again the medium or you can use

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.830 
use them again the medium or you can use
the<00:03:57.709> fat<00:03:57.920> one<00:03:58.129> so<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.640> think<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.180> use<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.450> fat<00:03:59.660> one

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
the fat one so I think I use the fat one

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.930 
the fat one so I think I use the fat one
last<00:04:00.050> time<00:04:00.290> let's<00:04:01.040> try<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.250> medium<00:04:01.610> one<00:04:01.760> see

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
last time let's try the medium one see

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.390 
last time let's try the medium one see
it<00:04:02.000> fits<00:04:02.209> absolutely<00:04:02.930> perfectly<00:04:03.349> but<00:04:04.250> the

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
it fits absolutely perfectly but the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.580 
it fits absolutely perfectly but the
technique<00:04:04.849> is<00:04:05.090> going<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.420> stay<00:04:05.599> precisely<00:04:06.170> the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
technique is going to stay precisely the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.070 
technique is going to stay precisely the
same<00:04:06.800> we're<00:04:07.730> gonna<00:04:07.819> put<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.090> lot<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.599> tension<00:04:08.750> on

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
same we're gonna put a lot of tension on

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.050 
same we're gonna put a lot of tension on
it<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.380> mean<00:04:09.620> more<00:04:09.980> than<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.400> think<00:04:10.640> is<00:04:10.849> normal

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
it I mean more than you think is normal

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.800 
it I mean more than you think is normal
and<00:04:11.860> then<00:04:12.860> move<00:04:13.280> from<00:04:13.459> pin<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.910> pin<00:04:14.120> just
