are shooting 24 in film we certainly
started<00:02:38.600> out<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:38.930> way<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.350> we've<00:02:40.010> been

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
started out that way and we've been

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.890 
started out that way and we've been
going<00:02:40.489> nine<00:02:40.730> years<00:02:41.060> actually<00:02:41.330> during<00:02:41.750> a

production in that time there's been a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.009 
production in that time there's been a
different<00:02:45.410> shift<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.769> digital<00:02:46.330> but<00:02:47.330> many<00:02:47.810> of

different shift to digital but many of

the qualities that film grain we enhance

the qualities that film grain we enhance
grain<00:02:53.959> we<00:02:54.200> shoot<00:02:54.470> industrial<00:02:55.250> locations<00:02:55.400> in

very low light very often and we kind of

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.340 
very low light very often and we kind of
like<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.150> grain<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.870> sort<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.230> a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
like that grain it is sort of a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.199 
like that grain it is sort of a
character<00:03:00.800> in<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.069> source<00:03:01.489> series<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.970> gives

character in the source series it gives

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.000 
character in the source series it gives
you<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.360> little<00:03:02.540> creepy<00:03:02.900> feeling<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:03.500> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
you a little creepy feeling and and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.070 
you a little creepy feeling and and
there's<00:03:04.880> there's<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> quality<00:03:05.630> about<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:05.900> which

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
there's there's a quality about it which

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.750 
there's there's a quality about it which
is<00:03:06.200> great<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.769> digital<00:03:06.920> cameras<00:03:07.459> tend<00:03:07.670> to

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
is great and the digital cameras tend to

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.240 
is great and the digital cameras tend to
be<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> lot<00:03:08.090> cleaner<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.870> they're<00:03:09.650> more

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
be a lot cleaner and they're more

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.180 
be a lot cleaner and they're more
difficult<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.940> give<00:03:11.350> kind<00:03:12.350> of<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.530> fabric<00:03:12.799> too

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
difficult to give kind of a fabric too

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.060 
difficult to give kind of a fabric too
and<00:03:13.820> that<00:03:14.000> Randall's<00:03:14.510> gonna<00:03:14.900> green<00:03:15.200> it's<00:03:15.650> more

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
and that Randall's gonna green it's more

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.890 
and that Randall's gonna green it's more
expensive<00:03:16.280> unquestionably<00:03:17.209> but<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> think<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
expensive unquestionably but I think the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.840 
expensive unquestionably but I think the
results<00:03:18.440> in<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.739> end<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:19.130> more<00:03:19.310> satisfying

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
results in the end of more satisfying

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.870 
results in the end of more satisfying
and<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:21.320> know<00:03:21.680> digital<00:03:22.340> we'll<00:03:22.489> get<00:03:22.670> there

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
and I know digital we'll get there

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.400 
and I know digital we'll get there
eventually<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.420> at<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.750> moment<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:24.140> don't

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
eventually but at the moment I don't

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.229 
eventually but at the moment I don't
think<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:24.769> completely<00:03:25.010> satisfying<00:03:25.910> as<00:03:26.180> a

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
think it's completely satisfying as a

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.390 
think it's completely satisfying as a
shooting<00:03:27.110> tool<00:03:27.350> right<00:03:28.360> GC<00:03:29.769> 24<00:03:30.769> shooting<00:03:31.130> in

shooting tool right GC 24 shooting in
digital<00:03:32.030> as<00:03:32.299> it<00:03:32.540> gets<00:03:32.780> there<00:03:33.019> or<00:03:33.260> pretty<00:03:33.680> much

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
digital as it gets there or pretty much

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.130 
digital as it gets there or pretty much
you<00:03:33.980> think<00:03:34.010> for<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.850> year<00:03:35.269> certainly<00:03:35.630> we

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
you think for this year certainly we

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.470 
you think for this year certainly we
have<00:03:36.260> put<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.890> bed<00:03:36.920> but<00:03:37.400> there<00:03:37.579> was<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> lot

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
have put that to bed but there was a lot

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.479 
have put that to bed but there was a lot
of<00:03:38.510> pressure<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:39.079> shoot<00:03:39.470> digital<00:03:40.010> was<00:03:40.310> that

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
of pressure to shoot digital was that

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.009 
of pressure to shoot digital was that
pressure<00:03:40.760> because<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.420> training<00:03:41.780> technology

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
pressure because the training technology

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.960 
pressure because the training technology
or<00:03:42.320> was<00:03:42.440> completely<00:03:42.890> cost<00:03:43.100> no<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.519> think<00:03:43.730> it's

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
or was completely cost no I think it's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.900 
or was completely cost no I think it's
the<00:03:44.060> caustic<00:03:44.690> Aisha<00:03:45.079> it's<00:03:45.590> also<00:03:45.829> it<00:03:46.459> falls<00:03:46.760> in

the caustic Aisha it's also it falls in

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.990 
the caustic Aisha it's also it falls in

so<00:04:29.410> what<00:04:30.160> do<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.460> see<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.940> future<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.300> talking

so what do you see the future of talking

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.570 
so what do you see the future of talking
about<00:04:32.199> sticking<00:04:32.830> with<00:04:32.949> tapeless<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.490> are

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
about sticking with tapeless and are

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.620 
about sticking with tapeless and are
coming<00:04:33.850> because<00:04:33.910> that's<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.180> big<00:04:34.330> issue<00:04:34.479> with

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
coming because that's a big issue with

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.540 
coming because that's a big issue with
tapeless<00:04:35.110> right<00:04:35.350> now<00:04:35.440> is<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.919> art<00:04:36.070> coming<00:04:36.400> in

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
tapeless right now is the art coming in

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.040 
tapeless right now is the art coming in
the<00:04:36.910> fact<00:04:37.090> like<00:04:37.210> you<00:04:37.360> mentioned<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:37.840> shoot

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
the fact like you mentioned you shoot

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.020 
the fact like you mentioned you shoot
something<00:04:38.290> tapeless<00:04:38.800> now<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.490> archive<00:04:39.820> in

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
something tapeless now you archive in

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.909 
something tapeless now you archive in
and<00:04:40.210> put<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.660> come<00:04:40.900> out<00:04:41.020> 20<00:04:41.410> 30<00:04:41.650> years<00:04:41.800> later

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
and put and come out 20 30 years later

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.310 
and put and come out 20 30 years later
can<00:04:42.699> even<00:04:42.970> playback<00:04:43.419> correct<00:04:43.960> right<00:04:44.169> with

can even playback correct right with

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.080 
can even playback correct right with
film<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.919> mean<00:04:45.100> you<00:04:45.220> only<00:04:45.250> need<00:04:45.580> basically<00:04:46.000> a

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
film you mean you only need basically a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.670 
film you mean you only need basically a
projector<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:46.960> reject<00:04:47.320> you're<00:04:47.470> lying

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
projector and reject you're lying

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.980 
projector and reject you're lying
already<00:04:47.889> I<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.580> tell<00:04:48.820> us<00:04:48.940> exactly<00:04:49.120> so<00:04:49.720> do<00:04:49.870> you

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
already I to tell us exactly so do you

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.920 
already I to tell us exactly so do you
do<00:04:50.380> you<00:04:50.500> see<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:51.460> industry<00:04:51.940> correcting<00:04:52.780> that

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
do you see the industry correcting that

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.460 
do you see the industry correcting that
somehow<00:04:53.580> coming<00:04:54.580> up<00:04:54.669> with<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.850> standard<00:04:55.540> the

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
somehow coming up with a standard the

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.730 
somehow coming up with a standard the
problem<00:04:57.100> is<00:04:57.280> that<00:04:57.750> we<00:04:58.750> are<00:04:58.900> deeply<00:04:59.290> involved

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
problem is that we are deeply involved

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.060 
problem is that we are deeply involved

more<00:05:34.590> like<00:05:35.590> film<00:05:35.919> basically<00:05:36.550> we<00:05:37.000> have<00:05:37.030> mags

more like film basically we have mags
that<00:05:37.660> come<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:37.960> go<00:05:38.139> but<00:05:38.380> they<00:05:38.560> change<00:05:38.919> quickly

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
that come and go but they change quickly

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.330 
that come and go but they change quickly
and<00:05:39.370> we<00:05:40.090> archive<00:05:40.479> them<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.650> it's<00:05:42.190> great

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
and we archive them and and it's great

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.070 
and we archive them and and it's great
to<00:05:42.400> be<00:05:42.520> able<00:05:42.639> to<00:05:42.789> see<00:05:42.910> stuff<00:05:43.180> playback<00:05:43.750> and

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
to be able to see stuff playback and

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.800

we still send them a tape and then they

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.029 
we still send them a tape and then they
redid<00:05:57.700> you<00:05:57.849> ties<00:05:58.060> and<00:05:58.870> i<00:05:59.020> win<00:05:59.229> not<00:05:59.440> alone<00:05:59.710> there

these<00:07:27.850> two<00:07:28.090> systems<00:07:28.300> out<00:07:28.660> there<00:07:28.690> which<00:07:29.020> is

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
these two systems out there which is

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.990 
these two systems out there which is
insane<00:07:29.620> you<00:07:29.650> know<00:07:29.920> whether<00:07:30.160> they<00:07:30.460> figure<00:07:30.880> it

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 
insane you know whether they figure it

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.490 
insane you know whether they figure it
out<00:07:31.120> before<00:07:31.300> they<00:07:31.630> actually<00:07:31.810> put<00:07:32.230> the<00:07:32.350> thing

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500 
out before they actually put the thing

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:53.790 
out before they actually put the thing
on<00:07:32.590> the<00:07:32.650> market<00:07:32.950> it<00:07:33.190> would<00:07:33.310> be<00:07:33.430> great
