Windows<00:00:09.330> Vista<00:00:09.570> with<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> batch<00:00:10.469> file<00:00:10.769> I

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
Windows Vista with a batch file I

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:40.070 
Windows Vista with a batch file I
created<00:00:11.360> sound<00:00:12.360> fun<00:00:12.630> let's<00:00:13.620> take<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> look

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.630 

so<00:00:41.080> what<00:00:41.200> this<00:00:41.320> batch<00:00:41.560> file<00:00:41.830> does<00:00:42.130> is<00:00:42.340> it<00:00:42.490> takes

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
so what this batch file does is it takes

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.370 
so what this batch file does is it takes
a<00:00:42.820> lot<00:00:43.000> of<00:00:43.030> steps<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:43.480> puts<00:00:43.720> it<00:00:43.810> into<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.080> few

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
a lot of steps and puts it into a few
