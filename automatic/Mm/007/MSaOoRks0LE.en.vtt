00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
okay so we're back it just occurred to

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.880 
okay so we're back it just occurred to
me<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.569> want<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.870> talk<00:00:07.049> maybe<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.440> little<00:00:07.649> bit

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
me I want to talk maybe a little bit

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.030 
me I want to talk maybe a little bit
about<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.429> fire<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.440> the<00:00:10.440> Kuiper<00:00:10.679> ooh

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
about a fire in the Kuiper ooh

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.440 
about a fire in the Kuiper ooh
stoves<00:00:12.230> here's<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.380> opinion<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.240> probably<00:00:15.240> how

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
stoves here's my opinion on probably how

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.290 
stoves here's my opinion on probably how
to<00:00:15.509> position<00:00:16.100> any<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> coals<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.850> mean<00:00:18.210> this

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
to position any of the coals I mean this

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.820 
to position any of the coals I mean this
stove<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.900> small<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.289> might<00:00:19.410> not<00:00:19.619> make<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
stove is so small it might not make a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.980 
stove is so small it might not make a
difference<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.460> usually<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.660> build<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
difference I usually like to build the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.679 
difference I usually like to build the
fire<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.500> front<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> flame<00:00:24.269> hits<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
fire up front so that flame hits the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.470 
fire up front so that flame hits the
front<00:00:24.900> end<00:00:25.220> circles<00:00:26.220> around<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.090> then

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
front end circles around here and then

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.509 
front end circles around here and then
finally<00:00:27.810> fly<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.230> finds<00:00:28.619> its<00:00:28.920> way<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
finally fly it finds its way out the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
finally fly it finds its way out the
flue<00:00:29.760> as<00:00:30.000> opposed<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.929> building<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
flue as opposed to building it in the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.910 
flue as opposed to building it in the
back<00:00:32.640> corner<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.510> then<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.500> heat<00:00:34.680> goes

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
back corner and then all the heat goes

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.729 
back corner and then all the heat goes
straight<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> stovepipe<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.930> doesn't

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
straight up the stovepipe and doesn't

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.920 
straight up the stovepipe and doesn't
bounce<00:00:37.890> around<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.600> I'll<00:00:39.719> usually

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
bounce around in here so I'll usually

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.950 
bounce around in here so I'll usually
like<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> stoke<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.309> upfront<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.000> even<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.809> can

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
like to stoke it upfront and even I can

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.959 
like to stoke it upfront and even I can
open<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.350> up<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> I'm<00:00:43.800> still<00:00:44.309> getting<00:00:44.460> quite

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
open this up and I'm still getting quite

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.389 
open this up and I'm still getting quite
a<00:00:45.000> bit<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.360> heat<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.980> probably<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
a bit of heat right here it's probably a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.930 
a bit of heat right here it's probably a
foot<00:00:47.850> maybe<00:00:48.660> nine<00:00:48.899> inches<00:00:49.230> away<00:00:49.410> from<00:00:49.940> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
foot maybe nine inches away from the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.439 
foot maybe nine inches away from the
stove<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.520> ultimately<00:00:53.730> what

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
stove and then you know ultimately what

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.510 
stove and then you know ultimately what
you'd<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.230> build<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> nice<00:00:55.949> hot

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you'd like to do is build up a nice hot

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.450 
you'd like to do is build up a nice hot
bed<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.090> coals<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.219> keep

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
bed of coals in there and then just keep

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.439 
bed of coals in there and then just keep
things<00:00:59.789> rolling<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:01.910> as<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.090> mentioned

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
things rolling on and on as I mentioned

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.830 
things rolling on and on as I mentioned
before<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:05.010> stove<00:01:05.280> top<00:01:05.549> likes<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.270> deflect<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
before the stove top likes to deflect a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.120 
before the stove top likes to deflect a
little<00:01:07.080> bit<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.650> we've<00:01:10.650> got<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:10.979> pretty

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
little bit and we've got some pretty

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.010 
little bit and we've got some pretty
good<00:01:11.220> winds<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.390> oh<00:01:12.659> maybe

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
good winds going on about oh maybe

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.170 
good winds going on about oh maybe
fifteen<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> twenty<00:01:14.310> kind<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> swirling

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
fifteen to twenty kind of swirling

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.219 
fifteen to twenty kind of swirling
around<00:01:15.740> really<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.070> stake<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:18.229> with

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
around really if you stake this with

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.789 
around really if you stake this with
this<00:01:19.350> threaded<00:01:19.770> rod<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:21.689> stove<00:01:21.990> stays

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this threaded rod here the stove stays

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.060 
this threaded rod here the stove stays
pretty<00:01:23.189> sturdy<00:01:23.930> along<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.770> know<00:01:25.890> it's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
pretty sturdy along with you know it's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.039 
pretty sturdy along with you know it's
anchored<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.909> necessarily<00:01:27.090> anchored<00:01:27.840> but

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
anchored up not necessarily anchored but

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
anchored up not necessarily anchored but
held<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.500> place<00:01:29.840> there<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> stove<00:01:31.409> jack<00:01:31.829> so

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
held in place there at the stove jack so

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.730 
held in place there at the stove jack so
really<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.210> stove<00:01:33.540> doesn't<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.200> mean<00:01:34.590> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
really this stove doesn't I mean it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.160 
really this stove doesn't I mean it
could<00:01:34.890> shake<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.460> bit<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.110> for<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
could shake a little bit but for the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.649 
could shake a little bit but for the
most<00:01:37.320> part<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.740> stays<00:01:38.009> pretty<00:01:38.369> steady<00:01:38.670> now<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
most part it stays pretty steady now the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.859 
most part it stays pretty steady now the
winds<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:40.079> kicking<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.530> again<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.750> can

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
winds are kicking up again you can

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.359 
winds are kicking up again you can
probably<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:45.530> tent<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.250> any

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
probably see the tent I don't have any

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.230 
probably see the tent I don't have any
guy<00:01:47.640> wires<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> tent<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.700> over

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
guy wires out on the tent here and over

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.429 
guy wires out on the tent here and over
there<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.110> over<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:54.200> but<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.259> guy

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
there and then over there but a guy

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.969 
there and then over there but a guy
probably<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> most

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
probably would do that but for the most

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.520 
probably would do that but for the most
part<00:01:59.509> you<00:02:00.509> know

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
part you know

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.100 
part you know
I'm<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.920> close<00:02:02.220> this<00:02:02.460> up<00:02:02.670> maybe<00:02:03.080> get<00:02:04.080> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
I'm gonna close this up maybe get a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.680 
I'm gonna close this up maybe get a
little<00:02:04.320> bit<00:02:04.440> more<00:02:04.619> draw<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.420> kind<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.479> fire

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
little bit more draw going kind of fire

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.660 
little bit more draw going kind of fire
up<00:02:06.840> those<00:02:07.020> coals<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.650> just<00:02:08.100> wanted<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> run<00:02:08.520> this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
up those coals I just wanted to run this

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.010 
up those coals I just wanted to run this
to<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> test<00:02:09.179> run<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.539> supposed<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> get

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
to the test run it's supposed to get
