00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.219
 very good girls very good guys today 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.840
 we are in a new fifa news 15 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.500
 this morning I was reading the article 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.650
 of fantastic dotcom a follower of the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.140
 channel and friend who has a web page 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.990
 fantastic I've been reading an article 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.500
 of stadiums without fifa 15 rain 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.109
 because really because there are stadiums that 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.320
 It never rains and it's one of the aspects 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.329
 playable that during matches there are 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.000
 people do not bother me that it rains that 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.820
 it is snowing as good these 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.970
 adverse weather conditions 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.810
 they find it quite difficult at the time 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.390
 to play because you already know that the ball 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.160
 it behaves in a different way and it 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.260
 play differently do not say it for 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.180
 that reason for that same reason are 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.340
 many who seek stadiums in the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.160
 it never rains and if the feef is 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.020
 stadiums that never rains because then 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.990
 so you can enjoy the best 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.820
 football practice in fifa there are five 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.220
 stadiums that meet these conditions 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.390
 which you can then buy in 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.909
 ultimate team 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.520
 and make sure there's never going to be rain 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.409
 nor after toys or snow or anything for the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.780
 style the stadiums where no 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.190
 it rains are the following the amsterdam 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.130
 arena the bc place stadium stadium 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.560
 veltins-arena qingfa stadium and the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.810
 sanderson park however these 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.820
 stadiums you know I got in a against 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.130
 during the day for example 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.140
 they project certain shadows on the field 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.450
 that sometimes hinder vision and 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.890
 you know those shadows of so they come 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.630
 being the platforms that cover the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.690
 stadium that's why it never rains 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.110
 because they are covered are thrown out by 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.910
 well the truth is that the stadium that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.830
 as indicated in this article that no 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.320
 it happens no problem is the king fat 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.470
 stadium that does not project any 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.000
 shadow and they say is the most optimal 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.119
 to be able to play in perfect 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.470
 weather conditions and vision I hope 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.050
