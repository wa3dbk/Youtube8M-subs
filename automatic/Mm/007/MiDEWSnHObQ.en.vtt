00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello to all and welcome to my 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.419
 blog that is worth this honor after the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.919
 triumph of brick leaves to the ground 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.720
 curie and minced meat 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.700
 today I'm going to prepare a recipe 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.969
 always based on brick sheets 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.580
 so it's squares on the other hand 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 in the form of a square of course you can 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.630
 very well prepare them to accompany 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 a salad just for you 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.810
 can prepare for a meal by 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.730
 example because it's pretty sturdy 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.740
 especially for the stuffing you can put 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.140
 really what you want from the tone of 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.550
 salmon there for example I used some 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.730
 onion tomatoes 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.950
 then a salami and cheese and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.230
 1.9 speak opposite that of such 2 to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.660
 3 per person 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.160
 of course you diversify the face there 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.040
 we will first see the ingredients 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 then I massage to the preparation 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.670
 then for the ingredients you need 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.650
 Brick leaves an egg a little bit 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.220
 parsley do not mix with a little bit of 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.720
 coriander 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.910
 of course we could very well 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.060
 replace with shelters provence lane 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.320
 is anything but the cheese mill there 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.880
 I took cumaj reminder you can 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.650
 very well replace it with the 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.370
 mozzarella of goat cheese or 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.750
 any other cheese 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.580
 then half of a tomato that I have 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.380
 cut into small pieces removed on 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.120
 all the juice to prevent the leaves 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.520
 Bread absorbs the juice of the blow I 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.600
 removed the pips and the juice that so 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.420
 the tomato then a little bit a little 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.840
 piece of lyon that I cut in 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.550
 slats and then salami that you 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.640
 can very well replaced with ham 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.290
 turkey ground meat from salmon 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 tuna what you want for them 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.700
 people who eat kosher or halal 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.650
 could very well buy some in the air 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.820
 in butchers could easily 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.990
 find pepper and a little salt 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.270
 for cooking sunflower oil 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.570
 but otherwise you can very well 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.550
 use a little bit of butter like 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.979
 it's very fast to do so I 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.740
 just started by just heating 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.630
 a product sunflower 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.710
 of course you really do not have to flood the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.960
 sunflower oil stove 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.270
 now here I'm going to do I'm going 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.649
 prepare the stuffing 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.720
 then for the preparation of the moments 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.400
 easy to do is fast enough 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.930
 just put a sheet of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.920
 brick on your worktop 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.440
 then I will put some pieces 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.280
 of tomatoes of course for stuffing for 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:35.600
 put what you want here is then the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.600
 salami that I cut into small pieces 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.640
 not sure we should not put a lot 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.269
 so that we can have less 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.120
 to close the sheet of brig then 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:58.799
 do this a little hole in the center like 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:03:00.269
 that's it I'll break the egg meters 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.360
 just a little pepper to raise the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.360
 taste 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.570
 a little salt of course not much 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:14.840
 as the salami is already salty 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.840
 here is the braking 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.799
 and the dove with a little parsley 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.400
 jean guy a little bit of course for the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.080
 quantities you can end 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.390
 could do several it depends on the 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.070
 number of people we help you and 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.400
 then it will be necessary to close the sheet of 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.010
 brig 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.190
 so it's very easy to do as 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.020
 that's it and then the to bend go 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.730
 to close 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.510
 of course it will be necessary to avoid crushing 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.510
 the brick sheet 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.280
 you can very well put a little bit of 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.560
 a little flour diluted in a little water 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.950
 to be able to close the sheet of 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.570
 brig 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.200
 but when I go to ask directly 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.150
 in the pan on this blow you are of course 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.100
 I do not necessarily need the dollar 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.680
 enclosed with flour dilute in water 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.709
 then you do like that here it is 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.390
 must put the fai in the pan 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.430
 so as soon as it is hot will be necessary 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.180
 the break inside I would like to do 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.180
 cook over medium heat 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.930
 here 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:40.090
 the mind relates the first part in 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:42.550
 no more returning the federation she 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.800
 enough to over France he had more 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.379
 of sunflower whose parents canvas 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.379
 us a little more for cooking 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.930
 you find this video on my channel 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.370
 student if on my blog it was 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.390
 not to subscribers for more recipes 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.390
 after far too much sharp
