00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
that's all don't be single unfortunately

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.449 
that's all don't be single unfortunately
he<00:02:42.030> has<00:02:42.480> been<00:02:42.690> seen<00:02:42.900> she<00:02:43.680> has<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.950> kind<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.220> go

shadows

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.970 

so<00:02:55.590> now<00:02:55.800> he's<00:02:56.010> going<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> go<00:02:56.340> behind<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:57.030> guy

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.430 
so I wrote different types of trophy
kills<00:03:03.300> depending<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:03.930> what<00:03:04.080> kind<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.290> enemy

kills depending on what kind of enemy

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.000 
kills depending on what kind of enemy
are<00:03:04.650> facing

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.740 

the<00:03:11.010> here<00:03:11.190> uses<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.700> federer<00:03:12.030> technology<00:03:12.570> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the here uses the federer technology to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:22.390 
the here uses the federer technology to
break<00:03:13.290> open<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:14.220> gate

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.860 

now<00:03:23.400> he's<00:03:23.579> entering<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:24.060> alien<00:03:24.420> vision<00:03:24.689> mode

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
now he's entering the alien vision mode

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.839 
now he's entering the alien vision mode
