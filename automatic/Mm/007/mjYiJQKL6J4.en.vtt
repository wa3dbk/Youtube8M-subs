00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.160
 after analyzing the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.960
 one-handed backhand this week 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.960
 will still point the spotlight on one of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.429
 those shots that if used correctly 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.680
 may prove to be one of the most lethal weapons 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.580
 on the tennis court 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.960
 we are very lucky on atp 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 world tour still to be able to count 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 on the help of a former number 6 of the world e 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.080
 winner of ten tests of the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.630
 circuit facts b first and foremost 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160
 textures will disavow some of the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 accompanying clichÃ©s 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.100
 performing a French want me 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.379
 of the French most important thing 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.450
 I think it's understanding that it's not about 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.090
 hit and stop on contact 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.950
 if you ask a boxing instructor or 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.730
 karate and they will tell you that any 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:56.070
 coup led to the end no 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.879
 you have to hit and stop you lose 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.770
 all the power 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.260
 we must instead prepare the blow very much 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.219
 before the ball arrives otherwise 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.909
 you risk not collecting 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:11.159
 sufficient energy but simple mission 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.680
 let me show you some shots like that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.240
 understand what I'm talking about the Rhine 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.980
 ok ok justin 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.540
 let's say you have to hit one 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.370
 molecule the right to load the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.910
 blow you need to get your hands here 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.500
 in front when you have finished wearing it 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.550
 see how the racket remains open 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.140
 to the sky 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.180
 this allows you to cross the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:40.479
 blow to bring it better and without losing 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.460
 rhythm and strong movement instead of 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.910
 what happens and stopping at contact with 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.979
 the ball 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.130
 you lose all your speed you see it 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.000
 it ends here but you have to close the shot 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.680
 race sentences if you observe latex stepanek 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.960
 mardy fish that are among the best 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.210
 net players you will find that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.740
 they close all their wanting not 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.090
 they would never risk to suffer a 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.160
 passer was gold and pitch or perfect 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.990
 justin so we don't just have to 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.700
 hit the ball but also 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.800
 accompany it to get it right 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 wanted elliot thanks for having 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.000
 highlighted my mistake
