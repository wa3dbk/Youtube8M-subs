00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.140

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.250
 after last year's 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.510
 And yes, I finally made a possible switch to Winnie the Pooh 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.470
 Marquis also with the promises or military attire 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.280
 chosen for the elite and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.780

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.040

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.040
 those who are also there as absolute top favorites away but last weekend one 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.990
 extra amount can still come with it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.120
 yes of course always make it a bit busy 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.500
 but Serbia 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.140
 I think I can handle that pretty well and 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.670
 I just had a lot of faith because the church is the carrier I seen 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.260

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.010
 that in itself was something out of it so 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.980

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.370
 that concerns the NFL 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.440
