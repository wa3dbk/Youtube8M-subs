00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
it on the two arrows that's going to do

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.809 
it on the two arrows that's going to do
two<00:03:01.840> feedings<00:03:02.260> with<00:03:02.560> usually<00:03:02.950> about<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> thirty

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
two feedings with usually about a thirty

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.229 
two feedings with usually about a thirty
second<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.540> minute<00:03:04.930> between<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.530> intervals

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
second to a minute between the intervals

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.120 
second to a minute between the intervals
so<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.269> way<00:03:07.750> it's<00:03:08.140> not<00:03:08.319> dumping<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.860> all<00:03:08.950> at

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
so that way it's not dumping it all at

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.380 
so that way it's not dumping it all at
once<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.550> your<00:03:09.640> fish<00:03:09.819> have<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.030> little<00:03:10.239> bit<00:03:10.360> of

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.270 
once and your fish have a little bit of
time<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.750> eat<00:03:10.989> what<00:03:11.260> was<00:03:11.500> first<00:03:11.709> dumped<00:03:12.040> and

time to eat what was first dumped and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.009 
time to eat what was first dumped and
then<00:03:12.400> they<00:03:12.940> can<00:03:13.060> go<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.269> what<00:03:13.480> secondly<00:03:13.810> was

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
then they can go on what secondly was

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.979 
then they can go on what secondly was
dumped<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.730> say<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.120> want<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.420> do<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.569> second

again<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:40.030> hit<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.329> what<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.810> plus<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:43.239> hit

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
again you hit the what the plus you hit

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.539 
again you hit the what the plus you hit
the<00:03:43.510> plus<00:03:43.720> button<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.709> will<00:03:44.769> add<00:03:44.980> one<00:03:45.340> or

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
the plus button and it will add one or

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.550 
the plus button and it will add one or
two<00:03:45.579> feedings<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:46.959> it's<00:03:47.109> really<00:03:47.320> not

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
two feedings to it so it's really not

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.039 
two feedings to it so it's really not
that<00:03:47.620> difficult<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.400> use<00:03:48.720> if<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.870> have<00:03:50.019> a

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
that difficult to use if you have a

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.490 
that difficult to use if you have a
normal<00:03:50.290> tank<00:03:50.650> setup<00:03:51.989> okay<00:03:52.989> so<00:03:53.049> if<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:53.440> a

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
normal tank setup okay so if you have a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.710 
normal tank setup okay so if you have a
tank<00:03:53.769> setup<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.459> like<00:03:54.549> a<00:03:54.579> normal<00:03:54.760> tank<00:03:55.150> that

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
tank setup just like a normal tank that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.819 
tank setup just like a normal tank that
you'd<00:03:55.840> have<00:03:55.989> your<00:03:56.170> home<00:03:56.380> with<00:03:56.560> your<00:03:56.680> regular

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
you'd have your home with your regular

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.699 
you'd have your home with your regular
hood<00:03:57.480> smooth<00:03:58.480> power<00:03:58.780> cord<00:03:59.109> right<00:03:59.230> there<00:03:59.440> and

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
hood smooth power cord right there and

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.620 
hood smooth power cord right there and
you<00:04:00.010> can<00:04:00.190> basically<00:04:00.609> balance<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.299> right<00:04:01.480> on

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
you can basically balance it right on

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.960 
you can basically balance it right on
the<00:04:01.750> back<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.200> tank<00:04:02.470> as<00:04:02.859> you<00:04:03.609> can<00:04:03.760> see<00:04:03.850> it's

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
the back of the tank as you can see it's

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.490 
the back of the tank as you can see it's
rotating<00:04:04.510> right<00:04:04.690> now<00:04:06.690> they'll<00:04:07.690> dump<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.230> food

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
rotating right now they'll dump the food

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.699 
rotating right now they'll dump the food
in<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.910> you're<00:04:10.209> all<00:04:10.329> set<00:04:10.570> so<00:04:11.440> it's<00:04:11.560> pretty

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
in and you're all set so it's pretty

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.490 
in and you're all set so it's pretty
easy<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.160> use<00:04:12.660> because<00:04:13.660> I<00:04:13.690> just<00:04:13.959> set<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.320> two

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
easy to use because I just set the two

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.050 
easy to use because I just set the two
it<00:04:14.620> will<00:04:14.769> go<00:04:14.920> off<00:04:15.070> at<00:04:15.220> another<00:04:15.489> one<00:04:15.820> minute

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
it will go off at another one minute

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.110 
it will go off at another one minute
interval<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:18.220> yeah<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.430> food's<00:04:18.669> not<00:04:18.910> all

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
interval but yeah the food's not all

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.390 
interval but yeah the food's not all
that<00:04:19.269> much<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:20.320> it's<00:04:20.380> not<00:04:20.560> too<00:04:20.829> bad<00:04:20.859> with<00:04:21.280> my

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
that much so it's not too bad with my

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.100 
that much so it's not too bad with my
tanks<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:21.880> like<00:04:22.060> it<00:04:22.240> because<00:04:22.479> I<00:04:22.510> have<00:04:22.750> just<00:04:22.990> this

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
tanks I like it because I have just this

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.620 
tanks I like it because I have just this
little<00:04:23.349> opening<00:04:23.740> right<00:04:23.770> here<00:04:23.950> I<00:04:24.370> can<00:04:25.210> place<00:04:25.450> it

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
little opening right here I can place it

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.790 
little opening right here I can place it
right<00:04:25.810> here<00:04:25.870> rotate

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
right here rotate

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.820 
right here rotate
Fiza<00:04:27.400> fish<00:04:27.789> no<00:04:28.030> problem<00:04:28.569> but<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.530> one<00:04:29.650> thing

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
Fiza fish no problem but the one thing

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.070 
Fiza fish no problem but the one thing
you<00:04:29.919> want<00:04:30.039> to<00:04:30.129> keep<00:04:30.220> your<00:04:30.370> mind<00:04:30.580> on<00:04:30.819> is<00:04:31.090> the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
you want to keep your mind on is the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.900 
you want to keep your mind on is the
output<00:04:32.349> right<00:04:32.740> here<00:04:32.919> because<00:04:33.250> this<00:04:33.460> can<00:04:33.759> go

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
output right here because this can go

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.089 
output right here because this can go
rather<00:04:34.599> really<00:04:34.960> large<00:04:35.289> or<00:04:35.979> rather<00:04:36.759> small<00:04:37.360> I

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
rather really large or rather small I

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.290 
rather really large or rather small I
usually<00:04:39.099> set<00:04:39.340> mine<00:04:39.550> right<00:04:39.789> at<00:04:39.940> like<00:04:40.150> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
usually set mine right at like the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.339 
usually set mine right at like the
second<00:04:40.750> click<00:04:41.099> you<00:04:42.099> can<00:04:42.129> feel<00:04:42.610> it<00:04:43.169> just<00:04:44.169> about

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
second click you can feel it just about

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.920 
second click you can feel it just about
that<00:04:44.560> big<00:04:44.770> opening<00:04:45.220> away<00:04:46.150> it's<00:04:46.300> not<00:04:46.479> too<00:04:46.720> much

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
that big opening away it's not too much

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.010 
that big opening away it's not too much
and<00:04:47.310> not<00:04:48.310> too<00:04:48.370> little<00:04:48.550> for<00:04:48.879> the<00:04:48.970> fish<00:04:49.240> but<00:04:49.960> it

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
and not too little for the fish but it

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.570 
and not too little for the fish but it
all<00:04:50.110> depends<00:04:50.409> on<00:04:50.500> if<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:50.800> big<00:04:50.979> fish<00:04:51.220> if

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
all depends on if you have big fish if

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.570 
all depends on if you have big fish if
you<00:04:51.970> have<00:04:52.090> fry<00:04:52.389> that<00:04:52.659> you're<00:04:52.780> looking<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.110> feed

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
you have fry that you're looking to feed

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.260 
you have fry that you're looking to feed
you're<00:04:54.580> going<00:04:54.699> to<00:04:54.759> be<00:04:54.849> setting<00:04:55.180> it

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
you're going to be setting it

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.010 
you're going to be setting it
accordingly

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
accordingly

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.100 
accordingly
but<00:04:56.560> just<00:04:56.770> if<00:04:57.159> you<00:04:57.909> have<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.240> do<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.449> test<00:04:58.810> run

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
but just if you have to do a test run

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.279 
but just if you have to do a test run
just<00:04:59.430> hit<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.580> great<00:05:00.849> button<00:05:01.210> it'll<00:05:02.020> do<00:05:02.259> a

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
just hit the great button it'll do a

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.779 
just hit the great button it'll do a
rotation<00:05:02.530> for<00:05:03.130> you<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.340> show<00:05:03.490> how<00:05:03.610> much

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
rotation for you and show how much

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.219 
rotation for you and show how much
you're<00:05:03.940> feeding<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:04.449> usually<00:05:04.750> put<00:05:04.900> mine<00:05:05.080> on

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
you're feeding I usually put mine on

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.830 
you're feeding I usually put mine on
like<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.409> piece<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:05.830> paper<00:05:06.449> that<00:05:07.449> way<00:05:07.630> it's

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
like a piece of paper that way it's

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.649 
like a piece of paper that way it's
sitting<00:05:08.259> right<00:05:08.319> there<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:10.360> can<00:05:10.509> measure

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
sitting right there and you can measure

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.379 
sitting right there and you can measure
out<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.050> food<00:05:11.490> but<00:05:12.490> again<00:05:12.729> like<00:05:12.849> I<00:05:12.970> said<00:05:13.030> don't

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
out the food but again like I said don't

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.640 
out the food but again like I said don't
block<00:05:13.690> this<00:05:14.370> because<00:05:15.370> as<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:15.789> is<00:05:15.940> spinning

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
block this because as it is spinning

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.149 
block this because as it is spinning
this<00:05:17.650> is<00:05:17.860> pulling<00:05:18.219> an<00:05:18.340> air<00:05:18.610> to<00:05:19.770> help<00:05:20.770> with<00:05:21.039> the

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
this is pulling an air to help with the

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.129 
this is pulling an air to help with the
machine<00:05:21.520> run<00:05:21.789> and<00:05:22.030> cool<00:05:22.270> down<00:05:22.569> and<00:05:22.870> keep<00:05:22.990> it

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
machine run and cool down and keep it

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.050 
machine run and cool down and keep it
cool<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:24.370> you<00:05:24.460> definitely<00:05:24.550> don't<00:05:24.789> want<00:05:25.000> to

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
cool so you definitely don't want to

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.640 
cool so you definitely don't want to
black<00:05:25.270> back<00:05:25.629> you<00:05:25.990> might<00:05:26.139> have<00:05:26.289> a<00:05:26.319> little<00:05:26.530> bit

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
black back you might have a little bit

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.800 
black back you might have a little bit
of<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.860> problem<00:05:27.129> right<00:05:27.370> there<00:05:27.610> so<00:05:28.419> again<00:05:28.629> this
