rich<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.580> me<00:00:28.700> it's<00:00:28.939> smoking<00:00:29.330> a<00:00:29.420> lot<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:29.869> it's

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
rich to me it's smoking a lot and it's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.890 
rich to me it's smoking a lot and it's
actually<00:00:30.350> found<00:00:30.770> plugs<00:00:31.310> but<00:00:31.700> once<00:00:32.450> you<00:00:32.570> get<00:00:32.720> up

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
actually found plugs but once you get up

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.080 
actually found plugs but once you get up
on<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.200> pipe<00:00:33.379> and<00:00:33.920> get<00:00:34.220> moving<00:00:34.520> once<00:00:34.850> you<00:00:34.970> get

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
on the pipe and get moving once you get

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
on the pipe and get moving once you get
the<00:00:35.210> throttle<00:00:35.600> down

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
the throttle down

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.470 
the throttle down
it<00:00:36.890> really<00:00:37.100> does<00:00:37.340> move<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:37.879> goes<00:00:38.030> pretty<00:00:38.239> fast

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
it really does move it goes pretty fast

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.689 
it really does move it goes pretty fast
it's<00:00:38.780> got<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.020> dual<00:00:39.230> carb<00:00:39.620> setup<00:00:40.070> still<00:00:40.400> so

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
it's got the dual carb setup still so

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.030 
it's got the dual carb setup still so
the<00:00:40.879> stock<00:00:41.150> carbs<00:00:41.629> with<00:00:42.410> some<00:00:42.620> LRD<00:00:43.370> pipes<00:00:43.760> and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
the stock carbs with some LRD pipes and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.510 
the stock carbs with some LRD pipes and
it<00:00:46.040> revs<00:00:46.280> up<00:00:46.489> moves<00:00:47.300> fast<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:48.100> little<00:00:49.100> scarier

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
it revs up moves fast a little scarier

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.900 
it revs up moves fast a little scarier
just<00:00:50.120> like<00:00:50.270> a<00:00:50.300> normal<00:00:51.190> fancy<00:00:52.190> but<00:00:52.700> other<00:00:52.820> than

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
just like a normal fancy but other than

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.880 
just like a normal fancy but other than
that<00:00:52.970> it's<00:00:53.420> basically<00:00:53.840> stock<00:00:54.140> decided<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.800> the

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
that it's basically stock decided to the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.150 
that it's basically stock decided to the
LRD<00:00:55.280> pipes<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.770> you<00:00:57.770> know<00:00:57.890> some<00:00:58.070> different

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
LRD pipes and you know some different

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.270 
LRD pipes and you know some different
handlebars<00:00:59.140> great<00:01:00.140> little<00:01:00.410> quad<00:01:00.710> I'd

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
handlebars great little quad I'd

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.490 
handlebars great little quad I'd
probably<00:01:02.030> be<00:01:02.480> helping<00:01:02.780> for<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.960> rebuild<00:01:03.350> that

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
probably be helping for a rebuild that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.249 
probably be helping for a rebuild that
put<00:01:03.710> some<00:01:03.890> fresh<00:01:04.160> rings<00:01:04.610> maybe<00:01:05.180> even<00:01:05.570> do<00:01:06.229> a

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
put some fresh rings maybe even do a

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.670 
put some fresh rings maybe even do a
board's<00:01:07.240> new<00:01:08.240> Pistons<00:01:08.750> I'm<00:01:08.930> not<00:01:09.110> sure<00:01:09.320> yet<00:01:09.500> I

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
board's new Pistons I'm not sure yet I

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.620 
board's new Pistons I'm not sure yet I
won't<00:01:09.860> know<00:01:10.009> until<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.340> take<00:01:11.149> a<00:01:11.180> look<00:01:11.420> inside

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
won't know until I take a look inside

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.570 
won't know until I take a look inside
and<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:12.229> feels<00:01:12.470> like<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.800> probably<00:01:13.220> is<00:01:13.369> gonna

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
and it feels like it probably is gonna

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.639 
and it feels like it probably is gonna
need<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:14.060> rebuild<00:01:14.539> here<00:01:14.720> soon<00:01:15.050> it's<00:01:15.350> getting

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
need a rebuild here soon it's getting

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.680 
need a rebuild here soon it's getting
pretty<00:01:15.979> easy<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.369> kick<00:01:16.550> over<00:01:16.729> if<00:01:17.570> the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
pretty easy to kick over if the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.420 
pretty easy to kick over if the
compression<00:01:18.110> is<00:01:18.440> there<00:01:18.680> like<00:01:18.920> it<00:01:19.070> should<00:01:19.250> be

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
compression is there like it should be

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.080 
compression is there like it should be
but<00:01:19.869> great<00:01:20.869> quality<00:01:21.640> probably<00:01:22.640> better<00:01:22.820> shape

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
but great quality probably better shape

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.510 
but great quality probably better shape
than<00:01:23.210> my<00:01:23.360> fan<00:01:23.600> sheet<00:01:23.900> considering<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.740> fact

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
than my fan sheet considering the fact

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.969 
than my fan sheet considering the fact
that<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.760> doesn't<00:01:26.090> have<00:01:26.240> any<00:01:26.830> welds<00:01:27.830> on<00:01:27.950> the

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
that it doesn't have any welds on the

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.179 
that it doesn't have any welds on the
frame<00:01:28.340> or<00:01:29.290> bends<00:01:30.290> or<00:01:30.470> cracks<00:01:30.770> or<00:01:31.100> anything

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
frame or bends or cracks or anything

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:32.920 
frame or bends or cracks or anything
like<00:01:31.580> that<00:01:31.640> it's<00:01:32.090> got<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.390> stock<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.689> arms

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
like that it's got the stock a arms

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.460 
like that it's got the stock a arms
stock<00:01:33.860> shocks<00:01:34.250> though<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:36.049> we're<00:01:36.200> looking<00:01:36.439> to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
stock shocks though so we're looking to

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.800 
stock shocks though so we're looking to
maybe<00:01:36.860> get<00:01:37.189> some<00:01:37.369> better<00:01:38.360> suspension

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
maybe get some better suspension

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.410 
maybe get some better suspension
