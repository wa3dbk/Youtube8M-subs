if<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> watch<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> videos<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
if you want to watch the videos and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
if you want to watch the videos and
better<00:01:39.270> quality<00:01:39.540> don't<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> full<00:01:41.250> screen

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
better quality don't go to full screen

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.789 
better quality don't go to full screen
because<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.689> makes<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> videos<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
because that makes the videos of it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.190 
because that makes the videos of it
lagging<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.430> fuzzy<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.149> stuff<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.110> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
lagging like fuzzy and stuff so when you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.310 
lagging like fuzzy and stuff so when you
want<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:47.220> put<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:48.320> small

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
want to do this just put it on small

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.289 
want to do this just put it on small
screen<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> quality<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.640> better<00:01:50.850> i'll<00:01:51.119> try

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
screen so the quality is better i'll try

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
screen so the quality is better i'll try
to<00:01:51.360> set<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> an<00:01:51.810> HD<00:01:52.140> setting<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.979> gonna

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
to set it to an HD setting it's gonna

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.530 
to set it to an HD setting it's gonna
take<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.520> lot<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.670> megabytes<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.240> i<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540
