you<00:05:51.970> can<00:05:52.090> see<00:05:52.240> bands<00:05:52.450> i<00:05:52.660> activated<00:05:53.140> it's

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
you can see bands i activated it's

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.960 
you can see bands i activated it's
pretty<00:05:53.800> much<00:05:53.979> looks<00:05:54.220> like<00:05:54.280> a<00:05:54.370> delta<00:05:54.760> sees

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970
