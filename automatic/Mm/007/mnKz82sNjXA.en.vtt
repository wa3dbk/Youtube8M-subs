00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:18.530
 well when you see us we start to read 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.880
 javier bonito the good victory 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.410
 very hard work I do not know if necessary 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.600
 after the streak that carried Latin 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.240
 yes clear clear 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.870
 we knew it was going to be a match 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.800
 tremendously intense worked and 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.310
 Needed effectively as you say 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.650
 because after losing at home 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.640
 badly if I am allowed the expression 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.329
 after losing out two games 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.559
 and the team was in need of 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.680
 rediscover yourself apart 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.980
 to give the audience a joy but not 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.230
 I was 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.329
 a triumph that good and more before a great 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.780
 rival or g 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.660
 what was 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.090
 necessary and good welcome and all three 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.420
 hours to pass string alonso novices 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.430
 from sydney lanzarote that was looking for 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.430
 these boat 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.570
 I have a good wide template 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.930
 strong fighter 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.940
 they train well people 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.940
 humble people hungry 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 and good there is internal competition and so 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.700
 so much so that everyone enters the day to 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.740
 day with a lot 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.600
 humility and with great quality and with desire 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.420
 of leaving Sunday and for me the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.210
 hardest job is doing 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.189
 configure the aforementioned list was 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.070
 tejera because it is working as the 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.110
 what more and today will leave tibi out from 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.470
 the 90 mientos was a pain for me 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.100
 great but good the changes had 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.100
 to be like that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.090
 also throw the change that 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.380
 midfield is killed and good 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.440
 is for me a 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.869
 an important job choosing what 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.420
 I think it's better for each game 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.060
 but I insist on the breadth and quality 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.590
 human of the template allows me to 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.590
 Suddenly not to be wrong 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.040
 you are notified of the party that you had 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.989
 imagined all the hours 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.150
 Without a doubt the athletic one of madrid- 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.700
 is the mirror in which we look at ourselves is a 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.890
 team that 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.310
 and we look closely at the fair year 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.500
 Last touched us we was leaving the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.379
 rivals then we saw how he played and 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.540
 we put my players as an example 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.680
 videos of madrid athletic 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.829
 athletic besides this 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.470
 and we knew we know it very well from 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.010
 what 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.420
 alone and we knew that we have to match 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.300
 of the circumstances and it was the match 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.310
 what we imagined we obviously had 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.680
 that dose of fortune that you have to have 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.420
 to win a big one because of the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.040
 stick the two of coast as they are 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.250
 quietly balls that in others 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.050
 circumstances can go inside and not 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.000
 nothing would have happened if they defeated us with 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.280
 that we also had at the end of the game 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.220
 broken a couple of moves I think there would be 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.660
 been very unfair to both teams 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.110
 they had a bulky marker no no what 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.890
 We deserved none was an effort 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.440
 important from the 20 many players 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.800
 28 and good today the fortune did not smile 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.050
 we work the game and I do not have more 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.459
 to congratulate the rival because he is 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.100
 doing record season and it's 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.120
 getting between the teams that 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.120
 in theory this 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.790
 infinitely superior in terms of 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.090
 budget to them that are giving the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.940
 face 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.360
 and I congratulate you 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.140
 and a second to rest let's go back 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.140
 change many things 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.220
 well, it usually stays in the field 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.320
 of the changing room not what he tells us 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.070
 towards outward and for me it would be a 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.750
 position this moment of advantage not 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.790
 because we won and look, I told them this and I 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.480
 I did this and hang up a measure that is not 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.510
 true 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.889
 so I appreciate the question but 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.769
 what happens at half time 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.549
 he usually stays and I think that 's what 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.549
 healthiest for all 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.920
 Sergio Garcia the goal the fight the delivery 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.120
 they have given him a lot of hits 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.540
 raised has not made a bad face today 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.699
 we understand that you do not want to focus 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.770
 the victory today in a player but in 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.960
 all the team but has highlighted by 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.440
 on top of the rest sergio mostly wine 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.130
 of a 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.020
 of a difficult week for him because 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.910
 he suffered a muscular problem and has had 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.370
 that the training level is very high and 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.110
 it is working well and I thought not 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.770
 I arrived honestly I thought not 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.800
 arrived 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.080
 tve did all the headline preparation 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.430
 and I was going to be very 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.820
 quiet 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.520
 sergio put a lot of love into him so much 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.520
 you have to have as leader and captain 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.290
 He showed his face showed his face there and not me 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.030
 he was surprised because I know he is a man 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.150
 who lives intensely and wants a lot 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.160
 these colors 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.910
 well I think it was up to 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.910
 the circumstances 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.820
 mister knock the leader leads the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.750
 team situation after these 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.490
 last three trips, as long as 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.430
 Beyond the leader or not when you come back 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.220
 to the path of triumph in some way 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.710
 stops with the negative dynamics in which 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.580
 was immersed the team is nothing but 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.009
 a favorable result and we can not today 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.360
 we can enjoy it with our people 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.830
 that it's a bit late but good 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.110
 tomorrow we will enter in the morning and it is already 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.900
 tomorrow you have to think about lifting the 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.880
 Saturday at 10 o'clock at night 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.699
 be another party very much like a lot 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.830
 enthusiasm and much war of many the 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.320
 very competitive aerial game top 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.570
 and below and that if we go to sleep and 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.240
 we only play with intensity against 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:13.630
 the big ones like today because we will suffer 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.030
 then evidently your new mind 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.270
 but already this morning you have to think about 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.820
 I raised 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.550
 and it served to break this dynamic 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.300
 that was long over it went through the 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.400
 fifa date was a strong mental stick 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.140
 but deserved on the other hand we had not 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.540
 done more than the rivals in the three 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.540
 you defeat very well thank you very much
