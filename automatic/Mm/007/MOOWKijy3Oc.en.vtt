part that hangs it to the door up here

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.559 
part that hangs it to the door up here
but<00:03:05.969> we<00:03:06.299> did<00:03:06.450> some<00:03:06.659> creative<00:03:07.250> repairing<00:03:08.250> and

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
but we did some creative repairing and

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.910 
but we did some creative repairing and
came<00:03:09.569> up<00:03:09.689> with<00:03:09.720> something<00:03:10.109> sturdy<00:03:10.590> enough<00:03:10.709> to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
came up with something sturdy enough to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.899 
came up with something sturdy enough to
hold<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.819> door<00:03:12.060> there<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.760> now<00:03:14.760> it

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
hold it on to the door there so now it

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.460 
hold it on to the door there so now it
doesn't<00:03:15.120> rattle<00:03:15.450> when<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.810> slam<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.140> door

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
there's a little gap right here and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.649 
there's a little gap right here and
that's<00:03:20.519> because<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:20.849> had<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.150> put<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.359> piece<00:03:21.629> of

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
that's because I had to put a piece of

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.330 
that's because I had to put a piece of
plexiglass<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:23.099> there<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:24.829> mend<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.069> part

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.530 
that was broken but that's not that bad
at<00:03:32.129> least<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.489> looks<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:32.849> a<00:03:32.879> regular<00:03:33.359> door

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
