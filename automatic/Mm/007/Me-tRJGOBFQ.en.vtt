00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.680
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.139
 welcome to apple 5 x 1 welcome to 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.240
 a new news video where good 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.099
 you know we love to report 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 the latest in the latest in the apple world 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.270
 and let's start talking about the ipod 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 because you know that a few days ago because 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.070
 we received an update of these 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.680
 products from Apple and after 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.539
 launch of the music player of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.910
 apple as many have asked what 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.949
 happen with the apple music service if 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.690
 It is compatible with these products as 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.059
 it's logical with an ipod touch if it's 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.520
 compatible since it contains 8.4 help 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 and therefore the system already supports the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.210
 apple music but what happens there 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.920
 will put today ipod shuffle because there 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.989
 many buyers who may have 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.640
 intention to acquire it alone and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.500
 exclusively by making use of apple 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.449
 music then here in up a five for one 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 we can confirm that it is not 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.180
 Compatible ie the music is not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.550
 is going to be able to use in these two ipod 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.110
 for reasons of logic also to see 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.030
 mainly because these two models 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.580
 they do not contain wifi antennas with what 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.830
 apple could control in this case the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.500
 songs that contain these 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.120
 devices according to the same as if 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 the user in the future would be unsubscribed 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.369
 I could not control without the antenna 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.590
 wifi can not control if those 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.180
 songs are still on that device in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.369
 summarized accounts so that you understand 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.990
 to prevent piracy if these 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.420
 devices the nano and the shuffle 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.759
 they lack connectivity with which apple 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.100
 can connect at some point in a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.020
 minimum instant in these teams without 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.970
 be able to logically control that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 these computers make use of music not 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.540
 allowed either because they have achieved 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.170
 the subscription or either because 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.960
 good 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.150
 stretching the case that you can not is 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.159
 definitive because because these teams 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.720
 they do not have wifi point of agreement and because 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.250
 Apple wants to prevent piracy by 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.140
 so much if you buy an important one and a 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.640
 ipod shuffle note that is for 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.659
 using music the old-fashioned way is 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.299
 say getting the songs 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.070
 manually to your device throughout 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.130
 case if you want an ipod touch with apple 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.240
 This music itself will be compatible and 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.860
 that nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.050
 I'm going to leave you in the description 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.030
 an article that we have written in our 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.700
 web with much more information about this 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.260
 more expanded and that surely 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.580
 explain much better than me in this 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.620
 video I do not know why I explain myself wrong 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.630
 even so if you are good and you have 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.340
 compassion giving a like and see you 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.860
 within the short time with more videos here in 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.720
 apple 5 x 1 because I'm fernando and 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.720
 I promise to be clear ciao 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.020
 a moment be clear I mean in the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.550
 next video explain me better though 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.550
 well I think I do not explain myself so badly
