00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.290
 finally our car arrived badly via 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 the time to be able to drive again instead 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.110
 to be stuck in the house and a car 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 arrived but the change has not yet arrived 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.260
 We appreciate that you are driving without 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.990
 nothing to do at home to give a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.380
 A peace out there , and more than that. 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.600
 look for a new sofa for our house 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.359
 former agent will keep the people who are the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.279
 larger more comfortable sofa extremely 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.009
 simple and we want to upgrade 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.620
 so I'm driving on the highway 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.399
 a look at how things are in the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 outside the car and taking enough 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.920
 It gives so you can see that we have the mark of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.620
 tires is that we have a trio with the tires 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.960
 of cars leave but between the tracks 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 in accumulated snow 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 When we 're not walking too much 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.020
 fast this is not a danger but quoting 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.300
 the fast has to change lanes with 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.910
 very careful we can not even 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.760
 see where are the tracks itself 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.430
 this is one of the winter problems 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.130
 Canadian has to deal with this type of 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 funny situation that in some 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 cities say it happens 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 in England for example in some 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.110
 places in england does not take much 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.420
 some places in the united states 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.160
 long so when here it snow 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.820
 guys get desperate stay inside 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.500
 House 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.400
 here in canada fell from snow normal hand 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.250
 Ring the day, nothing happened then anyway. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 are distinct realities and our 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.729
 Here in Canada is this reality. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.620
 here is a normal situation 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.120
 Let's enjoy the day, we will not let it go. 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.780
 so here we do prevent 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.550
 things we want to do and think 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.760
 This is it, folks, we're going to make videos. 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.000
 more complex and as there we 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.729
 time and as things happen 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.310
 at the moment our reality is that 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.770
 we are without our belongings are 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.740
 waiting for change yet then we 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.190
 will not profÃ­cio some consideration only 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.190
 piece 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.030
 let me think 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.330
 You thought too much, did not say anything then. 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.129
 I want to talk today, beauty, people are 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.599
 this, do not forget to leave a taste 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:23.080
 a favorite in the video thank you for 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.080
 attention of all and this is what the patient 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.110
 directly against the burst of 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.320
 snow then gives a good time not 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.100
 know how well the camera but the silveira 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.810
 personally so here it is pretty much a 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.810
 a little dangerous and to be careful
