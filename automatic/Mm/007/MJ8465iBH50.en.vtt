though to see it emerge at that sort of
pace<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.350> said<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.799> those<00:01:19.920> people<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
pace I said you know those people that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.280 
pace I said you know those people that
come<00:01:20.549> out<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> hold<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.210> signs<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.869> slow

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
kind of warning it gives new meaning to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.429 
kind of warning it gives new meaning to
only<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.610> Russia<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.659> seriously<00:01:28.229> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
only in Russia I think but seriously it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.740 
only in Russia I think but seriously it
looks<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:28.950> dangerous<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:30.210> anybody<00:01:30.540> hurt

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
looks a bit dangerous was anybody hurt

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.280 
looks a bit dangerous was anybody hurt
or<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:30.990> any<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> investigation<00:01:32.009> into<00:01:32.280> how

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
or is any kind of investigation into how

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.530 
or is any kind of investigation into how
unsafe<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.680> well<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.060> work<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.450> were

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
unsafe this is well the work there were

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
unsafe this is well the work there were
some<00:01:36.750> bits<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> investigations<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.860> think<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
some bits of investigations I think a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.350 
some bits of investigations I think a
few<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.400> signs<00:01:38.700> would<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.000> been<00:01:39.150> would

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
few more signs would have been would

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
few more signs would have been would
have<00:01:39.509> been<00:01:39.630> nice<00:01:39.810> yes<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.070> each<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
have been nice yes but in each of the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.600 
have been nice yes but in each of the
cases<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.630> aviation<00:01:43.290> authority<00:01:43.890> here

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
