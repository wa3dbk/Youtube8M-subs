full<00:04:13.019> power<00:04:13.260> until<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.829> engine<00:04:14.190> gets<00:04:14.400> up<00:04:14.519> to

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
full power until the engine gets up to

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.400 
full power until the engine gets up to
about<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.940> hundred<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.359> forty<00:04:15.660> degrees<00:04:15.750> and

about a hundred and forty degrees and

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.349 
about a hundred and forty degrees and
this<00:04:16.590> engine<00:04:16.950> was<00:04:17.039> also<00:04:17.370> used<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.849> pontiac

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
this engine was also used in the pontiac

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.500 
this engine was also used in the pontiac
vibe<00:04:18.389> and<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.349> toyota<00:04:19.829> celica<00:04:20.120> GTS<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.419> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
vibe and the toyota celica GTS and the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.480 
vibe and the toyota celica GTS and the
cylinder<00:04:21.930> head<00:04:22.109> was<00:04:22.260> worked<00:04:22.530> over<00:04:22.830> by<00:04:22.860> yamaha

cylinder head was worked over by yamaha

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.820 
cylinder head was worked over by yamaha
so<00:04:23.669> this<00:04:23.849> engine<00:04:24.030> gets<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.690> Toyota<00:04:25.110> but<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.620> revs
