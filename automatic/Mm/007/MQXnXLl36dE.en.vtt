platforming and exploring levels for
each<00:00:37.090> environment<00:00:37.449> there<00:00:37.750> will<00:00:37.840> be<00:00:37.870> daytime

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
each environment there will be daytime

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.290 
each environment there will be daytime
and<00:00:38.860> nighttime<00:00:39.100> portions<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.820> levels<00:00:40.090> so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
and nighttime portions of the levels so

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.910 
and nighttime portions of the levels so
some<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.720> their<00:00:40.840> beat<00:00:41.019> will<00:00:41.260> be<00:00:41.290> some<00:00:41.650> shared

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
some of their beat will be some shared

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.280 
some of their beat will be some shared
areas<00:00:42.280> but<00:00:42.879> because<00:00:43.390> Sonic<00:00:43.629> runs<00:00:43.809> so<00:00:43.960> faster

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
areas but because Sonic runs so faster

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.840 
areas but because Sonic runs so faster
in<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.440> daytime<00:00:44.769> we<00:00:45.339> don't<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:45.610> don't<00:00:45.640> want

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
in the daytime we don't you don't want

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.710 
in the daytime we don't you don't want
to<00:00:45.909> be<00:00:46.000> running<00:00:46.239> through<00:00:46.420> there<00:00:46.540> really

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
to be running through there really

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.170 
to be running through there really
slowly<00:00:47.019> is<00:00:47.290> werehog<00:00:48.010> form<00:00:48.280> so<00:00:48.580> there'll<00:00:49.150> be

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
slowly is werehog form so there'll be

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.610 
slowly is werehog form so there'll be
some<00:00:49.269> areas<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.750> are<00:00:49.870> dedicated<00:00:50.019> to<00:00:50.320> daytime

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
some areas that are dedicated to daytime

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.110 
some areas that are dedicated to daytime
or<00:00:50.769> nighttime<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:54.100> 2d<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.489> 3d<00:00:54.519> shifts<00:00:55.059> is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
or nighttime the 2d to 3d shifts is

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.160 
or nighttime the 2d to 3d shifts is
another<00:00:55.299> great<00:00:55.510> thing<00:00:55.690> about<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:56.019> game<00:00:56.140> that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
another great thing about the game that

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.149 
another great thing about the game that
we're<00:00:56.409> really<00:00:56.589> proud<00:00:56.830> of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
lots of Sonic fans have been asking for

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.469 
lots of Sonic fans have been asking for

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
a return to the Genesis roots and saying

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.539 
a return to the Genesis roots and saying
they<00:01:01.570> missed<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.960> 2d<00:01:02.290> platforming<00:01:03.159> aspects

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.219 
they missed the 2d platforming aspects
of<00:01:03.670> Sonic<00:01:03.970> and<00:01:04.239> we're<00:01:04.600> really<00:01:04.720> happy<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.019> bring

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229

that back with this game and so

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.570 
that back with this game and so
basically<00:01:07.090> during<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.780> daytime<00:01:08.049> gameplay<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
basically during the daytime gameplay it

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.300 
basically during the daytime gameplay it
shifts<00:01:09.940> perspective<00:01:10.540> on<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.810> fly<00:01:10.990> as<00:01:11.290> as<00:01:11.890> its

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
shifts perspective on the fly as as its

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.890 
shifts perspective on the fly as as its
suited<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:13.000> different<00:01:13.240> parts<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.690> level

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
suited to different parts of the level

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.060 
suited to different parts of the level
you<00:01:13.930> go<00:01:14.110> going<00:01:14.380> through<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.560> loop<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.950> looks

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
you go going through a loop that looks

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.279 
you go going through a loop that looks
really<00:01:15.280> cool<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.640> in<00:01:15.880> 2d<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.600> control<00:01:16.990> system

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
really cool in in 2d the control system

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:18.539 
really cool in in 2d the control system
has<00:01:17.409> been<00:01:17.590> improved<00:01:17.829> lots<00:01:18.189> of<00:01:18.280> things<00:01:18.460> have

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.010 
to the fans and it's also being built on
a<00:01:27.729> new<00:01:27.850> engine<00:01:28.060> technology<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.750> Hedgehog

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
a new engine technology the Hedgehog

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.690 
a new engine technology the Hedgehog
engine<00:01:29.320> which<00:01:29.799> has<00:01:29.920> been<00:01:30.100> in<00:01:30.219> development<00:01:30.640> to

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
engine which has been in development to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.880 
engine which has been in development to
Sega<00:01:30.909> Japan<00:01:31.179> since<00:01:31.390> 2005<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.619> werehog

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
Sega Japan since 2005 so the werehog

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.399 
Sega Japan since 2005 so the werehog
sonic<00:01:33.850> loses<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.109> kind<00:01:35.320> of<00:01:35.380> a

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
sonic loses is it's a kind of a

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.929 
sonic loses is it's a kind of a
transformation<00:01:35.799> that<00:01:36.219> Sonic<00:01:36.490> has<00:01:36.579> made<00:01:36.789> to

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
transformation that Sonic has made to

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.940 
transformation that Sonic has made to
undergo<00:01:37.149> by<00:01:37.420> Eggman<00:01:37.810> but<00:01:37.960> he's<00:01:38.079> captured<00:01:38.469> and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
undergo by Eggman but he's captured and

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.620 
undergo by Eggman but he's captured and
Eggman<00:01:39.219> uses<00:01:39.520> these<00:01:39.640> Chaos<00:01:39.969> Emeralds<00:01:40.390> on<00:01:40.509> them

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
Eggman uses these Chaos Emeralds on them

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.359 
Eggman uses these Chaos Emeralds on them
and<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.499> creates<00:01:41.740> kind<00:01:41.859> of<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.039> chaotic

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
and so it creates kind of a chaotic

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.690 
and so it creates kind of a chaotic
random<00:01:42.999> effect<00:01:43.509> on<00:01:43.780> Sonic<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:45.310> strips

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
random effect on Sonic and it strips

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.459 
random effect on Sonic and it strips
them<00:01:45.820> with<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:45.999> superpowers<00:01:46.689> but<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.140> grants

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
them with the superpowers but it grants

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.899 
them with the superpowers but it grants
