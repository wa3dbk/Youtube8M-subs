00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.900
 others here for tablet lobby i have 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.369
 with me just the vodafone smart tab 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.200
 13.1, a new tablet is included 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.939
 Vodafone could appear like her name 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.060
 We've got politics here 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.320
 10.1 inch display resolution of the 1280 x 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.660
 800 pixels 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.060
 in there is a 1.2 ghz quad 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.850
 processor from mediatek as well 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.540
 gigabytes of memory and 16 gb flash 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.430
 Storage 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.170
 because the tablet appears at Gudrun 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.910
 of course a 3g module 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.890
 Integrated on it runs Android 4.2.2010 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.240
 final version will be from vodafone 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.640
 be a bit adapted to that then 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.740
 We will see if it looks up 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.110
 the market always comes quite to the 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.590
 tray around here around the vodafone smart 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.870
 tab 13.1 they have a small one up here 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.150
 have webcam on this page at one 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.980
 series of connections could this 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.309
 flap here is a ten fight 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.170
 holethowe micro sd card slot 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.110
 We also have a micro usb 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.630
 connection as well as a micro hdmi 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.820
 connection a loudspeaker then just 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.729
 Up here we have the power button one 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.640
 headset in or out and a microphone 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.409
 on the other side is not too 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.690
 but on the back we have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.940
 another camera is two 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.040
 speakers and the round monopoly 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.670
 logo underneath a logo of 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.430
 lenovo 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 So make the device that the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.090
 Processing is all right it is 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.220
 completely plastic and I do not think so 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 that vodafone will be too much money 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.290
 will demand that I hope so at least 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.540
 but the workmanship is quite in 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.850
 order it is relatively thin there is also 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.729
 It will cover 10 inches of tablets 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.040
 I like in any case, as I said 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.750
 miditec processor so i think so too 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.000
 is not likely to be expensive 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.690
 I am leading the apple blog of many 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.690
 thanks to see
