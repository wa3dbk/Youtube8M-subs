craft<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.960> found<00:00:22.199> out<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.650> actually<00:00:23.070> called

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
craft I found out it is actually called

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.130 
craft I found out it is actually called
I<00:00:24.710> think<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:27.359> while<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.689> loading<00:00:27.779> up<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
I think and while it's loading up the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.839 
I think and while it's loading up the
world<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.949> prove<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.670> do

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
world I'm just going to prove that I do

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.740 
world I'm just going to prove that I do
have<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.599> expensive<00:00:31.260> graphics<00:00:31.830> club<00:00:32.750> so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
have these expensive graphics club so

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.030 
have these expensive graphics club so
that<00:00:33.800> in<00:00:34.800> through<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:37.620> takes<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.920> little

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that in through this it takes a little

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
that in through this it takes a little
while<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> load<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> terrain<00:00:39.710> I<00:00:42.079> think

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
while to load up the terrain I think

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.270 
while to load up the terrain I think
it's<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> roll<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> under<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it's going to roll it under in the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.619 
it's going to roll it under in the
distance<00:00:44.640> far<00:00:46.100> anyway<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.300> what<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
distance far anyway just see what you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.580 
distance far anyway just see what you
can<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.309> not<00:00:50.309> very<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.270> okay<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
can see it's Depot's GTX but you can't

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.830 
can see it's Depot's GTX but you can't
really<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> year<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.789> model<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.539> cars

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
really see the year the model of cars

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.670 
really see the year the model of cars
really<00:00:58.109> well<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:02.070> there<00:01:02.280> anyway

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
really well you can see there anyway

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.149 
really well you can see there anyway
back<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.710> business

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.370 

ok<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.610> here's<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> game<00:01:15.080> same<00:01:16.080> thing<00:01:16.259> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
ok so here's the game same thing is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.880 
ok so here's the game same thing is
before<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.310> side<00:01:17.520> screens<00:01:17.909> looking<00:01:18.890> super

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
before the side screens looking super

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.140 
before the side screens looking super
weird<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:21.200> mean<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.799> theory<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> be

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
weird I mean is theory it's going to be

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.590 
weird I mean is theory it's going to be
great<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:26.250> don't<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.420> I'm

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
great but I really I don't like it I'm

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.789 
great but I really I don't like it I'm
probably<00:01:28.729> never<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.420> play<00:01:30.799> with

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
probably never really going to play with

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.170 
probably never really going to play with
it<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.810> also<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.200> thing<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.619> found

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
it like this also one thing that I found

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
it like this also one thing that I found
is<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:36.750> lags<00:01:37.140> out<00:01:37.409> when<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.619> find

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
is that it really lags out when I find

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.420 
is that it really lags out when I find
an<00:01:38.040> enemy<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.460> fight<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.270> yeah<00:01:39.900> 690<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:41.189> great

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
an enemy to fight so yeah 690 not great

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
an enemy to fight so yeah 690 not great
for<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.240> ever<00:01:42.329> actually<00:01:42.540> got<00:01:42.810> into<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
for that if you ever actually got into a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.929 
for that if you ever actually got into a
fight<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.460> only<00:01:44.820> been

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
