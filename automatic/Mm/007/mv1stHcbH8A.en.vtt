00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:17.700
 when I like the standard oil game but 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:19.560
 seeing this gentlemen and the reaction that 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.810
 any video gamer should 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.060
 have when someone attacks a title 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.370
 that he likes ie he should pass 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.740
 go ahead and keep playing with it 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.480
 at most he could say or to me 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.640
 game like we play you don't like it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 Sticazzi Do n't Play With It 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.470
 ok what happens though that happens 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.720
 sometimes mechanisms are created 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.060
 very similar to the football cheering in which 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.320
 you keep that team so much 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.530
 that only see the colors of a team 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 opponent comiti or I don't know if you 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.250
 they say that there was no such penalty 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.020
 just and there was just you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.210
 however it is stubborn for a corner 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.430
 bastard rather than admit that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.800
 that rigor was there and also that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.720
 which is happening below by some 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.439
 games we have not spoken ill of 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.840
 skyrim of words instead be quiet 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.069
 but to say I want to see that bar at a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.889
 world of tanks e. outline game 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:18.389
 even there they came to look though 

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:20.189
 careful guys you have to go to 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:22.740
 reread the comments there is a bit of history 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.119
 returned sic story of us said we are 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.399
 breaking the balls is slow 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.439
 stick will come to mind they are unworkable 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.359
 there are people who told us but by force 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.689
 after a month you play starts at 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.609
 mesh eye around 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.560
 but boys will come back after a game 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.929
 after a month you play but how long 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.109
 free you have in your life 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.600
 however, however, something happened that 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.240
 we did not expect and we thought 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.450
 to do something and relax like a 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.310
 stock exchange yes with then a floor yes the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.840
 problem 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.960
 the problem is that there it is unleashed 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.450
 hell because we thought of how 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.700
 contests you can't defend those bugs 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.259
 just as you can't defend a system 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.270
 pointing at which at some point 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.710
 it slows the world down and you can't aim 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.780
 like God commands 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.819
 instead if almost below there are people who have 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.010
 made of scientific treatises for 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.910
 defend certain game mechanics that 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.709
 they are objectively a shit though us 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.019
 we also understood why in reality 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.730
 it was a tot of people who 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.050
 we are part of the same clan and that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.890
 you are a manforte 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.090
 come these south and bastards come to 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.860
 shoot on the red cross that these 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.630
 quasano saying but to our game 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.489
 we play every night but from 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.560
 these are called mark healey in floor 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.739
 it's pretty much reacted to this 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.739
 way 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.220
 but this game will be playing with it 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.730
 what the fuck did you say a game of 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.730
 shit 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.180
 ok so this is how the fan boy reacts no 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.709
 then we who is the message that 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.440
 we want to send these people 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.170
 first point because we take on the first 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.030
 not to take ourselves seriously but feel it 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.280
 the tune under the video you are 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.989
 there are many subscribers but now no longer for 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.200
 many of you are registered on the e channel 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.140
 they know that if the pampas start, the pope will come 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:32.010
 let 's get fucked they are fucking videos 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:34.500
 you take it the same but because I am 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.359
 facts like this 9 are made this way but there is none 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.950
 take it if I delete the comments 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.079
 where he gives us register directors 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.720
 incompetent because we of neeson ve 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.819
 let's give them to you let's see to play 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.170
 obviously girl who is so working 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.790
 we said we want a million 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.299
 assholes that I want a million 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.909
 assholes down here that tell me bad 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.799
 because we want to know we want to know 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.049
 we were obviously referring to fan boys who 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.120
 we did not believe we were told 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.400
 we were referring to the people one would of 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.799
 sure, fierce against us has happened 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.269
 and it happens so we were right ie 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.190
 fortunately you have not been a 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.530
 million assholes but 56 stron 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.930

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.599
 millions that is then you complain if you 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.250

 us because the fuck can't be admired 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.930
 while the world slows down for those who are there 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.840

 and you want to do it politely there is a way 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.249
 to do it 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.169
 that you don't speak a whole page of 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:11.919
 youtube and among other things if we block the 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.539
 comments 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.699
 the reason is not to spoil even the 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.779
