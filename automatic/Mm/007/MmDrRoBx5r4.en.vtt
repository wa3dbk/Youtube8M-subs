alright<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:13.820> now<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.450> what<00:02:14.600> i'm<00:02:14.780> going<00:02:15.110> to<00:02:15.200> do

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
alright so now now what i'm going to do

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.440 
alright so now now what i'm going to do
i'm<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:15.740> going<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> hook<00:02:16.580> up<00:02:16.760> cables<00:02:17.270> to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
i'm just going to hook up cables to

i'm just going to hook up cables to
those<00:02:17.630> mics<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.410> then<00:02:18.890> let's<00:02:19.130> see<00:02:19.310> how<00:02:20.240> it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
those mics and then let's see how it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:33.750 
those mics and then let's see how it
sounds

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.550 

right<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.090> we<00:02:35.300> can<00:02:35.420> see<00:02:35.480> from<00:02:35.810> this<00:02:36.050> the

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
right so as we can see from this the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.430 
right so as we can see from this the
cables<00:02:36.950> are<00:02:37.130> not<00:02:37.370> quite<00:02:38.209> long<00:02:38.510> enough<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:39.230> go

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
cables are not quite long enough to go

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280 
cables are not quite long enough to go
into<00:02:39.620> my<00:02:39.890> room<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.400> I'm<00:02:41.209> going<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.630> extend<00:02:41.900> them

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
into my room so I'm going to extend them

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.390 
into my room so I'm going to extend them
with<00:02:42.500> another<00:02:42.980> cable<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:43.970> have<00:02:44.150> cables

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
with another cable and now I have cables

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.660 
with another cable and now I have cables
connected<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:47.120> interface<00:02:48.459> doesn't<00:02:49.459> look

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
connected the interface doesn't look

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.160 
connected the interface doesn't look
pretty<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.540> works<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.850> anyway<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:54.050> let's

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
pretty but it works so anyway so let's

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.680 
pretty but it works so anyway so let's
check<00:02:55.780> all<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.840> look<00:02:57.319> so<00:02:57.500> bad<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.360> let's<00:02:59.360> fix

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
check all that look so bad so let's fix

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
right so now that we have that let's

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:21.749 
right so now that we have that let's
check<00:05:13.220> it<00:05:13.340> out<00:05:13.460> so<00:05:14.389> here<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:14.870> just<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:15.440> room

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
and if we compress it quite a bit so

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:46.630 
and if we compress it quite a bit so
let's<00:05:27.380> take<00:05:27.680> their<00:05:30.910> rock<00:05:31.910> my<00:05:32.150> room<00:05:32.449> present

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.800 

I'm<00:05:47.640> actually<00:05:47.790> in<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.150> beginning<00:05:48.510> we<00:05:48.630> can

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
I'm actually in the beginning we can

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.440 
I'm actually in the beginning we can
hear<00:05:49.050> that<00:05:49.200> we<00:05:49.380> have<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:50.030> ventilation<00:05:51.030> thing

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
maybe not the best place because it has

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.580
