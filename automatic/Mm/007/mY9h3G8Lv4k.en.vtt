00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
sort of cloaking issue will I get into a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.450 
sort of cloaking issue will I get into a
penalty<00:01:03.840> from<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.199> perspective<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.979> the

answer is no for the following reason

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
answer is no for the following reason
cloaking<00:01:08.549> looks<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> difference<00:01:09.510> between

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
cloaking looks at the difference between

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
cloaking looks at the difference between
what<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.170> returned<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> main<00:01:11.010> Googlebot

essence all we ask you to do to avoid

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.069 
essence all we ask you to do to avoid
any<00:01:41.250> cloaking<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:42.180> regular<00:01:42.659> Googlebot

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
any cloaking is if regular Googlebot

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.260 
any cloaking is if regular Googlebot
comes<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.740> web<00:01:43.890> crawler<00:01:44.189> treat<00:01:44.850> us<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.149> like
