happiness<00:01:44.779> we<00:01:44.899> have<00:01:44.929> to<00:01:45.109> throw<00:01:45.349> some<00:01:45.560> some

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:46.279 
happiness we have to throw some some

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.370 
happiness we have to throw some some
grit<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.999> I<00:01:47.270> think<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.569> camps<00:01:47.929> allow<00:01:48.139> us<00:01:48.289> to

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
grit and I think the camps allow us to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.169 
grit and I think the camps allow us to
do<00:01:48.529> that<00:01:48.679> they<00:01:48.950> get<00:01:49.099> athletes<00:01:49.549> coming<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:49.969> from

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
do that they get athletes coming in from

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.149 
do that they get athletes coming in from
across<00:01:50.450> around<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:50.990> country<00:01:51.349> who've<00:01:51.979> been

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
across around the country who've been

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.249 
across around the country who've been
working<00:01:52.490> hard<00:01:52.700> as<00:01:52.849> well<00:01:52.999> who<00:01:53.810> may<00:01:53.959> be<00:01:54.020> in

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
working hard as well who may be in

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.809 
working hard as well who may be in
environments<00:01:55.159> that<00:01:55.219> are<00:01:55.310> better<00:01:55.490> for<00:01:55.700> them

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
environments that are better for them

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.909 
environments that are better for them
for<00:01:56.029> their<00:01:56.179> development<00:01:56.689> than<00:01:57.229> perhaps<00:01:57.469> here

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:57.919 
for their development than perhaps here

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:59.349 
for their development than perhaps here
and<00:01:58.099> here<00:01:58.340> we've<00:01:58.490> got<00:01:58.609> athletes<00:01:59.029> who<00:01:59.119> are<00:01:59.209> here

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
and here we've got athletes who are here

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.419 
and here we've got athletes who are here
that<00:01:59.599> should<00:02:00.380> be<00:02:00.529> kind<00:02:00.709> of<00:02:00.770> at<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:00.950> top<00:02:01.159> of<00:02:01.340> the

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
that should be kind of at the top of the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.729 
that should be kind of at the top of the
game<00:02:01.609> in<00:02:02.029> terms<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.479> development<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.229> now

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
game in terms of development and now

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.099 
game in terms of development and now
they<00:02:03.950> all<00:02:04.069> get<00:02:04.219> to<00:02:04.310> challenge<00:02:04.489> each<00:02:04.789> other<00:02:05.109> for

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
they all get to challenge each other for

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.070 
they all get to challenge each other for
a<00:02:06.139> spot<00:02:07.099> on<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.279> 12-man<00:02:07.880> roster<00:02:07.929> so<00:02:08.929> that

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
a spot on that 12-man roster so that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.900 
a spot on that 12-man roster so that
competition<00:02:09.800> between<00:02:09.950> positions<00:02:10.670> and

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
competition between positions and

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.600 
competition between positions and
between<00:02:11.120> players

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
between players

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.430 
between players
it<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:13.090> another<00:02:13.360> reason<00:02:13.750> why<00:02:13.840> these<00:02:13.900> camps<00:02:14.320> are

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
it is another reason why these camps are

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.500 
it is another reason why these camps are
so<00:02:14.590> important<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.490> course<00:02:15.550> we'd<00:02:16.030> love<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.240> have

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
so important of course we'd love to have

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.660 
so important of course we'd love to have
a<00:02:16.750> huge<00:02:17.110> resident<00:02:17.560> residency<00:02:18.070> program<00:02:18.490> but

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
a huge resident residency program but

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.070 
a huge resident residency program but
that's<00:02:18.760> not<00:02:18.880> feasible<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.540> that's<00:02:19.660> not<00:02:19.750> also

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
that's not feasible and that's not also

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.140 
that's not feasible and that's not also
viable<00:02:20.560> for<00:02:21.040> some<00:02:21.220> rugby<00:02:21.400> players<00:02:21.700> where<00:02:22.000> they

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
viable for some rugby players where they

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.690 
viable for some rugby players where they
are<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.480> their<00:02:22.570> life<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.980> it's<00:02:24.340> giving<00:02:24.610> them

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
are in their life so it's giving them

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.300 
are in their life so it's giving them
every<00:02:24.970> opportunity<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:26.260> still<00:02:26.530> compete<00:02:26.740> for<00:02:27.250> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
every opportunity to still compete for a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.970 
every opportunity to still compete for a
place<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.090> USA<00:02:28.510> sevens<00:02:28.960> team<00:02:29.200> whilst

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
place in the USA sevens team whilst

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.500 
place in the USA sevens team whilst
recognizing<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.790> they<00:02:30.940> have<00:02:31.090> other<00:02:31.240> things

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
recognizing that they have other things

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.570 
recognizing that they have other things
going<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:31.960> their<00:02:32.080> life<00:02:32.230> as<00:02:32.470> well<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.980> you

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
going on in their life as well and you

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.640 
going on in their life as well and you
know<00:02:33.700> we<00:02:33.970> need<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.360> bring<00:02:34.570> competition<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
know we need to bring competition and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.590 
know we need to bring competition and
the<00:02:36.280> reality<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.000> they<00:02:37.150> all<00:02:37.300> have<00:02:37.480> the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
the reality is that they all have the

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.090 
the reality is that they all have the
world<00:02:37.840> benchmarks<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.500> we<00:02:38.590> require<00:02:38.920> from<00:02:39.010> a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
world benchmarks that we require from a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.260 
world benchmarks that we require from a
conditioning<00:02:39.520> perspective<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.090> whether

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
conditioning perspective so whether

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.030 
conditioning perspective so whether
you're<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> remote<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:40.840> residency<00:02:41.350> if<00:02:41.680> you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
you're a remote or residency if you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.710 
you're a remote or residency if you
don't<00:02:42.250> hit<00:02:42.430> those<00:02:42.550> conditioning<00:02:43.120> benchmarks

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
don't hit those conditioning benchmarks

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.740 
don't hit those conditioning benchmarks
you<00:02:43.900> won't<00:02:44.410> get<00:02:44.590> picked<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.760> why<00:02:46.390> would<00:02:46.600> we

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
you won't get picked so why would we

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.990 
you won't get picked so why would we
stand<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.320> way<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.800> remote<00:02:48.430> guy<00:02:48.670> who<00:02:48.730> is

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
stand in the way of a remote guy who is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.790 
stand in the way of a remote guy who is
doing<00:02:49.209> all<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.420> work<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.500> hard<00:02:50.739> work

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
doing all that work all that hard work

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.030 
doing all that work all that hard work
away<00:02:51.310> from<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.840> residency<00:02:53.410> program<00:02:53.830> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
away from the residency program and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.520 
away from the residency program and
still<00:02:54.610> putting<00:02:55.030> himself<00:02:55.209> in<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.989> position<00:02:56.110> to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
still putting himself in a position to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.810 
still putting himself in a position to
compete<00:02:56.890> when<00:02:57.430> we<00:02:57.520> call<00:02:57.700> these

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
compete when we call these

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.250 
compete when we call these
high-performance<00:02:58.090> camps<00:02:58.570> then<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.050> shows

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
high-performance camps then that shows

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.750 
high-performance camps then that shows
real<00:02:59.470> determination<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.340> shows<00:03:00.550> real

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
real determination that shows real

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.229 
real determination that shows real

commitment and a real desire and I

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.000 
commitment and a real desire and I
believe<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.810> believe<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.440> those<00:03:05.560> are<00:03:05.770> key

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
believe I believe that those are key

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.979 
believe I believe that those are key
values<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.450> want<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.720> be<00:03:07.810> successful

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
values that if you want to be successful

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.080 
values that if you want to be successful
not<00:03:08.500> only<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.709> rugby<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.220> life<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.640> you

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
not only in rugby but in life that you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.270 
not only in rugby but in life that you
need<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.360> possess<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.739> want<00:03:11.950> competition

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
need to possess so we want competition

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.310 
need to possess so we want competition
competition<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.239> part<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.570> life<00:03:13.750> it's<00:03:13.989> good<00:03:14.200> in

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
competition is part of life it's good in

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.550 
competition is part of life it's good in
life<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:16.090> would<00:03:16.209> be<00:03:16.330> very<00:03:16.450> stale<00:03:16.930> if<00:03:17.410> we

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
life and it would be very stale if we

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.440 
life and it would be very stale if we
just<00:03:17.769> had<00:03:17.890> residency<00:03:18.519> players<00:03:18.760> competing<00:03:19.299> for

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
just had residency players competing for

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.600 
just had residency players competing for
12<00:03:19.690> spots<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.290> we<00:03:20.890> wanted<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.190> keep<00:03:21.370> things

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610
