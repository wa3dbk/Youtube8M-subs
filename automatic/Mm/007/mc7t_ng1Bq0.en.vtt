00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.070
 how to have creative in survival so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.870
 simple this is a list where you have 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.239

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.260
 is what is in minecraft and neither here what 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.150
 you have a simple list is not 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.979
 living is very simple to use only 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.769
 give a touch and you can add 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.119
 164 It's not at all complicated to seriously 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.190
 links are here below and this is in 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:02.010
 Spanish obviously 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.799
 this a credit area mind the channel that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.140
 he translated it as the baby miguel 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.119
 people here is your forum and well 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.490
 here I made a correction if it is already 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.280
 because I'm not very perfectionist 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.899
 perhaps this part more than anything is in 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.190
 that of the blocks I think sometimes not 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.200
 of the decoration block but wrong 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:26.220
 I remember this fart that wii 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.440
 zzzz and it is obviously is here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.470
 this is the for example the red cube does not 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.170
 of those of the fungus eyes and in the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.990
 which follows is what the stem may be or 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 the trunk in that is the coffee and the trunk 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.750
 of the fungus that then good and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.909
 just that correction down here 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.159
 I also leave my version not upset 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.770
 this corrected more specific and also 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.899
 I corrected this way dyes dye 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.310
 black way sting had us not only 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.530
 it's dye I say because there are people who 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.850
 really do not know that everything with this nor 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.500
 will be confused when it comes to wanting 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.590
 find the black dye then good 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.619
 he invited simple but essences 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.030
 I did it but I also leave you my 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.159
 version and so you want the version 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.740
 original of the creator because you only need 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.440
 forum and there the downloads goes then 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.580
