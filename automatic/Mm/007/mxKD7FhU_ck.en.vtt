00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.430
 boys unfortunately or cold then 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.320
 if a few words came out very sla 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.850
 cited to them make us case 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.440
 hello everyone but you from the jet and beside the 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.970
 our game that speaks and today I am 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.650
 come back with a video really 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.390
 innovative guys both from the point of 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.830
 view of the gameplay is from the point of 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.350
 view of the con m and its contents 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.510
 of course I introduce very briefly 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.879
 this game is a world record 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.010
 just innovative guys I know why the 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.989
 our gigi and fall yen did the first 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.820
 double nuclears solo by jump shot 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.230
 dusting every gem he will have to 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.640
 do it in jump flot as it is doing 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.989
 right at this moment as you see 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.850
 so you guys absolutely must 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.920
 pass from the book of aliens that yes 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.059
 will find in the description why really me 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.620
 really less red girls 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.970
 conceive how he could do 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.100
 a gameplay of the genre then guys 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.690
 big ups for him past half of the site 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.520
 his channel but as I had already anticipated 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.350
 also comment enough 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.239
 innovative at least I hope because how 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.129
 you know all of you keep writing 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.330
 that is, not all of course for some 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.040
 of you they write us that we are now 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.690
 always making videos all the same and 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.550
 then so called why not try 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.619
 bring some innovation here with a 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.050
 good commentaries what is it guys 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.030
 essentially it's a quiz you all know 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.220
 that you are really attracted to here 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.650
 especially prizes because if the boys 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.659
 who will win this quiz will have 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.310
 a special special prize that you 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.510
 will exhibit in my next video when 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.340
 will decide the winner 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.470
 to participate in the crazy ones it is enough only 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.210
 write the answers in the comments 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.100
 as little time as possible due to the sites 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.659
 time counts or the first that will succeed 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.280
 to respond correctly to all 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.659
 questions below in the comments 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.030
 will succeed in winning precisely this quiz 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.340
 I'm sorry for those who unfortunately maybe 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.080
 will see the video a little later and but not 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.030
 worry because I will like it 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.420
 however the idea also others later e 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.000
 maybe I will expose the news anyway 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.130
 couple of videos first press first before always 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.320
 of a stuttering dad's band and 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.700
 so guys besides the answers to 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.170
 also write questions below in the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.610
 comments if you like the idea because 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.290
 I'm really putting a lot of effort into it 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.450
 to bring much more innovation is 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.579
 much more public in Canada than the clan 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.820
 let me know if my green effort has 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.250
 paid off in the video 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.930
 three ways I would be really happy 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.580
 boys anyway no more talk 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.960
 center the bands we start immediately with the 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.790
 first question then I remind you of 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.700
 write below in the comments 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.260
 for example one is the aboc non answer 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.880
 it was necessary to write the whole name 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.130
 because anyway if nov takes too much 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.230
 time you may not have beaten anymore 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.360
 however first question what is behind it 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:35.630
 to the acronym jtf a jolly of the fido bild 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.550
 joint task force today jimmy please 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.610
 poor boys you know very well that 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.410
 the acronym is the are three letters jtf ci 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.150
 is a name behind this gdf is not 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.160
 written so randomly one of these three is 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.940
 with the right answer, write it in 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.860
 comments 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.530
 right now I feel a little like 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.450
 carlo accounts of the stomper pubs at first 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.190
 I'm forgotten, I advise you to stop 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.200
 the video to each question precisely for 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.239
 enter your answer otherwise not do 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.160
 do you remember everyone goes well I think 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.220
 that in any case you are not stupid had it 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.180
 already thought, however, second question 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:13.250
 how many clan members are in all a 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.590
 12 21 today 17 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 ok you know all of you will be wanting 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.570
 said c 17 as a dragon ball will do at least 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.370
 you have ever seen dragon ball 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.930
 please don't tell me you never have 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.030
 seen dragon ball stopped because 61 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.980
 make the comment that third question qual 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.320
 is the world record we got on 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.019

 all c the largest number of ken in one 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.290
 single game but answered naturally 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.150
 in the comments I only remind you with le 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.640
 letters because otherwise I also use them 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.920
 a figure to look at them all fourth 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.209
 boys question what and how old is 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.370
 the oldest member 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.959
 you know we are of enough clan 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.150
 young in the sense there are many 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.280
 boys in sex levels in the good 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.690
 sense of the word but there are also from 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.790
 fairly elderly members 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.650

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.460

 connoisseurs do not like parmesan 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:14.090
 reggiano for true connoisseurs but away 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.740
 part the songs I ask a question what 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:22.550
 is the title of the intro song 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:26.780

 absolutely girls go on youtube 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.199
 to look for songs because I am 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.000
 youtube partner I can watch videos 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.550
 that you look and therefore absolutely 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.880
 if I see that you have been looking for songs 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.639
 unfortunately I will have to cancel the answer 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.349
 last question we got to the last one 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.570
 question finally this is the question 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.280
 more important than all boys though 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.870
 will you be able to respond adequately to 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.909

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.669
 they will have meant how much you love the jay 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:58.819

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.159

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.759
 missimi va bè boys bars 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.009
 stupid 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.300
 let me know in the comments if this 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.069
 kind of video so pretty 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.810
 entertaining quiz ways can you 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.210
 interesting because as I already have it 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.800
 said I really like to entertain the 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.930
 people in the best way why 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.030
 absurd gameplay as are those that you 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.919
 we bring here on the grain of the clan must 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.930
 be of necessity accompanied by a 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.659
 comment was the pleasant listenable 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.190
 absurd and above all entertaining and 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.509
 I really hope you and me comment 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.849
 reflect these characteristics 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.969
 just listed because otherwise I make a 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:32.009
 bit of a shitty figure 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.569
 but really seriously girls I put 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.429
 a lot of commitment because they believe in 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.139
 strength in the commentaries I believe in what 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:39.959
 they can transmit and I believe above all 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.909
 that people besides the gameplay come 

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:43.769
 really a good commentary I have it 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.569
 also said in another video of mine 

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:47.339
 I think there are many clans and in 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.289
 italy and that can be anyway 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.059
 really carried very high 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.799
 from the gameplay point of view but 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:54.839
 unfortunately they did not then comment on 

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:56.969
 entertained that however we of the camp 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:58.649
 we can bring now I'm not 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:00.539
 turning in some way maybe someone 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:02.129
 think badly the name I'm pulling though 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:04.769
 I follow some paxton channels for 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:07.110
 Italians and unfortunately they may bring some 

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:08.969
 top-notch gameplay but with a 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.889
 comment that makes the balls fall into that 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.289
 it really doesn't send me anything is 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:16.110
 only the description of the game e 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:18.059
 with some crap under always fall 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.639
 always come only call of duty that 

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:23.069
 maybe these are things we hear again 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:26.159
 Reverse boosting boyle times will have 

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:28.409
 or type seen a channel did three 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:30.629
 video I repeat three videos talking 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:32.789
 only by reverse boosting guys is 

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:33.839
 just talk about it absolutely but a 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:35.759
 enough video 

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:38.149
 and this is what unfortunately really me 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:40.889
 very sorry for those channels that are 

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:42.659
 very valid but unfortunately very valid 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:44.159
 they don't have like with members that really do 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:45.629
