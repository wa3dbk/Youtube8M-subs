always<00:00:06.140> looking<00:00:06.560> to<00:00:07.069> improve<00:00:07.189> our<00:00:07.580> off-road

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:07.879 
always looking to improve our off-road

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.750 
always looking to improve our off-road
ability<00:00:08.450> and<00:00:08.740> to<00:00:09.740> increase<00:00:10.010> our<00:00:10.340> underbody

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
ability and to increase our underbody

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.200 
ability and to increase our underbody
clearance<00:00:11.980> we<00:00:12.980> decided<00:00:13.429> to<00:00:13.519> put<00:00:13.670> in<00:00:13.790> some<00:00:13.969> four

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
clearance we decided to put in some four

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.290 
clearance we decided to put in some four
and<00:00:14.240> a<00:00:14.330> half<00:00:14.480> inch<00:00:14.750> coils<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:15.410> some<00:00:15.920> rancho<00:00:16.400> RS

9,000 XL shocks these Ranchos are long

9,000 XL shocks these Ranchos are long
travel<00:00:22.250> shocks<00:00:22.689> so<00:00:23.689> it's<00:00:23.869> a<00:00:23.960> good<00:00:24.109> idea<00:00:24.260> to

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
travel shocks so it's a good idea to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.330 
travel shocks so it's a good idea to
extend<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.519> brake<00:00:25.730> lines<00:00:26.029> at<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.510> same<00:00:26.720> time

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
extend the brake lines at the same time

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.830 
extend the brake lines at the same time
having<00:00:28.340> seen<00:00:28.670> these<00:00:28.910> shocks<00:00:29.210> on<00:00:29.420> many

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
having seen these shocks on many

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.990 
having seen these shocks on many
vehicles<00:00:30.109> before<00:00:30.470> I<00:00:30.920> was<00:00:31.400> really<00:00:31.730> keen<00:00:31.939> to

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
vehicles before I was really keen to

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.090 
vehicles before I was really keen to
give<00:00:32.239> them<00:00:32.419> a<00:00:32.480> try<00:00:32.720> on<00:00:32.900> ours<00:00:33.140> it's<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.890> ability

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
give them a try on ours it's the ability

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.250 
give them a try on ours it's the ability
to<00:00:34.340> make<00:00:34.699> adjustments<00:00:35.030> to<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.780> dampening

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
to make adjustments to the dampening

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.890 
to make adjustments to the dampening
that<00:00:36.650> really<00:00:36.920> caught<00:00:37.159> our<00:00:37.309> eyes<00:00:37.720> because<00:00:38.720> if

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
that really caught our eyes because if

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.410 
that really caught our eyes because if
you<00:00:38.989> think<00:00:39.229> about<00:00:39.379> it<00:00:39.710> as<00:00:40.159> off-roaders<00:00:40.909> we're

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
you think about it as off-roaders we're

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.660 
you think about it as off-roaders we're
constantly<00:00:41.799> adjusting<00:00:42.799> our<00:00:42.920> tire<00:00:43.159> pressures

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
constantly adjusting our tire pressures

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.240 
constantly adjusting our tire pressures
to<00:00:43.820> suit<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.180> conditions<00:00:44.650> so<00:00:45.650> it<00:00:45.830> only<00:00:45.949> makes

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
to suit the conditions so it only makes

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.060 
to suit the conditions so it only makes
sense<00:00:46.629> that<00:00:47.629> by<00:00:47.839> adjusting<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.830> shock

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
sense that by adjusting the shock

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.399 
sense that by adjusting the shock
absorbers<00:00:49.580> dampening<00:00:50.089> rate<00:00:50.299> you<00:00:51.110> could<00:00:51.260> also

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
absorbers dampening rate you could also

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.289 
absorbers dampening rate you could also
improve<00:00:51.799> the<00:00:52.190> vehicle's<00:00:52.580> performance<00:00:52.729> and

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
improve the vehicle's performance and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.109 
improve the vehicle's performance and
