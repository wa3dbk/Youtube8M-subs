painting completely out of mostly

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
painting completely out of mostly
fingerprints<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:46.140> now<00:00:46.230> we're<00:00:46.410> actually

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
fingerprints right now we're actually

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.930 
fingerprints right now we're actually
using<00:00:46.680> paint<00:00:47.010> brushes<00:00:47.220> to<00:00:47.580> paint<00:00:47.610> the

lon with the paintbrush and around the

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.319 
lon with the paintbrush and around the
most<00:00:55.379> part<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.129> did<00:00:56.550> all<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.210> our

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
most part we we did all this with our

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.080 
most part we we did all this with our
fingertips<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:58.649> also<00:00:58.829> good<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> go<00:00:59.520> back<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
fingertips it's also good to go back to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
fingertips it's also good to go back to
like<00:01:00.270> your<00:01:00.449> childhood<00:01:01.020> days<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.680> bit

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
like your childhood days a little bit

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.279 
like your childhood days a little bit
and<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:02.850> back<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.360> figure<00:01:03.570> bank<00:01:03.930> it's

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
and get to go back and figure bank it's

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:05.479 
and get to go back and figure bank it's
kind<00:01:04.410> of<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.649> machine<00:01:04.800> gun<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.339> off

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
kind of like a machine gun going off

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.550 
kind of like a machine gun going off
here<00:01:05.759> when<00:01:05.940> we're<00:01:06.060> all<00:01:06.149> going<00:01:06.539> make<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
here when we're all going make a little

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.870 
here when we're all going make a little
bit<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.860> mess<00:01:08.070> yeah<00:01:08.430> well<00:01:08.910> then<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.070 

so<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:13.000> our<00:01:13.090> mission<00:01:13.479> we<00:01:13.630> bring<00:01:14.050> people
