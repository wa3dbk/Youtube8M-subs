 history is exceeding production 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.130

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.440
 single presea when in fact it is missing 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.830
 practically a whole week which 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.739
 opens great expectations of overcoming 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.530
 latest pan-American games in terms of 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.850

 artistic and other countries of canada 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.570
 for example the music of piazzolla 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.590
 exactly if there is something that called us the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.420
 Attention
