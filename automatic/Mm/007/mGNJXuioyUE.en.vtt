00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.209

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.640
 you will like after minecraft folk 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.710
 think about batman 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:32.949
 did the submarine exactly do a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:37.170
 now I will be magicians myself to artem farm 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:40.920
 so let's look at the minifigures 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.469
 ordinary stella you have already seen in sets 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.519
 the cave nominee was in my diamond 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:53.710
 armor and somewhere else I have already seen 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:56.550
 its not looking here add this book at 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.739
 in his hand it is from scratch 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:07.149
 lego there are three variations of 3 armor 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:11.439
 diamond you understand how to craft cry 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:16.090
 to birds blue pants instead of green instead 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:22.140
 hair here it is to wear the same green 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 only instead of legs you need to wear a suit and 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.159
 take off your hair and cap, we are 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.549
 the rest is gold armor bring 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:38.380
 I told you about Steve and 2 is not a figure 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:42.390
 this is a lamb you have already seen a lamb but not 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.399
 the second variation is a little lamb 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.710
 reach only hurt 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:52.439
 here it is a little lamb you in my not 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:56.049
 but we are seen and seen here such a long and 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.410
 now she is smaller so she already 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.450
 little consolation 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.830
 okay, let's move on to the set itself 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:12.110
 it splits into two parts that's about 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.510
 here so let's talk about big about 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.380
 this little big part like you 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.080
 noticed really huge packs first 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.490
 what immediately catches your eye is this 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.420
 black gate it opens 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.770
 take the gray thing and it will open where 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.620

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.570
