done this once to one of them when I was
practicing<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.570> i<00:01:57.659> added<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.469> cool

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
practicing and i added a really cool

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.270 
practicing and i added a really cool
filter<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.549> quite<00:01:59.729> sure<00:01:59.759> where<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.329> now

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
filter not quite sure where it was now

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.100 
filter not quite sure where it was now
so<00:02:02.280> i<00:02:02.310> quite<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.509> quite<00:02:03.719> blue

well<00:02:32.220> you've<00:02:32.340> got<00:02:32.460> things<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.790> mixer<00:02:33.540> at<00:02:33.780> V

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
well you've got things like mixer at V

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.930 
well you've got things like mixer at V
shape<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.470> tilt<00:02:34.740> shift<00:02:34.830> let's<00:02:35.400> try<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.730> tilt

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
shape and tilt shift let's try it tilt

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.000 
shape and tilt shift let's try it tilt
shift<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.550> want<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.730> focus<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:40.010> this

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
shift so I just want to focus on this

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:51.230 
shift so I just want to focus on this
one<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:46.100> that's<00:02:47.100> pretty<00:02:47.340> cool<00:02:49.700> close<00:02:50.700> up<00:02:51.000> and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
one here that's pretty cool close up and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.170 
one here that's pretty cool close up and
then<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.170> artistic<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.400> add<00:02:53.790> things<00:02:54.060> like

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
then in artistic you can add things like
