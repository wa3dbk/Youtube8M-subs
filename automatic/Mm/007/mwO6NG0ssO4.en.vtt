 scrubber to make another part 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.690
 stands in the hall that we draw in large 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.530

 an unknown of you is a sky 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.420
 root 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.799
 a whole lot that we love to keep 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.510
 for ourselves 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.000
 because that is somewhat the secret of the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 blacksmith century the secret of the brewer 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.570
 the correct dosage is not behind that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.439
 we come there I am happy you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.470
 do not tell 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.659
 we keep that to ourselves completely 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.450
 dad was just my patient cool 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.759
 spirits slowed down and decided 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 early 70s to go 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.220
 experiment with existing drinks and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 homeopathic herbs and came to one 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.840
 desolate what has become sleep is feel 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.140
 there 40 years ago 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.290
 started forty years ago in an in 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.659
 in that house bar and he had that is 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.860
 late in his refrigerator and what 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.110
 happened 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.540
 my father was a burgundian there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.950
 quite a bit of party in that house bar 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.720
 and he offers that to many of his friends 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.740
 drink at any time and in the evening 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.899
 and what was created and down 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.390
 like a smile at people said of 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 they are eating that is tasty too 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.739
 and then a very hot one emerged 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.870
 I would like my friendship and atmosphere 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.670
 that was 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.340
 reason for my father to be around 7 years old 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.230
 to do that once in a jar 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.310
 and to present it at the squat 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.260

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.269

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.519

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.159

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.480
 number continues to grow steadily and start 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.760

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.000

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.459
 and then I asked him bolin cold and then 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.620
 says that online bring you a cold 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.269
 you have to drink him why so he came 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.560
 back with the message no 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.170
 problem gets hot with whipped cream 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.160

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.950

 tilburg kinder no warm school and with 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.720
 whipped cream and later you saw that 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.790
 in Zeeland and sometimes on others 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.010
 places problems thijssen very popular 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.609
 became and depending on when people 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.709
 got to know it and how they learn it 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.640
 that was also known in those regions 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.640
 further developed 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.989

 a song for the crawling concert 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.640
 scrubber 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.380
 People recognized that problem from 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.319
 our that they left everything about what the 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.300

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.650
 this year through the doorgers still 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.269
 have a go once in a while 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.269
 but then as a carnival cracker 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.720
 that side was 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.360
 we are asked for problems on the

 that he thought that was great 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.680
 I am convinced that 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.740
 and she would probably say below 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.050
