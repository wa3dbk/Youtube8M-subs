00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.780
 welcome be unboxing today I come to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.170
 bring the unboxing the first 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.730
 impressions dell xps 13 good then 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.130
 as you have already commented this year 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.260
 I wanted to start bringing some 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.750
 fish some laptops and not only 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.480
 mobile phones and tablets and here 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.460
 we have the first one this year I bought 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.700
 a new laptop in this case is the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.710
 new dell xps 13 and nothing we will take it out 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.570
 from the box and see what it contains 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.219
 as you see the big box what it contains 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.780
 another smaller black box that is where 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.210
 comes the laptop and then over here 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.550
 we have the charger someone who comes 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.960
 aside as well it is a pretty charger 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.489
 little one that fits in the palm of the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.170
 hand and this will make it very practical to 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.579
 the time to transport it good now yes 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.739
 we go with the computer that is what more 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.269
 interesting let's open the box and how 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.940
 you see directly we are going to find 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.980
 with the laptop if we remove it 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.960
 and we find a guide here 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.390
 Quick start where they explain us the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.489
 more basic about this team and some 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.409
 manuals of use and guarantee the truth is 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.060
 that comes much more normally to us 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.040
 laptops of this range of this price 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.690
 usually come some more details 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.940
 some case or something but in this case and 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.310
 You see that not as you see we have a team 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.740
 made entirely of aluminum from a 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.140
 piece and we have here a small cap 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.490
 that covers the excel sight that of him is worth 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.409
 this is for technical support 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.789
 we always have some number that in another 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.960
 laptop and what happened was that with the 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.520
 time is erasing so they have 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.229
 decided to put a lid to prevent that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.149
 that happens you see here we also have the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.159
 vents and on its side 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.670
 we will find the power connector 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.590
 an output in mini displayport a usb and 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.179
 here we have the headphone jack and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.830
 fixed microphones that we have here a 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.720
 very curious button that if we click on it 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.250
 it turns on to see the percentage 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.710
 what remains of battery indicates us 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.000
 easily how much we have left of course 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.619
 we can see here one of his 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.600
 speakers on the opposite side we 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.060
 We find another one speaker 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.640
 sd card reader and we have here 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.440
 also a fixed usb port which is a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.240
 very tiny laptop weighs only 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.759
 about three kilos and porta 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.920
 very portable also very finite and in the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.500
 direct competition for laptops like 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.970
 the macbook air and the macbook pro its part 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.830
 Internet does not just mimic the fiber of 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.180
 carbon is real carbon fiber already 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.640
 you know that it is a material that is used 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.370
 even in formula one vehicles 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.170
 for example and it is due first that a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.450
 very resistant material is lightweight and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.890
 It also transmits less heat than 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.530
 aluminum and therefore we are going to 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.480
 make the laptop more comfortable 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.760
 letting us fall like that is not going to burn us 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.709
 never because it stays pretty cold 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.480
 on the other hand it has a somewhat gummy feel 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.310
 what what also becomes very comfortable 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.890
 by grabbing the laptop like this you can 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.060
 appreciate the keyboard is also 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.400
 backlit as his own name 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.620
 indica is a 13-inch laptop and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.180
 this is the version of this year goes the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.430
 2015 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.349
 once on you can appreciate better 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.959
 the main feature of this 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.030
 team that are your minimum frames as 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.980
 you see has a very small frame indeed 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.260
 today would be the laptop with the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.760
 smaller frames of the world one of the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.290
 advantages that we get with this is that 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.150
 we have here a 13-inch laptop 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.340
 and yet the size is practically 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.219
 like that of one of 11 plus of course 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.469
 of your elegant finish fixes that your 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.659
 13.3-inch screen however 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:17.060
 here I have the chromebook that has 11 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.579
 with 6 and practically the size is the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.439
 same notice that practically the same is 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.299
 a little smaller chromebook but the 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.090
 difference in inches is pretty 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.549
 big there you can see the big difference 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.549
 between the frames of one team and another 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.050
 inside, as you can see, it has a 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.760
 i7 to 2 processor with 4 gigahertz that 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.210
 has a turbo of up to 3 gigahertz 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.820
 takes 8 gb of ram and windows 8 the disk 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.170
 hard is an ssd of 512 gb of any 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.810
 There are different configurations 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.460
 and you can buy it with an i7 a little more 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.740
 small you can buy it with less disk 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.510
 hard or with less ram and of course it comes out 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.880
 cheaper another quality of this version 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.330
 is that it has a screen which hd plus 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.340
 of 3200 by 800 thousand pixels and it is also 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.500
 tactile so that I can control 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.400
 from here as you see the team and also 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.400
 it works pretty well 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.970
 in short this is only the unboxing the 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.790
 first impressions of the new dell xps 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.140
 13 2015 of course to the week that 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.630
 comes we have the in-depth analysis or 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.340
 games testing software testing 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.920
 high performance of course we have 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.510
 to take advantage of that 7 and also 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.980
 we will try to take advantage of the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.990
 integrated graphic that brings that in the 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.000
 interior and without 500 comil that say that 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.530
 has improved up to 20% with respect to 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.960
 its previous version plus its processor 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.940
 Fifth generation i7 promises at least 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.860
 10 hours of battery of course as 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.270
 I always tell you, you can leave me at 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.740
 comments of this video your 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.700
 suggestions of what you want to try 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.620
 you want me to try a game in 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.180
 concrete or you want but some program 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.220
 like photoshop or whatever it is 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.390
 tell me and we will try it on this team 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.760
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.800
 is in a laptop boxing I hope 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.270
