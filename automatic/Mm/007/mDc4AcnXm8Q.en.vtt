about<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.160> on<00:03:18.310> your<00:03:18.489> show<00:03:18.640> many<00:03:18.850> many<00:03:19.209> times

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
about this on your show many many times

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.750 
about this on your show many many times
so<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.170> what<00:03:20.320> happens<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.190> I'm<00:03:21.549> right

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
so that what happens is and I'm right

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.270 
so that what happens is and I'm right
now<00:03:21.910> I'm<00:03:22.090> putting<00:03:22.299> together<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:23.530> lot<00:03:24.130> we're

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
now I'm putting together a lot we're

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.190 
now I'm putting together a lot we're
doing<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.489> lot<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.700> work<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.090> depth<00:03:25.450> zones<00:03:25.840> like

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
doing a lot of work on depth zones like

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.979 
doing a lot of work on depth zones like
I<00:03:26.260> call<00:03:26.769> them<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.400> house<00:03:27.519> but<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.450> impact

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
I call them in the house but the impact

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.160 
I call them in the house but the impact
areas<00:03:29.530> for<00:03:29.860> one<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.220> starts<00:03:30.790> in<00:03:31.390> 2013<00:03:32.080> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
areas for one this starts in 2013 and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.280 
areas for one this starts in 2013 and
2014<00:03:32.670> where<00:03:33.670> are<00:03:33.970> all<00:03:34.120> these<00:03:34.299> deaths<00:03:34.630> going<00:03:35.140> to

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
2014 where are all these deaths going to

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.380 
2014 where are all these deaths going to
occur<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.799> by<00:03:35.920> what<00:03:36.130> means<00:03:36.400> most<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.330> the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
occur and by what means most of the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.960 
occur and by what means most of the
deaths<00:03:37.720> will<00:03:37.959> be<00:03:37.989> starvation<00:03:38.950> because<00:03:39.459> water

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
deaths will be starvation because water

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.509 
deaths will be starvation because water
is<00:03:40.150> going<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.510> dry<00:03:40.780> up<00:03:40.989> they<00:03:41.290> did<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.709> he<00:03:41.950> will

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
is going to dry up they did it he will

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.759 
is going to dry up they did it he will
go<00:03:42.669> up<00:03:42.820> intensely<00:03:43.359> in<00:03:43.900> many<00:03:44.169> parts<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.650> the
