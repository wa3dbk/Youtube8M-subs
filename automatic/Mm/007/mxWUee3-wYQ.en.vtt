00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.309
 chair sledge its channel lovers have 5 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:12.150
 there are among and 1 2 slightly higher than 3 parts 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:15.330
 I thought I would like it too, I hope they don’t 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.930
 I think also like it and you know what 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.410
 on cool and only about 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.529
 channel he expounded his version of what 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.109
 This animatronic new day is 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.189
 the human body is not a fact that it is alive 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.489
 but there is 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 someone's bone residue and anything 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.300
 so yes, in principle, I can do it 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 to agree 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 I even have another such argument 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.070
 which principle can offer 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.230
 that this is a real live person possible 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.469
 even he is not completely dead yet either you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.940
 breathed closer he's the strangers but just on 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.660
 there he suffered severe injuries call 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.329
 corset who were video goal and where there 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.439
 he showed the type of flesh and all that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.979
 on now see my only yet this 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.159
 disgusting 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.110
 an argument that can prove something to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.479
 what is this animatronic 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.250
 man and about anything else he 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 just the end regularly severely mutilated 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 yes yes it is he himself year first he 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.369
 strongly twitches and I do not do that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 animatronics can wait altogether 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.740
 use any battle and yes now 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.439
 you will hear the voice of this animatronic 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.299
 it's like this probably attacks us 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.299
 so dry now 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.380
 honestly reminds me of some kind 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.330
 man just screams in pain know how 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.390
 can no longer just take that gas 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.980
 he just hisses I don't know, but I like that 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.660
 it seems and certainly not possible creators 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.660
 this chorus track senso 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.300
 they specifically kind of scare such a voice 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.610
 he doesn’t think it’s just that 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.850
 of possibility clear voice of this 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:15.410
 the man I shoved but how 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:17.900
 they say a coincidence I do not think so well 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.940
 that's all thanks for watching put 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.959

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.810

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.890
