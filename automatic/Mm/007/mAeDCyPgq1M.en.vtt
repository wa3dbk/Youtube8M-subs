00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
surfaces as well I actually work better

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.660 
surfaces as well I actually work better
on<00:02:45.760> those<00:02:46.390> wrong<00:02:46.780> surfaces<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.519> do

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
on those wrong surfaces because you do

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.310 
on those wrong surfaces because you do
might<00:02:49.030> have<00:02:49.239> some<00:02:49.420> problem<00:02:49.690> like<00:02:49.810> applying

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
might have some problem like applying

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.400 
might have some problem like applying
things<00:02:51.130> on<00:02:51.370> round<00:02:51.790> surface<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.269> actually<00:02:52.630> like

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
things on round surface to actually like

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.210 
things on round surface to actually like
so-called<00:02:54.040> gay<00:02:54.880> world<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:56.070> pewter<00:02:57.070> or

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
so-called gay world like pewter or

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.130 
so-called gay world like pewter or
something<00:02:57.579> all<00:02:58.090> right<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.480> think<00:02:58.600> pretty

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
something all right so I think pretty

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.000 
something all right so I think pretty
much<00:02:59.230> time's<00:02:59.590> up

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
much time's up

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.789 
much time's up
so<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.160> will<00:03:00.549> just<00:03:00.760> article<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.380> cow<00:03:02.560> and

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799
