 is recognized by gaming though 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.450
 we the Hebrew, I think 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.450

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.789
 known that plays with the old 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.070

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.810
 they have been giving me what I do not really 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.200

 He knew that I started YouTube and he was 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.200

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.590

 that we're going to be my last sexual and he 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.090
 he also sent me a lot of people 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.560
 then the community of mexico 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.540
 youtubers and inclusive and bloggers I do not know 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:25.560
 if you have seen them 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:28.080
 gutiÃ©rrez as in a good youtube 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.210
 blogger then is as divided into 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.360
 several sections the community are the 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.930
 bloggers the gamers from here the 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.050
 make-ups and all that then then no 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.050
 is very united that we say the community of 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.819
 of the bloggers with the gamers but 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.819
 for example horita of werevertumorro 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.770
 is making videos with these videos 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:52.080
 with him to capone one of the youtubers 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.699
 biggest in mexico that was the one that 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.930
 started and well that are those youtuber very 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.490
 bastard of the value that I take royal to 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.699
 capone are very different but 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.759
 they even came together and the section of 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:08.050
 youtube gamers from mexico I've noticed 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.990
 that is somewhat separate 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.879
 that is, they are like two groups of 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.520
 youtubers in mexico of gamers 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.470
 They are in this section and fiction 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.060
 which is more removed from the other 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.860
 I know why we're apart from each other 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.889
 but now it has not touched me 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.870
 to be I'm more I'm like I'm not in 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.280
 neither of you have me if I'm not 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.800
 still has not grown so much 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.039
 as to belong one of those two 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.259
 but if he is very there I like the 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.419
 true micro activity because if 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.220
 they found out if there are many people who 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.479
 He knew how to love, so to speak, I know that 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.310
 liked what I do and have subscribed to my 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.229
 channel and they have been following me and if I 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.740
 He liked it a lot as a reaction 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:50.409
 Mexican community now susana vinson a 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.629
 bing this I like as well as there are 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:57.120
 much support there if there will be support 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:07:01.410
 but we are like that less understands 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.199
 but yes, I think that was all like that 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:10.650
 this opinion of grandson this subscribe the 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:13.740
 channel him to review in July to see 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.150
 its its games is something different than what 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.040
 that are used because they are 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.720
 me here micro of mexico but you I 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.210
 the spirit of favor that they will see their 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.410
 channel and go to see their videos for 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.620
 that they see how handsome is also me 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.790
 taught already I do not have my camera yet 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.969
 but probably to buy my 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.189
 little camera and is in 9 on the little face 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:33.019
 and the channels were in the description 

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:36.379
 to be seen and subscribed 

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:38.860
 gaston in the July description his 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.860
 ideas 

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:46.759
 well I guess this was the gameplay 

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:50.949
 believing in his messages with the July in 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.949
 July I dismiss fine
