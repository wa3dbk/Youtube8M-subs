entire rest stop event with a pair of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
entire rest stop event with a pair of
binoculars<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.689> watching<00:01:31.500> Luke<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.950> he

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
binoculars just watching Luke as he
crawls<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.909> mountain<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.450> eventually

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
crawls up this mountain and eventually

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.410 
crawls up this mountain and eventually
towards<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.409> top<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.860> gets<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.460> steep<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
towards the top it gets really steep and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
towards the top it gets really steep and
so<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> Luke<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.770> his<00:01:38.189> hands

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
but I mean there's just no way he's

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.980 
but I mean there's just no way he's
gonna<00:02:30.610> get<00:02:30.790> all<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> way<00:02:31.180> back<00:02:31.360> down<00:02:31.570> in<00:02:31.810> five

gonna get all the way back down in five

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.170 
gonna get all the way back down in five
minutes<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.950> my<00:02:33.070> dad<00:02:33.250> ask<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.580> bus<00:02:33.760> driver<00:02:33.790> if

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
he's just gonna be stranded at this

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.270 
he's just gonna be stranded at this
rough<00:02:37.630> stop<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.050> guess<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.890> next<00:02:39.130> like

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
rough stop I guess for the next like

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.640 
rough stop I guess for the next like
eight<00:02:39.460> hours<00:02:39.880> until<00:02:40.120> we<00:02:40.330> loop<00:02:41.080> around<00:02:41.290> and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
eight hours until we loop around and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.110 
eight hours until we loop around and
come<00:02:41.920> back<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.340> rest<00:02:42.640> stop<00:02:42.760> on<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.060> way

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
come back to that rest stop on the way

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.940 
come back to that rest stop on the way
back<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:43.660> again<00:02:43.930> he<00:02:44.050> has<00:02:44.200> no<00:02:44.320> cell<00:02:44.590> phone<00:02:44.800> so

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
back and again he has no cell phone so

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.620 
back and again he has no cell phone so
we<00:02:45.070> have<00:02:45.190> no<00:02:45.340> way<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.520> communicating<00:02:46.030> this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
we have no way of communicating this

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.540 
we have no way of communicating this
with<00:02:46.810> him<00:02:46.990> but<00:02:47.320> as<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.650> bus<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:48.070> pulling<00:02:48.460> out

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
with him but as the bus is pulling out

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.520 
with him but as the bus is pulling out
and<00:02:48.790> coming<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.600> kind<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.840> down<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.170> road<00:02:50.320> in

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
and coming to kind of down the road in

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.450 
and coming to kind of down the road in
front<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.950> mountain

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
front of the mountain

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.370 
front of the mountain
Luke<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.210> at<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.690> foothill<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
Luke is like at the foothill of the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.380 
Luke is like at the foothill of the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
mountain he sees the bus and he starts

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.470 
mountain he sees the bus and he starts
like<00:02:55.600> running<00:02:56.470> behind<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.460> bus<00:02:57.700> he<00:02:58.180> doesn't

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
like running behind the bus he doesn't

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.260 
like running behind the bus he doesn't
even<00:02:58.660> actually<00:02:58.960> stop<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.950> bus<00:03:00.130> he<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.580> slows

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
even actually stop the bus he just slows

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.990 
even actually stop the bus he just slows
down<00:03:01.720> slightly<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.620> opens<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.430> door<00:03:03.610> now<00:03:03.910> you

down slightly and opens the door now you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.640 
down slightly and opens the door now you
might<00:03:04.150> be<00:03:04.180> wondering<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.750> did<00:03:04.930> not<00:03:05.110> give<00:03:05.410> Luke

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
might be wondering it did not give Luke

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.730 
might be wondering it did not give Luke
the<00:03:05.860> $40<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.870> would<00:03:08.050> have<00:03:08.170> suggested<00:03:08.380> that

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
the $40 and I would have suggested that

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.620 
the $40 and I would have suggested that
he<00:03:08.890> would<00:03:09.040> because<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.490> mean<00:03:09.670> Luke<00:03:09.880> almost<00:03:10.360> made

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
he would because I mean Luke almost made

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.540 
he would because I mean Luke almost made
it<00:03:10.660> but<00:03:10.990> that<00:03:11.230> being<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.860> philosophy<00:03:12.520> major

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
it but that being a philosophy major

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.610 
it but that being a philosophy major
from<00:03:12.970> Harvard<00:03:13.360> had<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.660> really<00:03:13.930> complicated

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
from Harvard had this really complicated

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.490 
from Harvard had this really complicated
explanation<00:03:14.800> about<00:03:15.400> how<00:03:15.550> like<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.630> truth<00:03:16.989> and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
explanation about how like the truth and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.729 
explanation about how like the truth and
accuracy<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.940> standards<00:03:19.660> for<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.989> future<00:03:20.440> or

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
accuracy and standards for the future or

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.020 
accuracy and standards for the future or
something<00:03:21.070> like<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.520> he<00:03:21.610> didn't<00:03:21.880> give

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
something like that so he didn't give

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.580 
something like that so he didn't give
