00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
hello everyone thanks again for tuning

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.959 
hello everyone thanks again for tuning

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
today we'll be looking at the flashback

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.179 
today we'll be looking at the flashback
x4<00:00:11.680> delay<00:00:12.490> looper<00:00:13.029> by<00:00:13.449> TC<00:00:13.900> electronic<00:00:14.410> the<00:00:14.680> x4

x4 delay looper by TC electronic the x4

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.800 
x4 delay looper by TC electronic the x4
has<00:00:15.369> been<00:00:15.549> redesigned<00:00:16.119> with<00:00:16.209> some<00:00:16.420> extra

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
has been redesigned with some extra

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.630 
has been redesigned with some extra
features<00:00:17.020> that<00:00:17.800> will<00:00:17.920> benefit<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.460> live

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
features that will benefit the live

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.120 
features that will benefit the live
performer<00:00:19.240> for<00:00:19.900> guitar<00:00:20.320> teacher<00:00:20.619> and<00:00:21.039> of

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
performer for guitar teacher and of

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.189 
performer for guitar teacher and of
course<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.789> bedroom<00:00:22.210> player<00:00:22.449> who's<00:00:22.869> looking

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
course the bedroom player who's looking

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.159 
course the bedroom player who's looking
to<00:00:23.230> improve<00:00:23.769> who<00:00:24.579> may<00:00:24.730> not<00:00:24.939> have<00:00:24.999> a<00:00:25.599> house<00:00:25.900> band

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
to improve who may not have a house band

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.839 
to improve who may not have a house band
to<00:00:26.380> cordon<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:26.890> anytime<00:00:27.099> you<00:00:27.369> want<00:00:27.519> to<00:00:27.550> jam

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
to cordon that anytime you want to jam

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.970 
to cordon that anytime you want to jam
so<00:00:28.329> of<00:00:28.419> course<00:00:28.659> they<00:00:28.989> exploit<00:00:29.409> a<00:00:29.710> slightly

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
so of course they exploit a slightly

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.519 
so of course they exploit a slightly
bigger<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:31.300> have<00:00:31.419> three<00:00:31.630> times<00:00:31.900> bigger<00:00:32.140> than

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
bigger and have three times bigger than

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.500 
bigger and have three times bigger than
the<00:00:32.710> original<00:00:33.160> but<00:00:33.670> has<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.850> few<00:00:34.239> more

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
the original but has a few more

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.569 
the original but has a few more
important<00:00:35.230> features<00:00:35.800> instead<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.310> having

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
important features instead of having

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.030 
important features instead of having
nine<00:00:37.030> delay<00:00:37.330> times<00:00:37.690> we<00:00:38.020> have<00:00:38.170> space<00:00:38.440> for<00:00:38.470> 15

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
nine delay times we have space for 15

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.150 
nine delay times we have space for 15
for<00:00:39.700> tone<00:00:40.030> prints<00:00:40.510> but<00:00:41.020> most<00:00:41.200> importantly<00:00:41.770> we

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
for tone prints but most importantly we

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.670 
for tone prints but most importantly we
have<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.490> delay<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.150> looper<00:00:43.720> switch<00:00:43.990> which

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
have the delay and looper switch which

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.740 
have the delay and looper switch which
determines<00:00:45.520> which<00:00:45.670> mode<00:00:46.120> for<00:00:46.420> pedals

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
determines which mode for pedals

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.960 
determines which mode for pedals
operating<00:00:47.230> in<00:00:47.350> in<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.890> delay<00:00:48.220> mode<00:00:48.490> you<00:00:48.820> can

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
operating in in the delay mode you can

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.180 
operating in in the delay mode you can
store<00:00:49.240> three<00:00:49.570> different<00:00:49.600> delay<00:00:50.320> sounds<00:00:50.950> in

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
store three different delay sounds in

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.340 
store three different delay sounds in
thanks<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.820> B<00:00:52.060> or<00:00:52.210> C<00:00:52.240> and<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:52.900> whole<00:00:53.080> chicken

is<00:00:54.880> very<00:00:55.450> helpful<00:00:55.810> if<00:00:56.320> you're<00:00:56.800> using

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
is very helpful if you're using

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.650 
is very helpful if you're using
different<00:00:57.520> delay<00:00:57.820> types<00:00:58.120> for<00:00:58.600> different

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
different delay types for different

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.200 
different delay types for different
songs<00:00:59.290> and<00:00:59.620> of<00:01:00.100> course<00:01:00.280> in<00:01:00.430> looper<00:01:00.790> mode<00:01:00.820> you

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
songs and of course in looper mode you

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.049 
songs and of course in looper mode you
have<00:01:01.240> what<00:01:01.960> you'd<00:01:02.080> expect<00:01:02.200> record<00:01:02.890> play<00:01:03.820> and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
have what you'd expect record play and

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.480 
have what you'd expect record play and
pause<00:01:04.239> play<00:01:04.780> once<00:01:05.079> and<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.530> course<00:01:05.740> undo<00:01:06.250> and

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
pause play once and of course undo and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.580 
pause play once and of course undo and
redo<00:01:06.880> which<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.390> particularly<00:01:07.810> helpful<00:01:08.170> if

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
redo which is particularly helpful if

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.930 
redo which is particularly helpful if
you're<00:01:08.710> like<00:01:08.830> me<00:01:09.100> you<00:01:09.460> make<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> lot<00:01:09.909> of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
you're like me you make a lot of

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.930 
you're like me you make a lot of
mistakes<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.710> now<00:01:12.190> that<00:01:12.250> that's<00:01:12.460> all<00:01:12.640> said<00:01:12.850> and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
mistakes so now that that's all said and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.580 
mistakes so now that that's all said and
done<00:01:13.030> let's<00:01:13.840> take<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.050> listen<00:01:14.230> to<00:01:14.440> how<00:01:14.560> it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
done let's take a listen to how it

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:47.280 
done let's take a listen to how it
sounds

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290
