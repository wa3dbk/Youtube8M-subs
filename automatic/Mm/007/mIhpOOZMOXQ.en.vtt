00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.900 
now let's crank the gain all the way up
this<00:02:44.200> amplifier<00:02:44.620> actually<00:02:44.830> goes<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.130> 12

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.090 

mmm

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.440 

if<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.220> need<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.459> extra<00:03:00.670> push<00:03:00.940> for<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> solo

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
if you need that extra push for a solo

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.090 
if you need that extra push for a solo
the<00:03:01.930> boost<00:03:02.110> control<00:03:02.470> really<00:03:02.620> does<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:02.950> job

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
the boost control really does the job

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.280 
the boost control really does the job
well<00:03:03.160> on<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.550> classic<00:03:03.910> 30<00:03:04.120> let's<00:03:05.020> turn<00:03:05.170> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
well on the classic 30 let's turn the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.750 
well on the classic 30 let's turn the
gain<00:03:05.440> control<00:03:05.590> back<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.100> about<00:03:06.280> 50%<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:09.640> is

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
gain control back to about 50% this is

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.230 
gain control back to about 50% this is
what<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.000> sounds<00:03:10.209> like<00:03:10.240> at<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.540> point<00:03:12.240> now

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
what it sounds like at that point now

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:24.990 
what it sounds like at that point now
I'll<00:03:13.420> hit<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.660> boost<00:03:13.840> control

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.980 

a<00:03:26.670> with<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> boost<00:03:27.970> control<00:03:28.330> engaged<00:03:28.660> we<00:03:28.870> get

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
a with the boost control engaged we get

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.750 
a with the boost control engaged we get
a<00:03:29.020> significant<00:03:29.560> volume<00:03:29.920> boost<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.520> we<00:03:30.610> also

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
a significant volume boost and we also

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.190 
a significant volume boost and we also
get<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:30.970> nice<00:03:31.150> tightening<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.780> sound<00:03:32.020> in

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
get a nice tightening of the sound in

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.540 
get a nice tightening of the sound in
the<00:03:32.260> fattening<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.740> lower<00:03:32.920> mid-range<00:03:33.220> so

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
the fattening of the lower mid-range so

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.830 
the fattening of the lower mid-range so
it's<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.730> really<00:03:33.910> nice<00:03:34.150> tone<00:03:34.420> for<00:03:34.630> playing

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
it's a really nice tone for playing

overdrive that we're producing we have a

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.550 
overdrive that we're producing we have a
bass<00:04:27.910> mid<00:04:28.240> control<00:04:28.690> now<00:04:28.840> what<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:28.990> does<00:04:29.140> is

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
bass mid control now what that does is

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.780 
bass mid control now what that does is
on<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.770> lower<00:04:29.919> end<00:04:30.190> of<00:04:30.280> when<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.490> turn<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
on the lower end of when you turn the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.850 
on the lower end of when you turn the
knob<00:04:30.820> down<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.570> reduces<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.380> amount<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.680> bass

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
knob down it reduces the amount of bass

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.890 
knob down it reduces the amount of bass
when<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.520> get<00:04:33.640> above<00:04:33.850> three<00:04:34.330> o'clock<00:04:34.600> on<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
when you get above three o'clock on the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.480 
when you get above three o'clock on the
control<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.500> actually<00:04:35.740> starts<00:04:35.980> to<00:04:36.040> boost<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
control it actually starts to boost the

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.860 
control it actually starts to boost the
mid-range<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:37.120> get<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.270> thicker<00:04:37.570> tone

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
mid-range so you get a thicker tone

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.930 
mid-range so you get a thicker tone
there's<00:04:38.650> also<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.950> treble<00:04:39.310> control<00:04:39.640> which<00:04:39.820> can

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
there's also a treble control which can

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.070 
there's also a treble control which can
do<00:04:40.060> everything<00:04:40.300> from<00:04:40.510> giving<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:40.900> very

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
do everything from giving you very

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.570 
do everything from giving you very
bright<00:04:41.350> sparkling<00:04:41.860> tones<00:04:42.100> all<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.430> way<00:04:42.520> to

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
darker smoother tones the toggle switch

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.230 
darker smoother tones the toggle switch
in<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.130> middle<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.460> pedal<00:04:45.730> is<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:45.880> spark

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240

lower<00:04:48.669> gain<00:04:48.940> output<00:04:49.360> pedal<00:04:49.720> so<00:04:50.110> what<00:04:50.230> you<00:04:50.320> have

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
lower gain output pedal so what you have

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.930 
lower gain output pedal so what you have
there<00:04:50.680> are<00:04:50.800> your<00:04:50.919> clean<00:04:51.130> boost<00:04:51.340> settings<00:04:51.760> and

there are your clean boost settings and

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.250 
there are your clean boost settings and
getting<00:04:52.120> into<00:04:52.270> more<00:04:52.419> your<00:04:52.540> overdrive<00:04:52.990> type

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
getting into more your overdrive type

that's<00:05:00.700> feeding<00:05:00.880> into<00:05:01.180> your<00:05:01.300> amplifier<00:05:01.690> which

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
that's feeding into your amplifier which

that's feeding into your amplifier which
is<00:05:01.900> great<00:05:02.200> for<00:05:02.350> overdriving<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.919> front<00:05:03.220> end

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.149 

mmm<00:05:51.319> now<00:05:52.319> we'll<00:05:52.469> move<00:05:52.589> the<00:05:52.740> switch<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:53.069> the

mmm now we'll move the switch to the

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.010 
mmm now we'll move the switch to the
flame<00:05:53.369> position<00:05:53.849> and<00:05:54.059> put<00:05:54.389> together<00:05:54.509> a<00:05:54.719> smooth

flame position and put together a smooth

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:04.640

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
in the flame position we can also create

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:20.200 
in the flame position we can also create
more<00:06:07.180> traditional<00:06:07.660> fuzz<00:06:07.870> type<00:06:08.139> tones

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.300 

when<00:06:20.900> we<00:06:20.990> crank<00:06:21.199> both<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.590> tone<00:06:21.770> controls<00:06:22.160> on

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
when we crank both the tone controls on

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.980 
when we crank both the tone controls on
the<00:06:22.400> gain<00:06:22.550> all<00:06:22.729> the<00:06:22.849> way<00:06:22.940> up<00:06:23.120> we<00:06:23.449> get<00:06:23.539> a<00:06:23.599> really

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
the gain all the way up we get a really

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.990 
the gain all the way up we get a really
massive<00:06:24.289> harmonically<00:06:25.099> dense<00:06:25.370> tone

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
the nice thing about this paddle is the

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.520 
the nice thing about this paddle is the
way<00:06:44.540> they<00:06:44.690> set<00:06:44.840> up<00:06:44.960> the<00:06:45.050> input<00:06:45.320> and<00:06:45.440> output

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
way they set up the input and output

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.530 
way they set up the input and output
impedances<00:06:46.220> with<00:06:46.430> an<00:06:46.520> extremely<00:06:46.880> high<00:06:47.030> input
