00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.130
 the work really begins our first 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.929
 most important point is 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.990
 it is our meeting that would value 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.910
 your lips have things that help and have 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.719
 things that do not help one side more 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.400
 bulky 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 let's talk about the red that the classic 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.910
 of the classics there are several shades m 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.910
 in red 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.439
 This one is the least indicated that I think 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.429
 that would yellow your skin that is more 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.130
 orange 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.750
 So you have to get away from this one, this tone. 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.120
 it will look beautiful that you want 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 more red cherry almost blood 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.040
 only he gets more vampire than he 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.329
 It's not something you have at your will. 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.800
 This is not what you want to be more 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.500
 discreet 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.850
 these two tones and it gets super modern 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.010
 and this one is going to be the first 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.110
 classic in a delicate way in you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.390
 It will get more elegant. 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.530
 so I intend to use this one and you 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.109
 today 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 now my big tip even I go 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.120
 use to sidestep your side a pencil 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.010
 lipstick did not also have a red that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 I think it is suitable for you and 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 mixed with a little mouth but color 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 of mouth with a brunette woman and over 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.770
 that lipstick pencil I apply lipstick 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 red 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.040
 temper that color when you do 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.770
 a more neutral base 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.850
 it is as if he came to terror his 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850
 most harmonic way 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.619
 I 'm applying a bit of blush in tone 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.270
 neutral 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.270
 we have a notion until the total look 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.900
 The tip of passing lipstick first I guess 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.940
 that's all you want to give this dose was 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.750
 very cool because as I started with 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.750
 the eyes 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.490
 I think so, and when the lipstick arrived 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.040
 How nice that you found the way now 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.690
 I really loved, I loved the fan. 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.190
 I'm very happy, I'll make a 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.190
 light photo is not 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.930
 I said that two floods 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.720
 now I will not be afraid to use 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.910
 red lipstick because I have learned which 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.000
 are the colors that combine how the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.560
 trade with afs then you can 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.560
 wear red without fear 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.250
 the fat
