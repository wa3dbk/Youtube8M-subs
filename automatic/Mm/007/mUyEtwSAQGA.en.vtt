00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.940
 humans have been classified as a kind of the kingdom 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.759
 animal 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.769
 we belong to the group of tertiary consumers who are predatory 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.869
 and we are located at the apex of the food chain because we consume 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.869
 everything that is around us 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.200
 humans are vertebrate animals 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.260
 mammals deputies 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.589
 I eat hours 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.080
 but we have unique characteristics 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.390
 that make us different from all the other members of the animal kingdom 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.230
 unlike other animals we have adapted completely walk upright 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.290
 on the legs they release with these strokes and hands with which we have 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.700
 developed a great ability to make tools and apply 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.910
 technology 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 the domain of the game is perhaps the first technological advance 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.130
 that further improves the chances of survival 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.130
 since it allowed us to cook food 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.680
 all human beings have an extreme measure to develop 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.730
 a frame 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.260
 He speaks at waist the most sophisticated communication system and 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
 complex in the animal kingdom 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880
 but also we humans have an incredible memory 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.870
 that is, we have history 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.520
 and inherit from our ancestors the assets and skills that resulted from 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 Years of experiences and discoveries 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.570
 and what constitutes what we call 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.580
 p 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.359
 these exclusive characteristics of the species 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.529
 they have allowed us to achieve levels of adaptation to the environment very effective
