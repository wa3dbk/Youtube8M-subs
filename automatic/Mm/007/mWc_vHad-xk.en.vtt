cardboard iphone and that's it and the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.090 
cardboard iphone and that's it and the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
lined with felt you don't have any

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.139 
lined with felt you don't have any
rubber<00:02:04.380> rails<00:02:04.709> like<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.220> case<00:02:05.459> sliders<00:02:05.940> or

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
rubber rails like the in case sliders or

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.469 
rubber rails like the in case sliders or
the<00:02:06.330> rebel<00:02:06.720> scholars<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.429> nice<00:02:08.910> felt

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the rebel scholars do just a nice felt

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.620 
the rebel scholars do just a nice felt
lining<00:02:09.780> which<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:10.830> prefer<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
lining which I actually prefer to the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.120 
lining which I actually prefer to the
rubber<00:02:12.810> rails<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.380> think<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.770> does<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.920> better

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
rubber rails I think it does a better

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.100 
rubber rails I think it does a better
job<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.819> protecting<00:02:15.120> your<00:02:15.750> phone<00:02:15.900> and

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
which you can probably see right now is

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.560 
which you can probably see right now is
the<00:04:47.520> camera<00:04:47.910> hole<00:04:48.120> cut<00:04:48.389> out<00:04:48.419> is<00:04:48.770> huge<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:51.210> don't

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
the camera hole cut out is huge I don't

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.779 
the camera hole cut out is huge I don't
know<00:04:51.659> why<00:04:51.930> it's<00:04:52.200> that<00:04:52.380> big<00:04:52.680> really<00:04:53.550> doesn't

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
know why it's that big really doesn't

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.080 
know why it's that big really doesn't
need<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:53.969> be<00:04:54.120> that<00:04:54.150> big

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
that gets in around there and you know

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.440 
that gets in around there and you know
your<00:05:01.100> camera<00:05:01.490> rolls<00:05:01.640> not<00:05:02.090> really<00:05:02.270> going<00:05:02.360> to

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
your camera rolls not really going to

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.540 
your camera rolls not really going to
get<00:05:02.540> hurt<00:05:02.780> it's<00:05:03.620> not<00:05:03.770> big<00:05:03.950> enough<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.220> expose

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
get hurt it's not big enough to expose

get hurt it's not big enough to expose
the<00:05:04.610> camera<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.750> I<00:05:05.780> mean<00:05:05.990> it's<00:05:06.140> fine<00:05:06.380> it's<00:05:06.860> just

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
the camera so I mean it's fine it's just

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.300 
the camera so I mean it's fine it's just
ginormous<00:05:08.800> really<00:05:09.800> doesn't<00:05:10.010> need<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.160> be<00:05:10.280> that

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310
