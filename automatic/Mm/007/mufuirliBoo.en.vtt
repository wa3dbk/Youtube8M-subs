00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.759 
earlier so this is to just add some
taste<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.609> that<00:04:16.910> sauce<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:18.229> sauce<00:04:18.440> that<00:04:18.650> we

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
taste to that sauce the sauce that we

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.909 
taste to that sauce the sauce that we
use<00:04:19.010> is<00:04:19.310> already<00:04:19.639> sweet<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.329> then<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:21.229> shrimp

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
use is already sweet and then the shrimp

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.070 
use is already sweet and then the shrimp
is<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.280> being<00:04:22.460> used<00:04:22.639> is<00:04:22.850> also<00:04:23.210> sweet

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
is that being used is also sweet

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.529 
is that being used is also sweet
so<00:04:24.440> remember<00:04:24.889> to<00:04:25.010> just<00:04:25.220> paste<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.880> then<00:04:26.240> add

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
so remember to just paste and then add

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.350 
so remember to just paste and then add
as<00:04:26.840> much<00:04:27.110> sugar<00:04:27.349> as<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.830> want<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:29.150> if<00:04:29.330> you

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
as much sugar as you want and if you

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.870 
as much sugar as you want and if you
like<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:29.960> also<00:04:30.169> add<00:04:30.440> some<00:04:30.680> salt<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.099> it<00:04:33.880> so

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
like you can also add some salt to it so

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.820 
like you can also add some salt to it so
just<00:04:35.180> remember<00:04:35.509> to<00:04:35.690> keep<00:04:35.960> tasting<00:04:36.289> and<00:04:36.650> then

just remember to keep tasting and then

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.650 
just remember to keep tasting and then
you<00:04:36.919> get<00:04:37.099> the<00:04:37.250> right<00:04:37.430> taste<00:04:37.699> it<00:04:38.000> should<00:04:38.300> not<00:04:38.449> be

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
you get the right taste it should not be

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.390 
you get the right taste it should not be
too<00:04:38.900> sweet<00:04:39.289> it's<00:04:39.530> supposed<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.070> have<00:04:40.370> a

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
too sweet it's supposed to have a

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.330 
too sweet it's supposed to have a
balance<00:04:40.940> between<00:04:41.000> sweetness<00:04:41.599> and<00:04:41.960> saltiness

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.680
