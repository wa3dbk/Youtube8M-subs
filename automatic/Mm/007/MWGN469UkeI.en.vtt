great you see still kicks I know it's

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.120

stupid<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.490> fix<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.029> October<00:00:21.859> but<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.010> know

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130

would be worth it to have it work with

would be worth it to have it work with
the<00:00:26.789> defroster<00:00:27.359> because<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> does<00:00:27.930> come<00:00:28.170> on

with<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> defroster<00:00:29.220> setting<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.630> rid<00:00:30.810> of

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
with a defroster setting to get rid of

degreaser um but yeah anyway it's right

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.550 
degreaser um but yeah anyway it's right
here<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.349> new<00:02:11.349> compressor<00:02:12.989> put<00:02:13.989> away<00:02:14.170> on<00:02:14.319> it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
here a new compressor put away on it

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.890 
here a new compressor put away on it
this<00:02:14.860> system<00:02:15.280> takes<00:02:15.459> seven<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.120> 3/4<00:02:16.540> ounces

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
this system takes seven and 3/4 ounces

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:26.630 
this system takes seven and 3/4 ounces
of<00:02:19.739> oil<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:24.040> put<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> vacuum<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.360> system<00:02:25.780> I

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
of oil so put a vacuum on the system I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.190 
of oil so put a vacuum on the system I
guess<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.819> from<00:02:27.940> when<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.150> put<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:31.200> down

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
guess is from when I put it on down

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.530 
guess is from when I put it on down
there's<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> high<00:02:32.890> pressure<00:02:33.190> fitting<00:02:33.670> here's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
there's the high pressure fitting here's

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.740 
there's the high pressure fitting here's
the<00:02:34.660> low<00:02:34.840> pressure<00:02:35.080> fitting<00:02:39.420> yes<00:02:40.420> that's

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
the low pressure fitting yes that's

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.020 
the low pressure fitting yes that's
about<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.650> mean<00:02:42.100> like<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.519> said<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.910> was<00:02:43.000> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
about that I mean like I said it was a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.660 
about that I mean like I said it was a
there's<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.840> shame<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.290> do<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:45.040> October<00:02:45.310> when

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
there's a shame to do it in October when

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.220 
there's a shame to do it in October when
you<00:02:45.730> really<00:02:45.940> don't<00:02:46.090> need<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.390> but<00:02:46.569> I<00:02:46.780> figured

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
you really don't need it but I figured

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.759 
you really don't need it but I figured
I'd<00:02:47.350> need<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.560> with<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.930> defroster<00:02:49.930> but

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
I'd need it with the defroster but

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.780 
I'd need it with the defroster but
anyway<00:02:51.660> that's<00:02:52.660> about<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.350> got<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.370> Mille

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
anyway that's about it I got on Mille

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.130 
anyway that's about it I got on Mille

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
a good deal I put the mounting bracket

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.849 
a good deal I put the mounting bracket
in<00:03:19.510> them<00:03:19.660> they're<00:03:20.320> pretty<00:03:20.470> good<00:03:20.680> quality

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
anything so power steering pump still

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.430 
anything so power steering pump still
holding<00:03:29.079> up

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
holding up

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.199 
holding up
there's<00:03:30.100> no<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.280> did<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.670> down<00:03:30.910> there<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
there's no I did that down there the

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.819 
there's no I did that down there the
seal<00:03:31.390> isn't<00:03:31.630> leaking<00:03:31.840> any<00:03:32.079> oil<00:03:32.290> anymore<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:32.799> I

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
seal isn't leaking any oil anymore so I

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.650 
seal isn't leaking any oil anymore so I
guess<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.190> ring<00:03:33.370> war<00:03:33.609> itself<00:03:34.090> into<00:03:34.570> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
guess the ring war itself into the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.910 
guess the ring war itself into the
groove<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.519> was<00:03:36.670> nice<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.900> gotta<00:03:38.709> clean

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
groove so that was nice I gotta clean

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.430 
groove so that was nice I gotta clean
that<00:03:39.100> die<00:03:40.030> up<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.450> put<00:03:40.630> tracer<00:03:41.019> dye<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.350> the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
that die up I put tracer dye in the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.289 
that die up I put tracer dye in the
system<00:03:41.799> when<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:41.980> did<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.340> put<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.609> vacuum<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:43.180> it

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
system when I did it put a vacuum on it

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.220

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
and get the vacuum at Harbor free just

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.840 
and get the vacuum at Harbor free just
put<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.500> back<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.680> Mon<00:03:47.920> for<00:03:48.130> 10-15<00:03:48.430> minutes

get a gauge set put your right amount of

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.069 
get a gauge set put your right amount of
oil<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.940> there<00:03:52.090> if<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.269> want<00:03:52.480> per<00:03:52.600> tracer

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
oil and there if you want per tracer

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.190 
oil and there if you want per tracer
just<00:03:53.739> in<00:03:53.890> case<00:03:54.069> you<00:03:54.250> do<00:03:54.430> have<00:03:54.640> any<00:03:54.819> leaks<00:03:55.200> you

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
just in case you do have any leaks you

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.539 
just in case you do have any leaks you
will<00:03:56.350> be<00:03:56.530> able<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.739> find<00:03:56.920> them<00:03:57.040> with<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.160> UV

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
will be able to find them with a UV

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.949 
will be able to find them with a UV
light<00:03:57.730> sometimes<00:03:58.390> you<00:03:58.450> don't<00:03:58.510> even<00:03:58.600> need<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
light sometimes you don't even need the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.879 
light sometimes you don't even need the
UV<00:03:59.350> light<00:03:59.560> because<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.040> just<00:04:00.239> looks<00:04:01.239> like<00:04:01.329> that

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
UV light because it just looks like that

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.039 
UV light because it just looks like that
but<00:04:02.889> that's<00:04:03.790> basically<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.269> new<00:04:04.389> gaskets<00:04:04.870> new
