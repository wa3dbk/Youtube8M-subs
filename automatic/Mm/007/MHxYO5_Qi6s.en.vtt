really<00:01:58.600> hurt

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.390 

too<00:02:03.160> far<00:02:04.110> why<00:02:05.110> no<00:02:05.170> crazy<00:02:05.650> risk<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:06.250> think

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
too far why no crazy risk I think

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.550 
too far why no crazy risk I think
honestly<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.420> mean<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.229> don't<00:02:08.290> want<00:02:08.500> to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
honestly I mean you don't want to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.800 
honestly I mean you don't want to
question<00:02:08.740> someone's<00:02:09.250> flow<00:02:09.520> but<00:02:09.820> at<00:02:10.600> that

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
question someone's flow but at that

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.240 
question someone's flow but at that
point<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.230> think<00:02:11.290> he<00:02:11.470> needed<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.800> scale<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.130> back

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
point I think he needed to scale it back

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.190 
point I think he needed to scale it back
a<00:02:12.460> little<00:02:12.520> bit<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.030> not<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> little<00:02:13.810> jerk<00:02:13.990> game
