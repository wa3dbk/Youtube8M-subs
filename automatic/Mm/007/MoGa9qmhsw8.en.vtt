things<00:01:48.360> work<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:49.189> this<00:01:50.189> pair<00:01:50.430> produces<00:01:50.909> about

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
things work out this pair produces about

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.190 
things work out this pair produces about
two<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.460> three<00:01:53.490> clutches<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> year<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
two to three clutches a year and the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.660 
two to three clutches a year and the
clutches<00:01:55.700> consist<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:57.079> from<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.740> two<00:01:59.310> eggs

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
clutches consist of from one to two eggs

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.389 
clutches consist of from one to two eggs
in<00:01:59.969> each<00:02:00.090> clutch<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.710> believe<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> first

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
in each clutch and I believe the first

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.429 
in each clutch and I believe the first
time<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.880> produced<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.420> viable<00:02:03.659> egg<00:02:04.110> was<00:02:04.290> in

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
time they produced a viable egg was in

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.670 
time they produced a viable egg was in
2008<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.310> they've<00:02:05.460> been<00:02:06.350> doing<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.439> pretty<00:02:07.590> good

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
2008 so they've been doing a pretty good

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.380 
2008 so they've been doing a pretty good
job<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:08.450> producing<00:02:10.489> viable<00:02:11.489> hatchlings<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.209> of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
job of producing viable hatchlings as of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.140 
job of producing viable hatchlings as of
late<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.599> we're<00:02:12.959> pretty<00:02:13.050> excited<00:02:13.379> about

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
late so we're pretty excited about

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.730 
late so we're pretty excited about
you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.300> see<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> female<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.620> bit
