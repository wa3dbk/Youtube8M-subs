 He is now looking for myself and will 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.840
 catch it like this 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.290
 it takes a while to find it not much 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.290
 but good taken a while 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.120
 if I see that they take a long time there is already 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.890
 I have already seen it I have found that you have 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.069
 have to press the already several times 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.390
 same and they go 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.860
 At least that says 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.860
 and huelva pound 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.670
 you let this end and you're done 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.280
 synchronized so I'm going with him if to 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.440
 me three me or if you have a smartphone 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.610
 common 15 would be in this case with 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.030
 your annex 5 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.920
 lgg 3 or the smartphone that you have the 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.650
 hesperia z 2 I do not care any 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.610
 smartphone managed with android 4.3 or 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.710
 4.4 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.350
 it would be the way 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.880
 of the application I will talk to you in 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.310
 review 1 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.320
 yes because for now I do not think but good 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.290
 if you want to see the functions that we can 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.960
 have are the same as in energy 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.440
 I threw my 1s we can give it to look for and 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.960
 you can not find the amai by 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.990
 this is set the goal the color 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.230
 of ID leds is in this 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.299
 blue case that is for me the one that better 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.790
 see both indoors and in 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.070
 outside the rest of the colors are wrong 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.520
 that clear if the light does not look very good 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.070
 then he thought from my opinion that the 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.580
 blue is the best color 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.950
 here would be in the case of unlocking the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.740
 screen that as you can see I can from 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.140
 block and because you will say good because 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.950
 this smartphone the if me 3 is 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.090
 session 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.220
 managed by me and 5 based on android 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.460
 kitkat 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:55.390
 and then I will show you a video in which 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.390
 We'll see if the minivan can unlock 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.990
 a smartphone that is not yao ming but 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.610
 which is based on android kitkat then 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.220
 I do not know in a few days I'll do it as much 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.800
 sure but I think it's not like that 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.430
 you can unlock it if not good if 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.020
 you have a 5 such and you want to check 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.050
 check it but I think you can not 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.889
 it's something exclusive to smartphones 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.099
 Dexia or me 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.289
 well says here in two steps to 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.389
 unlock safely and quickly 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.409
 from the good phone let's create a plan 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.449
 a pattern 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.800
 well then 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.800
 good simple one l 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.410
 and now it says 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.180
 enter the pay 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.490
 press the device to confirm 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.760
 use this device to block 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.550
 techniques 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.160
 well it 's the first time I do it like this 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.160
 that we are going to see that this one is given to me 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.479
 good and put me and me and me go 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.400
 now let's see how the 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.740
 unlocking pattern of the system 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.659
 unlocking with the flame iván we are going to 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.789
 do it before without having the seom and 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:11.610
 maybach and in theory the smartphone us 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:14.400
 will ask for the unlock pattern and 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.610
 having it xiao spoils and they go to the side of the 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.039
 smartphone with the good in theory not 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.770
 We ask the unlock pattern we 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.969
 to do so I will leave and go semi iván 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.969
 to lock the smartphone 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:35.050
 and unlock it under here and as you see me 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.630
 they ask for the unblocking pattern if 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.500
 class me my bank accepts where they have me 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.690
 status now nothing has been unlocked 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.270
 If you want, I'll repeat it to the nation itself 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.930
 Ivan is away I have my hand thrown 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.360
 back then yes unlock us 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.850
 ask for the unlocking pattern of the I'm going 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.650
 to close it and I'm going to attach the lady 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.430
 same and they go to the side and I will unlock 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:02.010
 we get the lock screen but not 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.080
 asks us for the password the pattern of 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.810
 unlocking since good is attached to the 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.300
 seam and maybach and that 's it, that's how 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:13.650
 it works and they are going to me at the time of 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.450
 unlock the smartphone more things then 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.270
 the issue of alarms that yesterday already
