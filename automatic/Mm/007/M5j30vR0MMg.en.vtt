00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:15.480
 here and also here in this company and in this other one near us today far 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:21.079
 we find professionals who work for the scientific and technological advance 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.050
 for improving our wellbeing 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.449
 the way we live and the place where we live 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.720
 but before they were trained in the university that Salamanca studied the faculty of 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.720
 sciences 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.660
 in the faculty of science can excuse the dishes in physics mathematics 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.800
 geological engineering geology statistics today I did in iria informatics 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 debate with the city sk puebla 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.220
 the planets Estafeta de Sao Bernardo the tension 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.000
 0 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.940
 and support when entering the race found these things that have 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.190
 liked too much 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.640
 as argentina market 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.990
 the appointment called together as we learn things 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.450
 we arrived laboratories the checked 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.000
 and this is 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.480
 It leaves you with a good taste of mouth one of the biggest inducements for from this 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.000
 career is being able to explain the phenomenon that occurs in other duels 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.680
 example 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.990
 because some storms caused no layoffs because it's a city 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.659
 eye, well, not even how an explosion engine works 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.850
 a thermal power plant 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.250
 to close the hospital room specialized hospital deficit 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.810
 efe a Breathalyzer test and eat the bonuses 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.020
 colleagues who work in cooperatives 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.510
 the oil company 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.240
 in shock 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.420
 see more cc oo radiological sanz 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.390
 the public like the workers 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 colleagues who also work 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.950
 I particularly told me martin para 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.950
 more specifically to the area of ​​Mexicans 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.390
 morals I always liked mathematics a lot p it seemed to me that 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.280
 statistical career because it had a lot to do with mathematics but it had 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.469
 a very much batista purpose 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.869
 I want to ask the whole race and now studied the city whatever happens countries 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.499
 for example pharmacy little more effective in quality control 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.329
 in two processes who analyzed survival among clinics 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.639
 if you go to the stock market once the economic part conscious that to strive 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.399
 in these studies demography 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:39.659
 exceeded part d official statistics for received mortality 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:48.139
 When you get here, you realize that mathematics is a bit different 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.159
 but they are not harder than simply getting used to working 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.699
 with it has been transformed 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.489
 then when you get used to going little by little you are getting experience 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.909
 then you have to have a very large world of possibilities not the 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.380
 work in the department 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.010
 see page 4 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.089
 collect 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.419
 projects related to the action of others the fact of 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.929
 scholarship mathematical training 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.249
 well see it the data 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.569
 as if they were a set when I write 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.219
 get the information in an even more 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.449
 from yesterday and until now notwithstanding the letter with the environment 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.439
 the one known as 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.329
 a good way to create the earth had warned many times 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.300
 develop 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.839
 volcanology seismology iran 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:46.179
 from the study of earthquake volcanoes to see how the earth behaves and 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.669
 also it will give recent earthquakes well 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.189
 know how to move 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.489
 I started the race 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.669
 is motivated because 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.909
 Since I was little I liked very much the possible witnesses 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.279
 the physiology that was the one that had 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:02.599
 that part of studies 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.960
 day D 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.500
 As the race went by, I discovered that I was more interested in 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.019
 other things that judges 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.659
 mainly related to the terrestrial dynamics as in the 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.659
 continents as reported by mountain ranges 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:25.379
 regularly doctor to the foundation is special 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:30.000
 you need to have the knowledge the engineering process the 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:33.459
 chilling but once in a run over before the aforementioned plot of 

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:34.069
 geologist 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.350
 filmus of an agent in 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.680
 the properties already to public works 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.349
 they work mining activities 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.069
 work also now I'm in supervising work direction and 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.059
 control of works in underground tunnels 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:48.279
 we hope that the geological engineering the geological province allows 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.550
 access to that sector 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.810
 because the geologist engineer is a specialist in the field in this 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.159
 eleventh place in the general in this logic 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:01.639
 from ea works asks for the crime tatiane is details of soil quality 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.729
 to professions 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.460
 that offers this activity 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.460
 heather locklear technology 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.949
 the cinema studios are really interesting because 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.089
 is a component to a goal with the crisis that there is with the unemployment rate that 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.870
 there is 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.710
 in spain we are defendants professionals the company needs 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.939
 computer engineers 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:32.300
 Chinese livorno prepare for 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.159
 to meet those needs of the company 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.720
 efe a species over there of the king flavor 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.020
 you will not be stuck in the highest limit 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.569
 up to here labarca my field 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.099
 can not be 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.059
 dedicate yourself to different things 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:49.039
 and everything was waiting for him 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.319
 this center that currently has 300 employees 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:57.270
 has plans for expansion is in the near future for 450 I have achieved in 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.179
 computer engineering of the faculty of sciences of the university of 

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:01.159
 salamanca 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.539
 It's fundamental 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.990
 to nourish with the recently graduated this center the Faculty of Sciences of the 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.580
 University of Salamanca 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.319
 occupies these four buildings in the historic center this is for 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.500
 master 200 professors mister thousand legs to the pines here teach 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.500
 they investigate teachers from more than 20 departments 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.940
 in the science faculty you can also find in addition to your offer of 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.469
 degrees an extensive list of the postgraduate degrees plus pibes and doctorate 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.270
 to know our planet investigate the climate is debatable courses and 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.939
 mineral deposits 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:49.049
 to explore the world of robotics working in a company or in the 

00:06:49.049 --> 00:06:50.199
 administration 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:55.060
 to make a career as a researcher or dedicate yourself to teaching to be 

00:06:55.059 --> 00:07:00.340
 day in electronic technology for that and much more if you are looking for a way out 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.069
 this is the front door
