tutorial<00:00:02.909> for<00:00:03.120> Josh's<00:00:03.510> ladders<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.770> design

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
tutorial for Josh's ladders this design

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.490 
tutorial for Josh's ladders this design
is<00:00:05.160> stitched<00:00:05.760> by<00:00:06.210> first<00:00:06.480> creating<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.230> sides

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
is stitched by first creating the sides

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.700 
is stitched by first creating the sides
of<00:00:07.740> your<00:00:07.890> ladder<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:09.290> then<00:00:10.290> you're<00:00:10.470> going<00:00:10.620> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
of your ladder and then you're going to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.740 
of your ladder and then you're going to
stitch<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.160> rungs<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.180> just<00:00:12.390> simply

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
stitch the rungs so you just simply

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.110 
stitch the rungs so you just simply
stitch<00:00:13.440> two<00:00:13.740> straight<00:00:14.040> lines<00:00:14.220> parallel<00:00:14.820> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
stitch two straight lines parallel to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.569 
stitch two straight lines parallel to
one<00:00:15.269> another<00:00:15.300> and<00:00:15.809> then<00:00:16.199> more<00:00:17.009> straight<00:00:17.339> lines

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:17.579 
one another and then more straight lines

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.229 
one another and then more straight lines
within<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:19.140> space<00:00:19.789> moving<00:00:20.789> back<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.150> forth

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:21.239 
within that space moving back and forth

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.239 
within that space moving back and forth
and<00:00:22.019> you<00:00:22.169> can<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.499> there's<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.919> lot<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:23.249 
and you can see there's a lot of

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.819 
and you can see there's a lot of
travelling<00:00:24.150> involved<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.050> stitch<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
travelling involved with this stitch and

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.790 
travelling involved with this stitch and
a<00:00:25.980> lot<00:00:26.159> of<00:00:26.189> precise<00:00:26.699> stitching<00:00:27.439> I'm<00:00:28.439> stitching

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
a lot of precise stitching I'm stitching

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.240 
a lot of precise stitching I'm stitching
pretty<00:00:29.249> slowly<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.419> that<00:00:30.449> way<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.229> can<00:00:31.589> keep<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
pretty slowly so that way I can keep the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
pretty slowly so that way I can keep the
stitch<00:00:32.579> quality<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.510> nice<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.469> keep

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
stitch quality very nice I can see keep

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.529 
stitch quality very nice I can see keep
my<00:00:34.980> stitches<00:00:35.399> looking<00:00:35.730> nice<00:00:35.879> and<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.329> those

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
my stitches looking nice and on those

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.840 
my stitches looking nice and on those
lines<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.140> that's<00:00:37.829> very<00:00:38.070> important<00:00:38.609> just

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
lines and that's very important just

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
lines and that's very important just
take<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.269> time<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.649> don't<00:00:40.649> try<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.129> rush

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
take your time and don't try and rush

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
take your time and don't try and rush
through<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> now<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.019> to<00:00:43.140> stitch

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
through this so now I'm going to stitch

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.279 
through this so now I'm going to stitch
another<00:00:43.710> ladder<00:00:44.070> coming<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.960> stitch

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
another ladder coming up and then stitch

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.490 
another ladder coming up and then stitch
the<00:00:46.530> rungs<00:00:46.739> again<00:00:47.839> my<00:00:48.839> husband<00:00:49.320> actually

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the rungs again my husband actually

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.489 
the rungs again my husband actually
thought<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.339> design<00:00:51.050> after<00:00:52.050> cleaning

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:52.499 
thought of this design after cleaning

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.500 
thought of this design after cleaning
off<00:00:52.769> out<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.429> gutters<00:00:53.789> who's<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.210> well<00:00:54.359> what

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
off out the gutters who's like well what

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.970 
off out the gutters who's like well what
if<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.749> could<00:00:54.960> stack<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> ladders

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
if you could stack all the ladders

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
if you could stack all the ladders
together<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.850> make<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> filler<00:00:57.570> design<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
together to make a filler design and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.759 
together to make a filler design and
this<00:00:59.039> reminds<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.699> lot<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.690> stitches<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
this reminds me a lot of in stitches and

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.009 
this reminds me a lot of in stitches and
one<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> early<00:01:02.789> designs<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.749> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
one of the early designs from the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.260 
one of the early designs from the
project<00:01:04.590> and<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.640> has<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:06.120> interesting

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
project and it has a very interesting

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740 
project and it has a very interesting
texture<00:01:07.230> it's<00:01:07.410> very<00:01:08.150> graphic<00:01:09.150> straight<00:01:09.510> lines

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
texture it's very graphic straight lines

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.770 
texture it's very graphic straight lines
and<00:01:10.140> sharp<00:01:10.380> angles<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and sharp angles so it's going to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
and sharp angles so it's going to
probably<00:01:13.320> end<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.920> being<00:01:14.160> fairly<00:01:14.430> flat<00:01:14.880> on

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
probably end up being fairly flat on

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.230 
probably end up being fairly flat on
your<00:01:15.210> quilt<00:01:15.660> but<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> same<00:01:16.980> time<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.820> gaps

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
your quilt but at the same time the gaps

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.050 
your quilt but at the same time the gaps
that<00:01:18.660> are<00:01:18.980> created<00:01:19.980> in<00:01:20.100> between<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> ladders

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that are created in between the ladders

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.800 
that are created in between the ladders
do<00:01:21.900> add<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.260> bit<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.130> design<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.210> well<00:01:24.420> so

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
do add a bit to this design as well so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.300 
do add a bit to this design as well so
it's<00:01:24.870> very<00:01:25.140> interesting<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> kind<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.100> fun<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it's very interesting and kind of fun to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's very interesting and kind of fun to
play<00:01:26.550> with<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> want<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> stack

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
play with you're going to want to stack

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.500 
play with you're going to want to stack
these<00:01:28.770> together<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.580> see<00:01:29.760> how<00:01:29.970> I'm<00:01:30.150> doing

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
these together you can see how I'm doing

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.010 
these together you can see how I'm doing
this<00:01:30.630> very<00:01:30.960> randomly<00:01:31.590> almost<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.250> they're

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
this very randomly almost like they're

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.720 
this very randomly almost like they're
kind<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> sticks<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:34.980> been<00:01:35.130> cut<00:01:35.310> throat

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
kind of sticks that have been cut throat

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.480 
kind of sticks that have been cut throat
on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> floor<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.660> this<00:01:37.530> helps<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> keep<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
on the floor and this helps to keep the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.850 
on the floor and this helps to keep the
design<00:01:38.790> looking<00:01:39.150> random<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.810> course<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
design looking random of course if you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.680 
design looking random of course if you
wanted<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.220> slightly<00:01:41.460> different<00:01:41.760> effect<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
wanted a slightly different effect you

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.470 
wanted a slightly different effect you
could<00:01:42.900> stitch<00:01:43.280> one<00:01:44.280> single<00:01:44.310> ladder<00:01:44.910> from<00:01:45.210> edge

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
could stitch one single ladder from edge

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.090 
could stitch one single ladder from edge
to<00:01:45.510> edge<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:47.460> could<00:01:47.820> stitch<00:01:48.780> them<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.380> mark

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to edge you could stitch them and mark

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
to edge you could stitch them and mark
them<00:01:50.400> in<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.820> particular<00:01:51.210> pattern<00:01:51.900> there's

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
them in a particular pattern there's

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.410 
them in a particular pattern there's
really<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.250> million<00:01:53.640> ways<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.090> could<00:01:54.270> take

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
really a million ways you could take

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840 
really a million ways you could take
this<00:01:54.540> design<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.170> play<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.980> like

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
this design and play with that I like

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.330 
this design and play with that I like
the<00:01:57.030> randomness<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.410> admittedly

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340

the randomness but this is admittedly
pretty<00:01:59.460> tricky<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.420> stitch<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:01.710> had<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> couple

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
pretty tricky to stitch I had a couple

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.700 
pretty tricky to stitch I had a couple
miss<00:02:02.880> starts<00:02:03.330> simply<00:02:03.870> because<00:02:04.020> i<00:02:04.230> stitched

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
miss starts simply because i stitched

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.250 
miss starts simply because i stitched
myself<00:02:05.070> into<00:02:05.310> kind<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.700> corner<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.260> it

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
myself into kind of a corner and it

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.320 
myself into kind of a corner and it
wasn't<00:02:07.620> looking<00:02:07.920> very<00:02:08.129> good<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:09.060> there

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
wasn't looking very good because there

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.380 
wasn't looking very good because there
were<00:02:09.390> too<00:02:09.570> many<00:02:09.690> gaps<00:02:10.050> between<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
were too many gaps between the the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.150 
were too many gaps between the the
ladders<00:02:12.840> for<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.470> look<00:02:13.650> nice

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
ladders for it to look nice

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.190 
ladders for it to look nice
so<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.820> kind<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.240> tricky<00:02:15.540> design<00:02:15.840> but

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
so it is kind of a tricky design but

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.620 
so it is kind of a tricky design but
play<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.130> fun<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.450> design

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
play with that it is fun and this design

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.200 
play with that it is fun and this design
would<00:02:18.930> look<00:02:19.140> great<00:02:19.470> stitched<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.760> boy

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
would look great stitched on a boy
