00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
way or force to have a straight way back

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.300 
way or force to have a straight way back
the<00:02:18.000> other<00:02:18.150> way<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.709> actually

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the other way so this is actually

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.550 
the other way so this is actually
remarkably<00:02:21.090> comfortable<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:22.049> here<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.439> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
remarkably comfortable so here is the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.410 
remarkably comfortable so here is the
corset<00:02:22.920> laying<00:02:23.099> flat<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:23.970> material

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
corset laying flat and for the material

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.390 
corset laying flat and for the material
of<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:24.689> for<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.079> satin<00:02:25.500> here<00:02:25.769> it's<00:02:26.159> actually

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
of this for the satin here it's actually

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.360 
of this for the satin here it's actually
more<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.269> salmon<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:28.439> opposed<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
more of a salmon as opposed to like a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.059 
more of a salmon as opposed to like a
really<00:02:29.670> bright<00:02:30.150> hot<00:02:30.840> pink<00:02:30.870> actually<00:02:31.769> in<00:02:31.890> real

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
really bright hot pink actually in real

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.380 
really bright hot pink actually in real
life<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.519> I<00:02:32.549> don't<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.879> if<00:02:32.940> that's<00:02:33.090> coming

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
life so I don't know if that's coming

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.940 
life so I don't know if that's coming
out<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.540> camera<00:02:33.959> but<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.319> absolutely

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
out on camera but it's absolutely

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.069 
out on camera but it's absolutely
beautiful<00:02:35.129> so<00:02:35.879> there's<00:02:36.269> that<00:02:36.480> satin<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
beautiful so there's that satin on the

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.800 
beautiful so there's that satin on the
outside<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.829> then<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.609> inside<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.359> you

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
outside and then on the inside here you

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.440 
outside and then on the inside here you
can<00:02:39.959> see<00:02:40.079> that<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:40.440> lined<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:41.129> could<00:02:41.400> tell<00:02:41.640> if

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
can see that it's lined in could tell if

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.300 
can see that it's lined in could tell if
this<00:02:42.689> one<00:02:42.870> does<00:02:43.049> not<00:02:43.079> have<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.470> floating<00:02:43.890> liner

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
this one does not have a floating liner

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.430 
this one does not have a floating liner
but<00:02:44.609> you<00:02:44.730> can<00:02:45.090> purchase<00:02:45.480> corsets<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:46.409> a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
but you can purchase corsets with a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.860 
but you can purchase corsets with a
liner<00:02:46.829> for<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> small<00:02:47.549> markup<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> website

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
liner for a small markup on the website

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.229 
liner for a small markup on the website
and<00:02:49.200> for<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.010> construction<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.940> if<00:02:51.120> I

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
and for the construction of this if I

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.360 
and for the construction of this if I
turn<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.599> on<00:02:51.690> its<00:02:51.900> side<00:02:52.139> here<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.099> see

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
turn it on its side here you can see

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.569 
turn it on its side here you can see
that<00:02:53.579> it<00:02:53.760> has<00:02:53.790> eight<00:02:54.420> panels<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.859> two

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
that it has eight panels here one two

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.839 
that it has eight panels here one two
three<00:02:57.450> four<00:02:57.959> in<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.440> front<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.950> then<00:02:59.579> five

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
three four in the front and then five

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.270 
three four in the front and then five
six<00:03:00.239> seven<00:03:00.780> eight<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.799> back<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.250> so

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
six seven eight for the back here so

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.710 
six seven eight for the back here so
eight<00:03:02.790> panel<00:03:03.450> pattern<00:03:04.349> total<00:03:04.829> sixteen<00:03:05.720> panels

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
eight panel pattern total sixteen panels

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.800 
eight panel pattern total sixteen panels
in<00:03:06.959> all<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.889> for<00:03:08.639> the<00:03:08.700> actual<00:03:08.849> assembly<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.659> can

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
in all and for the actual assembly I can

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.119 
in all and for the actual assembly I can
see<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.109> that<00:03:10.139> each<00:03:10.379> seam<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.889> stitched

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
see here that each seam is stitched

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.830 
see here that each seam is stitched
multiple<00:03:11.549> times<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.940> actually<00:03:12.329> if<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.480> read

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
multiple times and actually if you read

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.839 
multiple times and actually if you read
on<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.260> Electra<00:03:13.560> designs<00:03:13.859> website<00:03:14.340> Alexis

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
on the Electra designs website Alexis

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.939 
on the Electra designs website Alexis
says<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.209> each<00:03:15.359> theme<00:03:15.629> is<00:03:15.810> stitched<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.470> total

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
says that each theme is stitched a total

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.400 
says that each theme is stitched a total
of<00:03:17.069> four<00:03:17.370> times<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:18.750> very<00:03:18.900> sturdily

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
of four times so it's very sturdily

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.289 
of four times so it's very sturdily
constructed<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.699> bones<00:03:20.910> they're

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
constructed as for the bones they're

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.500 
constructed as for the bones they're
sandwiched<00:03:21.989> in<00:03:22.199> between<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.530> layers<00:03:22.889> and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
sandwiched in between the layers and

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.539 
sandwiched in between the layers and
there<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.660> one<00:03:24.900> bone<00:03:25.169> on<00:03:25.440> each<00:03:25.650> seat<00:03:25.949> as<00:03:26.190> well

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
there is one bone on each seat as well

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.640 
there is one bone on each seat as well
as<00:03:26.790> an<00:03:27.209> additional<00:03:27.810> bone<00:03:28.049> in<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.319> middle<00:03:28.349> of

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
as an additional bone in the middle of

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.050 
as an additional bone in the middle of
the<00:03:28.739> panel's<00:03:29.129> if<00:03:29.280> they're<00:03:29.459> large<00:03:29.699> enough<00:03:29.790> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
the panel's if they're large enough to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.770 
the panel's if they're large enough to
do<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.129> is<00:03:32.489> really<00:03:33.060> really<00:03:33.329> nice<00:03:33.599> I

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
do so so that is really really nice I

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.930 
do so so that is really really nice I
actually<00:03:33.930> prefer<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.799> type<00:03:35.129> of<00:03:35.190> boning<00:03:35.730> to

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
actually prefer this type of boning to

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.750 
actually prefer this type of boning to
just<00:03:36.480> having<00:03:36.780> double<00:03:37.530> bones<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:37.949> the<00:03:38.310> seams

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
just having double bones on the seams

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.189 
just having double bones on the seams
because<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:39.480> feels<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:39.900> it

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
because it just feels like it

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.839 
because it just feels like it
distributes<00:03:40.949> the<00:03:41.099> tension<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.549> little<00:03:41.669> bit

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
distributes the tension a little bit

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.930 
distributes the tension a little bit
better<00:03:42.120> here<00:03:42.449> of<00:03:43.079> course<00:03:43.340> there<00:03:44.340> are<00:03:44.370> two

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
better here of course there are two

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.839 
better here of course there are two
bones<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:46.290> scene<00:03:46.680> here<00:03:47.099> because<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.669> needs

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
bones on the scene here because it needs

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.720 
bones on the scene here because it needs
to<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.180> able<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.629> support<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.459> side

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
to be able to support this the the side

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.449 
to be able to support this the the side
hits<00:03:51.090> right<00:03:51.389> there<00:03:51.739> for<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.829> inside<00:03:53.160> here

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
hits right there for the inside here

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.250 
hits right there for the inside here
like<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.819> said<00:03:54.000> before<00:03:54.120> no<00:03:54.480> floating<00:03:54.750> liner<00:03:55.049> but

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
like I said before no floating liner but

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.920 
like I said before no floating liner but
you<00:03:55.379> can<00:03:55.620> get<00:03:55.889> a<00:03:55.919> floating<00:03:56.340> liner<00:03:56.549> if<00:03:57.419> you<00:03:57.659> pay

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
you can get a floating liner if you pay

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.050 
you can get a floating liner if you pay
for<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.319> but<00:03:58.709> this<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.129> just<00:03:59.159> a<00:03:59.370> sample<00:03:59.609> so<00:04:00.030> I

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
for it but this was just a sample so I

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.509

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.230 
they have a very small flange around
them<00:05:41.199> but<00:05:41.919> like<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.400> said<00:05:42.550> this<00:05:42.639> is<00:05:42.789> a<00:05:42.820> non-issue

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
them but like I said this is a non-issue

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.790 
them but like I said this is a non-issue
because<00:05:43.479> it's<00:05:43.780> set<00:05:43.930> into<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.289> bone<00:05:44.469> itself

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
because it's set into the bone itself

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.189 
because it's set into the bone itself
not<00:05:45.099> just<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.460> fabric<00:05:45.699> so<00:05:46.419> it's<00:05:46.659> not<00:05:46.810> going<00:05:47.110> to

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
not just the fabric so it's not going to

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.290 
not just the fabric so it's not going to
come<00:05:47.409> free<00:05:47.710> at<00:05:47.830> all<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.340> lot<00:05:48.849> of<00:05:48.909> the<00:05:49.090> tension

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
come free at all a lot of the tension

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.450 
come free at all a lot of the tension
from<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.659> laces<00:05:50.050> are<00:05:50.199> taken<00:05:50.949> by<00:05:51.099> the<00:05:51.159> bone

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
from the laces are taken by the bone

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.459 
from the laces are taken by the bone
itself<00:05:51.909> as<00:05:52.030> opposed<00:05:52.360> to<00:05:52.449> the<00:05:52.599> actual<00:05:52.750> grommets

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.550 
itself as opposed to the actual grommets
and<00:05:54.389> alexis<00:05:55.389> says<00:05:55.569> that<00:05:55.810> she<00:05:55.960> finds<00:05:56.199> these

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
and alexis says that she finds these

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.890 
and alexis says that she finds these
small<00:05:57.069> flanges<00:05:57.430> to<00:05:57.520> be<00:05:57.729> more<00:05:58.419> aesthetically

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
small flanges to be more aesthetically

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.629 
small flanges to be more aesthetically
pleasing<00:05:58.990> than<00:05:59.500> the<00:05:59.770> grommets<00:06:00.250> with<00:06:00.370> a<00:06:00.400> great

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.270 
pleasing than the grommets with a great
big<00:06:00.819> honkin<00:06:01.599> flange<00:06:02.199> around<00:06:02.530> them<00:06:02.680> so<00:06:03.130> there

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
big honkin flange around them so there

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.659 
big honkin flange around them so there
are<00:06:03.430> 28<00:06:04.389> of<00:06:04.419> these<00:06:04.690> two-part<00:06:05.380> eyelets<00:06:05.710> 14<00:06:06.520> on
