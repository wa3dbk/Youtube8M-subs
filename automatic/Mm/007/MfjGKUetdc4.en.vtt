I<00:00:14.009> want<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.280> build<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.759> world<00:00:15.059> i<00:00:15.210> built<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I want to build the world i built the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.590 
I want to build the world i built the
prototyping<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.320> now<00:00:16.529> gone<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:16.980> i<00:00:17.600> will

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
prototyping is now gone but i will

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.470 
prototyping is now gone but i will
recreate<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.470> survival<00:00:19.800> server<00:00:20.480> it

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
recreate it in a survival server it

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.450 
recreate it in a survival server it
shouldn't<00:00:21.840> take<00:00:21.869> long<00:00:21.990> did<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.560> basic<00:00:23.130> design

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
shouldn't take long did it basic design

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.529 
shouldn't take long did it basic design
is<00:00:24.529> correct<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.680> anyway<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.150> it

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
is correct it anyway so that is not it

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.540 
is correct it anyway so that is not it

is the result I don't exactly know what
got<00:00:48.690> over<00:00:48.719> me<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.520> why<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> even<00:00:50.850> built<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.360> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
got over me or why I even built it it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.950 
got over me or why I even built it it
was<00:00:51.960> an<00:00:52.379> idea<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.539> wanted<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
was an idea I got and I just wanted to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
was an idea I got and I just wanted to
see<00:00:55.199> how<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:57.980> when<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.039> actually<00:00:59.280> built

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
see how it was in when I actually built

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.119 
see how it was in when I actually built
it<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> house<00:01:03.680> it<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> the

it and it is actually a house it is the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.370 
it and it is actually a house it is the
weirdest<00:01:05.790> most<00:01:06.030> crazy<00:01:06.420> house<00:01:06.689> i<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.170> ever

weirdest most crazy house i have ever
built<00:01:07.560> by<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.860> house<00:01:08.070> no<00:01:08.280> less<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:11.840> i<00:01:12.840> can

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
built by the house no less and i can

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
built by the house no less and i can
just<00:01:13.680> show<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.159> from<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> inside<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
just show you this from the inside this

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
just show you this from the inside this
is<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> entrance<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:18.500> i<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.680> made<00:01:19.890> it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
is the entrance and i have made it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.130 
is the entrance and i have made it
possible<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.640> used<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.060> survival<00:01:21.720> mode<00:01:21.750> too

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
possible to be used in survival mode too

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.700 
possible to be used in survival mode too
even<00:01:22.950> though<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.250> built<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.640> creative<00:01:24.000> mode

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
even though it's built in creative mode

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.120 
even though it's built in creative mode
and<00:01:26.180> this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and this is the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
and this is the
what<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.000> call<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> main<00:01:30.750> room<00:01:31.020> I'm

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
what can you call it the main room I'm

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.690 
what can you call it the main room I'm
heading<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:33.799> it's<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.340> directly

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
heading for now it's just going directly

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.120 
heading for now it's just going directly
up<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.090> get<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> exit<00:01:36.719> exit

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
up and you get to the exit exit

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.080 
up and you get to the exit exit
entrance/exit<00:01:38.130> thing<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
entrance/exit thing and this is one of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
entrance/exit thing and this is one of
the<00:01:42.270> rooms<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.259> nine<00:01:43.439> rooms<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.950> total

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the rooms there are nine rooms in total

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.760 
the rooms there are nine rooms in total
all<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.640> them<00:01:44.939> looks<00:01:45.329> pretty<00:01:46.079> much<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.409> this

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
all of them looks pretty much like this

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.200 
all of them looks pretty much like this
oh<00:01:51.799> yeah

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.899 

so<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:56.049> is<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.320> floor<00:01:56.590> where<00:01:56.979> for<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.700> rooms

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
so this is the floor where for the rooms

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.870 
so this is the floor where for the rooms
are<00:01:59.340> eight<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.729> rooms<00:02:02.430> pretty<00:02:03.430> much<00:02:03.670> like

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
are eight of the rooms pretty much like

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.670 
are eight of the rooms pretty much like
this<00:02:04.090> although<00:02:04.360> only<00:02:04.690> four<00:02:05.050> of<00:02:05.080> them<00:02:05.290> has<00:02:05.440> the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
this although only four of them has the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.520 
this although only four of them has the
water<00:02:05.979> column<00:02:06.190> here<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.750> other<00:02:07.930> four<00:02:08.259> looks

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
water column here the other four looks

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:17.809 
water column here the other four looks
like<00:02:08.770> this<00:02:09.009> one<00:02:09.220> up<00:02:09.429> here

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.920 

so<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:19.469> is<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:20.180> entirely<00:02:21.180> necessary<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.810> have

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
so it is not entirely necessary to have

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.559 
so it is not entirely necessary to have
a<00:02:22.129> water<00:02:23.129> access<00:02:23.579> liver<00:02:24.439> in<00:02:25.439> every<00:02:25.889> room

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
a water access liver in every room

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.170 
a water access liver in every room
actually<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:28.069> theory<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.189> only<00:02:29.370> needs<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.760> but

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
actually in theory it only needs one but

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.360 
actually in theory it only needs one but
I<00:02:30.209> don't<00:02:30.739> want<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.889> run<00:02:32.129> from<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:35.069> entire

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
I don't want to run from the entire

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.879 
I don't want to run from the entire
house<00:02:35.639> to<00:02:35.939> get<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.329> a<00:02:36.540> water<00:02:37.170> never<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:40.680> this

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
house to get to a water never but this

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.309 
house to get to a water never but this
is<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.670> house<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:42.180> think<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.689> awesome<00:02:42.989> this

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
is the house I think it is awesome this
