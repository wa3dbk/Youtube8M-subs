00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

I<00:00:00.120> personally<00:00:00.840> do<00:00:01.199> not<00:00:01.350> do<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.800> method<00:00:02.100> any

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
I personally do not do this method any

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.550 
I personally do not do this method any
longer<00:00:03.030> because<00:00:03.149> I'm<00:00:03.510> so<00:00:03.780> used<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.110> drawing<00:00:04.350> my

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
longer because I'm so used to drawing my

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.289 
longer because I'm so used to drawing my
eyebrows<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.040> know<00:00:05.250> what<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.609> like<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:05.970> where

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
eyebrows on I know what I like and where

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.690 
eyebrows on I know what I like and where
to<00:00:06.779> put<00:00:06.930> them<00:00:07.080> but<00:00:07.649> start<00:00:08.010> with<00:00:08.069> three<00:00:08.519> dots

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
to put them but start with three dots

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.310 
to put them but start with three dots
you<00:00:09.450> very<00:00:09.780> simple<00:00:10.139> connect<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> dots<00:00:10.920> go<00:00:11.250> one

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
you very simple connect the dots go one

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.099 
you very simple connect the dots go one
and<00:00:14.839> two<00:00:15.839> now<00:00:17.029> when<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.119> start<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.510> perfect<00:00:18.930> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
and two now when you start to perfect it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.349 
and two now when you start to perfect it
obviously<00:00:19.560> you're<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.070> round<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.180> out<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
obviously you're going to round it out a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.960 
obviously you're going to round it out a
little<00:00:21.570> bit<00:00:21.779> more<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:26.010> personally<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
little bit more and I personally like a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.810 
little bit more and I personally like a
thicker<00:00:27.330> eyebrow<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> bottom<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.640> would

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
thicker eyebrow on the bottom so I would

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.669 
thicker eyebrow on the bottom so I would
draw<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.449> bit<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.230> you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
draw it up a little bit and then you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.040 
draw it up a little bit and then you
know<00:00:35.180> soften<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.300> out<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.940> another<00:00:38.940> fact<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
know soften it out and another fact to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.330 
know soften it out and another fact to
know<00:00:41.780> eyebrows<00:00:42.780> are<00:00:43.050> cousins<00:00:43.590> they're<00:00:44.190> not

the<00:01:24.960> dots<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.890> draw<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> dot<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.150> draw

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the dots you know draw the dot here draw

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
the dots you know draw the dot here draw
the<00:01:27.600> dot<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.350> match<00:01:28.560> draw<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> dot<00:01:29.759> up

here<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:31.020> wherever<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.710> them<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
here you know wherever you want them to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.649 
here you know wherever you want them to
match<00:01:32.189> because<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.880> want<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.329> eyebrows

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
match because you do want your eyebrows

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.770 
match because you do want your eyebrows
to<00:01:33.900> look<00:01:33.930> close<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.310> each<00:01:35.430> other<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:36.600> get

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
to look close to each other don't get

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.990 
to look close to each other don't get
discouraged<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.350> they're<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.650> identical

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
discouraged when they're not identical

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.850 
discouraged when they're not identical
also<00:01:39.000> another<00:01:39.570> trick<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.409> probably<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
also another trick that's probably the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.880 
also another trick that's probably the
most<00:01:40.979> important<00:01:41.490> trick<00:01:41.670> besides<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.270> dots<00:01:42.479> if

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
most important trick besides the dots if

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.310 
most important trick besides the dots if
you're<00:01:43.890> right-handed<00:01:44.570> do<00:01:45.570> your<00:01:45.780> left<00:01:46.079> eyebrow

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you're right-handed do your left eyebrow

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080 
you're right-handed do your left eyebrow
first<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.250> important<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:47.729> your

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
first it's very important because your

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.980 
first it's very important because your
dominant<00:01:48.600> side<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.250> easier<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> do

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
dominant side is easier for you to do

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.870 
dominant side is easier for you to do
you<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.320> draw<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.520> you

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you know you just draw it up and you

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.719 
you know you just draw it up and you
know<00:01:54.000> whatever<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:55.020> quickly<00:01:55.259> put<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
know whatever just quickly put it on and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
know whatever just quickly put it on and
it's<00:01:57.149> easier<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> match<00:01:57.840> your<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:58.170> side<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it's easier to match your right side to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920 
it's easier to match your right side to
your<00:01:58.799> left<00:01:58.950> side<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.820> your<00:02:00.360> weaker<00:02:00.719> side

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
your left side so do your weaker side

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
your left side so do your weaker side
before<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.250> your<00:02:02.340> dominant<00:02:02.759> side<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
before you do your dominant side and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.100 
before you do your dominant side and
connect<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> dots<00:02:04.290> easy<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.820> two<00:02:06.180> three

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.139 
connect the dots easy as one two three
and<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.770> round<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.129> out<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.580> obviously<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and then round it out and obviously you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.999 
and then round it out and obviously you
can<00:02:09.360> put<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.750> inish<00:02:10.080> any<00:02:10.319> design<00:02:10.979> you

can put them on inish any design you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.700 
can put them on inish any design you
want<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> triangle<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:12.989> do
