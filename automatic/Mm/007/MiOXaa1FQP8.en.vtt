a wearable Solar is focusing on debt and
where<00:00:29.399> the<00:00:29.550> Solar<00:00:29.759> is<00:00:29.970> about<00:00:30.349> integrating

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
solar cells into fashion so the body can

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.560 
solar cells into fashion so the body can
become<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:34.260> actual<00:00:34.500> source<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.770> energy<00:00:35.570> the

variability<00:00:36.899> plays<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> very<00:00:37.559> important<00:00:38.010> role

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
variability plays a very important role

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
variability plays a very important role
in<00:00:38.219> my<00:00:38.430> work<00:00:38.640> because<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.210> am<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> fashion

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
in my work because I am a fashion

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.690 
in my work because I am a fashion
designer<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.530> I'm<00:00:40.770> dealing<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.460> human

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
designer and I'm dealing with the human

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.729 
designer and I'm dealing with the human
body<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.510> not<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.899> aesthetic<00:00:43.410> bodies

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
body and it's not just aesthetic bodies

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.040 
body and it's not just aesthetic bodies
it's<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> body<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> movement<00:00:45.179> a<00:00:45.629> body<00:00:45.839> with

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
it's a body a movement a body with

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
it's a body a movement a body with
expressions<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.640> sensory<00:00:48.480> surface<00:00:49.999> so<00:00:50.999> it's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
expressions a sensory surface so it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.430 
expressions a sensory surface so it's
very<00:00:51.239> important<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> stress<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> wearability

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
very important to stress the wearability

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.139 
very important to stress the wearability
I<00:00:52.739> think<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> only<00:00:53.429> way<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.670> really

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
I think this is the only way to really

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.669 
I think this is the only way to really
connect<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> market<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> connect<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
connect to the market to connect to

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.700 
connect to the market to connect to
people<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.909> to<00:00:57.210> again<00:00:57.510> transcend<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
people and to again transcend the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.610 
people and to again transcend the
reality<00:00:59.129> edges<00:00:59.429> and<00:00:59.609> performers<00:01:00.559> there<00:01:01.559> are

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
reality edges and performers there are

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.200 
reality edges and performers there are
two<00:01:01.769> different<00:01:02.039> prototypes<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> them<00:01:03.089> is

two different prototypes one of them is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
two different prototypes one of them is

for<00:01:23.100> an<00:01:23.400> hour<00:01:23.550> they<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.360> generate<00:01:24.690> enough

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
for an hour they can generate enough

for<00:01:28.140> 50%<00:01:28.820> an<00:01:29.820> important<00:01:30.300> next<00:01:30.480> step<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.990> take

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
for 50% an important next step to take

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.930 
for 50% an important next step to take
wearable<00:01:31.410> technology<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.070> another<00:01:32.310> level<00:01:32.640> is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
wearable technology to another level is

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.820 
wearable technology to another level is
to<00:01:33.150> look<00:01:33.330> at<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.620> commercialization<00:01:34.620> of<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
to look at the commercialization of it

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.460 
to look at the commercialization of it
all<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.160> I<00:01:35.460> mean<00:01:35.910> we<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.570> lot<00:01:36.870> of<00:01:36.900> exciting

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
all so I mean we see a lot of exciting

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.500 
all so I mean we see a lot of exciting
projects<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.980> lot<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.130> design<00:01:38.640> prototyping

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
projects a lot of design prototyping

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.960 
projects a lot of design prototyping
going<00:01:39.870> on<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.830> really<00:01:41.100> amazing<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:41.730> quick

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
going on it's really amazing how quick

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
going on it's really amazing how quick
things<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.360> evolving<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.080> but<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
things are evolving I think but it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.890 
things are evolving I think but it's
also<00:01:44.040> important<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> look<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:45.060> how<00:01:45.330> all<00:01:45.690> these

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
also important to look at how all these

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.500 
also important to look at how all these
new<00:01:46.470> designs<00:01:46.800> can<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.730> integrated<00:01:48.330> into

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
new designs can be integrated into

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.690 
new designs can be integrated into
things<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.050> production<00:01:49.500> chain<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
things like the production chain and the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
things like the production chain and the
the<00:01:50.910> manufacturing<00:01:51.510> of<00:01:51.690> clothing<00:01:52.170> nowadays

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the manufacturing of clothing nowadays

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
the manufacturing of clothing nowadays
how<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.220> should<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.640> altered<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
how that should be altered to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.310 
how that should be altered to
incorporate<00:01:55.230> these<00:01:55.410> new<00:01:55.620> technologies<00:01:56.130> also
