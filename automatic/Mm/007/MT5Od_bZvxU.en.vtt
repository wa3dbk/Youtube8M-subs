00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 how are you because maniac I am 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.760
 mini and good here I bring you a new 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.250
 analysis vessel and this time this is the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.040
 pokemon mirotic 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.920
 mirotic is a water type pokÃ©mon that 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.860
 has the special scan abilities and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.550
 tenacity and the hidden skill would be the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.550
 great charm 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.040
 it's a special bed what it does is it goes up 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.520
 the defense if it suffers some attack of 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.520
 state 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.960
 tenacity what it does is that the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.260
 special attack is reduced in some 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.260
 characteristic 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.659
 and great charm what it does is that it can 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.659
 get to fall in love with the rival 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.430
 better attacks that I would put a 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.760
 mirotic would be water pumps or surf 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.460
 hypnosis mantle mirror or ice ray 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.480
 or we can also make it toxic and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.760
 protection ray ice and surf and object 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.760
 equipped we will put leftovers 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.320
 the natures that we can put to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.300
 a mirotic would be the serene one that climbs us 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.610
 the special defense and we would lower the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.350
 attack and we can also put the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.150
 modest that increases the attack 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.150
 special and we would lower the attack 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.150
 mirotic is a water type pokemon that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.180
 I really like it is a very pokemon 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.180
 resistant to special attacks 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.440
 because he has a lot of special defense 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.220
 ice beam we will put it for the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.220
 Pokemon type plant or flying 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.019
 south and attack the pump today it 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.079
 we will put especially for the pokemon of 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.079
 fire type rock type and earth type 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.680
 the mantle attack mirror we will put it 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.720
 especially for type pokemon 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.330
 electric that we launch attacks 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.129
 specials or plant-type pokemon 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.129
 that they launch us special attacks 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.030
 and the hypnosis attack we will put it 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.760
 to try to sleep our rivals 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.879
 what also if you do not want these 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.549
 attacks we can put the toxic combo 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.739
 more protection because as a mirotic has 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.650
 enough special defense will hold us 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.609
 quite well the attacks and more if you 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.609
 we remove remains 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.459
 and well, that's all I hope you 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.620
 this little analysis has helped 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.540

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.540
