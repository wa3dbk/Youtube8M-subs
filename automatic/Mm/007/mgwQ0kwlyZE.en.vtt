 Easter eggs for me an indie game octodad 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.220
 and the very first link we have is in 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.439
 churches at the very first level exactly 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.149
 then when you go to your wedding on 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.790
 one of the glasses you can see 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.020
 local saint is own 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.210
 persona katuhu 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.250
 the same sleeve about which he wrote 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.469
 howard lovecraft that howard 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.340
 lovecraft which is considered one of 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.620
 maestro 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.050
 horror I advise everyone to read by the way 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 came up with things like the necronomicon and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.420
 cthulhu and other stuff other about whose 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.920
 outstanding writer and in the world of the act of grandfather 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.660
 cthulhu is a deity or holy all 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.510
 The rest of the easter eggs can be found in 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.460
 the store basically they are here in other 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 places I did not find for example going up here to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.490
 in this shop you can see cheese in the form 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.430
 pakmana but this is understandable to the classics of the genre 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.640
 further here is just to the right 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.950
 milk 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.350
 one pushes throw out we find 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.939
 here is orange milk on it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.189
 written eclipsed the company 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.350
 This is a reference to one of the team. 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.110
 developers bad game company which 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 created Journey flower &amp; flow 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.030
 having looked still you can check 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.460
 notice such a rack of mind kraft 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.250
 here probably anyone will understand what it is and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.560
 what is this sending for easter 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.960
 egg of course maykravt by the way if you 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.610
 take the creeper's head then he will smoke 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.100
 but otherwise everything is very clear 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.369
 probably the most obvious Easter eggs in this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.470
 the game well maybe another mid fight so 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.680
 obvious at mid'e bout let's move on to 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.680
 him 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.850
 and while we go to the meat kid I want 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.550
 pay attention to the poster club see 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.250
 right the bedbug is an old flash game where 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.720
 you play easy from the summer and run 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.580
 I press these qw o and n keys 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.490
 Well, by itself, here it is with boy as 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.280
 see pieces of meat with plasters like u 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.440
 meat kid and saw in accuracy such 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.380
 same as in the very game where i am 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.150
 I tell it and now we return to 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.330
 exit and find the machine which 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.670
 looks like robs 3 pro on these 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.800
 stripes in the back is an exact copy of the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.500
 the game itself is in this machine again 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.390
 there are easter eggs there sending on judge dreadlocks 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.700
 on some developers actually 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.220
 it is very far from us because a lot 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.860
 references that we simply do not understand 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.690
 as they are connected more likely abroad 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:00.790
 than with us but judge dread 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:03.640
 obvious further we have sending with a poster 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.130
 stanley stanley parable who did not understand and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.860
 such a cool indie game this ship 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.799
 This is a reference to the game retrograde can 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.870
 google on easter eggs on icing like 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.500
 on donuts and all principle here too 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.260
 understandably 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.269
 robe fashion is the creators of tony hawk 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.620
 the latter is not very successful total 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.600
 biscuit famous critic 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.519

 lie a box which is 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.049

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.049
