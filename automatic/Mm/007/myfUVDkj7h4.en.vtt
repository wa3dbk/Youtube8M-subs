you need so all you need to do is just

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.789

flash the rom itself so just flash it so
this<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:05.040> take<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.399> moment<00:02:05.549> obviously

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
this will take just a moment obviously

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520

considering<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.719> nexus<00:02:07.020> 4<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.350> not<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
considering the nexus 4 it's not the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.529 
considering the nexus 4 it's not the
Nexus<00:02:07.829> 5<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.520> take<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.940> little<00:02:09.390> bit

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
Nexus 5 it's going to take a little bit

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.120 
Nexus 5 it's going to take a little bit
longer

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
longer

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.190 
longer
than<00:02:10.250> usual<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.240> really<00:02:11.630> it's<00:02:11.780> actually

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
than usual but really it's actually

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.680 
than usual but really it's actually
quite<00:02:12.440> quite<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.800> small<00:02:13.010> wrong<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:13.880> will<00:02:14.600> be

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.150 
quite quite a small wrong so I will be
back<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:14.960> soon<00:02:14.990> as<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.350> done<00:02:15.440> flashing

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.710 
back as soon as this is done flashing
already<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.150> looks<00:02:17.300> like<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.450> done

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.020 
already and it looks like it's done
flashing<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.770> yes<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.580> at<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:19.820> point

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
flashing and yes it is so at this point

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.910 
flashing and yes it is so at this point
all<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.210> got<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.510> do<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.810> click<00:02:21.170> on<00:02:21.320> reboot

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
all we got to do is click on reboot

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.400 
all we got to do is click on reboot
system<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.610> obviously<00:02:23.540> your<00:02:23.780> first<00:02:24.110> boot

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
system and obviously your first boot

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.020 
system and obviously your first boot
like<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.980> always<00:02:25.130> say<00:02:25.340> always<00:02:25.550> takes<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.940> little

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
like I always say always takes a little

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.340 
like I always say always takes a little
while<00:02:26.210> because<00:02:26.390> everything<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.810> compiling<00:02:27.170> in

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
while because everything is compiling in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.450 
while because everything is compiling in
the<00:02:27.410> background<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.070> have<00:02:28.220> some

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
the background so just have some

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.850 
the background so just have some
patience<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> will<00:02:30.170> eventually<00:02:30.410> boot

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
patience but it will eventually boot

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.050 
patience but it will eventually boot
into<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.370> you'll<00:02:31.550> be<00:02:31.610> off<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:31.970> races

into it and you'll be off to the races

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.910 
into it and you'll be off to the races
