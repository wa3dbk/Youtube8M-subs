00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.060
 It is sometimes taking a fresh green this time 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.340
 How to take light and its timing 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:29.810
 We would like to continue to the discussion about this 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:36.020
 First, here please refer to this screen and still it is a shot treasure late in rural areas Plateau 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:40.770
 It is also the time of this situation but is fresh green eyes book a little in front of the state 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:48.060
 Is that how can I photographed in 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.260
 It's like this You put larchs vertically and horizontally, and you're mountainous with a background of mountains. 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.350
 Overlap 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.980
 Show off while taking so 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.480
 I think that is not bad for the purpose, so let me see it and leave 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:05.000
 Become the same color 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:09.690
 It is with the background including the beginning of the heart 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.670
 I've almost unified It is colors 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.530
 That means especially this part 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:21.759
 And the upper part is now turned whiteish on the contrary 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:27.100
 The amount of light can be controlled using Verdi, though 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:32.380
 Cares in the balance of it is the way to the control color is not change 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.690
 If you try to aim for an earlier time than when you come out, what will it be like? 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.350
 It is called 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:43.950
 It can be taken in such a feel 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:49.060
 You can see it when you look at the data, but that's about 1/93 of a second 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.880
 Also I am using the impression that 1/13 Byoiso 800 by the diaphragm grade 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.040
 I say why I took it in 1/13 seconds 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.560
 Relatively windy 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.280
 や っ て や っ て 9 9 こ の 部分 部分 部分 部分 思 う 思 う 思 う 思 う 思 う 形 形 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.920
 but 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.200
 Main place is 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.679
 I'm not swinging like this, but I'm just playing around because the area is shaking . 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.090
 Also 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:18.010
 It is that we chose the warriors and speed so much 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.580
 It 's a focal distance of 120 mm , so it's not a telephoto. 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.540
 And it is substitution correspondence choosing shutter speed of Eco 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:31.210
 That's why I chose to target and say that more than this 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:35.660
 The shutter speed is too slow and the shutter speed balance light 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:42.440
 Before getting out , think about the shutter speed balance 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.100
 If you would like to take a look at the exposure and shoot in this situation 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.620
 Is it 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:51.299
 But rather a result of the more early time in shooting 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.069
 Besides, if I unify to blue tone and express it with a silhouette in such a time zone 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.069
 It becomes possible to say 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.850
 It's morning when you say why this is blue 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:04.130
 It means that the color temperature is high 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.420
 Because the color temperature is high until the fire comes out, it turns blue so I applied another blue filter 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.040
 It is not a reason 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:13.810
 In this way it turns blue it is also taken with a typical example light shooting 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.810
 Well depending on the situation 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.550
 It is mode tungsten mode for traditional schools 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.030
 It is also possible to take a picture and make it more blue 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.500
 I think there is, but in this case it is back in 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.580
 The lights of I think you have this little red light city it is around here 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.050
 White balance's also the fact that you want to a certain extent the Mamada is 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.140
 Taken with lights at 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:45.920
 Then I would like to see the next case 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:50.400
 This is also I'd It is to have fire come out to reverse the day is out the faint of earlier 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:56.069
 The place which is different from the picture which I showed at the beginning is crowded and taken . 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.700
 The larch in the depths is alright, but I think the larch in front is still 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.939
 Still 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:04.170
 It is in a state of feeling that I was a little tired of the branches 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:10.420
 Such is the feeling of buds it is in the case, but hey still Well hey backlight Pounds 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:16.720
 This is also backlit, but the light is that it is not strong yet 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:22.060
 Make a light street Look at the whole situation at this time What is the state of the light 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:26.410
 It's there is a correspondence towards the upper right also I do not look at the so-called this screen 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:32.410
 Correspondence of the upper right person is it now in the cloud? 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.310
 And think about composition at timing whether it is likely to come out from among the ninth from now on 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.240
 Please give me 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.800
 It's very important to take it like this 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.470
 Say messy 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.129
 It makes a sense a little It is this part to try to put a space on top and make a change 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.129
 In this sentence 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.310
 Even if you try to catch 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:53.670
 After all 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.280
 I think it can not be said that the balance of the composition of the photos is very good. 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.750
 Therefore, it is more 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.750
 Cheer Day 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.270
 We have taken down the point 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:09.060
 I would like to do something 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:11.009
 I am looking for a timing of the light situation and the light coming into the house . 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.390
 First, before that 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.760
 Select by this composition 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:24.450
 I mean, this time it is about 200 mm ahead, but it is 100 mm. 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.780
 The focal length of the previous time is doubled, and please look at the stop in comparison with the previous time 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.449
 Too 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:34.629
 A little further ahead is 6 points 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:35.319
 And to this time blur behind much of the larch, which has been opened and the diaphragm 5.6 edition of the three-dimensional effect 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:41.259
 Take out 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:46.479
 And the moment that this light strikes strongly is to aim at this moment 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:48.440
 Let's make a light town with this composition before the light comes out instead of making this composition from 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:55.550
 In the case of a photo, always 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:06:00.290
 It is important not to chase but to have a stance to wait for it. 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.310
 You can create more works by waiting and taking pictures 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.310
