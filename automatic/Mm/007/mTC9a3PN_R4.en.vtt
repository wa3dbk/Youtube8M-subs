I'm Tom marchment from apres bikes where
the<00:00:09.120> renesis<00:00:09.540> could<00:00:09.690> be<00:00:09.750> tuned<00:00:09.900> in<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> UK

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the renesis could be tuned in the UK

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.999 
the renesis could be tuned in the UK
this<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.759> new<00:00:12.030> razor<00:00:12.269> wheel<00:00:12.540> set<00:00:12.809> which<00:00:13.769> is

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
this is the new razor wheel set which is

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.430 
this is the new razor wheel set which is
due<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:14.880> release<00:00:14.960> January<00:00:15.960> February<00:00:16.139> next

year so in 2010 there's a lot of new

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.710 
year so in 2010 there's a lot of new
technologies<00:00:19.710> got<00:00:19.890> into<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:21.270> lots<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
technologies got into it and lots of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.439 
technologies got into it and lots of
interesting<00:00:22.050> new<00:00:22.470> developments<00:00:23.210> lots<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.300> lot

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
interesting new developments lots a lot

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.550 
interesting new developments lots a lot
of<00:00:24.510> work<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:26.039> guy<00:00:26.220> behind<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.910> new<00:00:27.510> top<00:00:28.349> hand

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
of work the guy behind the new top hand

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
language called the studio line of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.870 
language called the studio line of
wheels<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.449> rails<00:00:31.019> instantly<00:00:32.009> called<00:00:32.279> poorly

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
wheels and rails instantly called poorly

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.959 
wheels and rails instantly called poorly
and<00:00:33.210> he<00:00:33.660> has<00:00:33.989> obviously<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.190> lot<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.340> experience

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and he has obviously a lot of experience

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.850 
and he has obviously a lot of experience
something<00:00:36.420> may<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.809> heard<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.079> him<00:00:37.230> from<00:00:37.440> his

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
something may have heard of him from his

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.660 
something may have heard of him from his
new<00:00:38.040> racing<00:00:38.399> wheels<00:00:39.379> which<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:41.340> very

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
new racing wheels which look very

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.920 
new racing wheels which look very
similar<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> their<00:00:42.210> Reynolds<00:00:42.480> raise<00:00:42.600> wheels

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
similar to their Reynolds raise wheels

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.389 
similar to their Reynolds raise wheels
for<00:00:43.140> good<00:00:43.530> reason<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.129> lot<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> these

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
for good reason because a lot of these

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.860 
for good reason because a lot of these
technologies<00:00:44.910> being<00:00:45.059> transplanted<00:00:45.510> into

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
technologies being transplanted into

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.020 
technologies being transplanted into
them<00:00:46.110> I'll<00:00:47.039> start<00:00:47.280> off<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.579> take<00:00:47.789> through<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
them I'll start off and take through the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.100 
them I'll start off and take through the
whole<00:00:48.149> rate<00:00:48.360> whole<00:00:48.629> range<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.960> features

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
whole rate whole range of features

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
whole rate whole range of features
between<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.680> wheel<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> quite

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
between this wheel which make a quite

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.850 
between this wheel which make a quite
special

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
special

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.920 
special
first<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.309> rims<00:00:53.629> they're<00:00:54.629> actually

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
first up the rims they're actually

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.680 
first up the rims they're actually
constructed<00:00:55.379> from<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.800> boron<00:00:56.309> carbon<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
constructed from a boron carbon so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.029 
constructed from a boron carbon so
there's<00:00:57.870> boron<00:00:58.140> added<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> carbon<00:00:58.859> which

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
there's boron added to the carbon which

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.639 
there's boron added to the carbon which
is<00:00:59.640> just<00:01:00.449> release<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> military<00:01:01.109> spec<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
is just release a military spec in the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.260 
is just release a military spec in the
US<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.489> these<00:01:02.579> wheels<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:02.910> completely

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
US and so these wheels are completely

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.939 
US and so these wheels are completely
hand-built<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.750> America<00:01:04.199> there's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> music<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
hand-built in America there's a music of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.270 
hand-built in America there's a music of
rims<00:01:05.159> end<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:06.150> being<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.659> lot<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:08.100> lighter

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
rims end up being a lot a lot lighter

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.550 
rims end up being a lot a lot lighter
and<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.420> other<00:01:09.600> boat<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> other

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and the other boat one of the other

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.899 
and the other boat one of the other
major<00:01:10.740> things<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.430> wheel<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.820> actually

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
major things in this wheel is actually

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.490 
major things in this wheel is actually
built<00:01:12.270> using<00:01:12.390> mutual<00:01:12.740> tensions<00:01:13.740> folks<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
built using mutual tensions folks so the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.690 
built using mutual tensions folks so the
benefits<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.950> obviously<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.430> spreading

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
benefits that obviously you're spreading

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.130 
benefits that obviously you're spreading
the<00:01:17.909> tension<00:01:18.270> throughout<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> wheel<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> lot

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the tension throughout the wheel a lot

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
the tension throughout the wheel a lot
more<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:20.490> means<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> rim<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> not

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
more that means that the rim is not

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
more that means that the rim is not
first<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.049> doesn't<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.409> lots<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> inner

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
first of all doesn't have lots of inner

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.210 
first of all doesn't have lots of inner
tension<00:01:23.520> within<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> wheel<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> rivets

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
tension within the wheel so the rivets

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.380 
tension within the wheel so the rivets
are<00:01:26.250> being<00:01:26.430> pulled<00:01:26.640> towards<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> sense<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.299> on

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
are being pulled towards a sense of on

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.660 
are being pulled towards a sense of on
all<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> spokes<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:29.070> also<00:01:29.220> means<00:01:29.430> when

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
all the spokes and it also means when

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.770 
all the spokes and it also means when
you're<00:01:29.790> riding<00:01:29.970> you're<00:01:30.299> spreading<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you're riding you're spreading that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.149 
you're riding you're spreading that
tension<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.470> more<00:01:31.619> around<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> wheel

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
tension out a bit more around the wheel

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
tension out a bit more around the wheel
and<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.270> means<00:01:33.450> both<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> those<00:01:34.290> things

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and so it means both of those things

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.499 
and so it means both of those things
mean<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.770> rim<00:01:35.009> care<00:01:35.250> should<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.460> made<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
mean the rim care should be made and to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.499 
mean the rim care should be made and to
not<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> put<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.560> such<00:01:37.740> high<00:01:37.920> forces

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
not have to put up with such high forces

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
not have to put up with such high forces
the<00:01:39.509> wheel<00:01:39.689> itself<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.170> actually<00:01:40.259> made<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the wheel itself is actually made and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.760 
the wheel itself is actually made and
baked<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.479> autoclave<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.500> three

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
baked in the autoclave in three

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
baked in the autoclave in three
different<00:01:43.920> parts<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:45.000> means<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
different parts and that means that you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
different parts and that means that you
don't<00:01:45.990> end<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> warping<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.369> wheel

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
don't end up with a warping of the wheel

standard<00:03:23.269> carbon<00:03:23.510> spoke<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.859> shape<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.370> them

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
standard carbon spoke the shape of them

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.410 
standard carbon spoke the shape of them
is<00:03:25.579> actually<00:03:25.730> NACA<00:03:26.380> 3:03<00:03:27.640> aerofoil<00:03:28.640> as<00:03:29.180> it's

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
is actually NACA 3:03 aerofoil as it's

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.150 
is actually NACA 3:03 aerofoil as it's
an<00:03:29.510> accredited<00:03:29.900> aerofoil<00:03:30.290> shape<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.799> several

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
an accredited aerofoil shape the several

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.190 
an accredited aerofoil shape the several
layers<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.670> move<00:03:32.239> through<00:03:32.540> if<00:03:32.750> there<00:03:32.959> is<00:03:33.049> any

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
layers to move through if there is any

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.099 
layers to move through if there is any
kind<00:03:33.410> of<00:03:33.500> Nick<00:03:33.680> or<00:03:33.859> damage<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.250> spoke<00:03:34.579> and

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
kind of Nick or damage to the spoke and

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.229 
kind of Nick or damage to the spoke and
so<00:03:36.109> if<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.590> do<00:03:36.769> start<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.130> damage<00:03:37.819> the<00:03:38.030> spoke

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
so if you do start to damage the spoke

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.789 
so if you do start to damage the spoke
it<00:03:38.389> will<00:03:38.510> actually<00:03:38.630> rather<00:03:39.319> than<00:03:39.470> running<00:03:39.620> all

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
it will actually rather than running all

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.990 
it will actually rather than running all
the<00:03:39.889> way<00:03:39.920> through<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.310> strain<00:03:40.519> of<00:03:40.549> cough<00:03:40.850> the

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
the way through the strain of cough the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.699 
the way through the strain of cough the
strength<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.359> carbon<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:42.079> will<00:03:42.200> stop<00:03:42.470> at<00:03:42.620> each

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
strength of carbon it will stop at each

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.110 
strength of carbon it will stop at each
layer<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.250> way<00:03:43.370> through<00:03:43.639> obviously<00:03:44.060> if

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
layer on the way through obviously if

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.090 
layer on the way through obviously if
it's<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> large<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.810> large<00:03:45.109> Nick<00:03:45.380> or<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:46.010> know

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
it's a large that large Nick or you know

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.530 
it's a large that large Nick or you know
a<00:03:46.130> lot<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.370> damage<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:46.760> will<00:03:46.850> break<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.299> but<00:03:47.420> it

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
a lot of damage it will break it but it

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.629 
a lot of damage it will break it but it
means<00:03:47.630> smaller<00:03:48.019> more<00:03:48.440> minor<00:03:48.650> Nick's<00:03:48.980> are<00:03:49.190> less

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
means smaller more minor Nick's are less

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:50.920 
means smaller more minor Nick's are less
likely<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:49.940> cause<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.239> catastrophic<00:03:50.569> failure

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
likely to cause a catastrophic failure

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.770 
likely to cause a catastrophic failure
of<00:03:51.079> this<00:03:51.200> phone<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:53.239> I'll<00:03:53.299> move<00:03:53.450> on<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.600> the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
of this phone so I'll move on to the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.490 
of this phone so I'll move on to the
rear<00:03:54.590> wheel<00:03:54.799> now<00:03:55.930> there's<00:03:56.930> kind<00:03:57.109> of<00:03:57.139> one<00:03:57.290> main

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
rear wheel now there's kind of one main

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.259 
rear wheel now there's kind of one main
main<00:03:58.040> difference<00:03:58.430> between<00:03:58.519> notice<00:03:59.000> for<00:03:59.150> this

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
main difference between notice for this

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.849 
main difference between notice for this
is<00:03:59.480> how<00:03:59.690> God<00:03:59.959> thinks<00:03:59.989> something<00:04:00.590> they<00:04:00.680> call

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
is how God thinks something they call

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.259 
is how God thinks something they call
the<00:04:00.889> talk<00:04:01.130> flange<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.639> the<00:04:01.730> center<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.120> hub

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
the talk flange in the center of the hub

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.509 
the talk flange in the center of the hub
and<00:04:03.430> with<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:05.060> has<00:04:05.959> four<00:04:06.350> spokes<00:04:06.680> which

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
and with that it has four spokes which

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.160 
and with that it has four spokes which
pull<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:09.549> in<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:10.670> top<00:04:10.880> direction<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.600> then

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
pull and in the top direction and then

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.870 
pull and in the top direction and then
on<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.530> external<00:04:12.859> two<00:04:13.160> flanges<00:04:13.400> that<00:04:13.639> has<00:04:13.760> the

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
radial spokes which allow the support

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.440 
radial spokes which allow the support
for<00:04:15.889> the<00:04:15.950> wheel<00:04:16.130> one<00:04:16.909> problem<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.269> that

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
for the wheel one problem is that

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.670 
for the wheel one problem is that
because<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.900> dry<00:04:18.320> sided<00:04:18.799> flanges<00:04:19.220> off<00:04:19.370> saying

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
because the dry sided flanges off saying

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.159 
because the dry sided flanges off saying
when<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.609> transfer<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.299> talk<00:04:21.690> when<00:04:22.049> you

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
when you transfer that talk when you

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.810 
when you transfer that talk when you
power<00:04:22.440> top<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.370> wheel<00:04:23.520> when<00:04:23.699> you're

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
power top of the wheel when you're

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.150 
power top of the wheel when you're
pedaling<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.990> actually<00:04:25.410> often<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.130> a

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
pedaling you actually often on a

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.770 
pedaling you actually often on a
lightweight<00:04:26.400> wheel<00:04:26.790> especially<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.570> will

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
lightweight wheel especially you will

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.830 
lightweight wheel especially you will
pull<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.229> wheel<00:04:28.440> slightly<00:04:28.949> over<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.840> because

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
pull the wheel slightly over and because

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.330 
pull the wheel slightly over and because
the<00:04:30.960> talk<00:04:31.139> is<00:04:31.259> off-center<00:04:31.560> whereas<00:04:32.009> a<00:04:32.130> talk

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
the talk is off-center whereas a talk

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.680 
the talk is off-center whereas a talk
flames<00:04:32.610> because<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.030> runs<00:04:33.180> right<00:04:33.419> down<00:04:33.479> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
flames because it runs right down the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.960 
flames because it runs right down the
center<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.110> rim<00:04:34.460> means<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.729> don't

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
center of the rim means that you don't

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.850 
center of the rim means that you don't
get<00:04:36.060> any<00:04:36.270> movement<00:04:36.509> in<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.900> wheel<00:04:37.080> when

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
get any movement in the wheel when

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.219 
get any movement in the wheel when
you're<00:04:38.039> on<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:39.270> you're<00:04:39.389> talking<00:04:39.570> wheel<00:04:39.990> and

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
you're on and you're talking wheel and

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.020 
you're on and you're talking wheel and
high-power<00:04:40.680> will<00:04:41.100> see<00:04:41.280> sprinting<00:04:41.699> that<00:04:41.850> on

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
high-power will see sprinting that on

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.450 
high-power will see sprinting that on
the<00:04:42.120> thing<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:42.830> when<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.949> add<00:04:44.100> up<00:04:44.130> all<00:04:44.310> the

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
the thing so when you add up all the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.860 
the thing so when you add up all the
features<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:44.880> this<00:04:45.060> wheel<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:45.539> I<00:04:45.570> things<00:04:45.780> like

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
features of this wheel so I things like

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.659 
features of this wheel so I things like
the<00:04:45.960> carbon<00:04:46.289> spokes<00:04:46.590> if<00:04:46.889> like<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.100> can't<00:04:47.340> spokes

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
the carbon spokes if like I can't spokes

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.180 
the carbon spokes if like I can't spokes
the<00:04:48.180> lightweight<00:04:48.479> carbon<00:04:48.900> boron<00:04:49.650> rim<00:04:49.889> and

the lightweight carbon boron rim and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.189 
the lightweight carbon boron rim and
which<00:04:50.910> obviously<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.360> made<00:04:51.570> lighter<00:04:51.780> just

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
which obviously is made lighter just

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.230 
which obviously is made lighter just
because<00:04:52.410> of<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.620> fact<00:04:52.740> has<00:04:52.949> less<00:04:53.160> tension<00:04:53.400> and
