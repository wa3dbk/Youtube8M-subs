00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.920 
you want to think about is that he might
not<00:01:21.790> always<00:01:21.970> see<00:01:22.180> you<00:01:22.270> as<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.420> human<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.750> say

you're<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.110> human<00:01:23.470> but<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.979> might<00:01:24.160> see<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.399> as

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
you're a human but you might see you as

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.139 
you're a human but you might see you as
a<00:01:24.520> dog<00:01:24.729> so<00:01:24.970> often<00:01:25.899> we<00:01:26.110> can<00:01:26.290> use<00:01:26.560> kind<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.149> sounds

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
a dog so often we can use kind of sounds

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.690 
a dog so often we can use kind of sounds
verbal<00:01:28.899> sounds<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.800> tell<00:01:29.979> him<00:01:30.070> exactly<00:01:30.190> once

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
verbal sounds to tell him exactly once

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.219 
verbal sounds to tell him exactly once
so<00:01:30.910> if<00:01:31.030> we<00:01:31.179> wanted<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.509> actually<00:01:31.660> do<00:01:32.020> some<00:01:32.140> he's

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
so if we wanted to actually do some he's

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.460 
so if we wanted to actually do some he's
wiggling<00:01:32.500> him<00:01:32.709> I<00:01:32.800> may<00:01:32.920> go<00:01:33.069> haha<00:01:33.929> and<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.350> other

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
wiggling him I may go haha and the other

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.199 
wiggling him I may go haha and the other
thing<00:01:35.709> is<00:01:35.830> that<00:01:36.009> we<00:01:36.130> might<00:01:36.250> want<00:01:36.429> to<00:01:36.550> do<00:01:36.759> for
