00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
Qing some commands right into a device

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.730 
Qing some commands right into a device
you<00:01:24.570> want<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:24.930> ahead<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.320> type<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.650> your

password which is alpine ALP I n E and
then<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.390> some<00:01:30.869> command<00:01:31.409> codes<00:01:31.680> in

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
then I will have some command codes in

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
then I will have some command codes in
the<00:01:32.310> description<00:01:32.820> below<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> can

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the description below that you can

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.960 
the description below that you can
easily<00:01:33.659> copy<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.439> paste<00:01:34.680> these<00:01:35.159> codes<00:01:35.520> right

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
easily copy and paste these codes right

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.289 
easily copy and paste these codes right
into<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> terminal<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> first<00:01:38.400> year<00:01:38.759> just

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
into the terminal so the first year just

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.969 
into the terminal so the first year just
go<00:01:39.479> ahead<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.689> paste<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> will<00:01:40.680> take<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
go ahead and paste it in it will take a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.359 
go ahead and paste it in it will take a
few<00:01:41.100> seconds<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.930> then<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.500> code<00:01:43.829> will

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
few seconds and then the code will

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
few seconds and then the code will
finish<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.960> second<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:48.320> will<00:01:49.320> be

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
finish up here the second one will be

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.060 
finish up here the second one will be
updating<00:01:50.850> some<00:01:51.090> packages<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.140> via<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
updating some packages here via the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130 
updating some packages here via the
bigboss<00:01:53.670> repo<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.390> may<00:01:54.600> take<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> little

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bigboss repo so this may take a little

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.499 
bigboss repo so this may take a little
while<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.399> sped<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.240> process

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
while so I have sped it up the process

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.590 
while so I have sped it up the process
quite<00:01:58.020> considerably<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.880> will<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.210> having

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
quite considerably but it will be having

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.889 
quite considerably but it will be having
to<00:02:00.750> access<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.530> big<00:02:01.920> boss<00:02:02.100> directory<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to access the big boss directory to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.660 
to access the big boss directory to
download<00:02:04.290> some<00:02:04.500> additional<00:02:04.890> packages<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
download some additional packages that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.150 
download some additional packages that
aren't<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.210> there<00:02:06.329> now<00:02:06.840> once<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.890> has

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
aren't really there now once that has

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420 
aren't really there now once that has
finish<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.440> go<00:02:10.590> ahead<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.830> copy<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
finish up you can go ahead and copy and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.880 
finish up you can go ahead and copy and
paste<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> mobile<00:02:12.540> substrate

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
should see the 3d mapping imaging right

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.350 
should see the 3d mapping imaging right
at<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.410> bottom<00:03:10.739> there<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.190> if<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.820> go<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.090> a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
at the bottom there and if you go to a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.190 
at the bottom there and if you go to a
3d<00:03:13.019> mapping<00:03:13.320> city<00:03:14.070> such<00:03:14.400> as<00:03:14.430> Chicago<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:16.080> will

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
3d mapping city such as Chicago you will

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.170 
3d mapping city such as Chicago you will
now<00:03:16.350> see<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.739> we<00:03:16.830> do<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.100> 3d<00:03:17.580> mapping<00:03:17.820> on

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
now see that we do have 3d mapping on

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.340 
now see that we do have 3d mapping on
our<00:03:18.329> iphone<00:03:18.630> four<00:03:19.019> or<00:03:19.260> 3gs<00:03:19.860> or<00:03:20.400> ipod<00:03:21.180> touch<00:03:21.450> 4th

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.319 
our iphone four or 3gs or ipod touch 4th
generation<00:03:22.709> now<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:23.820> might<00:03:23.970> be<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> little

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
generation now this might be a little

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.420 
generation now this might be a little
laggy<00:03:24.600> at<00:03:24.810> first<00:03:25.110> but<00:03:25.709> once<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:26.160> played

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
laggy at first but once you have played

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.190 
laggy at first but once you have played
around<00:03:26.640> with<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.329> will<00:03:27.510> become<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> little

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
around with it it will become a little

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.380 
around with it it will become a little
bit<00:03:28.230> faster<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:28.860> time<00:03:29.070> goes<00:03:29.310> on<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:30.239> if<00:03:30.299> you

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
bit faster as time goes on so if you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.910 
bit faster as time goes on so if you
guys<00:03:30.540> do<00:03:30.780> like<00:03:30.930> these<00:03:31.110> videos<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.769> don't
