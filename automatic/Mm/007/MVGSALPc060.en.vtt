00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.760
 hi girls who are as they are 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 and today this time I want to show you a video of a child is 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.979
 in this case I applied to the colors 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.509
 I eat cake 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.000
 what was this 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 net left porsche and call 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.759
 already peñíscola and 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.069
 and be in the forum that is black 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.399
 catán 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.589
 Apply the right half pani coli 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.470
 entel in me very well 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.770
 to the right and in the other half the black 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.490
 not the chelito 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.850
 but if you want to have a more right-wing line 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.629
 and I suggest you have to go 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.170
 to 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.320
 villar lives with the tape 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.050
 putting the tape you put the other color first remove is the ribbon 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.090
 and now if you dedicate yourself to putting 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 the other color 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.050
 So he says that I already made three models 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.310
 cot- three wedges to show them 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.700
 i for this we are going to use two basic colors in this case these two that yusti 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.050
 liste 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.360
 I'm going to use 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.860
 in golden color 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.380
 that in this case I think that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.640
 that the Asians use a lot of gold 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.860
 i 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.090
 half bribe 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090
 which is the base that we put to seal the design 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.480
 here I have my little plate now the number n24 here we are going to use 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 the design of the medium that is the Japanese letter 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.920
 very much nothing or Korean the truth I could not tell you what language is 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
 to start you can apply 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.440
 The Golden 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.440
 in the design of the medium 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.000
 I'll take 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 our scraper 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.460
 or written 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.330
 in English 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.979
 I'm going to take the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.720
 Amen 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.780
 the small print 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 and I'll try what's left is the pure corner 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.119
 the anita actor 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.499
 why exist this porsche design 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:18.169
 that the medium has the warble 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.169
 and that hairline we want that we have left 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:23.010
 in the line 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.010
 of the color black and orange 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:31.049
 maybe on camera you can not appreciate it but 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.049
 I'm going to show the pictures so you can get an idea of ​​what I'm talking about 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.599
 If you do not have it right, do not worry after an attempt 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.059
 I must clarify much better 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.059
 I'm going to clean my plate 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.779
 good year I'll clean a print 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.799
 and again 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.799
 I'm going to aplicate 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.699
 The Golden 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.949
 while paying 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:15.829
 and the pattern as I tell you is that it was limited 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.709
 the most 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 How can the line 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.670
 of the design you stay in the middle 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.879
 of the colors of the uimp 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.289
 since we have that 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.489
 let's move on to the next step 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.919
 As you know, these cecam excesses are very fast 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.919
 so maybe now it's dry 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.219
 and what I'm going to do 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.369
 is take 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.969
 communal chovet enamel that said more nor now that no 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:05.299
 which are the enamels that have the morocha also final 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.979
 well delicate 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.089
 and with this I'm going to complain common in french mannequins 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.509
 the flea of ​​what covers touriñán 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.370
 applies 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.490
 this 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.370
 that is still 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.370
 the enamel with golden glitters 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.360
 and this is going to give 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 will highlight the design that we put 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:44.270
 If you do not have Glitter, do not worry, you can use Eliminate 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.230
 it can be a bad state company 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.360
 golden although in this case I do not have why he decided to apply this aside that 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.909
 I did not want it to take away so much of the design view 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.069
 and it is very easy to use these pens 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.080
 or are you lasted eight years 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.580
 clear in 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.919
 like to do this kind of sources 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.090
 because that's how you make me do lines and if you're going to grab me in curve 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.169
 already has its substitutes 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.279
 Naples chemistry as French already has it complicated 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.539
 now I will go to take michoacán cowen 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.849
 and I will apply neither pa min 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.029
 in the letter 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.669
 to seal the design 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.490
 remember do not peace about the design of twice by where same 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.069
 because that can do 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.069
 that the design is charged 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.879
 that's how I'm already putting all 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.839
 he had a layer of it like nothing 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:17.520
 you do not have your enamel either 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.520
 I recommend that this one arconada because ap 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.690
 because I have tried different enamels of different brands 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.650
 and most of them if not all 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.270
 I'm glad 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.960
 run the design 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.529
 i cease now it does not look pretty 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.529
 but if you have found a transparent enamel 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:43.729
 that you do not do the state because later use it you do not have to use a condom 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.340
 in this case it is textile final result 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.270
 I'm going to put pictures so you can see it 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.310
 If you have any questions, do not hesitate to let me know 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.869
 and I hope to see you soon 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:01.449
 Take care 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:03.180
 and until the next lapan
