00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.380 
with you whenever you're dogging or
whatever<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.299> pretty<00:01:33.299> much

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
whatever so that's that and pretty much

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.510 
whatever so that's that and pretty much
that's<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.530> has<00:01:34.740> got<00:01:34.920> some<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.340> soft

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that's it this has got some really soft

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.420 
that's it this has got some really soft
material<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.840> actually<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> never<00:01:38.040> felt<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
material it's actually a never felt a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.039 
material it's actually a never felt a
case<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.909> before<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.689> soft

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
case like this before it's really soft

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.410 
case like this before it's really soft
and<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.950> pretty<00:01:41.189> compact<00:01:41.579> seen<00:01:41.909> considering

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and it's pretty compact seen considering

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.630 
and it's pretty compact seen considering
the<00:01:42.509> size<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.649> that's<00:01:43.890> pretty<00:01:44.159> cool

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the size so that's pretty cool

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.310 
the size so that's pretty cool
so<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.360> put<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.810> side<00:01:45.899> as

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so I'm going to put that to the side as

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.200 
so I'm going to put that to the side as
well<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:48.079> let's<00:01:49.079> get<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> actual<00:01:50.700> earbuds

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
not sure what this is I guess of

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.970 
not sure what this is I guess of
half-circle<00:02:47.690> looks<00:02:47.960> like<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.080> phone<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.950> I

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
half-circle looks like a phone so I

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.160 
half-circle looks like a phone so I
guess<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.460> can<00:02:49.580> maybe<00:02:49.730> turn<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.050> off

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
guess you can maybe turn it on and off

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.920 
guess you can maybe turn it on and off
through<00:02:51.590> here<00:02:51.860> as<00:02:52.010> well<00:02:52.250> as<00:02:52.520> hang<00:02:52.820> up<00:02:53.000> calls<00:02:53.330> or

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
through here as well as hang up calls or

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.170 
through here as well as hang up calls or
something<00:02:54.740> I'm<00:02:55.220> not<00:02:55.400> sure<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:55.850> I'll<00:02:56.000> figure

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
something I'm not sure but I'll figure

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.870 
something I'm not sure but I'll figure
it<00:02:56.300> out<00:02:56.480> but<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.320> how<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.620> goes<00:02:57.800> as<00:02:58.730> you

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
it out but this is how it goes as you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.820 
it out but this is how it goes as you
can<00:02:59.000> see<00:02:59.210> here<00:02:59.420> these<00:02:59.540> are<00:02:59.690> pretty<00:02:59.990> adjustable

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
can see here these are pretty adjustable

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.850 
can see here these are pretty adjustable
so<00:03:01.820> that's<00:03:01.970> really<00:03:02.210> cool<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.750> can<00:03:02.870> get<00:03:02.990> into

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
so that's really cool so it can get into

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.470 
so that's really cool so it can get into
your<00:03:03.950> ear<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.160> fit<00:03:04.490> properly
