00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.780
 in fact I do not know what to say to you three 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.879
 minutes before the biggest fight of 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.990
 our professional lives and all summarizes 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.130
 until today 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.890
 either we heal hears click or 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.670
 we collapse game after game centimeter 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.770
 per centimeter 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.400
 until we are finished by being in 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.150
 glass here gentlemen believe me and we 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.359
 can stay there 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.340
 this fact put back a wrecked where we 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.699
 can fight to go back to the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.580
 light 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:39.059
 we can climb gold from hell a 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.460
 centimeter at a time but that I can not 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.550
 not do it for you I'm too 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.739
 old I look at you I see these young people 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 faces and I think I'll tell you 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.460
 I made all the wrong choices that a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.070
 middle-aged man can do 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.510
 ok I slammed all my 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.629
 dough believe it or not I scared 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.190
 all who have never loved but these 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.839
 time will 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.119
 I can not even stand to see my 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.860
 face in the mirror are you going when 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.580
 you're getting older in life 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.070
 things are taken away I'm part 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.810
 of life but that we can not 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.259
 understand that once we start to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.540
 lose them 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.200
 we discover that life is played out 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.149
 a few centimeters like football 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.970
 because in these two games the life where 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.630
 football the margin of error here 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.119
 scaled down 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.640
 I mean you're a half step into 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.800
 late or early and you do not mark 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.539
 not you're a half-second too 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.700
 slow or too fast and missed you 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.970
 few centimeters to win 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.619
 they are everywhere around us 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.360
 of his name every game opportunity to 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:52.630
 every minute every second in 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.090
 this team we are fighting for this cm in 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.190
 this team we get the tripe and where 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.820
 the spells to those around us 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.890
 for this cm 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.830
 hoffa clean and tip of lauzon for his cm 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.319
 because we only do when we add 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.780
 everything and cm that's what will make this 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:19.130
 fucking difference between winning and 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:21.530
 lose live and die I'll tell you 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.580
 in every fight it's the guy who's 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.270
 ready to die 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.490
 who will win cm and I know that this 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.860
 happens again to be lived it's because 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.209
 that I always want to fight 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.290
 die for this cm because that's it 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.360
 summed up at his town hall 15 cm which are in front 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.030
 in the face now I can not 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.680
 force to do it look at the case that 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.010
 is next to you looking in the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.320
 eyes 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.019
 I think you'll see a case 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.600
 who goes one centimeter forward with you 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.940
 and you will see a case that is ready to 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.190
 to sacrifice for his team 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.590
 because it bleeds only when the moment 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.800
 will come you will do the same thing for 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.990
 it's a men's team 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.170
 either we heal today as 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:17.100
 that team will either we all have as 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:20.220
 that individual half polemic born gaza 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.310
 and now what are you going 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.310
 make
