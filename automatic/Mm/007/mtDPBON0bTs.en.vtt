hey<00:00:01.140> Minecrafters<00:00:01.800> so<00:00:02.520> when<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> trip<00:00:03.270> wires

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hey Minecrafters so when a trip wires

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.249 
hey Minecrafters so when a trip wires
were<00:00:03.840> added<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:05.299> together<00:00:06.299> with<00:00:06.569> many<00:00:07.049> other

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
were added I together with many other

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.750 
were added I together with many other
people<00:00:07.560> have<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.859> idea<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.490> could<00:00:08.700> use

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
people have the idea that you could use

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120 
people have the idea that you could use
them<00:00:09.179> for<00:00:09.389> simple<00:00:09.809> minecart<00:00:10.380> passenger

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
them for simple minecart passenger

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.350 
them for simple minecart passenger
detection<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:13.410> worked<00:00:14.040> great<00:00:14.360> unfortunately

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
detection and worked great unfortunately

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.670 
detection and worked great unfortunately
there<00:00:15.839> were<00:00:15.990> bit<00:00:16.230> slow<00:00:18.140> which<00:00:19.140> meant<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.560> had

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
there were bit slow which meant you had

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.820 
there were bit slow which meant you had
to<00:00:19.740> distance<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.869> crack<00:00:21.869> Junction<00:00:22.320> away<00:00:22.560> from

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
to distance the crack Junction away from

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.429 
to distance the crack Junction away from
the<00:00:22.949> trip<00:00:23.189> wire<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:24.890> draw<00:00:25.890> longer<00:00:26.490> than

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
the trip wire and draw longer than

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.640 
the trip wire and draw longer than
necessary<00:00:28.439> wires<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.580> longer<00:00:30.330> than<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:31.470> would

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
necessary wires or longer than you would

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.889 
necessary wires or longer than you would
think<00:00:31.679> necessary<00:00:32.430> due<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> leg<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
think necessary due to the leg of the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.740 
think necessary due to the leg of the
trip<00:00:34.170> flyer<00:00:38.090> because<00:00:39.090> otherwise<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.629> would

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
trip flyer because otherwise you would

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.950 
trip flyer because otherwise you would
soon<00:00:40.200> by<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.559> your<00:00:40.710> mind<00:00:40.860> court<00:00:41.160> without

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
soon by in your mind court without

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.650 
soon by in your mind court without
before<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> crackle<00:00:43.440> change<00:00:44.660> fortunately

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
before the crackle change fortunately

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
before the crackle change fortunately
low<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> new<00:00:46.739> snapshot<00:00:47.129> they<00:00:47.670> seem<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
low in the new snapshot they seem to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.740 
low in the new snapshot they seem to
have<00:00:48.230> improved<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> response

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
have improved the response

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.119 
have improved the response
responsiveness<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> trip<00:00:52.320> wires<00:00:52.590> so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
responsiveness of the trip wires so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.130 
responsiveness of the trip wires so
let's<00:00:53.460> skip<00:00:54.030> over<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> new<00:00:54.899> version<00:00:55.940> and

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
let's skip over to the new version and

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.240 
let's skip over to the new version and
here<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.800> latest<00:00:59.430> snapshot<00:01:01.250> what

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
here we are in the latest snapshot what

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.350 
here we are in the latest snapshot what
is<00:01:02.399> week<00:01:02.820> 24<00:01:03.780> yeah<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.000> i

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
is week 24 yeah and as you can see i

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.340 
is week 24 yeah and as you can see i
have<00:01:07.049> compacted<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.979> quite<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> bit<00:01:09.350> because

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
have compacted this quite a bit because

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.760 
have compacted this quite a bit because
the<00:01:10.799> trip<00:01:11.040> wires<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.490> much<00:01:11.760> faster<00:01:12.350> let's<00:01:13.350> try

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the trip wires are much faster let's try

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
the trip wires are much faster let's try
it<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:19.430> empty<00:01:20.430> carts<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:20.909> go<00:01:21.060> straight

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
it out empty carts will go straight

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.660 
it out empty carts will go straight
ahead<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:24.110> if<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:28.189> go<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
ahead and if we get in we go to the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.950 
ahead and if we get in we go to the
right<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> yeah<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:33.180> will<00:01:33.390> help<00:01:33.570> making

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
right so yeah that that will help making

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.600 
right so yeah that that will help making
these<00:01:34.170> systems<00:01:34.650> even<00:01:34.829> more<00:01:35.040> compact<00:01:35.460> than

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
these systems even more compact than

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.530 
these systems even more compact than
before<00:01:36.619> passenger<00:01:37.619> detection<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.340> indeed<00:01:38.610> mob

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
before passenger detection or indeed mob

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.300 
before passenger detection or indeed mob
or<00:01:39.979> entity<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.159> Minecraft<00:01:41.729> detection<00:01:43.310> never

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
or entity in Minecraft detection never

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.230 
or entity in Minecraft detection never
been<00:01:44.520> simpler<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.520> wiring<00:01:47.729> area

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
been simpler this is all the wiring area

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.630 
been simpler this is all the wiring area
is<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.740> straight<00:01:50.009> wire<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
is this just a straight wire to the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.929 
is this just a straight wire to the
block<00:01:51.110> under<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.380> junction<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:53.850> are

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
block under the junction so they are

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.459 
block under the junction so they are
very<00:01:53.970> simple<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:56.329> that's<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.170> i<00:01:58.200> want

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
very simple and that's that's all i want

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.560 
very simple and that's that's all i want
to<00:01:58.500> show<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.219> thanks<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.700> watching<00:02:00.060> if
