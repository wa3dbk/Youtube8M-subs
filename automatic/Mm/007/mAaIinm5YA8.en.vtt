 I am here in the speaker this already 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.690
 explain beans according this week 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.450
 has achieved has brought the fragments 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.640
 radiant and radiant energy to 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.989
 to be able to combine the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.519

 of fragments and I'm going to do some 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.860
 few speck of light 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.810
 this I already tell you that as I 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.690
 you ask so many about motorcycles 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.810
 light on the strange coins of 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.820
 Energy 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.920
 the strange coin I already met with the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.049
 engrams getting very many 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.390
 engramdo playing a lot because that's not 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.030
 has another round of leaves and in the three 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.560
 weekly of the three characters and 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.880
 the motes of light is different because 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.270
 you are seeing how I am doing 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.130
 agreement 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.979
 here you see that if it changes and here so 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.649
 that you get radiant energy what 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.479
 which is with fragments that does not deserve 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.329
 worth it according to what is worth 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.340
 more is this would be the reverse change to 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.899
 radiant energy per fragment and the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.759
 fragments change it by killing light 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.100
 this not of the whole week of agreement 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.929
 this week towards the fragment there is another 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.350
 week that is with energy that those who 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.000
 we get in the root of art on and nothing 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.030

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.860
 what I want you to see how I get 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.930
 so many light specks according to how 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.910
 I get and this is because I have a 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.799
 reserve fragments and energy 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.120
 radiant that the great deal had 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:24.569
 between the three people in more than a thousand 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.739
 decades and that therefore much forgiveness 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.959
 now go see that I have 300 poems of 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.249
 thousand three hundred and peak assemble according 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.680
 to the fragments you are seeing what 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:36.389
 I have now I 'm going to do magic again and 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.489
 I'm going to bring back some others 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.680
 of fragments I keep it for you to see 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.069
 how much can you get from specks 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.049
 of light 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.609
 the one that does not have all the exotic things 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.739
 or the one who has problems is going to buy them 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:50.400
 in grass he understands me because this is a 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.870
 point for the guitar this problem here 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.359
 I'm going to do a little bit of movie magic 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.760
 you are seeing and 374 drops of luque no 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.000
 few fragments there and 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.500
 energy compliment magics of agreement and now 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.079
 go see what it is or what again with 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.639
 the app brings me a little bit with the 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.699
 fragment a little bit more energy and 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.280
 Now I would have 309 300 four 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.799
 fragments 200 and peak of energy and the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.230
 growing 74 more light in case I want 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.389
 keep changing in agreement here you are 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.790

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.590
 changing and I keep changing I say 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.959
 made for those who have a reservation 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.419
 energy or radiant fragments of 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.829
 agreement of the blue wright and nothing gentlemen 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.990
 I hope you have liked this explanation 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.850

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:38.600
 and as I always tell you, I hope there 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.600
