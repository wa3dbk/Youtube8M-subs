 usb 2.0 or pnbl are 800 thousand 200 thousand 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.949
 600 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.969
 No, I'm not thinking about how much more 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 hot best 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 not least the most sensitive team 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.390
 Mouse 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.780
 I can not even explain why 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.470
 less to have better so that's the way I go 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.150
 take in the capital for you how it is 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.939
 So full, it 's brand new there. 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.780
 around 90 reais 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.780
 so we'll see you 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.820
 The people here die, right? 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.120
 he is very big 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.370
 comparing has a queue this one is already 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.690
 a large egg only if compared to 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.810
 this from here 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.110
 look at the much larger size difference 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.210
 that this is another thing I think 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.590
 cool so he allowed this button 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.490
 mandou determines that it is an advance 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.619
 he also has this button here that is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.190
 called top button because while the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.729
 pipe 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.960
 we stay in it and still 3 click is mine 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.600
 I think we do not rush. 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.700
 also understood that this button novacki 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.050
 that goes to the enactment of the web the internet 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.959
 there 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.740
 It's another cool thing that we do. 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.670
 here o 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.980
 are the ones that do not remember the name 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.230
 What I want here when we put the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.020
 mouse and turns on the computer 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.980
 he is being then has purple red and 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.470
 blue to indicate how much detail is 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.260
 How much of de ipi? 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.810
 so I 'm going to call him to him 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.850
 To see how it is you 're cool, it's not 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.440
 his car is also very good has a meter 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.209
 and Midle 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.730
 he is taken to those who do not know that he came 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:50.610
 free in londrina and turn of the wire to 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.130
 leaving in the bc tends to be more difficult 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.900
 it was always to pull him not to die 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.940
 So I'll call and now I can give you a 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.830
 look how ana is advisable 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.830
 to connect a 2.0 ace 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.530
 yes he was on the rope now i go 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.620
 To face this button you will not see 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.150
 will change time changed that here was 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.290
 to be rock is appearing more in the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.110
 hour 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.370
 now changed in favor is that it stays like this 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.800
 it's the time 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.310
 I will not be showing only the mouse and 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.950
 such 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.360
 so I'll show the energy still took 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.160
 a new message on the continent and you 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.900
 will see the level of sensitivity as 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.040
 deny that sign if I'm going to play with 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.340
 this new document 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.890
 This little one I use I prefer 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.870
 let think it will then play you 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.540
 they also think that with the difference that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.640
 mouse game and rosinha today in how to act 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.340
 so but today, how do you guys then? 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.440
 now let's test the biggest game first 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.220
 No, we'll test that our link later. 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.090
 the following is said to be sensitive to 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.310
 500 ne 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.830
 I'm going to go down to 300, it's good to 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.500
 me is each one depends on each one of the 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.500
 Your sensitivity to me ended in 300 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.890
 sorry if you have a little legg there 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.890
 it is 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.819
 so you 're a customer and the little bit to do 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.219
 that animation in shot kind and swap 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.949
 should be back is better if you try to do 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.849
 with this evil zica the brand new 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.849
 it's very bad to do 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.720
 Only you think I'm not a noob I 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.550
 I put level 6 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.550
 It's normal trouble. 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.480
 the guys already tested here with 11 game and 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.350
 Now what I said I'm going to test with 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.350
 This our neighbor, right? 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.890
 is the next because that is not good already 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.600
 that this type of business because the 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.740
 The next time he walked in here, I 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.630
 I have to do maybe this movement. 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.580
 When you change like that, it 's because of 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.470
 lift the mouse back because place 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.940
 so it's very bad and the sensitivity 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.050
 continue right there รณ 300 has not changed 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.230
 I have to do what you're doing. 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.620
 that with the mouse until the shooting and return is 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.160
 bad course it helps a lot this year 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.160
 us gamers 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.940
 Not even the door thinking ah but how is it? 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.069
 that the small mold was better than the 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.430
 gamer 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:33.770
 each one has its taste I prefer the gamer 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.990
 It is why it is much better for sure is 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.139
 You better buy these they 'll notice the 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:42.169
 difference is not certainly not the 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.419
 same thing as these mice because the 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:48.940
 following but was not made to play is 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.940
 just do the basics and look there 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.300
 That's why I advised you missing that game. 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.020
 and likes to play a shooting game there is 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.259
 good buy new games that neither was 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:03.139
 forgetting the gamer mouse and moving me 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.310
 their useful lives are 3 million 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.550
 clicks 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.259
 so if you think it's little and little 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.830
 public and he is very mistaken that 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:11.830
 enough 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.650
 wait a second 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.240
 subscribe to the channel and gateway page on 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.280
 Facebook 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.870
 This, I said something wrong, I 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.930
 I forgot to say something 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.220
 leave in the comments there that I 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:35.030
 I'll put it in the comments there and you 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:39.580
 put the staff the staff will know of 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.580
 guys until next time and thanks
