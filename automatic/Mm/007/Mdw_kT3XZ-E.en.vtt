00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.470

 I look like there by them often 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.090
 shops and somehow now could not resist 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.340
 and 5 hand completed the foray and want you 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.020

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.400
 watching 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.430
 so want to show you the first thing to me 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.740
 really enjoyed this body scrub and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.669
 wakame series 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.820
 tangerine jam is a sugar scrub for me 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.540
 liked to imitate its composition 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 active ingredients here are essential oil 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.219
 tangerine dried orange peel juice 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.530
 orange and apple carrots and lemons 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:54.300
 the scent is awesome of course but he doesn't 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.570
 so you know bright chemical so tasty 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
 it looks like this consistency 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.719
 consistency will not tell it to be 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.899
 thick but not very liquid in general so 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.840
 convenient to take him a scrub very good 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.100
 he's pretty tough good 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.990
 scrubs skin accordingly makes it 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.189
 Basically, this s80 70 grams does 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.240
 skin more so smooth and elastic 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.700
 even in general scrub me very 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.450
 of course I liked first of all 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.610
 over flavor due to these active 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.650
 components in general, it is useful and myself 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.850
 scrub is very very very wonderful 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.170
 I am sure that the future to buy it and for 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.490
 faces I bought berry peeling so a series of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 we are here oring here we are 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.020
 active ingredients fruit acids 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.640
 raspberry juice extract of siberian berries berries 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.259
 her snow and cranberry wild rose hips in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.399
 general scrap and not only 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.340
 This peeling is more accurate and cleansing 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.640
 nourishes the skin 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.670
 as stated by the manufacturer as helpful 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.810
 saturates the skin with moisture 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.060
 tones have a wholesome 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.730
 effects on collagen synthesis and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.459
 elastin 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.980
 Now here I'll blow you pokozhu 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:23.110
 I will show this peeling 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.940
 the particles I will not call them very small 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.040
 but it cleans the skin very well 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.579
 there is a slight tingling visible 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.769
 apparently because of these fruit acids skin 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.530
 insanely insanely smooth and you know 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.220
 so she cleaned here even these 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.819
 pores 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.390
 they somehow smoothed the scrub to me very 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.720
 liked the flavor not strongly pronounced i 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.739
 I will not say that he is very pleasant and he does not 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.370
 sweet grassy so generally i 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.180
 noticed that Siberian health is all 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.400
 their cosmetics smell here 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.620
 They basically the grassy smell 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.430
 saw due to the fact that basically 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.769
 there are such villages here 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.150
 Siberian herbs and berries because of this 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:19.200
 compiling I also really like that 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.090
 can't say about hand cream 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 nourishing so the sun gleams everything 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:30.790
 such a package 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.519
 we are already in her bed 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.639
 I generally sign it all written below 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.769
 that this cream is a nourishing cream pretty 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.769
 still creepy light texture 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.090
 little white 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.730
 it absorbs very, very quickly into the skin 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.130
 no stickiness no 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.990
 some kind of greasy film 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.830
 norms for my skin 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.200
 this moisture is not enough for me 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.890
 my skin will not carry it to the nutrient 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.440
 cream 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.410
 that is, not moistening is enough for me 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.690
 no power it can use well i 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.900
 I use it in the daytime then yes 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.450
 he quickly absorbed light moistening to her 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.910
 for skin comfortable all at night he told me 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.960
 not suitable not enough in general 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.200
 sweet cream good I think he 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.590
 suitable for such skin can young 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:34.570
 which has no problem yet 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:39.610
 dryness further what I'll show you bought 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.560

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.510

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.890

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.419

 betaine essential oils of fir and eucalyptus 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.150
 apparently that's the presence of their qalib then 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.290
 it cools the skin so nicely 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.680
 toning due to this of course 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.140

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.360
 i am not too nice scent not mix 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.030
 Now these all herbs well, that the general is not 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.140
 critical by itself who is not very good 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.570
 tones the skin comfortable to use 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.070
 there is even some sort of purification effect 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.680
 general after using it 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.470

 it's for pregnant women 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:33.539
