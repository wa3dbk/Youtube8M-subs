00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
here's something like spice so what
we're<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.329> we're<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> take

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.479 
we're going to do is we're going to take
a<00:00:57.780> toothpick<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.969> we're<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:01.460> poke<00:01:02.460> some

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
a toothpick and we're going to poke some

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.609 
a toothpick and we're going to poke some
holes<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> ice<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> we're<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> jars

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
holes in the ice and we're going to jars

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
holes in the ice and we're going to jars
that<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.489> jars<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.939> been<00:01:06.150> previously

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that the jars have been previously

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.420 
that the jars have been previously
sterilized<00:01:07.520> now<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> hole<00:01:08.850> needs<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.600> in

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
sterilized now the hole needs to go in

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
sterilized now the hole needs to go in
one<00:01:11.430> side<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.110> other<00:01:13.140> side<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
one side and out the other side and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.780 
one side and out the other side and
that's<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.790> allow<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.890> flavour<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.220> actually

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
that's to allow the flavour to actually

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.749 
that's to allow the flavour to actually
absorb<00:01:18.450> through<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> eggs<00:01:19.049> while<00:01:19.380> they're

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
absorb through the eggs while they're

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.010 
absorb through the eggs while they're
sitting<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.119> 21<00:01:21.390> days<00:01:23.689> now<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
sitting for the 21 days now there is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.320 
sitting for the 21 days now there is
also<00:01:25.229> another<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.790> make<00:01:27.150> them

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
also another way to do it that make them

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.390 
also another way to do it that make them
actually<00:01:27.780> last<00:01:28.080> longer<00:01:28.259> than<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> 21<00:01:29.189> days

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
actually last longer than the 21 days

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.780 
actually last longer than the 21 days
but<00:01:30.180> mine<00:01:30.659> never<00:01:30.810> lasts<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.380> long<00:01:31.579> and<00:01:32.579> then

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
but mine never lasts that long and then

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.179 
but mine never lasts that long and then
around<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.360> seem<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.189> really<00:01:35.189> enjoy<00:01:35.340> the
