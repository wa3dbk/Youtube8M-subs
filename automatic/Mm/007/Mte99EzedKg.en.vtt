no gravity suit for you
does<00:00:45.640> I<00:00:45.940> don't<00:00:46.120> think<00:00:46.149> I'm<00:00:46.420> actually<00:00:46.780> think

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
does I don't think I'm actually think

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.069 
does I don't think I'm actually think
they're<00:00:47.230> grabbing<00:00:47.410> super<00:00:47.890> busy<00:00:48.309> managing

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
they're grabbing super busy managing

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.869 
they're grabbing super busy managing
like<00:00:50.079> it<00:00:50.230> does<00:00:50.440> in<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> other<00:00:51.010> means<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.460> just

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
like it does in the other means and just

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.330 
like it does in the other means and just
says<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.379> can<00:00:53.559> put<00:00:53.710> through<00:00:53.949> liquids<00:00:54.339> on<00:00:54.460> top

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
says you can put through liquids on top

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.630 
says you can put through liquids on top
yeah<00:00:57.330> and<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.810> also<00:00:57.990> clears<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.980> visor<00:00:59.220> so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
it doesn't appear blurry as hell when

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
it doesn't appear blurry as hell when
you<00:01:02.510> pass<00:01:03.510> through<00:01:03.989> water<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.170> remember

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you pass through water and I remember

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.310 
you pass through water and I remember
the<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:07.410> time<00:01:07.580> I<00:01:08.580> didn't<00:01:09.300> know<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the one time I didn't know to get the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.230 
the one time I didn't know to get the
gravity<00:01:10.680> suit<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.160> I<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:11.700> tried<00:01:12.060> going

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
gravity suit and I actually tried going

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.540 
gravity suit and I actually tried going
through<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> friggin<00:01:12.930> work<00:01:13.080> beyond<00:01:13.550> without

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
through the friggin work beyond without

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.570 
through the friggin work beyond without
the<00:01:14.790> gravity<00:01:15.180> suit<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.680> actually<00:01:16.830> says<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the gravity suit and it actually says I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.430 
the gravity suit and it actually says I
did<00:01:17.760> that<00:01:17.940> too<00:01:18.410> it<00:01:19.410> actually<00:01:19.619> tells<00:01:20.160> you<00:01:21.440> your

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
did that too it actually tells you your

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.660 
did that too it actually tells you your
emotions<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.220> comfort<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.790> something

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.600 

oh<00:01:28.729> yeah<00:01:29.360> Metroid's

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
oh yeah Metroid's

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.880 
oh yeah Metroid's
I<00:01:31.670> think<00:01:32.390> that's<00:01:32.810> right<00:01:33.080> killed<00:01:33.590> last<00:01:33.920> pirate

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.250 

yeah<00:01:37.890> probably<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:39.870> that<00:01:39.990> means<00:01:40.080> the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
yeah probably but then that means the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.860 
yeah probably but then that means the
metroids<00:01:40.620> down<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.600> there's<00:01:42.600> another<00:01:42.750> one

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
metroids down there there's another one

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.680 
metroids down there there's another one
up<00:01:43.110> here

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
up here

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.170 
up here
and<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.770> actually<00:01:45.920> think<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.400> that<00:01:46.730> metroid

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
and I actually think that that metroid

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.180 
and I actually think that that metroid
down<00:01:47.510> there<00:01:47.720> is<00:01:47.810> gonna<00:01:47.990> come<00:01:48.380> up<00:01:48.530> for<00:01:48.770> me<00:01:48.920> soon

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
down there is gonna come up for me soon

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.320 
down there is gonna come up for me soon

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
enough well if you would get through the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.140 
enough well if you would get through the
room<00:01:53.570> yeah
