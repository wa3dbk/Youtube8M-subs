00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
tiling tube and all I did was take a

tiling tube and all I did was take a
knife<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.350> cut<00:01:14.439> up<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.250> side<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.530> that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
knife and cut up the side of it so that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.350 
knife and cut up the side of it so that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
you can slip it onto the tree the idea

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.819 
you can slip it onto the tree the idea
is<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:24.159> you<00:01:24.219> have<00:01:24.719> it<00:01:25.719> used<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.110> be<00:01:26.229> these<00:01:26.439> just

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
is if you have it used to be these just

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.160 
is if you have it used to be these just
put<00:01:26.979> one<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.159> these<00:01:27.310> wraps<00:01:27.610> on<00:01:27.909> but<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.960> deer

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
put one of these wraps on but the deer

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.899 
put one of these wraps on but the deer
obviously<00:01:29.770> can<00:01:30.009> scrape<00:01:30.399> through<00:01:30.640> it<00:01:30.790> and

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
obviously can scrape through it and

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.929 
obviously can scrape through it and
still<00:01:31.149> cause<00:01:31.390> damage<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.399> if<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.549> just<00:01:33.729> put

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
still cause damage and if you just put

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.999

really well and I just want to show you

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.850 
really well and I just want to show you
how<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.859> install<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.390> first<00:02:07.390> off<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:08.619> take<00:02:08.800> the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
how to install it first off you take the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
how to install it first off you take the
plastic

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.080 

and<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.620> wrap<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.430> wrap<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.760> around<00:02:18.850> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
and you wrap it you wrap it around the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.630 
and you wrap it you wrap it around the
trunk<00:02:19.620> now<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:20.770> important<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.220> get<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.460> down

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
trunk now it's important to get it down

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.340 
trunk now it's important to get it down
low<00:02:24.030> then<00:02:25.030> also<00:02:25.480> make<00:02:25.630> sure<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.080> get<00:02:26.200> it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
low then also make sure that you get it

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:44.580 
low then also make sure that you get it
high<00:02:26.560> enough<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.880> idea<00:02:43.240> is<00:02:44.020> that<00:02:44.320> when<00:02:44.470> you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
high enough the idea is that when you

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.670 
high enough the idea is that when you
install<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.600> tube<00:02:46.930> will<00:02:47.560> be

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
install this that this tube will be

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.760 
install this that this tube will be
covered<00:02:47.980> by<00:02:48.010> plastic<00:02:48.610> down<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:50.380> protect

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
covered by plastic down here to protect

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.640 
covered by plastic down here to protect
it<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.160> then<00:02:52.120> also<00:02:52.480> up<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.320> doesn't

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
it and then also up here so it doesn't

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.110 
it and then also up here so it doesn't
rub<00:02:53.890> onto<00:02:54.190> your<00:02:54.310> bark<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.790> cause<00:02:54.970> damage<00:02:57.120> so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
rub onto your bark and cause damage so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.100 
rub onto your bark and cause damage so
all<00:02:58.210> you<00:02:58.390> do<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:01.030> put<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.540> my<00:03:01.660> shoulder

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
all you do is I put this on my shoulder

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.310 
all you do is I put this on my shoulder
I<00:03:02.350> go<00:03:03.250> on<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> an<00:03:03.670> area<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.360> where<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:04.960> had<00:03:05.200> the

I go on to an area of where I had the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:14.790 
I go on to an area of where I had the
plastic<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:12.220> stiff<00:03:12.550> but<00:03:13.410> once<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.530> get<00:03:14.680> it

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
plastic it's stiff but once you get it

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.540

on it stays there you can see where I

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.370 
on it stays there you can see where I
got<00:03:18.700> plastic<00:03:19.180> above<00:03:19.480> here<00:03:19.720> that'll<00:03:20.020> protect

I<00:03:45.160> like<00:03:45.460> to<00:03:45.730> install<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.330> by<00:03:46.510> about<00:03:46.690> Labor

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
I like to install this by about Labor

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.540 
I like to install this by about Labor
Day<00:03:47.200> turner<00:03:47.740> like<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.040> first<00:03:48.250> week<00:03:48.460> of

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
Day turner like the first week of

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.180 
Day turner like the first week of
September<00:03:49.050> but<00:03:50.050> it's<00:03:50.230> also<00:03:50.410> important<00:03:51.010> to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
September but it's also important to

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.180 
September but it's also important to
remove<00:03:51.610> them<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:52.810> want<00:03:52.960> to<00:03:53.050> remove<00:03:53.320> them<00:03:53.530> dirt

remove them you want to remove them dirt
you<00:03:54.370> know<00:03:54.400> before<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.850> get<00:03:55.180> into<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.540> growing

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
you know before you get into the growing

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.860 
you know before you get into the growing
season<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:56.440> usually<00:03:57.190> about<00:03:57.430> April<00:03:58.270> 1st<00:03:58.600> is

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
leave these on all summer long because

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.520 
leave these on all summer long because
it<00:04:03.520> does<00:04:03.670> nothing<00:04:04.030> more<00:04:04.240> than<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.930> track<00:04:05.230> and

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
it does nothing more than a track and

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.280 
it does nothing more than a track and
maybe<00:04:05.920> even<00:04:06.190> harbor<00:04:07.090> insect<00:04:07.720> pests<00:04:08.140> such<00:04:08.230> as

develop<00:04:13.900> below<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.040> want<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.280> make<00:04:15.430> sure

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
develop below so you want to make sure

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.690 
develop below so you want to make sure
this<00:04:15.730> is<00:04:15.880> normally<00:04:16.239> aerated<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:18.250> you

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
this is normally aerated and that you

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.780 
this is normally aerated and that you
know<00:04:18.760> you<00:04:19.060> get<00:04:19.359> these<00:04:19.510> things<00:04:19.780> off<00:04:19.960> in<00:04:20.170> April

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
know you get these things off in April

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.640 
know you get these things off in April
now<00:04:21.790> if<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.330> was<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.900> time<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.290> take<00:04:23.440> this

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
now if it was in the time to take this

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.240 
now if it was in the time to take this
off<00:04:24.090> all<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.450> do
