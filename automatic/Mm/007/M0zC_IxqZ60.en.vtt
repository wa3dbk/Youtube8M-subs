00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.589
 for the reference to fujimori birth together with the plot of 25 years before 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.589
 until afternoon 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.470
 Mr. Humala 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.720
 you ask questions and there will be military the sun promotion of 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.060
 army occupying body these important in segovia 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.140
 the doctor positions important but within the army euros 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.029
 the officers in activity 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.470
 it has to devote itself to national defense policy to politicians 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.010
 yes i think he 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.190
 what better message to the country a thousand kilos another cd 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.910
 we go to this institutions particularly the deadlines set by 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.660
 ruben neck 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 some areas to think that your government 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.540
 would have some resemblance to the government 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.540
 of General Juan Velasco 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.990
 point because the site 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.560
 our governments 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.540
 a government that emanates from the people 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.270
 but popular vote 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
 the government of velasco by the military dictatorship 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.330
 What we do think and we have clearly said that we have what 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.660
 so social policies that allow girl ovidia the inequality gap 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.550
 of the tensional theme the theme of 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.110
 education health 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.210
 in this sense the issue of fighting for control limited 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.290
 italy legalize that this 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.299
 war against drugs does not have the time effective results 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.300
 I think it would be a bad message 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.030
 for going to young people 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.310
 the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.800
 despite the viewer who could buy it all thanks to this is 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.880
 which is allowing 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.400
 deaf-mute 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.050
 today that message, especially that of Peru 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.910
 the consumption phenomenon 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.880
 up to this point 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.380
 growing 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.539
 this is worryingly 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.930
 soon and that we are now the first second protocol exporter of 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.829
 cocaine worldwide I think it would be a bad message I 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.829
 the code and go as zero tolerance partners the village's eave 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.809
 the visit of cacao fujimori entities 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.189
 and yesterday was a protocol visit as it was in a substance visit that 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.919
 agreements arrived by egypt 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.919
 so the visit 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.589
 p 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.479
 which is normally traditional peru 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.359
 the candidate when 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.079
 by the way already your country defeats healthy as everyone knows 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:00.099
 per cent always of some cost in terms of expectations the effort 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.839
 but 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:05.089
 the important thing is that we are a generation of young politicians who 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.750
 have 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.979
 different from the other generations 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:12.289
 yes we can give it there we still have a lot of time to boot for 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:14.459
 give our forgiveness our efforts 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.459
 that 15-table concertación government includes a couple of charges to the 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.239
 Fujimorism and other opposition parties 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.150
 we open the doors 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.149
 current policies that want to join the concertación 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.939
 we can not yes 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.879
 impose it as a parade bonus come here is not a position 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.039
 politics 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.309
 kika each one of them has flu 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.389
 I think that as probable Fujimorismo 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.249
 erich remains as the opposition 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.469
 that is legitimate by pensioners things that happened to the second round 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.319
 but percent and precious 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.299
 us to him 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.999
 converse with all political forces 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:59.669
 we're going to try to include everyone on the programmatic basis we can not be 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.059
 per hundred that more ideological because our differences but for example 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:07.359
 percent asks that they agree or not to give a pension not 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.480
 contributive union mdp low 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.379
 to contribute things to the attack 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.379
 by the government 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.120
 we have not discussed that the muscles absolutely speaking system of the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.709
 fujimorismo president elect sun 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.350
 second vice president 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.570
 and if it's possible to compare if it is said that fujimori should be traced to a jail 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.680
 as you know I would be willing to try it for reasons 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.650
 sentimental I was imprisoned as a contradiction 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.760
 do you agree 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.569
 with that possession this Saturday his tongue went 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.639
 but I think that the home is about people personally 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:48.340
 min nor worry today is pension 65 these percent programs 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.120
 for early childhood 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.120
 this event structure 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.240
 and I think it's an issue that belongs to the judiciary 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:05:00.159
 the journey to analyze it is not me who showed up when I gave priority 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.289
 touching that topic I think he is not convenient has let see 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.540
 denied today knowing the selection is dealing with issues that 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.640
 not to unite to the Peruvians insinuated that they are not going to create and divergences we do not want 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.650
 more divergences we want 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.470
 in the country has what worries me is the macroeconomic stability the 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.610
 monetary policy would be responsible martinez and economic growth 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.050
 i that this generates social inclusion 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.870
 establish relations with all the countries of the region 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.490
 in the case of his brother who is budgeted hotel was also 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.820
 think and until eta now that is president improve the conditions 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.639
 prison other news the news 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.370
 I believe that the party to follow burns 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.760
 that I respect the judiciary I will not regret 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.960
 I'm not going to interfere in that subject 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.309
 what I do believe that like him all people who suffer jail 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:54.650
 they must be treated properly 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.090
 and they should have the right to education or the right to work because the 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.730
 deprivation of liberty does not infringe on other rights, at least not 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.740
 say the spices the judges the good condition 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.039
 percent in some other uribistas 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.420
 today starts this was the second part to return to Panama but other relationships 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.889
 patrimonial of ollanta play operations 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.409
 Rafael Nadal 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:27.649
 loa comarca and also comes in relation to the media especially 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:29.059
 two that for peace
