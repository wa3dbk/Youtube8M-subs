really choose this charity but you can't
build<00:02:21.799> very<00:02:21.980> source<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.459> was<00:02:22.580> very<00:02:22.850> difficult

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
build very source it was very difficult

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.050 
build very source it was very difficult
and<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:24.019> lot<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.350> Protoss<00:02:24.890> players<00:02:25.160> are<00:02:25.459> really

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
and a lot of Protoss players are really

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060 
and a lot of Protoss players are really
experienced<00:02:26.840> with<00:02:27.019> holding<00:02:27.320> off<00:02:27.470> any<00:02:27.739> kind<00:02:28.010> of

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
experienced with holding off any kind of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.070 
experienced with holding off any kind of
like<00:02:28.250> two<00:02:28.519> or<00:02:28.820> three<00:02:28.850> rocks<00:02:29.390> all<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.870> with

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
like two or three rocks all in with

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.020 
like two or three rocks all in with
Marines<00:02:30.470> right<00:02:30.830> right<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.250> they're<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:31.820> good

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
Marines right right and they're so good

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.510 
Marines right right and they're so good
with<00:02:32.209> their<00:02:32.360> forcefields<00:02:33.019> now<00:02:33.140> that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
with their forcefields now that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.980 
with their forcefields now that
makes<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.760> really<00:02:34.030> difficult<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.630> get<00:02:34.840> up<00:02:34.960> that

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
makes it really difficult to get up that

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.840 
makes it really difficult to get up that
ramp<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.620> even<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.070> do<00:02:36.250> get<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.700> ramp

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
ramp and even if you do get up the ramp

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.760 
ramp and even if you do get up the ramp
they<00:02:37.000> can<00:02:37.180> delay<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.960> long<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.470> force

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
they can delay with so long with force

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.410 
they can delay with so long with force
fields<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.220> they're<00:02:39.700> able<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.060> get<00:02:40.240> the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
fields that they're able to get the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.270 
fields that they're able to get the
amount<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.750> units<00:02:40.960> necessary<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.800> deal<00:02:42.070> with

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
amount of units necessary to deal with

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.370 
amount of units necessary to deal with
any<00:02:42.460> kind<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.760> all<00:02:42.910> in<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.420> oh<00:02:43.570> look<00:02:44.170> at<00:02:44.260> this

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
any kind of all in so oh look at this

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.250 
any kind of all in so oh look at this
though<00:02:44.680> ruby<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.760> gonna<00:02:46.240> be<00:02:46.450> cheesing<00:02:47.080> and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
though ruby is gonna be cheesing and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.050 
though ruby is gonna be cheesing and
then<00:02:47.470> he's<00:02:47.650> going<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.860> be<00:02:47.950> building<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.400> proxy

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
then he's going to be building a proxy

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.940 
then he's going to be building a proxy
barracks<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.440> really<00:02:50.830> good

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
barracks and this is a really good

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.530 
barracks and this is a really good
location<00:02:51.070> man<00:02:51.520> it's<00:02:51.640> away<00:02:51.880> from<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.150> Xel'Naga

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
location man it's away from the Xel'Naga

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.270 
location man it's away from the Xel'Naga
watchtower<00:02:53.080> so<00:02:53.350> any<00:02:53.500> probe<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:53.920> comes<00:02:54.100> by

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
watchtower so any probe that comes by

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.250 
watchtower so any probe that comes by
won't<00:02:54.460> see<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.880> how<00:02:55.540> often<00:02:55.900> does<00:02:56.080> a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
won't see it and how often does a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.780 
won't see it and how often does a
Protoss<00:02:56.650> players<00:02:56.920> send<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.280> scouting<00:02:57.520> unit

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
Protoss players send a scouting unit

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.150 
Protoss players send a scouting unit
around<00:02:58.090> here<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.480> early<00:02:58.630> on<00:02:58.980> droopy<00:02:59.980> is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
around here this early on droopy is

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.160 
around here this early on droopy is
gonna<00:03:00.640> be<00:03:00.790> doing<00:03:01.150> some<00:03:01.390> kind<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.660> two<00:03:01.900> racks

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
gonna be doing some kind of a two racks

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.440 
gonna be doing some kind of a two racks
play<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.800> a<00:03:03.220> minigun<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:04.090> don't<00:03:04.240> think<00:03:04.270> he's

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
play and a minigun I don't think he's

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.310 
play and a minigun I don't think he's
going<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.600> be<00:03:04.690> doing<00:03:04.780> any<00:03:04.960> cheese<00:03:05.140> because

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
going to be doing any cheese because

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.600 
going to be doing any cheese because
he's<00:03:05.440> had<00:03:05.560> several<00:03:05.860> core<00:03:06.130> going<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.490> already

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
he's had several core going up already

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.300 
he's had several core going up already
so<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.150> gonna<00:03:07.240> be<00:03:07.450> pretty<00:03:08.020> frantic<00:03:08.860> game

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
so this is gonna be pretty frantic game

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.890 
so this is gonna be pretty frantic game
in<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.520> opening<00:03:09.820> moments<00:03:09.970> yeah<00:03:10.480> absolutely

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
in the opening moments yeah absolutely

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.350 
in the opening moments yeah absolutely
and<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.440> really<00:03:11.740> like<00:03:11.890> how<00:03:12.130> minigun<00:03:12.610> has<00:03:12.880> stowed

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
and I really like how minigun has stowed

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.990 
and I really like how minigun has stowed
away<00:03:13.540> his<00:03:14.020> scouting<00:03:14.650> probe<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.460> top<00:03:15.700> left

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
away his scouting probe in the top left

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.970 
away his scouting probe in the top left
corner<00:03:16.270> of<00:03:16.450> drewbie<00:03:16.780> space<00:03:17.020> yeah<00:03:17.320> gonna<00:03:17.650> save

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
corner of drewbie space yeah gonna save

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.920 
corner of drewbie space yeah gonna save
that<00:03:18.010> for<00:03:18.520> a<00:03:18.550> rainy<00:03:18.820> day<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.420> then<00:03:19.600> probably
