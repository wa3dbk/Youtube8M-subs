season 11 it is going to prove to be a

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.089 
season 11 it is going to prove to be a
season<00:00:20.119> that<00:00:20.269> has<00:00:20.480> a<00:00:20.509> big<00:00:20.869> bad<00:00:21.109> and<00:00:21.439> that<00:00:21.830> big

season that has a big bad and that big

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.230

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
bad is the darkness the darkness is

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.579 
bad is the darkness the darkness is
pre-biblical<00:00:26.289> it<00:00:27.289> is<00:00:27.910> very<00:00:28.960> very<00:00:29.960> powerful

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
pre-biblical it is very very powerful

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.490 
pre-biblical it is very very powerful
and<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.369> very<00:00:31.579> dark<00:00:31.880> from<00:00:32.449> my<00:00:32.750> character<00:00:33.320> for

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
and a very dark from my character for

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.470 
and a very dark from my character for
Castiel<00:00:33.800> I<00:00:33.949> think<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.460> darkness<00:00:34.789> is<00:00:35.000> my

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
Castiel I think the darkness is my

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.779 
Castiel I think the darkness is my
suspicion<00:00:36.289> is<00:00:36.469> that<00:00:36.590> over<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:37.399> course<00:00:37.430> of<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
suspicion is that over the course of the

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.810 
suspicion is that over the course of the
season<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:38.210> will<00:00:38.329> help<00:00:39.129> unite<00:00:40.129> him<00:00:40.489> with<00:00:40.520> the

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
season it will help unite him with the

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.930 
season it will help unite him with the
boys<00:00:40.969> against<00:00:41.449> a<00:00:41.510> common<00:00:41.750> enemy<00:00:42.820> but<00:00:43.820> we

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
boys against a common enemy but we

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.900 
boys against a common enemy but we
haven't<00:00:44.239> seen<00:00:44.989> that<00:00:45.050> far<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:45.920> that's<00:00:46.070> my<00:00:46.460> step

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
haven't seen that far so that's my step

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.750 
haven't seen that far so that's my step
in<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.180> dark<00:00:47.480> if<00:00:48.019> you'll<00:00:48.410> pardon<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.949> pun<00:00:49.070> and

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
in the dark if you'll pardon the pun and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.880 
in the dark if you'll pardon the pun and
he<00:00:50.000> killed<00:00:50.300> me<00:00:50.449> at<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.719> end<00:00:50.840> of<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.379> season<00:00:51.859> so

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
he killed me at the end of the season so

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.830

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
episode it would be virtually impossible

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.040

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
and that sort of thing so typically the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.830 
the scripts or at least the outlines
okay<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:00.950> those<00:02:01.280> first<00:02:02.000> episodes<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.750> we

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
okay of those first episodes so that we

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.090 
okay of those first episodes so that we
can<00:02:02.990> sort<00:02:03.260> of<00:02:03.290> piece<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.560> together<00:02:03.620> although<00:02:03.980> I

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
can sort of piece it together although I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.680 
can sort of piece it together although I
think<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.430> is<00:02:04.550> difficult<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:05.210> sort<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.450> keep

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
think it is difficult to sort of keep

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.330 
think it is difficult to sort of keep
the<00:02:05.930> thread<00:02:06.230> a<00:02:06.260> little<00:02:06.590> bit<00:02:06.680> I<00:02:06.710> think<00:02:06.830> everyone

that we're gonna shoot over the course
of<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:49.250> day<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:50.060> both<00:02:50.510> took<00:02:50.780> place<00:02:50.989> in<00:02:51.290> this

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
of the day that both took place in this

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.929 
of the day that both took place in this
room<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.099> was<00:02:52.220> just<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.519> three<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.760> us

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
room and it was just the three of us

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.159 
room and it was just the three of us
talking<00:02:53.780> we<00:02:54.620> could<00:02:54.889> shoot<00:02:55.489> those<00:02:55.819> scenes<00:02:56.169> kind

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
talking we could shoot those scenes kind

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.110 
talking we could shoot those scenes kind
of<00:02:57.260> together<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.919> it's<00:02:58.760> called<00:02:58.879> block

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
of together and it's called block

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.940 
of together and it's called block
shooting<00:02:59.540> where<00:02:59.750> you<00:03:00.349> would<00:03:00.500> shoot

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
shooting where you would shoot

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.860 
shooting where you would shoot
everything<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.579> direction<00:03:01.840> for<00:03:02.840> both

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
everything in this direction for both

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.270 
everything in this direction for both
scenes<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.560> then<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.739> turn<00:03:03.919> around<00:03:03.950> and

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
scenes and then you turn around and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.500 
scenes and then you turn around and
shoot<00:03:04.430> everything<00:03:04.669> in<00:03:04.879> that<00:03:04.970> direction<00:03:05.150> but

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
shoot everything in that direction but

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.449 
shoot everything in that direction but
you<00:03:05.599> saves<00:03:05.780> time<00:03:06.049> for<00:03:06.260> lying<00:03:06.919> and<00:03:07.159> moving

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
you saves time for lying and moving

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.789 
you saves time for lying and moving
things<00:03:07.639> around<00:03:07.760> but<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:09.049> just<00:03:09.260> gets<00:03:09.560> really

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
things around but it just gets really

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.069 
things around but it just gets really
easy<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.250> start<00:03:10.370> messing<00:03:10.790> stuff<00:03:10.879> up<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.659> the

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
easy to start messing stuff up and the

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.420 
easy to start messing stuff up and the
logistical<00:03:12.530> ease<00:03:12.650> it's<00:03:12.950> an<00:03:13.099> extraordinarily

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
logistical ease it's an extraordinarily

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.369 
logistical ease it's an extraordinarily
complicated<00:03:13.909> thing<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.299> do<00:03:14.450> most<00:03:14.659> people<00:03:14.959> who

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
complicated thing to do most people who

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.339 
complicated thing to do most people who
watch<00:03:15.560> television<00:03:16.720> don't<00:03:17.720> realize<00:03:18.079> that<00:03:18.109> we

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
watch television don't realize that we

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.659 
watch television don't realize that we
don't<00:03:18.440> shoot<00:03:18.650> things<00:03:18.889> in<00:03:19.010> order<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.400> we<00:03:19.489> don't

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
don't shoot things in order and we don't

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.250 
don't shoot things in order and we don't
shoot<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:20.120> mean<00:03:20.659> it<00:03:20.720> has<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.840> be<00:03:20.959> done<00:03:21.109> for

shoot I mean it has to be done for

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.240 
shoot I mean it has to be done for
convenience<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.799> if<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:21.949> have<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.129> ever

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
it's got a very apocalyptic quality to

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.599

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
stuff off in a very ominous we will be

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.210 
stuff off in a very ominous we will be
addressing<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.629> dark<00:03:57.260> as<00:03:57.409> well<00:03:57.439> they<00:03:57.769> will<00:03:58.069> be

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
addressing the dark as well they will be

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.830 
addressing the dark as well they will be
addressing<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.790> darkness<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.419> mean<00:03:59.569> I<00:03:59.689> would

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
addressing the darkness I mean I would

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.920 
addressing the darkness I mean I would
think<00:03:59.989> pretty<00:04:00.470> much<00:04:01.150> from<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.209> bat<00:04:02.449> I<00:04:02.479> mean<00:04:02.810> it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
think pretty much from the bat I mean it

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.539 
think pretty much from the bat I mean it
has<00:04:03.049> to<00:04:03.199> be<00:04:03.290> addressed<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.859> think<00:04:04.069> is<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:04.400> not

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
has to be addressed I think is it not

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.170 
has to be addressed I think is it not
yeah<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.329> things<00:04:05.659> are<00:04:05.810> bad<00:04:06.069> at<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.250> outset

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
yeah so things are bad at the outset

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.130 
yeah so things are bad at the outset
