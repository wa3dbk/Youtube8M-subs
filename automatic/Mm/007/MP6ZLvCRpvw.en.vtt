00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
with the kosher butchering and so we do

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.110 
with the kosher butchering and so we do
that<00:05:07.260> and<00:05:07.800> then<00:05:08.159> now<00:05:08.370> we<00:05:08.460> mix<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:08.970> with<00:05:09.030> a

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
that and then now we mix it with a

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.629 
that and then now we mix it with a
Passover<00:05:09.840> friend<00:05:10.080> and<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:10.860> eat<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.070> blood<00:05:11.490> of

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
Passover friend and so eat the blood of

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.719 
are pounds and pounds and pounds of meat
that<00:05:24.510> we<00:05:24.840> grind<00:05:25.199> up<00:05:25.440> in<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:26.039> sausage<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.669> the

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
that we grind up in the sausage and the

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.149 
that we grind up in the sausage and the
hamburger<00:05:27.419> and<00:05:27.900> that's<00:05:28.260> why<00:05:28.500> we<00:05:28.740> made<00:05:28.949> those

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
hamburger and that's why we made those

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.250 
hamburger and that's why we made those
the<00:05:29.430> most<00:05:29.550> popular<00:05:30.180> things<00:05:30.449> sausage<00:05:31.050> for
