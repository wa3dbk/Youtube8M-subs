00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
we're sitting in a late-model chrysler

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.430 
we're sitting in a late-model chrysler
vehicle<00:00:10.300> we're<00:00:10.660> going<00:00:10.809> to<00:00:10.870> extract<00:00:11.290> the

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
vehicle we're going to extract the

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.260 
vehicle we're going to extract the
trouble<00:00:11.800> codes<00:00:12.010> from<00:00:12.220> the<00:00:12.370> computer<00:00:12.880> system

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
trouble codes from the computer system

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.060 
trouble codes from the computer system
actually<00:00:13.660> chrysler<00:00:14.350> vehicles<00:00:14.770> are<00:00:14.860> one<00:00:14.980> of

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
actually chrysler vehicles are one of

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.580 
actually chrysler vehicles are one of
the<00:00:15.130> easiest<00:00:15.640> ones<00:00:16.000> to<00:00:16.150> do<00:00:16.450> but<00:00:17.080> i<00:00:17.260> still<00:00:17.529> have

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
the easiest ones to do but i still have

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.400 
the easiest ones to do but i still have
my<00:00:17.830> pad<00:00:18.340> and<00:00:18.610> paper<00:00:18.850> and<00:00:19.210> my<00:00:19.660> manual<00:00:20.170> along

with me to tell me where to start
diagnosis<00:00:22.990> once<00:00:23.380> we've<00:00:23.560> got<00:00:23.740> the<00:00:23.860> codes<00:00:24.130> out

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
diagnosis once we've got the codes out

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.900 
diagnosis once we've got the codes out
now<00:00:25.450> like<00:00:25.750> all<00:00:25.960> vehicles<00:00:26.800> we<00:00:27.279> must<00:00:27.520> count<00:00:27.790> the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
now like all vehicles we must count the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.819 
now like all vehicles we must count the
flashes<00:00:28.509> of<00:00:28.540> the<00:00:28.689> check<00:00:28.989> engine<00:00:29.169> light<00:00:29.590> or

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
flashes of the check engine light or

flashes of the check engine light or
other<00:00:29.910> diagnostic<00:00:30.910> tool<00:00:31.419> that<00:00:31.599> we<00:00:31.689> have

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
other diagnostic tool that we have

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.750 
other diagnostic tool that we have
attached<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.560> system<00:00:32.980> in<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.550> case<00:00:33.730> of

attached to the system in the case of
the<00:00:34.030> Chrysler<00:00:34.300> there<00:00:34.840> is<00:00:34.960> a<00:00:34.989> check<00:00:35.290> engine

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
the Chrysler there is a check engine

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.950 
the Chrysler there is a check engine
light<00:00:35.890> but<00:00:36.460> we<00:00:36.579> don't<00:00:36.850> have<00:00:36.970> a<00:00:37.149> diagnostic

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
says end of message for trouble codes so

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.680 
says end of message for trouble codes so
that's<00:01:38.980> nothing<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.610> we<00:01:39.730> have<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.150> work<00:01:40.390> on

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
that's nothing that we have to work on

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.390 
that's nothing that we have to work on
that<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.260> means<00:01:41.500> our<00:01:41.680> system<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.220> done

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
that just means our system is done

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.000 
that just means our system is done
telling<00:01:42.730> us<00:01:42.820> codes<00:01:43.090> right<00:01:43.600> are<00:01:43.780> 12<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.230> 14<00:01:44.800> or

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
telling us codes right are 12 and 14 or

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.620 
telling us codes right are 12 and 14 or
Thomas<00:01:45.400> we've<00:01:45.580> got<00:01:45.730> a<00:01:45.760> problem<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.300> look<00:01:46.450> in

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
Thomas we've got a problem to look in

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.540 
Thomas we've got a problem to look in
that<00:01:46.780> is<00:01:46.960> correct<00:01:47.260> alright<00:01:47.920> if<00:01:48.040> I<00:01:48.160> look<00:01:48.340> in<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
that is correct alright if I look in the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.910 
that is correct alright if I look in the
manual<00:01:48.700> here<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.750> 12<00:01:50.110> says<00:01:50.530> we've<00:01:50.740> got<00:01:50.890> a

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
manual here the 12 says we've got a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.570 
manual here the 12 says we've got a
problem<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.610> memory<00:01:52.000> feed<00:01:52.570> circuit<00:01:53.200> ok<00:01:53.620> so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
problem in the memory feed circuit ok so

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.580 
problem in the memory feed circuit ok so
basically<00:01:55.210> that's<00:01:55.690> selling<00:01:56.080> us<00:01:56.170> we<00:01:56.320> probably

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
basically that's selling us we probably

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.590 
basically that's selling us we probably
got<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.830> wiring<00:01:57.070> problem<00:01:57.220> yeah<00:01:57.970> usually<00:01:58.270> that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
got a wiring problem yeah usually that

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.970 
got a wiring problem yeah usually that
just<00:01:58.810> means<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.110> have<00:01:59.170> an<00:01:59.320> open<00:01:59.590> circuit

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
just means we have an open circuit

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.500 
just means we have an open circuit
somewhere<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:01.000> would<00:02:01.120> be<00:02:01.150> easy<00:02:01.420> to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
somewhere and that would be easy to

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.710 
somewhere and that would be easy to
check<00:02:01.810> later<00:02:02.280> ok<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.760> we've<00:02:04.000> also<00:02:04.180> got<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.480> code

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
check later ok and we've also got a code

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.279 
check later ok and we've also got a code
14<00:02:05.380> which<00:02:06.010> says<00:02:06.370> a<00:02:06.610> map<00:02:07.030> sensor<00:02:07.870> electrical

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
14 which says a map sensor electrical

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.100 
14 which says a map sensor electrical
problem<00:02:10.890> ok<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.760> those<00:02:13.000> two<00:02:13.300> are<00:02:13.510> probably

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
problem ok so those two are probably

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.250 
problem ok so those two are probably
going<00:02:14.470> hand<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.160> hand<00:02:15.720> there's<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.810> good<00:02:16.960> chance

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
going hand in hand there's a good chance

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.460 
going hand in hand there's a good chance
that<00:02:17.500> either<00:02:17.620> somebody

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
that either somebody

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.170 
that either somebody
left<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.770> map<00:02:18.950> sensor<00:02:19.220> disconnected<00:02:20.060> when
