00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.910
 hello everyone with you Nikita winters and this 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.920
 The third release of Levolution Gaetz in this 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.220
 issue we will discuss a burry plant in 300 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.220
 loyalty 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.320
 311 abandoned Russian plant 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.300
 tank factory where you can feel the mixture 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.489
 infantry combat and the battle on the technique 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.140
 heart of autumn you will fight medium 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.860
 you will survive the crisis of an abandoned building 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.020
 inside 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.270
 the above-mentioned plant in the center of the map at 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.460
 factory buildings located high pipe 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.290
 which can be brought down to earth by exploding 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.239
 warhead blocking the central 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.070
 travel by changing the battle strategy 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.230
 can also activate all possible 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.600
 life -threatening factory gear 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.550
 which can turn deadly 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.989
 traps for enemy soldiers and also we 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.489
 we can observe several others 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.230
 elements from levolution such as 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.840
 motion sensors on. 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.630
 cars on point and hatch on point d a 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.009
 now more detail 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.410
 Perhaps we will start again unnecessary 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.430
 levolution and in my opinion it is for the hatch 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.830
 on building point d 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.450
 what he does he just closes when 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.430
 activation and does not climb with the help of 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.440
 stairs to the highest roof on 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.420
 building and ask why is he 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.610
 useless yes because usually camper 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.470
 climb there using helicopters and in 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.119
 As a result, do not forget a small grid 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.590
 close the hatch when you are on the roof 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.930
 this is not going to you the enemy 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.340
 help stairs 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.710
 the next object of our reasoning is this 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.420
 motion sensor system on a point and with 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.700
 activation of the generator the whole building of this 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.860
 the point will be lit it is exit at the point 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.049
 lasers will catch fire these lasers are 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.850
 the theme of the battle when the enemy passes 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.280
 through activated laser this is a serenade 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.080
 be aware of what's on the enemy's point but if 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.060
 a fighter from that team will pass through the laser 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.280
 which captured the point then nothing 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.750
 happen as a result we understand that when 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.820
 grab the point should be nothing 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.130
 generator and someone the same point with 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.000
 included price reduction system ready 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.430
 to the fact that you 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.360
 found later in this list are th 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.670
 years at point e 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.229
 tutti just the doors close and you can 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.239
 safely sit almost in 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.920
 security and besides sitting in 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.870
 wagons can grab a point and this 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.760
 plus but don't forget that the doors 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.470
 can play against you if 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.329
 opponents do not grenade into the car and close 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.220
 the door you may not have time to open 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.680
 the door and the grant will explode or at least 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.660
 can cause you damage to at least somehow 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.090
 reduce damage from grenades to try 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.370
 immediately play two and you would not have time 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.500
 just sand in the corner of the car and 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.010
 wait out the blast maybe you stay 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.380
 same 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.240
 it should also be said that at the points was 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.550
 there is a building that can be destroyed 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.080
 change the gameplay on the points especially on 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.660
 point b or there can be spread 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.040
 literally the whole point is not what it is 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.440
 fraught to be heard in our 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.210
 previous releases 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.730
 as for the factory machinery on 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.580
 point d then there the situation is tomorrow is similar to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.380
 motion sensor on point a should 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.600
 start the generator and then the mechanism 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.790
 will start their work should include only 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.680
 then when opponents are on 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.440
 the location of these objects 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.840
 or move them irresistible come 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.740
 and so now the sweetest pipe 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.390
 to activate this levolution 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.640
 should only activate the system 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.440
 self destruct which will blow it 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.810
 scary mechanism that directs 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.820
 warhead explodes of course after three 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.860
 minutes after the start, by the way, you can set 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.140
 timer paused after time expires 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.960
 the siren will start and this mechanism will explode 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.180
 the dangerous pipe will be shaken and fall between 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.350
 dots dc thereby blocking the movement 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.750
 in this segment 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.850
 as well as demolished pipe crossing between 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.130
 dots that do not really like the camper 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.870
 conclusion should not immediately destroy the pipe 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.400
 so it can interfere with yours 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.380
 armored vehicles move fast from 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.670
 dot to dot or blown hell 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.200
 right moment the pipe may well 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.630
 destroy enemy equipment which 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.120
 is between the points 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.560
 Well, here we have discussed this card 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.300
 subscribe put likes 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.420
 tell friends or fall on you 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.209
 pipe if our release is likely to 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.660
 Unfortunately will not be released in a week 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.790
 because 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.170
 the team in bright read me to the shooting 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.730
 myths on battlefield 4 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.770
 and also invited me to spend 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.010
 interviews with 1 famous people from 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.640
 portal play pleer.ru by Mr Kings 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.380
 and so see the command channel if 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.080
 want to see and your described work and 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.030
 collecting then write myths questions for 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.320
 interview in the comments and also write 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.600
 the name of the card that you would like 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.790
 see in my next review 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.960
 I think that's all 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.960
 see you on the battlefield maitz
