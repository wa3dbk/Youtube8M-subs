00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 19 comes to a new episode bad honnef 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.240
 and fourth is the theme and you 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.440
 was already treated in the last patch 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.019
 and I did not make it in time 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.610
 that's why the revanche here more or 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.920
 less than for jurassic has been revised 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.599
 and many have criticized her for that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.890
 listen back and the old one for juror me 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.940
 I'm honest the new one is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.890
 spitzenklasse 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.730
 I think it's beautiful by design and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 we will all skills now 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 consistent and the criticism hearts 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
 or burst abc speech mistake in comic 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 Well, we start with your passports when 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.170
 so that is capable of weak spots 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.759
 of the opponent to search and find 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.130
 these weak points are then in the 90th 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 degrees angle around the opponent marked without 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 be able to outtakes or with 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.260
 to hurt those passports 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.750
 you should have done the whole thing 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 you will have with massive bonus 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.590
 rewarded is ditto 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.460
 that means he makes bonus true damage in 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.820
 your opponent 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.000
 well and the value please 3% location then 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 up to 4 5 percent per 100 bonus damage 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.680
 you have well you have to remember that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.480
 we say we start 25 without any harm 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.640
 if you have halfway normal rest and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 the whole hold of the maximum life of the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.000
 that means if you have one for 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.590
 Jurassic is the one with say I'm 300 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.390
 he walks around every time 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.850
 Twelve percent off the opponent 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.130
 twelve percent of his maximum lives as 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.070
 Bonus damage is after the autotag of 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.509
 300 on computers are super high and if they are 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.580
 as soon as a sign is out, it becomes moreover 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.920
 even with movement speed rewards the synonymous 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.630
 increases with time or with 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.340
 the points the inner ultimate puts 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.600
 you will even be healed 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.579
 I have to admit that the cure is not 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 especially much right at the beginning but 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.299
 the whole adds up just when 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.610
 the ultimate uses but come to that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.400
 nor has the relative pace of duty is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.750
 top class does and the shame and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.579
 you are in the situation the opponents really 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.920
 on the left to the polish just to hesse 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.360
 if that fit well with you show that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.369
 it is especially easy for you 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.060
 use the ski or the new spring 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.860
 your opponents ran 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 nevertheless a full force pure and run 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.610
 Away free but extremely much 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.200
 damage done to the opponent well 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.729
 This kyu is very good 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 that would change me now 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.329
 not twice anyway for opponents 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.549
 or so but she can cross walls 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.259
 everything and attack targets nearby 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.240
 the harm of it is not okay 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.409
 overrun high is the advantage but that 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.270
 you have been able to do this since 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.670
 weak spots as the name trigger 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.319
 that would favor me in addition 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.659
 will also the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.400
 uhrlau lowered this ability in 60 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.780
 if you attack an opponent and yes 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.030
 the cool start though with a 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.340
 astronomically high value so the sum 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.049
 high, but later it's only eight 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.969
 seconds and of it the whole percent 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.519
 deducted what can all the time 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.810
 and jumping is much better 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.030
 as the last time you just have to look 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.739
 that you correctly assess the turn it 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.540
 are some tricky if then I want 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.829
 Let's say where you rather bang against it 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.480
 but otherwise this should where many 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.950
 small ones are very important for 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.609
 folder has been defensive mobility goods 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.840
 always a problem 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.189
 Well come to her like now 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.079
 Normally we could do things 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.549
 parry they can in principle always 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.019
 but the whole thing is essential 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.400
 improved that means it now 1 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.829
 Killshot is able to target 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.449
 slow down even taking text 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.159
 or to look after 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.829
 because the second effect is that the thing 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.139
 as a fur shield applies if anything csi 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.949
 I started reading that could come 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.359
 just sing away 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:05.180
 the problem is that is very 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.620
 stately animal stands 0.75 seconds 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.719
 this is one with some opponents 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.280
 numbness as skill nerves small 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.780
 a little bit of it makes it magical 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.639
 harm and you can still do it 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.409
 to protect myself though I find specials 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.759
 like nocturne or victories essential 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.599
 better this much more reactive 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.849
 do not have to aim 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.829
 Nevertheless, the duel is restrained by her 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.389
 significantly strengthened by alone 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.049
 the lyrics reduction that one should 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.370
 not underestimate 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.139
 for me personally is the ability 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.540
 a little too slow , we come good 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.919
 to her former blackrock usually 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.900
 You can also attack soon 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.609
 increase speed and this mostly 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.250
 capable of two audio tracks 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.169
 reinforce that means you hold 50% 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.930
 Attacks can be made until the release 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.939
 but the audio text have the following bonus 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.739
 with little that meant the first beats 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:47.840
 but to be but never crib for it 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.759
 The second certainly offers, however 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.620
 a certain reduced will always 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.389
 was bonus damage there but it is 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.560
 ok if you have the ability 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.030
 then maximize then you have completely 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.069
 normal credit anyway is the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.959
 Ability in Laage massive damage 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.790
 to express normally well above all things 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.199
 you can read it as it means that the 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.120
 later gameplay can yes the 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.889
 Opponent for 60 percent for one 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.750
 Slow down for a few seconds 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.129
 worth it for viola is about it 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.269
 to be able to turn the opponents and for it 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.859
 is a slowdown almost 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.479
 If necessary, you have enough 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.709
 the numbness with that would be like that 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.269
 said a bit difficult as well 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.039
 must be mentioned that the ability 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.680
 an auto tech reset is that means here 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.560
 it's about opponents to takkt ag and you 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.030
 credit 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.290
 credit always it is of course one 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.600
 starting with weak credo but later 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.450
 terrific of the damage output of fiorano 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.889
 pitt high enough with the ultimate 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.570
 was criticized hard 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.730
 because the old one is for her true position 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.860
 by the opponents to schnetzeln that though 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.560
 pretty random and pretty packed 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.180
 but she could and where the damage 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.980
 and because of the damage of the 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.480
 old ultimate not bad the new one 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.040
 however, works differently is 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.110
 to save something 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.610
 it's something that lets support 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.750
 Figures and the location of an opponent 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.669
 mark we get this epic 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.200
 monster radius is back in the 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.030
 lay his weak spots his 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.070
 digital points his passports more or less 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.139
 less company trigger once around it 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.240
 and then please make a huge 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.860
 either are mobile victory sound that 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.120
 means the opponent still lives or if 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.560
 her opponent also die before 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.800
 you should have a pretty here 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.729
 large area where extremely much is healed 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.430
 you have to say that 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.960
 jana is from pitzer g standards of the situation 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.450
 and high values ​​of their healing 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.180
 but for year has 1 3 100 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.169
 percent bonus ag scaling that is 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.270
 just stupid 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.919
 that just fails that means to 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.510
 example with 200 bonus to rom need 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.800
 not unusual and would therefore be in 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.780
 this area 1300 live 1300 that it 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.430
 without stopping this ultimate is the 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.030
 that's the turnaround 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.830
 madness 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.410
 and I watched players for Jurassic 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.360
 The've deliberately said okay I choose 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.370
 as uli targets the weakest of all 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.930
 because of the support of the place immediately 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.000
 because you have to remember it 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.770
 almost four times depressive stacks on the 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.630
 opponent on it or can 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.280
 Now you break that down four times and that is 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.860
 sophie true the human there is none 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.050
 with clear the target explodes so and 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.150
 well and nobody really nobody 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.039
 can be with your team in this zone 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.660
 you can forget to create so 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.220
 fast high money only massive blogs 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.270
 bring and if you share it well 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.530
 is the embarrassment one of the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.479
 fallen in the tank environment 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.680
 totally disturbed the health of these 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.270
 ability are normal 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.190
 In addition, even 4 as movement 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.419
 speed in there increases and they are 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.620
 plants even better strike 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.220
 or other goals 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.570
 shred 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.979
 the biggest advantage that has to be 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.720
 be mentioned the ultimate is the 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.550
 fact that you have these four vital ones 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.110
 Zones with a dream pack 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.070
 scenario is so the opponent will 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.650
 marked by the press 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.140
 here the persistence triggers and releases him 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.360
 once again all the passports of the oldie 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.060
 that is so abnormally much to do 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.050
 today, mankind probably noticed that there 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.909
 none resist 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.409
 they all burst out in a chronic way 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:42.240
 It's the first time she really gets it 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.800
 So honestly do the land 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.500
 games I've seen the body 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.849
 fiona really extremely good and it has 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.189
 super fun to watch 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:52.110
 was really asked for it gets her 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:54.539
 the victory son through or not because 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.639
 If you instead of the turnaround of the month 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.229
 of the year my ideas hammer so me 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.819
 Personally the guides like it very much 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.319
 nevertheless, one is also weakening some 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:04.740
 For one thing , the cool ones will be on the 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:06.330
 low level this stupid fee 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.830
 look at these numbers that is 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.779
 just stupid but you have to say 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.219
 fair against these cool and very 

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:12.960
 very fast down reach then right 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.909
 pleasant almost worth a lot 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.949
 just the cow ability is constantly 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.389
 can be used but until then you have to first 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:20.009
 once worked well another point 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.479
 is that it is still vulnerable 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.699
 that must not just overheat that 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.319
 fight one she dies anyway if she 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.039
 it just not keen her victory son 

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.439
 build 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:30.029
 then there are really problems otherwise is too 

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:31.319
 a duo land grown in a position 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:32.669
 really get along with others 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:34.620
 duel and fight back 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.870
 she has 90 she has 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.210
 super much attacking power with their 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.650
 Resets or with the press and you can 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.449
 make a good lane bulli because 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.159
 now she has a direct escape and 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.139
 is also in the situation one right 

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:48.629
 Great gentleman imagine it with the press 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:49.949
 that's just really nasty god can 

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:52.110
 failed as I said something 

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:54.060
 but it was a dream come true 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.930
 to put this video skin pure and 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.930
 have fun while ranking
