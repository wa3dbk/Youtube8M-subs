00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
grenade launchers and some special I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.550 
grenade launchers and some special I
think<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:00.899> some<00:02:01.079> kind<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.320> healing

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
think that's like some kind of healing

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.039 
think that's like some kind of healing
yet<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> healing<00:02:03.030> gun<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.689> also<00:02:06.930> have

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
yet is a healing gun so you also have

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.510 
yet is a healing gun so you also have
these<00:02:07.170> coins<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.039> believe<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.369> only<00:02:08.429> way

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
these coins which I believe the only way

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.260 
these coins which I believe the only way
to<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.849> them<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.569> buy<00:02:10.410> them<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.039> you

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
to get them is if you buy them or if you

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.530 
to get them is if you buy them or if you

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
you don't have to aim down the site to

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.569 
you don't have to aim down the site to

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
shoot if you don't wanna which I usually

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.190 
shoot if you don't wanna which I usually
do<00:03:00.879> it<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.150> way<00:03:01.359> just<00:03:01.569> because<00:03:01.659> it's<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.049> much

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
do it this way just because it's so much

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.339 
do it this way just because it's so much
easier<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:03.419> look<00:03:04.419> around<00:03:04.689> because<00:03:05.079> these

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
easier to look around because these

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.229 
easier to look around because these
zombies<00:03:05.769> come<00:03:05.919> from<00:03:06.099> everywhere<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.000> don't

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
zombies come from everywhere so I don't

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.309 
zombies come from everywhere so I don't
I<00:03:10.389> don't<00:03:10.419> see<00:03:10.659> what<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:10.870> supposed<00:03:11.139> to<00:03:11.200> be

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
I don't see what I'm supposed to be

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.559 
I don't see what I'm supposed to be
doing<00:03:11.349> right<00:03:11.680> now<00:03:11.849> because<00:03:12.849> I<00:03:13.060> don't<00:03:13.120> actually

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
doing right now because I don't actually

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.280 
doing right now because I don't actually
read<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.019> missions<00:03:14.790> but<00:03:15.790> I'm<00:03:16.780> guessing<00:03:17.109> I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
read the missions but I'm guessing I

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
just up to defend this guy usual either

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.550 
just up to defend this guy usual either
somebody<00:03:19.659> you<00:03:19.750> have<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.900> defend<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
somebody you have to defend in the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.289 
somebody you have to defend in the
mission<00:03:22.349> so<00:03:23.459> I'm<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:24.669> going<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.849> finish<00:03:25.030> this

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
believe yeah I don't know what that

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.910 
believe yeah I don't know what that
means<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:53.080> think<00:04:54.080> this<00:04:54.170> next<00:04:54.320> fish<00:04:54.470> has<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:54.830> do

with that but I'm not going to play that
now<00:04:56.450> just<00:04:56.480> because<00:04:56.990> this<00:04:57.170> isn't<00:04:57.440> a<00:04:57.470> game<00:04:57.650> play

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
that as cheating but some people like to

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.060 
that as cheating but some people like to
spend<00:05:41.180> money<00:05:41.390> to<00:05:41.510> do<00:05:42.290> it<00:05:42.470> but<00:05:42.680> whatever<00:05:45.070> so

spend money to do it but whatever so

spend money to do it but whatever so
that's<00:05:46.490> about<00:05:46.670> it<00:05:46.700> for<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:47.060> game<00:05:47.590> you<00:05:48.590> also
