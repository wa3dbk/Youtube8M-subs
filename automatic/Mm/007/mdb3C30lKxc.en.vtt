like<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> systems<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.829> use<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.309> chrome

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
like the systems that use for chrome

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
like the systems that use for chrome
shops<00:00:50.879> now<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.260> using<00:00:52.469> an<00:00:52.710> acid

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
shops now we will be using an acid

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
shops now we will be using an acid
solution<00:00:53.309> during<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.090> plating<00:00:54.539> process<00:00:55.020> as
