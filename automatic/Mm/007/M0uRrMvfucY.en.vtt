00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
really important and the reason is is

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.250 
really important and the reason is is
because<00:05:07.380> we<00:05:08.220> want<00:05:08.430> our<00:05:08.540> manifold<00:05:09.540> pressurized

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
because we want our manifold pressurized

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.140 
because we want our manifold pressurized
and<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:11.040> reason<00:05:11.310> we<00:05:11.430> want<00:05:11.639> that<00:05:11.790> is<00:05:12.000> that's

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
and the reason we want that is that's

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.120 
and the reason we want that is that's
what's<00:05:12.360> going<00:05:12.510> to<00:05:12.570> give<00:05:12.720> us<00:05:12.870> even

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
what's going to give us even

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.050 
what's going to give us even
distribution<00:05:14.130> through<00:05:14.280> all<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.580> equipment

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
distribution through all the equipment

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.510 
distribution through all the equipment
and<00:05:15.539> we<00:05:15.690> want<00:05:15.930> no<00:05:16.289> pressure<00:05:16.650> on<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:17.039> backside

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
and we want no pressure on the backside

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.219 
and we want no pressure on the backside
and<00:05:17.789> that's<00:05:18.150> how<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.390> system<00:05:18.660> works

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
and that's how the system works

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.950 
and that's how the system works
these<00:05:19.650> are<00:05:19.860> property<00:05:20.400> setup<00:05:20.760> manifolds<00:05:21.390> one

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
these are property setup manifolds one

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.330 
these are property setup manifolds one
other<00:05:22.140> little<00:05:22.320> nice<00:05:22.620> piece<00:05:22.919> to<00:05:23.039> this<00:05:23.160> is

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
other little nice piece to this is

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.760 
other little nice piece to this is
there's<00:05:23.580> an<00:05:23.669> emergency<00:05:24.180> bypass<00:05:24.500> over<00:05:25.500> here<00:05:25.680> in

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
there's an emergency bypass over here in

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.400 
there's an emergency bypass over here in
the<00:05:25.860> corner<00:05:26.690> what<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.810> emergency<00:05:28.229> bypass

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
the corner what the emergency bypass

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.980 
the corner what the emergency bypass
does<00:05:28.979> is<00:05:29.220> in<00:05:29.850> case<00:05:30.030> your<00:05:30.210> chiller<00:05:30.450> goes<00:05:30.720> down

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
does is in case your chiller goes down

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.430 
does is in case your chiller goes down
you<00:05:31.650> can<00:05:31.800> turn<00:05:31.979> off<00:05:32.220> these<00:05:32.520> two<00:05:32.760> valves<00:05:33.210> and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
you can turn off these two valves and

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.880 
you can turn off these two valves and
come<00:05:34.440> over<00:05:34.590> here<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:36.229> turn<00:05:37.229> on<00:05:37.470> these<00:05:37.710> two

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
come over here and turn on these two

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.620 
come over here and turn on these two
valves<00:05:38.280> it's<00:05:38.460> up<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.729> city<00:05:38.940> water<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.300> drain

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
valves it's up to city water and drain

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.810 
valves it's up to city water and drain
so<00:05:40.169> you<00:05:40.260> can<00:05:40.380> do<00:05:40.500> drain<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.889> waste<00:05:41.100> while<00:05:41.610> your

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
so you can do drain to waste while your

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.029 
so you can do drain to waste while your
chillers<00:05:42.180> being<00:05:42.780> repaired<00:05:43.169> this<00:05:43.680> keeps<00:05:43.919> you

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
chillers being repaired this keeps you

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.350 
chillers being repaired this keeps you
from<00:05:44.220> having<00:05:44.400> to<00:05:44.580> shut<00:05:44.820> your<00:05:44.970> whole<00:05:45.120> system

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
from having to shut your whole system

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.510 
from having to shut your whole system
down<00:05:45.630> this<00:05:45.840> allows<00:05:46.139> you<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:46.470> keep<00:05:46.680> growing<00:05:46.950> no

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
down this allows you to keep growing no

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.610 
down this allows you to keep growing no
matter<00:05:47.729> what<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.150> conditions<00:05:48.690> and<00:05:48.870> you<00:05:49.470> have
