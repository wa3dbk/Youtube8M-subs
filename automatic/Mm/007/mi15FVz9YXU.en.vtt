nonetheless look through this little

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.420 
nonetheless look through this little
magnet<00:01:07.070> test<00:01:07.340> here<00:01:07.610> you'll<00:01:08.570> see<00:01:09.280> doesn't<00:01:10.280> have

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
magnet test here you'll see doesn't have

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.510 
magnet test here you'll see doesn't have
any<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:10.909> bump<00:01:11.659> that<00:01:11.870> sorry<00:01:12.140> doesn't<00:01:12.860> have<00:01:13.190> any

is real it is marked 925 inside it does
have<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.619> value<00:01:22.490> at<00:01:22.610> 150<00:01:23.329> there<00:01:23.509> um<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.850> next

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
have the value at 150 there um the next

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.410 
have the value at 150 there um the next
one<00:01:26.299> I'll<00:01:26.360> do<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.780> this<00:01:26.960> little<00:01:27.259> one<00:01:27.939> this<00:01:28.939> also

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
magnet test is here's a DC ring I know

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.690 
magnet test is here's a DC ring I know
for<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.270> fact<00:02:24.300> but<00:02:24.750> its<00:02:24.930> fake<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.530> take<00:02:26.340> calls<00:02:26.580> to
