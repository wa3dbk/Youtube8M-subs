00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 samurai manual chapter 2 the first 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.360
 lesson of the samurai cangas was a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.150
 beautiful morning in the sky in the distance 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.210
 The seagulls flew high, challenging the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.670
 Sun 2 Kan was sitting on the cool 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.520
 grass together with other apprentices to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.340
 samurai was his first class he by 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 his father caught the old man 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.619
 samurai the general of generals had 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.019
 decided to leave his other obligations in 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.000
 hands of his trusted men to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.329
 give the class to young people 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 Samurai Khan knew that it was out of love for his 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.030
 son but the old samurai never did 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.910
 I would have recognized and there was the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.309
 old general sitting on the grass with 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.590
 her long white hair waving at 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.870
 wind and his double sword katana 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.120
 diamond drawing trails of light in the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.109
 air each time its owner did the most 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.710
 slight movement I heard young apprentices their 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.120
 omnipresent and penetrating voice to fell 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.729
 instantly all the young voices 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.600
 I want to prevent you from cheating with 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.270
 what you can 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.580
 found in your lives you must 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.100
 always remember that if you run into 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.140
 any of these traps will be a sign of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.270
 that you have left the path 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.299
 correct and you have entered the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 forest is only in the forest 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.520
 of shame and dishonor where 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.799
 the traps are installed on 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.649
 path of honor is the only means to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.350
 reach success may be that some 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.810
 sometimes it seems long and heavy and even 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.330
 look like we can cut through the forest 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.659
 to get there before but that's always 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.270
 illusions the only means to achieve 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.759
 success and achieve your goals is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.759
 follow the path of honor friendship and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.950
 teamwork if you do so 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.039
 we will reach the goal long before 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.530
 what to believe is after saying this 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.960
 the old samurai kept silent a 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.940
 moment for young minds to 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 his students could assimilate the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.560
 wisdom of his words 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.780
 only when he checked in the look of 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.870
 each and every one of his students that what 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.390
 they had understood continued you should not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.640
 fall into the temptation of wanting to create a 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.670
 new magic blow that will solve the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.310
 life the path is unique for all and not 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.590
 we can create another the only thing that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 you need is to continue learning from 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.290
 your mentor applying and practicing 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.769
 his teachings and later teaching 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.540
 what you know to your own students 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.849
 all the apprentices to samurai already 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.130
 they felt in their dream was to learn 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.819
 correctly teach their 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.459
 teachers to be able to put them into practice 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.830
 after someday they wanted to be able to teach 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.750
 also to his own students like today 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.299
 he taught them the old 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.519
 generality you should not fall into 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.680
 temptation to devote little time to 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.650
 your duties thinking that you are 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.780
 better than others only work 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.980
 hard leads to the results and 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.590
 success 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.250
 You must also learn to think what 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.310
 big from today 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.380
 when I was your age my teacher 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.080
 he told me if you want to give him an eagle 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.050
 point to the sun I did not understand his words 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.270
 and I asked him why master what he 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.490
 he answered me better to aim at the sun and 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.010
 give only an eagle to point to 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.380
 eagle and hunt a stone since then 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.530
 My aim has been to be the biggest 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.800
 of the samurai that has never existed 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.690
 the same one that you should notice 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.570
 many of you believe that I am the samurai more 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.510
 powerful and experienced that there is me 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.790
 I think I'm just the oldest laugh 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.880
 of the students resounded in the quiet 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.220
 valley however he continued to dip very 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.800
 serious and every day I work for 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.200
 improve me a bit to get a little 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.239
 more than the day before his voice was gone 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.840
 gradually reducing to a slight 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.480
 I whisper thanks to that I have arrived 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.480
 where I am but do not tell it to 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.090
 nobody is a secret the students had 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.340
 eyes wide open as if like that 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.340
 could better listen to their teacher
