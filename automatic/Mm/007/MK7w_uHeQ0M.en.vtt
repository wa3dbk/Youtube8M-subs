00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.270
 goodnight please some 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.030
 silence to start the conference of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.710
 press welcome professor pablo 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.660
 bengoechea technical director of the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.730
 national team colleagues who 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.910
 want to ask please there we have 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.320
 the microphone forward what paulo like this 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.840
 good night for those in the des tower 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.800
 cable and what conclusions can be drawn 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.689
 of this match and the result today 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.720
 reflects what was seen in the field of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.720
 game 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.670
 we beyond the result we are 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 satisfied because 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.590
 let's say the local matches 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.630
 that were not fifa date we started to 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.790
 work there by the end of March or 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.980
 early April and good luck 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.899
 the guys that came to these 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.160
 microcycles today had the 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.519
 opportunities for many minutes of those 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.510
 90 minutes make a great game more 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:04.350
 beyond the goals I do not think the game 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.490
 what made peru today was very good 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.799
 it was mainly the first time he did 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.990
 everything what was planned 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.659
 that left me very happy 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.270
 and the issue of dedicating them to judge today we saw 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.280
 in a different position he will continue 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.580
 or will he continue to use you in that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.580
 position 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.490
 the last the last game before 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.600
 his injury he played steering wheel by right 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.060
 the san martín 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.260
 that day he was injured and when he has returned 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.260
 played by steering wheel by right 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.420
 I think it's a player who plays in 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.310
 many positions that has a 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 physical performance 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 elevated or is it a player who 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.479
 that has an important deployment and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.840
 good today apart from that deployment 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.840
 physical 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.020
 that we had asked him to come to 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.810
 area we owe many conditions for 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.370
 get worthless to the area and good and today 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.970
 it went round because I end up doing 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:08.729
 the goals bengochea process renovation 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.700
 as a result it serves because 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.659
 feeds the spirit of the 3 selection to 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.260
 0 is important in this instance that 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.170
 conclusions to the soldering iron 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.210
 beyond operating results 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.950
 of the team 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.870
 the goals have been of later flyers 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.780
 cristian ramos defense there has been no more 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.670
 of the front and here obeyed the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.190
 change from youtube and have been conditioned 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.790
 for the yellow card 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.890
 they are many questions 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.319
 in soccer all field players 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.340
 can they make goals let's say the goal of 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.379
 still ball 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.700
 many times they have more chance 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.260
 defenders who are the ones who are going to 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.170
 nod in there practically from the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.970
 strikers with the exception of Chávez 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.890
 they were in the area so we had 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.520
 a lot of choice that was a defender the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.330
 I converted 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.060
 then he had 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.890
 in two arrivals one in an overflow by 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.510
 left a center of cedrón and in the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.210
 second time came against back to 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.430
 defining the goals is the least for me 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.920
 I am satisfied with the first 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.110
 weather 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.690
 I think the second time we did not start 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.060
 well the team did not repeat what was 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.849
 done in the first time we thought that 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.340
 could happen to us because I needed to go back 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.920
 We made a lot of effort in the first 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.630
 time to have that performance then 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.319
 the first minutes of the second half 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.160
 cost us with the changes I think the 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.800
 team returned to 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.250
 to have the rhythm of the first time to 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.220
 more there was a little more too and that we 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.430
 let's say we took to have spaces for 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.800
 convert goals the change of youtube or 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.780
 it has to do with the yellow if not 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.750
 we wanted to run risk there are five 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.160
 changes and we intended to give it 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.020
 to work since we see it in the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.610
 local championship we take them to the 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.550
 friendly matches of europe and not 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.370
 we had the chance to see it 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.290
 play with the shirt of Peru then 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.690
 we thought it was the right time 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.680
 the yellow of youtube and see it back with 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.900
 the second time 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.450
 at that time he said he stays 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.850
 satisfied by the game of unofficial Peru 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.770
 by 3 to 0 however he stays 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.720
 also there is not much 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.669
 improve the points where you see that you 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.580
 can work even more this young 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.530
 selection always improve if we think 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.510
 we can not improve we can not play 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.880
 to football as in any order of the 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.930
 life tomorrow you have to be better than today 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.669
 with what we saw today one gets excited 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.460
 one saw boys work on 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.900
 microcycle as I commented previously to 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.900
 end of march april 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.509
 and what we did in these microcycles 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.720
 I think it looked good today 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.530
 we agree 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.530
 Question 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.080
 another question please 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.010
 good night, have a good time 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.010
 many thanks
