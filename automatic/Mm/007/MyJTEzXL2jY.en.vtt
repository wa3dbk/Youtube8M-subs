00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.409
 these allegations ensuring the peeling off a departure 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.649
 to let go of the mans what is not won because 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.209
 even for a session in March 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.209
 but hey, we'll do everything to make this augur 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.560
 so to start we will prepare to face the traces 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.119
 a year ago 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.119
 your access codes no longer perceive possible right 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.750
 evidence that the plateau otherwise also and especially try to avoid leaving or 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.050
 to stop them 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.310
 percent after should put a little bit of doing 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.490
 there just for the passage of the year 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.980
 why the tobacco back wheel on the sardou michel game do not lose 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.370
 bad weather 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.370
 and after that you have to clean it and put away all the little pebbles 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.350
 there is this series does not get wide enough 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650
 for me the width of two windows 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.000
 even if we only have love 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.570
 nothing 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.570
 if you have some loose soil available 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.580
 try gravity 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.610
 Why 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.610
 movies to put it in the national b track a little bit 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.900
 he must do at least right 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.250
 but at some point you get ready with your arms 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.920
 I really want to empty the focus 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.680
 for his sleeve because that's where we start to be alone 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.390
 there's nobody else and we can 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.420
 we can really be 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.700
 that we can really get in and 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 field review eventually year 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.780
 newaucun to start once arrival taunting 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 I start according to 100 meters in 9 years 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.380
 I always use blocked 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.060
 especially in fact 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.190
 in any case we from the moment it looks really use it 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.830
 after in the sand we have less tendency which is not used because there is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.410
 less grip 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.920
 clear enemy 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.180
 but right now I think about the operation 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.659
 on a normal texture must also an indispensable tool 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.079
 alami glasses i'm still waiting 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.929
 a little before putting them to look a little air 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:16.799
 in general I look 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.209
 who enters 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.470
 in the last from the continent and on the comic Tuesday 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.609
 so when it comes to pollution less 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.029
 I always keep the right foot on the ground and the left foot on the 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.069
 footrest 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.599
 vincent lemaire relatively forward 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.599
 what is not necessary at least 4 50 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.669
 eqtype ...% in the middle ages I do not know why 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.669
 within this group 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.669
 this new treatment 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.519
 with the second child 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.669
 it allows me to 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.669
 he's hoping for a good part of the straight line on a person in front of the 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.669
 la France 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.469
 more than just a passage on the set 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.469
 I focus on the system that I studied percent 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.069
 Before his departure 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.539
 and to mention that I discover something move butter let loose 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:19.809
 all 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:24.419
 % next with regards to my right foot I have out to get 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:30.909
 I go back up and I feel lucky right stable and that I took a little bit of 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.939
 speed I regret what I have on my subject this trap 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.939
 % to have maximum traction 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.479
 nokia nok pretty close to qom center 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.479
 there is not much room to disturb the bike too much 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.199
 employment pole will be happy 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.840
 in short on the departure just regret that this is for sure 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.089

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.549
 to leave in front 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.449
 we have to put ourselves in the head that 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.449
 here is the saying 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.319
