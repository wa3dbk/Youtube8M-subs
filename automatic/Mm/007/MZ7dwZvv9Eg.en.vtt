medical treatment and I think the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.999 
medical treatment and I think the
governor's<00:01:27.900> theory<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> them<00:01:28.890> will

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
governor's theory is a lot of them will

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.960 
governor's theory is a lot of them will

choose not to seek medical treatment

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.760 
choose not to seek medical treatment

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
the hands of the doctor and let the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.440 
the hands of the doctor and let the
doctor<00:02:30.830> make<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.130> best<00:02:31.640> medical<00:02:32.000> decision

for<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.690> patient<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.200> then<00:02:33.500> if<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.700> doctor

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
for the patient and then if the doctor

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.020 
for the patient and then if the doctor
feels<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.110> individual<00:02:36.620> patient<00:02:37.070> is<00:02:37.730> not

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
feels that the individual patient is not

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.600 
feels that the individual patient is not
is<00:02:38.630> not<00:02:38.959> meeting<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.680> standards<00:02:40.280> meeting<00:02:40.550> the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
is not meeting the standards meeting the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.979 
is not meeting the standards meeting the
requirements<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.270> doctors<00:02:41.600> prescribe

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
requirements that the doctors prescribe

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.070 
requirements that the doctors prescribe
then<00:02:42.830> somehow<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.370> doctor<00:02:44.120> would<00:02:44.360> assess<00:02:44.840> a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
then somehow the doctor would assess a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.170 
then somehow the doctor would assess a
fifty<00:02:45.440> dollar<00:02:45.470> fee<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.280> person<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:47.120> just

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
fifty dollar fee to that person it just

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.820 
fifty dollar fee to that person it just
seems<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.630> crazy<00:02:47.930> system<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.410> if<00:02:48.680> we're

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
seems like a crazy system and if we're

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.140 
seems like a crazy system and if we're
going<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.010> leave<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.489> decisions<00:02:49.940> between

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
going to leave the decisions between

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.970 
going to leave the decisions between
patients<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.780> doctors<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.290> can<00:02:51.650> think<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:51.920> a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
patients and doctors I can think of a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.229 
patients and doctors I can think of a
few<00:02:52.010> other<00:02:52.310> policy<00:02:52.700> areas<00:02:53.000> where<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
few other policy areas where the

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.100 
few other policy areas where the
governor<00:02:53.540> has<00:02:53.630> failed<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.900> do<00:02:53.989> that

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
governor has failed to do that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.500 
governor has failed to do that
interestingly<00:02:54.739> one<00:02:55.160> other<00:02:55.280> point<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.820> this<00:02:56.450> is

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
interestingly one other point is this is

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.990 
interestingly one other point is this is
the<00:02:56.750> same<00:02:56.989> governor<00:02:57.500> who<00:02:57.920> decided<00:02:58.370> last<00:02:58.760> year

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
the same governor who decided last year

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.960 
the same governor who decided last year
to<00:02:59.239> not<00:02:59.870> pay<00:03:00.140> for<00:03:00.340> transplants<00:03:01.340> for<00:03:01.610> people

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
to not pay for transplants for people

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.630 
to not pay for transplants for people
who<00:03:02.750> needed<00:03:03.320> those<00:03:03.530> life-saving<00:03:04.220> procedures

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
who needed those life-saving procedures

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.570 
who needed those life-saving procedures
who<00:03:04.760> were<00:03:04.910> among<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.780> same<00:03:05.989> population<00:03:06.590> David

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
who were among the same population David

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.100 
who were among the same population David
