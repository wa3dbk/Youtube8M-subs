00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
nothing really else lined up you can see

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.580 
nothing really else lined up you can see
in<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> interior<00:03:02.970> here<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.510> firewall<00:03:04.140> didn't

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
in the interior here the firewall didn't

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.200 
in the interior here the firewall didn't
really<00:03:04.980> attached<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.700> floor<00:03:05.940> there's<00:03:06.150> a

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
really attached on the floor there's a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.360 
really attached on the floor there's a
little<00:03:06.360> bit<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.600> gap<00:03:06.920> that's<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:08.220> because

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
little bit of a gap that's just because

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.970 
little bit of a gap that's just because
of<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.880> tires<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.900> used<00:03:10.140> there<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.560> monster<00:03:10.920> 24

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
of the tires I used there the monster 24

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.480 
of the tires I used there the monster 24
set<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.100> those<00:03:14.220> ones<00:03:14.430> there<00:03:14.960> they're<00:03:15.960> just

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
set of those ones there they're just

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
set of those ones there they're just
really<00:03:17.490> big<00:03:17.760> tires<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:19.280> they<00:03:20.390> pushed<00:03:21.390> up

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
really big tires and they pushed up

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.760 
really big tires and they pushed up
against<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.840> wheel<00:03:22.020> well<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.590> truck

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
against the wheel well so the truck

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.990 
against the wheel well so the truck
wouldn't<00:03:23.010> sit<00:03:23.190> down<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.430> kind<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.730> figured<00:03:23.970> that

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
wouldn't sit down I kind of figured that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.030 
wouldn't sit down I kind of figured that
after<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.510> got<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.840> all<00:03:24.960> put<00:03:25.110> together<00:03:25.230> should<00:03:25.980> I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
after I got it all put together should I

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.540 
after I got it all put together should I
mopped<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.430> up<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.670> little<00:03:26.760> more<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.060> guess<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
mopped it up a little more I guess I

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.980 
mopped it up a little more I guess I
found<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.790> out<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.240> that<00:03:30.600> was<00:03:30.780> going<00:03:30.930> to

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
found that out that that was going to

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.330 
found that out that that was going to
happen

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.059 

passengers<00:03:34.340> said<00:03:35.380> butt

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
turned out okay and then some alumina

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.200 
turned out okay and then some alumina
tubing<00:04:00.270> for<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.480> exhaust<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.850> just<00:04:03.030> use<00:04:03.180> a

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
tubing for the exhaust and I just use a

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.910 
tubing for the exhaust and I just use a
little<00:04:03.360> bigger<00:04:03.660> limb<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.350> slid<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.680> over

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
little bigger limb to and slid that over

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.809 
little bigger limb to and slid that over
just<00:04:05.100> like<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> muffler<00:04:05.780> of<00:04:06.780> effect<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.410> it

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.580 

because<00:04:11.360> I<00:04:11.450> used<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:11.750> motor<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.170> training<00:04:12.500> of

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
because I used the motor of training of

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.229 
because I used the motor of training of
that<00:04:12.709> 37<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.400> wouldn't<00:04:13.610> line<00:04:13.730> up<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.030> rear

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
that 37 it wouldn't line up to the rear

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.060 
that 37 it wouldn't line up to the rear
end<00:04:14.420> that's<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.379> different<00:04:15.680> rear-end<00:04:15.950> I

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
end that's a different rear-end I

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.920 
end that's a different rear-end I
wrecked<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.400> rear<00:04:16.970> end<00:04:17.150> trying<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.510> lower<00:04:17.720> it

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
wrecked the rear end trying to lower it

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.610 
wrecked the rear end trying to lower it

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
63 kit that I had kicking around he was

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.490 
63 kit that I had kicking around he was
a<00:04:29.840> Corvette<00:04:30.260> kit<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:30.650> I<00:04:30.680> had

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
a Corvette kit that I had

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.740 
a Corvette kit that I had
and<00:04:33.240> seemed<00:04:35.280> seem<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.400> fit<00:04:36.580> in<00:04:36.670> there<00:04:36.820> fairly

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
and seemed seem to fit in there fairly

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.620 
and seemed seem to fit in there fairly
well<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.890> width<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.400> was<00:04:40.180> what<00:04:40.480> I<00:04:40.510> was

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
well and the width of it was what I was

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.580 
well and the width of it was what I was
looking<00:04:40.720> for<00:04:41.140> so<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.380> seized<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.830> out<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.100> it

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
looking for so I seized it out of it

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.350 
looking for so I seized it out of it
again<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.830> not<00:04:45.100> aesthetically<00:04:45.730> correct<00:04:46.150> and

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
again is not aesthetically correct and

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.339 
again is not aesthetically correct and
stuff<00:04:46.540> like<00:04:46.720> that

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.019 

you<00:04:49.619> know<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.889> doesn't<00:04:50.129> have<00:04:50.309> shocks<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.939> if

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:51.029 
you know it doesn't have shocks and if

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:52.489 
you know it doesn't have shocks and if
she<00:04:51.270> was<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.659> ride<00:04:51.869> down<00:04:52.050> there<00:04:52.169> hope<00:04:52.319> should

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:52.499 
she was to ride down there hope should

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:53.659
