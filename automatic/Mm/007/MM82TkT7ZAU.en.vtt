the middle beat area and we do this by

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.370 
the middle beat area and we do this by
controlling<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.880> golf<00:00:28.060> cart<00:00:28.300> room<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:28.810> in

to<00:01:01.480> really<00:01:01.750> illuminate<00:01:02.320> this<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:02.770> he<00:01:03.190> does<00:01:03.370> it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
to really illuminate this and he does it

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.740 
to really illuminate this and he does it
better<00:01:03.580> than<00:01:03.700> anybody<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.330> I've<00:01:04.449> been<00:01:04.629> able

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
better than anybody that I've been able

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.280 
better than anybody that I've been able
to<00:01:04.900> find<00:01:05.170> now<00:01:06.390> similar<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.600> his<00:01:07.810> initial

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
to find now similar to his initial

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.780 
to find now similar to his initial
Russian<00:01:08.619> domination<00:01:08.770> he<00:01:09.280> moves<00:01:09.490> up<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.670> the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
Russian domination he moves up to the

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.789 
Russian domination he moves up to the
center<00:01:10.090> of<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.299> flame<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:11.079> map<00:01:11.290> here<00:01:11.590> and

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
center of the flame the map here and

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.890 
center of the flame the map here and
uses<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.520> long-range<00:01:12.909> gun<00:01:13.150> his<00:01:13.299> weapon

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
uses a long-range gun his weapon

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.450 
uses a long-range gun his weapon
selection<00:01:14.049> is<00:01:14.409> a<00:01:14.500> more<00:01:14.799> long-range<00:01:15.009> gun

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
selection is a more long-range gun

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.530 
selection is a more long-range gun
because<00:01:15.729> he<00:01:15.880> could<00:01:16.000> be<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.150> little<00:01:16.329> more

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
because he could be a little more

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.630 
because he could be a little more
patient<00:01:17.049> there's<00:01:17.320> not<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.770> pressure<00:01:18.310> of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
patient there's not the pressure of

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.090 
patient there's not the pressure of
gaining<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.240> B<00:01:19.420> flag<00:01:19.780> or<00:01:19.990> flipping<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.829> spawn

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
gaining the B flag or flipping the spawn

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.819 
gaining the B flag or flipping the spawn
in<00:01:21.280> this<00:01:21.429> case<00:01:21.840> more<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.109> it's<00:01:23.380> about<00:01:23.619> gaining

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
in this case more so it's about gaining

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.529 
in this case more so it's about gaining
the<00:01:24.100> high<00:01:24.310> ground<00:01:24.609> getting<00:01:25.179> a<00:01:25.270> good

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
the high ground getting a good

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.989 
the high ground getting a good
line-of-sight<00:01:26.100> dominance<00:01:27.100> on<00:01:27.249> this<00:01:27.429> map<00:01:27.670> and

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
line-of-sight dominance on this map and

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.510 
line-of-sight dominance on this map and
there's<00:01:28.899> really<00:01:29.140> no<00:01:29.439> better<00:01:29.619> place<00:01:29.950> than<00:01:30.069> the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
there's really no better place than the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.999 
there's really no better place than the
pool<00:01:30.759> area<00:01:31.060> now<00:01:31.840> you'll<00:01:32.049> see<00:01:32.259> as<00:01:32.350> he<00:01:32.530> advances

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
pool area now you'll see as he advances

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.450 
pool area now you'll see as he advances
through<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.249> map<00:01:33.429> he<00:01:33.999> slides<00:01:34.299> along<00:01:34.479> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
through the map he slides along and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.800 
through the map he slides along and
establishes<00:01:36.460> his<00:01:36.700> position<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.389> this<00:01:37.539> pool

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
establishes his position on this pool

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.139

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
have the grain bet high ground but it's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.910 
have the grain bet high ground but it's
more<00:02:10.450> important<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:10.959> actually<00:02:11.170> use<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.709> to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
more important to actually use it to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.030 
more important to actually use it to
your<00:02:12.010> advantage<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.959> Jay<00:02:13.959> does<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> great<00:02:15.010> job

its sliding cover and concealment you'll

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.950 
its sliding cover and concealment you'll
see<00:02:28.210> here<00:02:28.450> so

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960

point he makes a decision to move across
the<00:02:36.880> map<00:02:37.060> because<00:02:37.270> he<00:02:37.570> recognizes<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
the map because he recognizes that the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
and to his original spawn area now one

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.480 
and to his original spawn area now one
important<00:02:44.560> thing<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.710> note<00:02:44.800> here<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.310> he

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
important thing to note here is that he

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.980 
important thing to note here is that he
actually<00:02:45.730> waited<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.330> make<00:02:46.540> his<00:02:46.720> move<00:02:46.960> from

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
actually waited to make his move from

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.870 
actually waited to make his move from
the<00:02:47.230> high<00:02:47.350> ground<00:02:47.620> when<00:02:48.250> he<00:02:48.280> had<00:02:48.430> put<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.640> black

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
the high ground when he had put a black

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.610 
the high ground when he had put a black
bird<00:02:49.090> up<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.480> area<00:02:49.630> now<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:49.960> is<00:02:50.290> so

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
bird up in the area now this is so

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.440 
bird up in the area now this is so
critical<00:02:51.220> because<00:02:51.250> now<00:02:51.700> he<00:02:51.760> knows<00:02:52.090> exactly

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
critical because now he knows exactly

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.990 
critical because now he knows exactly
where<00:02:52.780> everybody<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.560> he<00:02:54.070> can<00:02:54.340> adjust<00:02:54.730> his

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
where everybody is and he can adjust his

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.360 
where everybody is and he can adjust his
movement<00:02:55.510> through<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.720> map<00:02:55.990> in<00:02:56.440> accordance

movement through the map in accordance
with<00:02:57.490> his<00:02:57.670> enemy<00:02:58.270> movement<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.110> set<00:02:59.290> himself

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
with his enemy movement to set himself

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.920 
with his enemy movement to set himself
up<00:02:59.740> for<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.070> best<00:03:00.370> chance<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.850> success<00:03:01.000> now<00:03:01.870> he

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
up for the best chance of success now he

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.690 
up for the best chance of success now he
actually<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.620> earned<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.890> chopper<00:03:03.220> gunner<00:03:03.250> here

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
actually is earned a chopper gunner here

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.060 
actually is earned a chopper gunner here
but<00:03:04.210> will<00:03:04.300> cut<00:03:04.450> that<00:03:04.540> out<00:03:04.600> now<00:03:04.980> after<00:03:05.980> his

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
but will cut that out now after his

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.230 
but will cut that out now after his
chopper<00:03:06.340> gunner<00:03:06.490> he<00:03:06.640> makes<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.910> move<00:03:07.030> across

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
chopper gunner he makes a move across

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.580 
chopper gunner he makes a move across
the<00:03:07.450> map<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.870> think<00:03:08.050> it's<00:03:08.140> important<00:03:08.500> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
the map that I think it's important to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.050 
the map that I think it's important to
point<00:03:08.740> out<00:03:08.890> how<00:03:09.130> he<00:03:09.190> moves<00:03:09.520> now<00:03:09.730> if<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:09.910> look

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
point out how he moves now if you look

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.060 
point out how he moves now if you look
in<00:03:10.180> her<00:03:10.270> overhead<00:03:10.570> view<00:03:10.780> here<00:03:11.020> he<00:03:11.470> slides<00:03:11.860> from

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070

in her overhead view here he slides from
rock<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.580> rock<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.210> this<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> good<00:03:14.200> counter
