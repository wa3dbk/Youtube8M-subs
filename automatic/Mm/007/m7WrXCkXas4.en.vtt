00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
lighthearted skin concept for him like

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
lighthearted skin concept for him like
something<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.300> fit<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
something that would not fit the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
something that would not fit the
character<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.410> all<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.340> least<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.850> should

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
character at all or at least that should

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
not fit the character at all so this

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.209

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
could actually work with the original

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.000 
could actually work with the original
personality<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.250> feel<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> champion<00:00:48.239> and

actually allows you to look at the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
actually allows you to look at the
in-game<00:01:47.880> model<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.450> rotate<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> zoom<00:01:49.710> in

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
in-game model and rotate it and zoom in

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
in-game model and rotate it and zoom in
and<00:01:49.920> look<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.210> every<00:01:51.540> possible

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and look at it for like every possible

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.940 
and look at it for like every possible
angle<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.460> much<00:01:53.610> easier<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.329> get<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
angle and it's much easier to get like a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.069 
angle and it's much easier to get like a
better<00:01:56.430> understanding<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> proportions

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
better understanding of the proportions

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.800 
better understanding of the proportions
and<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.850> volumes<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.180> champion<00:02:00.659> like

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and the volumes of the champion like

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.859 
and the volumes of the champion like
that<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.380> 3d<00:02:02.270> or<00:02:03.270> at<00:02:03.420> least<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.780> me<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.290> and

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
that in 3d or at least for me it is and

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.510 
that in 3d or at least for me it is and
another<00:02:06.869> thing<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.920> in-game

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
another thing is that the the in-game

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.390 
another thing is that the the in-game
model<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.149> not<00:02:09.509> as<00:02:09.720> detailed<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
model is not as detailed as the the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.119 
model is not as detailed as the the
concept<00:02:11.849> art<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.629> splash<00:02:12.870> art

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
concept art or the splash art

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.100 
concept art or the splash art
which<00:02:14.549> at<00:02:14.879> first<00:02:14.909> it<00:02:15.330> could<00:02:15.510> seem<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> bad

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
which at first it could seem like a bad

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.039 
which at first it could seem like a bad
thing<00:02:16.409> if<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:16.739> looking<00:02:17.340> for<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.549> reference

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
thing if you're looking for a reference

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.390 
thing if you're looking for a reference
but<00:02:19.049> actually<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:20.220> thinking

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
but actually I think I was thinking

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.100 
but actually I think I was thinking
about<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.970> while<00:02:21.209> looking<00:02:21.450> at<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> model

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
about this while looking at the model

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.649 
about this while looking at the model
and<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.409> think<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.799> helps<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.549> like<00:02:24.420> what

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
and I think it helps you see like what

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.229 
and I think it helps you see like what
are<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.170> essential<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.280> essential<00:02:26.730> elements

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
are the essential the essential elements

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.869 
are the essential the essential elements
to<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.720> character's<00:02:28.200> design<00:02:28.709> because<00:02:29.700> with

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
to that character's design because with

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.819 
to that character's design because with
the<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.329> the<00:02:30.420> limitations<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.349> need<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.799> be

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
the with the limitations that need to be

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.809 
the with the limitations that need to be
put<00:02:32.159> like<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.849> 3d<00:02:33.209> models<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.840> general<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:35.099> let

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
put like on 3d models in general to let

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.300 
put like on 3d models in general to let
the<00:02:36.000> game<00:02:36.209> run<00:02:36.569> smoothly<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.739> cannot<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.159> too

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the game run smoothly they cannot be too

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.479 
the game run smoothly they cannot be too
detailed<00:02:38.579> so<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.629> can<00:02:39.810> only<00:02:39.989> retain<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
detailed so you can only retain like the

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.789 
detailed so you can only retain like the
things<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.030> are<00:02:42.299> most<00:02:42.569> important<00:02:43.260> visually

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
things that are most important visually

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.580 
things that are most important visually
and<00:02:44.329> those<00:02:45.329> things<00:02:45.660> are<00:02:45.930> often<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.440> as

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and those things are often just as

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.360 
and those things are often just as
important<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.250> drawing<00:02:48.120> than<00:02:48.599> they<00:02:48.750> are<00:02:48.959> on<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
important in drawing than they are on a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.660 
important in drawing than they are on a
3d<00:02:50.370> model<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:51.690> yeah<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.859> spent<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.519> while

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
3d model but yeah I just spent a while

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.690 
3d model but yeah I just spent a while
looking<00:02:54.209> at<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:55.079> 3d<00:02:55.829> model<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.400> at<00:02:56.609> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
looking at that 3d model and at the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.780 
looking at that 3d model and at the
models<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.329> other<00:02:57.510> world<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.200> skins<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
models of the other world and skins and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.030 
models of the other world and skins and
tried<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.819> imagine<00:03:00.359> what<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:01.049> warden<00:03:01.680> bard

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
tried to imagine what a warden bard

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.130 
tried to imagine what a warden bard
would<00:03:02.370> look<00:03:02.549> like<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.870> end<00:03:04.019> I'm

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
would look like and in the end I'm

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.559 
would look like and in the end I'm
pretty<00:03:04.349> happy<00:03:04.560> with<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:05.099> result<00:03:05.879> but<00:03:06.209> I'm<00:03:06.390> not

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
pretty happy with the result but I'm not

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.059 
pretty happy with the result but I'm not
I'm<00:03:07.349> not<00:03:07.409> sure<00:03:07.590> if<00:03:07.829> i<00:03:07.920> exactly<00:03:08.250> captured<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
I'm not sure if i exactly captured the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.099 
I'm not sure if i exactly captured the
specific<00:03:11.069> look<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.700> warden<00:03:12.209> armor<00:03:12.629> -<00:03:12.930> well

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
specific look of the warden armor - well

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.789 
specific look of the warden armor - well
like<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.489> warden<00:03:14.879> armors<00:03:15.799> basically

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
like the the warden armors basically

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.770 
like the the warden armors basically
almost<00:03:17.099> looked<00:03:17.609> like<00:03:17.700> some<00:03:18.090> some<00:03:18.480> kind<00:03:18.690> of

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
almost looked like some some kind of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.580 
almost looked like some some kind of
fluid<00:03:20.030> steel<00:03:21.030> quarreling<00:03:21.660> very<00:03:22.169> tightly

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
fluid steel quarreling very tightly

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.250 
fluid steel quarreling very tightly
around<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.220> body<00:03:23.519> it's<00:03:24.090> very<00:03:24.329> curvy<00:03:24.900> very

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
around the body it's very curvy very

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.250 
around the body it's very curvy very
tight<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.980> especially<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.269> case<00:03:27.419> of<00:03:27.450> Ward

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
tight and especially in the case of Ward

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.470 
tight and especially in the case of Ward
and<00:03:28.410> Nautilus<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.069> almost<00:03:29.430> almost<00:03:30.150> looks<00:03:30.359> like

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
and Nautilus it almost almost looks like

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.210 
and Nautilus it almost almost looks like
the<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.980> character<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:33.709> encased<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:35.069> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
the the character is encased in the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.300 
the the character is encased in the
armor<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.750> that's<00:03:37.410> definitely<00:03:38.010> not<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.280> case

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
armor and that's definitely not the case

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.390 
armor and that's definitely not the case
with<00:03:38.669> my<00:03:39.150> version<00:03:39.389> with<00:03:39.810> warden<00:03:40.200> bard<00:03:40.470> like

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
with my version with warden bard like

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.879 
with my version with warden bard like
here<00:03:41.609> here<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.299> can<00:03:42.449> see<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.560> straps

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
here here you can see the the straps

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.460 
here here you can see the the straps
that<00:03:44.549> are<00:03:44.609> holding<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.329> armor<00:03:45.989> on<00:03:46.169> the<00:03:46.290> body

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that are holding the armor on the body

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.500 
that are holding the armor on the body
and<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.859> can<00:03:47.010> see<00:03:47.220> where<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.790> armor<00:03:48.150> plates

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
and you can see where the armor plates

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.250 
and you can see where the armor plates
start<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.319> end<00:03:49.560> which<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.579> not<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.419> case<00:03:52.049> with

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
start and end which is not the case with

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.710 
start and end which is not the case with
you<00:03:52.500> with<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.889> other<00:03:53.040> warden<00:03:53.579> skins<00:03:53.910> where<00:03:54.599> it

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
you with the other warden skins where it

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.599 
you with the other warden skins where it
almost<00:03:54.870> looks<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.709> whole<00:03:55.980> armor<00:03:56.459> is

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
almost looks like the whole armor is

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.559 
almost looks like the whole armor is
just<00:03:56.879> one<00:03:57.090> big<00:03:57.389> piece<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.720> metal<00:03:58.349> so<00:03:59.340> I<00:04:00.060> don't

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
just one big piece of metal so I don't

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.689 
just one big piece of metal so I don't
know<00:04:00.660> maybe<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.410> more<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:02.010> heavy<00:04:02.220> armor

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
know maybe it's more of a heavy armor

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.229 
know maybe it's more of a heavy armor
board<00:04:02.940> than<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.510> warden<00:04:03.930> board<00:04:04.849> but<00:04:05.849> then<00:04:06.090> again

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
board than a warden board but then again

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.229 
board than a warden board but then again
even<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:07.109> other<00:04:07.290> two<00:04:07.680> other<00:04:08.370> warden<00:04:08.970> skins

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
even the other two other warden skins

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.689 
even the other two other warden skins
are<00:04:09.449> pretty<00:04:09.720> different<00:04:10.250> from<00:04:11.250> each<00:04:11.400> other

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
are pretty different from each other

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.099 
are pretty different from each other
so<00:04:12.209> maybe<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.650> wardens<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.949> don't<00:04:14.129> have<00:04:14.310> any

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
so maybe the wardens just don't have any

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.990 
so maybe the wardens just don't have any
standard<00:04:16.109> type<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.650> armor<00:04:17.250> or<00:04:17.430> something<00:04:17.820> I

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
standard type of armor or something I

standard type of armor or something I
don't<00:04:18.090> know<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.510> I<00:04:19.500> did<00:04:19.769> still<00:04:20.310> use<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.299> color

don't know but I did still use the color

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.020 
don't know but I did still use the color
scheme<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:22.019> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
scheme of the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.270 
scheme of the
like<00:04:23.240> that<00:04:23.450> blueish<00:04:23.870> silver<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.889> some<00:04:25.070> kind

of<00:04:25.370> golden<00:04:26.060> reflections<00:04:26.720> on<00:04:26.960> some<00:04:27.170> parts

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
of golden reflections on some parts

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.980 
of golden reflections on some parts
which<00:04:28.280> i<00:04:28.490> think<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.850> really<00:04:29.060> cool<00:04:29.180> color

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
which i think is a really cool color

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.640 
which i think is a really cool color
scheme<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.620> then<00:04:31.190> keep<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.330> kept<00:04:32.540> all<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.750> the
