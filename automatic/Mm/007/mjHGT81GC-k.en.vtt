00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello and welcome to our teacher 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.150
 point fr today's course has for 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.519
 goal of teaching you a method 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.820
 to arrange the pieces on a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.530
 chessboard for a game of chess before 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.089
 beginning of the game 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.820
 first of all some fundamentals a 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.460
 chess game is played between two 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.100
 opponents of players who opposes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.840
 each side of an apron of a tray 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 we call a chessboard 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.140
 it was a check book consisting of 64 boxes 1.8 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.420
 by eight trials 4 are alternatively 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 dark and clear they are called by 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.129
 white and black expansion on some 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.399
 chessboard the boxes are numbered 1 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.820
 at h in the direction of the length and 1 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.530
 at 8 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.710
 from a point of view from the point of view of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 white player so the white player at the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.879
 numbering in the right order and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.270
 have these parts on lines 1 and 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.760
 2 while black jeans him a rotation 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:06.650
 to pour obviously left the h is this 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.650
 these pieces occupy the lines 7 and 8 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.020
 the pieces recap the we have 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.759
 had eight pawns the pawns it's these 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.070
 small basic pieces that make up 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:26.970
 a little duke's infantry in two rounds 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.610
 and here are the towers he got for you 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.750
 show how positions them from 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.250
 riders so we call riders or 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 or horse by extension I think that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.079
 you and that why the turn as to 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.340
 to her is a tower 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.689
 it's a fortification of fools are 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.180
 pieces with them look a little like 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:53.310
 pawns in some editions always 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.399
 with a slot and the royal couple the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.630
 two most important pieces 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:02.490
 the queen and the king who are bigger 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.740
 and which are distinguishable from each other 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.390
 by their headdresses a leroy always a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.370
 croatia and the stylized wind and the queen 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:18.940
 in general you have seen it to have 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:22.550
 the pawns the pieces we start with 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.570
 have the eight sessions that are in 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.520
 first line so on the line of 20 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.090
 front lines one they do 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.700
 who directly opposes the enemy camp 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.090
 to the opposing side that protects the coins 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.890
 majors who are behind the guy pawn 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:48.230
 in the first line the king and the queen 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.700
 are centrally located how one of the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.980
 main problem of the main 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.350
 problems is how do not 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.860
 reverse them it's very simple the queen 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.489
 must be on her color so the queen 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.670
 white 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.739
 the white lady on the white box the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.170
 lady on her odier color and lady 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.590
 black you see on a black box and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.070
 they are also on the column of 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.600
 dice like lady 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.140
 it is one of the means of his memory 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.209
 also is the same among blacks lady 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.660
 black and on the column of wings is 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.170
 face 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.190
 see him and on the other the other box 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.040
 central on the hour column then 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.630
 crazy people both are there for the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.280
 entertainment of the royal couple so they 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.079
 are right next to the king's penny fool 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.780
 of the queen even if they are called in 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.940
 General white cabbage and black 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.489
 by analogy to the diagonal on which 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.140
 they will move 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.790
 other way of easily remembered other 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.110
 piece of which there is an easy way to 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.170
 memories of their positioning 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.780
 these are the laps the laps are the 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.420
 fortifications the a10 it's the pillar that 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.870
 supports the camp and as such they 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.430
 are in the corners in the bases for 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.690
 well support the camp to defend him 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.730
 to complete the fortification and the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.080
 riders come to complete the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.140
 structure 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.600
 this is a small point again that I have 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.280
 forgot to mention 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.480
 for checkbooks in order to find out if 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.299
 you are if we took it in the good 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.790
 sense if you do not have the chance to 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.710
 have a numbered chessboard it's 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.570
 that the box that is on the right 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.940
 to your right should always be 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.370
 white here you are white or 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.930
 black by the way you see the black camp 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.650
 to the box on his right which is white 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.920
 also the only way to know if the 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.180
 checkbooks and well kept because if it is not 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.760
 not number as it was taken as 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.510
 this is the right box very black 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.970
 which would be problematic 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.680
 Here you know now arrange 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.060
 pieces of a chess game one recapitulates 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.750
 the eight pawns in front of the towers in the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.150
 corners the jumpers next so there is 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.580
 a symmetry between all these pieces the 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.300
 crazy on each side closer to the 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.200
 royal couple 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.380
 the lady on her color in the center 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.590
 another way that you can have 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.300
 maybe with the videos it's that the 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.260
 pieces are getting bigger at the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.620
 as they approach the 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.990
 center 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.450
 but hey it is a way walking 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.880
 some games because some 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.870
 manufacturers take a few 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.740
 freedoms with this convention so 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.780
 it's just for the anecdote 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.270
 here you know how to arrange them 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.530
 you are ready to play or neuro white 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.510
 as always these are old starts 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.830
 good game and see you soon for others 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.830
