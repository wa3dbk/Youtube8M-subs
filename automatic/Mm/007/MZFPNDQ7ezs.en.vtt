00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that to do that part um yeah you would

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.310 
that to do that part um yeah you would
because<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.610> probably<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.690> v4<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
because you probably have the v4 of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.069 
because you probably have the v4 of
modloader<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> come<00:00:41.370> need<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.079> b-52

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
modloader and you come need the b-52

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.190 
modloader and you come need the b-52
make<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.680> happen<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.480> had<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.809> install

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
make this happen so you had to install

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.430 
make this happen so you had to install
that<00:00:46.260> too<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:46.920> means<00:00:47.190> you'll<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
that too which means you'll have to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.540 
that too which means you'll have to
start<00:00:49.440> from<00:00:49.530> scratch<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:50.190> your<00:00:50.309> minecraft

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
start from scratch on your minecraft

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.660 
start from scratch on your minecraft
older<00:00:51.320> but<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.829> who<00:00:54.890> never<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.250> installed

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
older but you who never have installed

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.760 
older but you who never have installed
any<00:00:56.879> months<00:00:57.120> before<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.840> won't<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.680> do

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
any months before you won't have to do

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.270 
any months before you won't have to do
anything<00:00:58.980> about<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.309> because<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:02.039> no

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
anything about that because you have no

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.780 
anything about that because you have no
marks<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.120> guess<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> will<00:01:05.729> have

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
marks on it I guess and so you will have

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.609 
marks on it I guess and so you will have
to<00:01:06.090> start<00:01:06.360> by<00:01:06.540> deleting<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:07.170> minecraft

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to start by deleting your minecraft

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.789 
to start by deleting your minecraft
older<00:01:07.950> tape<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.030> probably<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.900> backup<00:01:10.770> your

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
older tape is probably to backup your

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
older tape is probably to backup your
saves<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.820> don't<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> lose<00:01:12.900> them

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
saves if you don't want to lose them

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.140 
saves if you don't want to lose them
because<00:01:13.439> they<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
because they are in there and you can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450 
because they are in there and you can
just<00:01:15.299> drag<00:01:15.570> me<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> scalp<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.530> looks<00:01:16.920> kind

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
just drag me to the scalp it looks kind

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.100 
just drag me to the scalp it looks kind
