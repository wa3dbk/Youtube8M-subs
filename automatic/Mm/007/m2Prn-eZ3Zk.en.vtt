00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
bad it's that this game is just we've

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.070 
bad it's that this game is just we've
gotten<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.909> point<00:01:07.119> where<00:01:07.240> this<00:01:07.479> card<00:01:07.810> can

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
gotten to the point where this card can

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.560 
gotten to the point where this card can
pretty<00:01:08.770> much<00:01:08.860> max<00:01:09.280> out<00:01:09.490> crisis<00:01:09.970> one<00:01:10.150> but<00:01:10.390> still

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
pretty much max out crisis one but still

pretty much max out crisis one but still
nowhere<00:01:11.020> near<00:01:11.440> maxing<00:01:11.890> out<00:01:12.009> metro<00:01:12.550> so<00:01:13.030> that's

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270
