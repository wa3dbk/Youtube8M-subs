00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.000 

so<00:00:10.700> this<00:00:10.880> design<00:00:11.330> could<00:00:11.720> definitely<00:00:12.110> be<00:00:12.710> used

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
so this design could definitely be used

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.230 
so this design could definitely be used
with<00:00:13.280> 260s

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
with 260s

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.210 
with 260s
I<00:00:14.330> am<00:00:14.600> using<00:00:14.870> 360s<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:15.980> it<00:00:16.130> looks<00:00:16.390> bigger<00:00:17.390> and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
I am using 360s so it looks bigger and

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.720 
I am using 360s so it looks bigger and
it's<00:00:19.220> real<00:00:19.430> simple<00:00:20.920> actually<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.310> artwork

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
it's real simple actually the artwork

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.170 
it's real simple actually the artwork
takes<00:00:23.060> longer<00:00:23.450> than<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.840> balloon<00:00:25.150> so<00:00:26.150> I

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
takes longer than the balloon so I

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.589 
takes longer than the balloon so I
really<00:00:26.779> don't<00:00:26.869> have<00:00:27.020> much<00:00:27.230> else<00:00:27.439> to<00:00:27.590> say

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
really don't have much else to say

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.069 
really don't have much else to say
except<00:00:29.599> don't<00:00:30.410> over<00:00:30.860> inflate<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.340> 360

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
except don't over inflate the 360

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.250 
except don't over inflate the 360
because<00:00:33.910> it'll<00:00:34.910> pop<00:00:35.500> but<00:00:36.500> outside<00:00:37.040> of<00:00:37.100> that

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
because it'll pop but outside of that

00:00:38.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
because it'll pop but outside of that
enjoy<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.290> beautiful<00:00:39.890> music
