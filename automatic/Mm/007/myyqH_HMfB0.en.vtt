00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.040
 The first thing we observe is this 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.189
 hanging for the door well it says 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.849
 I'm playing not bothering myself 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.369
 I think there is no pendant on earth 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.150
 I can have a woman if she acts 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:23.490
 it's because of your mother this is just not 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 works then we have connector 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.140
 three plagues 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.690
 the nvidia video boards fine for is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.010
 which we can comment up to three 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.240
 plates together in the same wood after 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.400
 we have 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.790
 now two are connected but we have 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.260
 the third state cable 3 after 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.890
 we have the connector that he had told them 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.920
 mentioned about the the usb of dedicated 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.079
 for road to monitor after 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.339
 we have 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.339
 and a cable for 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.470
 I think it's so that fire does not stop 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.470
 line and I that we have another cable to 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 crossfire 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.189
 and that would be how much 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.850
 to the cables then we have this that 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.509
 it can be very useful that they really are 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.229
 I can not think of using them but it's good 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.649
 useful also for some people this 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.229
 it's so much hobbies to label and 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.360
 next at each end of the cases of 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.799
 this one is fine to identify them to the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.460
 time to connect and disconnect 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:46.899
 then we have a civilian with the driver 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.270
 of the motherboard with a scudito with 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.720
 a sticker that can be pasted on the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.420
 cabinet or where you want and a 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.689
 Fast guide 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.689
 good for installation and um 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.359
 a manual 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.149
 for everything you can imagine 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:13.629
 it's in English it 's pretty thick 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.050
 you explain things about shipments in 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.930
 hardware 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.440
 everything you need in configurations 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.140
 and so on is overclockers and so on 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.950
 well now past is over 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.770
 turn on that time thanks to the disc 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 solid-state that really was something 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.010
 very very innovative 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.890
 when the loading speed of windows and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.100
 of the games 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.130
 and you can see that a wallpaper of 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.040
 public gamer that happened from 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.810
 installation brings aside and not 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.060
 only from wallpapers and driver 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.420
 it also brings some programs 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.420
 which are useful as for example he 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.130
 this link 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.730
 the eye suite 2 which is a program for 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.910
 see block from windows is that by 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.170
 auto tuning example just use and I 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:21.070
 out overclock ea mother 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:28.090
 I forgive the processor and the memory I 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:32.170
 took 3.60 700 megahertz and 1100 the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.150
 memory that was a surprise the truth 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.100
 is that pretty easy to use vacated 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.100
 we can also see 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.010
 points 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.010
 wrapped in tools 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.030
 how can we see and observe 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.800
 the use of cpu 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.900
 we can choose 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.540
 update shipments from here from 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.530
 windows the truth that quite useful of 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.760
 this tool 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.760
 after good 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.250
 I think that until then everything that 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.599
 is the hardware and software the only thing 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.980
 well I 'm going to make a small 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:22.669
 demonstration of what it is in terms of 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.860
 playability on the ground also played the bat 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.570
 Sincerely, I'm not interested in another 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.080
 game and the truth that you notice a 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.080
 pretty big difference 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.870
 as for a standard motherboard 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.890
 let's say common to a republic of plate 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.920
 gamers is the truth that it is a very jump 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.980
 great the difference is much noticeable 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.600
 quality textures in childhood 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.150
 smoothness 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.540
 is 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.540
 very nice is can be appreciated very well 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.960
 It is very comfortable to handle it for 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.289
 I can see even here I'm going to put 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.319
 a demonstration 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.380
 well I recommend you too I have 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.330
 a 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.980
 well know a keyboard rise air 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.620
 nostrum or to play absolutely 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.920
 comfortable new full we can 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.740
 modify it to our whim with simple 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:31.020
 software that brings for windows and the 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.820
 I recommend true that much 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.040
 well there it is loading 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.340
 I think that before I had not connected the 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.520
 good wifi sensor something I have for 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.740
 reproach them 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.560
 that it seems to me that you are 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.020
 discriminating against md and it would be nice that 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.639
 put also a 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.729
 an integrated wifi system and that's good 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:01.289
 ever call is updated to have 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.289
 pci express 3.0 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.290
 there it is loading and I will be able to go 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.210
 to play 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.490
 a few seconds nothing more much I can not 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.820
 use it for a matter of which I am 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.340
 using the camera and the mouse or keyboard to 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.710
 Same time 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.280
 and the truth is that the details look very 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.850
 all right 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.850
 smoothness 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.669
 all the smoke 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.680
 where the right thing is square of sound and 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.680
 I will understand 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.110
 for many other terms it is going to be able 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.580
 appreciate but it sounds really good 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.580
 let's upload it 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.470
 in what was said of 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.470
 proceed 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.100
 by his side 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:14.210
 is in ultra 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.210
 about a problem 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:25.319
 perfect graphics describing a range 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.319
 average of 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.210
 If we post video kakÃ¡ we just 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.210
 a little more 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.920
 there 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.790
 So, well, I hope you have them 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.860
 liked and that this has served you 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.750
 good Boatyard us first review 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.310
 we are seeing if you like please 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.310
 I like him until then
