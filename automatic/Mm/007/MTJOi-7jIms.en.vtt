00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.730
 I am carloncho I am a sound musician 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.220
 I am from Guadalajara. I want you to break me 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.120
 every enzo I put my grandfather good I can 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.950
 that way 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.279
 since I remember that there is no I am 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.480
 calancha I am a musician I make music calonius 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.490
 how is this really my personality 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.650
 started in 2011 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.760
 good to express it publicly already 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 I had more time I started doing 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.150
 songs since 2007 more or less but 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.989
 I never expressed them until 2011 the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.960
 Musical music scene in Guadalajara 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.300
 this independent seems to me to be very 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.879
 good there are many good bands 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.140
 We are like a team work 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.690
 I consider the best bands of 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.690
 Guadalajara that are sounding today 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.960
 lately spoken for example is 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.280
 where he advanced in the words of tapatÃ­a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.710
 that I hear from the nose I'm not 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.920
 advanced also weird but if there's very 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.720
 good front on this side is therefore 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.050
 technicolor fabrics siddharta of outs 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.430
 this is like velvet greyhound sanjuÃ¡n 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.010
 projects and as many bands well 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.140
 Chinese of every one that after you believe 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.090
 that was made as this cluster of 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.190
 everyone working together started to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.729
 make a movement that sounds like 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.149
 they are also other regions is always 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.180
 this part of the independent vato 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.160
 they suffer the match in it to the planet not 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.340
 I know if I've had a lot of luck or 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.530
 it's also the way perspective with 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.300
 the one that I want to do things to me is me 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.000
 has done well the process 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.990
 I've enjoyed it a lot since the moment 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.670
 that I had to carry something like that myself and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.260
 carry everything in my amps and microphone 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.120
 arm and engineer it myself only in 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.730
 those in the bars and coughs that played 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.950
 pizzerias and also all this question 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.960
 that the distribution and how to do 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.120
 sound and give you the net it touched me a lot 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.090
 lucky to meet with strategists of 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.300
 excellent quality and very very nice 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.430
 people human actions then new 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.300
 complain here that is super important not 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.130
 also know with whom you are going to ally 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.630
 and how to go dosing the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.760
 content 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.500
 but I think it's cool in the end 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.440
 been a good process 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.170
 fun this 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.600
 of a lot of productive learning besides 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.780
 I'm working new songs I want 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.000
 complete the boss fruit that came out in 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.910
 September 2013 I would like that 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.150
 out for September 2014 when 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.790
 when the full 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.900
 however it is a medium process too 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.120
 particular when working with a 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.209
 the delivery date because the end then 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.849
 it is not known when to stop producing 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.620
 it is difficult to define that song is already 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.599
 list if you are not going to move anything 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.239
 so then I'm working on that 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.709
 I'm going to put songs from those that 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.430
 I'm playing live that people 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.260
 have liked and that I have not recorded and 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.200
 I contemplate putting a couple more songs 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.280
 new unpublished 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.280
 this is what I 'm doing 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.610
 then the birds
