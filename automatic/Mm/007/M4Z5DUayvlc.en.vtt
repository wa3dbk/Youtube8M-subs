00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.229 
i have the black the grey and the blue
and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.309> these<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> clear

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and then on one of these is a clear

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
and then on one of these is a clear
polycarbonate<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.460> nice<00:00:53.610> thing

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
polycarbonate back and the nice thing

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.420 
polycarbonate back and the nice thing
about<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:55.110> interchangeable<00:00:55.430> so

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
about this is it's interchangeable so

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.930 
about this is it's interchangeable so
this<00:00:56.640> back<00:00:56.910> actually<00:00:57.329> pops<00:00:57.930> out<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.910> can

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.790 
this back actually pops out and you can
switch<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.449> between<00:01:00.899> any<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> three

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
switch it between any of the three

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.280 
switch it between any of the three
colors<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.969> basically<00:01:03.690> when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> use
