00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.010
 very good to all and welcome to the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 gaming news reviews i am looking and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.910
 here begins our favorite review to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.920
 the best of the week let's start 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.869
 opening mouth with microsoft that phil 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.910
 Spencer is not the typical manager of a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.349
 great multinational for its desire to be 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.970
 close to the users through the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.250
 social networks is something that we already know 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 what we did not have was with a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.910
 conciliatory facet that has caught us 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.920
 completely by surprise some 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.570
 days has appeared commenting on his taste 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.670
 by the consoles of other brands and is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.280
 which he says he learns at the same time 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.110
 enjoy playing with ps4 and willy according to 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.030
 Spencer although the competition is something 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 natural being an ultra one 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.229
 becoming anti-other is nothing 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.970
 good wise and beautiful words feel 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.890
 It seems a lie that they come from someone 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.239
 Microsoft is not for nothing is that we 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.540
 they are used to another type of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540
 attitude 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.480
 we all like the design robustness and 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.210
 comfort of the xbox one pack 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.430
 then why not use it with our 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.830
 Dearest pc as it should be because 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.479
 creators of windows if those the same 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.979
 responsible for the console itself 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.440
 they have time to get some drivers from 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.030
 a few cast or that or that we 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.760
 they want to jam a command of 60 turkeys 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.170
 for each device luckily for that 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.580
 is the mother community thanks to the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.080
 which we can do following a few 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.820
 simple steps even if it takes a 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.650
 all the little instructions 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.330
 you can find on our website as the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.090
 own dealer says it's not working 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.950
 100% but better than I tell microsoft 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.950
 stone meant a stone 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.100
 ps4 continues to be the queen of the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.870
 mountain but xbox one is you 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 approaching leaps and nothing 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.950
 stealthy according to the February data the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.600
 of sonia sold more but almost 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.370
 margin and if we concentrate on 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.020
 gains then the winner is the one of 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.210
 microsoft among other things because it follows 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.470
 costing a hundred euros more and seeing the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.119
 jump that they have stuck with the pack of 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.979
 tight and fall we would not miss anything 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.990
 that the data of this month give a turn 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.400
 in the general classification sure that 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.130
 Some of Phil now does not care so much 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.229
 that of the war of consoles mood uy 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.229
 one more effort that you can still 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.720
 we know there are many restless people 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.190
 with the issue of whether the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.780
 game that the god himself has given 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.520
 If approval is your 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.960
 developer has more faith than all 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.180
 we were waiting each time the three together 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.800
 so he has entrusted the highest and 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.570
 continues his tireless search for 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.640
 desert of the sponsors by 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.050
 volcanic abraham scholes will put us the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.430
 skin of one more in the caravan of 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.980
 prophet going through Egypt and Mesopotamia 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.930
 as in a tour of the imserso the project 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.030
 still alive and with the strength of bassinet 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.890
 open the Dead Sea will be published in pc 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.930
 mac linux xbox 360 ps3 xbox one and ps 4 a 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.930
 the poor will you do not want her or god 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.880
 the one that has been set up in australia with 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.470
 the latest changes of white sox ubisoft 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.210
 had achieved a classification for 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.760
 15 years but after the changes that 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.140
 made something like this at the last minute 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.360
 like censorship and the holy inquisition 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.460
 together in a single body has been 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.470
 scared with the sex scenes the 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.960
 simulated sexual activity or violence 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.940
 implicit sexual we go that you do not see anything 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.140
 more than what is in a dirty mind the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.970
 case is that this time the users 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.800
 Australians have been lucky and 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.230
 it has simply become a 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.490
 article for adults and thanks to not 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.770
 they are going to force him to sell the sex shops 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.480
 the sand the age the creative director 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.430
 of the game that assures us that thanks to 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.960
 the latest additions 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.150
 will provide between 35 and 40 hours of 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.070
 fun and up to 100 if we're the typical 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.110
 tired that can not finish everything at a hundred 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.580
 per hundred good duration now that the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.580
 It is fashionable that they do not arrive at 5 o'clock 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.940
 many rub their hands with the 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.769
 latest rumors about a new 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.090
 delivery of the resident evil series more 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.680
 what is likely if we consider the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.780
 survey that is being carried out by capcom 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.530
 in social networks we assume that it 's time 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.510
 so as not to throw another 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.069
 you have to throw up like those who have 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.770
 tucked bent with four of the five 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.630
 last titles but attention that according to 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.850
 is quoted out there could be converted 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.620
 an exclusive for xbox one just like 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.630
 happened a long time ago with one that came out 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.520
 only for nintendo consoles if 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.780
 finally it is confirmed we do not believe that 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.850
 go to do thank you very much the super 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.770
 fans of the saga to us the truth is 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.980
 that the total snob we have all the 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.980
 consoles 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.549
 to finish we announce that valve has 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.680
 taken one more step towards 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.060
 self-publishing or what is the same as 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.260
 the process that they do right now 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.150
 to ensure the quality of the games 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.740
 from his steam platform we finished it 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.060
 doing us for it have created 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.530
 a feature that will serve to 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.720
 inform them if we have found 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.700
 inappropriate content in your warehouse we go 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.110
 the lifelong report button that 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.060
 Sneaks wear out from so much use 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.380
 the thing is that we can communicate and 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.510
 we have found programs that incite 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.310
 to hatred of child exploitation fraud 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.470
 malware or what this week is so 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.820
 Fashion porn is no longer enough to have 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.560
 the big brother 'watching us day and 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.090
 night now they make us participate although 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.090
 for this time it's like a situations 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.370
 and we said goodbye with great sadness but 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.170
 is that we have other things more 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.400
 important to do as we vitiate 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.500
 until the retinas come off 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.420
 see you next week and while 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.210
 So do not forget to go several times to the 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.320
 day for the best web game no 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.320
 that's not ours
