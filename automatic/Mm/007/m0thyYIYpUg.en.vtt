here's<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.840> quick<00:00:01.050> demo<00:00:01.469> of<00:00:01.770> my<00:00:02.100> kitchen<00:00:02.370> LED

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
here's a quick demo of my kitchen LED

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.680 
here's a quick demo of my kitchen LED
lights<00:00:06.170> if<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.200> Tex<00:00:07.529> motion<00:00:08.389> no<00:00:09.389> on/off

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
lights if you Tex motion no on/off

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:18.470 
lights if you Tex motion no on/off
switch<00:00:11.780> it<00:00:12.780> also<00:00:12.929> has<00:00:13.200> light<00:00:13.440> detection<00:00:17.480> above

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
switch it also has light detection above

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.370 
switch it also has light detection above
and<00:00:18.779> below<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> cabinet's<00:00:20.779> LEDs<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:22.020> spaced

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
and below the cabinet's LEDs are spaced

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.800 
and below the cabinet's LEDs are spaced
every<00:00:23.160> 6<00:00:23.430> inches<00:00:23.730> apart<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:26.269> then<00:00:27.269> gives

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
every 6 inches apart and then gives

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.410 
every 6 inches apart and then gives
enough<00:00:28.080> light<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.730> illuminate<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.119> kitchen

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
enough light to illuminate the kitchen

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.359 
enough light to illuminate the kitchen
at<00:00:30.570> night<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.740> come<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.219> get<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
at night so you can come in and get a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.540 
at night so you can come in and get a
drink<00:00:32.700> or<00:00:33.860> navigate<00:00:34.860> around<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.219> kitchen

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
drink or navigate around the kitchen

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.700 
drink or navigate around the kitchen
without<00:00:35.670> having<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> worry<00:00:36.270> about<00:00:36.590> turning<00:00:37.590> on

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
without having to worry about turning on

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.940 
without having to worry about turning on
the<00:00:37.800> light<00:00:38.930> after<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.170> period<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.469> time<00:00:40.620> when<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the light after a period of time when it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.740 
the light after a period of time when it
doesn't<00:00:41.100> detect<00:00:41.430> motion<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.000> goes<00:00:42.030> off<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
doesn't detect motion it goes off and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.319 
doesn't detect motion it goes off and
then<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> move<00:00:44.100> again<00:00:44.329> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
then you just have to move again and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.770 
then you just have to move again and
it'll<00:00:45.539> come<00:00:45.690> back<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:47.090> I<00:00:48.090> designed<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it'll come back on and I designed the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
it'll come back on and I designed the
system<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
system so that it would do that

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.450 
system so that it would do that
effectively<00:00:51.449> because<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.500> did<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:52.829> want<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
effectively because I did not want to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.430 
effectively because I did not want to
have<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> worry<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:54.300> turning<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> off<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
have to worry about turning on and off a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.799 
have to worry about turning on and off a
light<00:00:55.469> switch<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:57.800> when<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> lights<00:00:59.070> come<00:00:59.280> on

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
light switch so when the lights come on

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.569 
light switch so when the lights come on
it<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> motion<00:01:01.260> detector<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.399> light

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
it has a motion detector and a light

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.859 
it has a motion detector and a light
sensor

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.620 

there's<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.280> light<00:01:07.850> sensor<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.360> motion

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
there's the light sensor and motion

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.969 
there's the light sensor and motion
detector<00:01:09.369> next<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.640> is<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.979> Arduino

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
detector next to that is the Arduino

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.450 
detector next to that is the Arduino
controller<00:01:13.640> next<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:15.009> is<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.280> power

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
controller next to that is the power

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.870 
controller next to that is the power
supply<00:01:18.190> and<00:01:19.190> then<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.549> LED<00:01:19.700> strips

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
supply and then the LED strips

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.469 
supply and then the LED strips
underneath<00:01:22.880> here<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:25.520> there's<00:01:26.000> one<00:01:26.060> every

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
underneath here and there's one every

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.770 
underneath here and there's one every
six<00:01:26.720> inches<00:01:27.729> that<00:01:28.729> are<00:01:28.850> just<00:01:29.060> hand<00:01:29.509> wired

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
six inches that are just hand wired

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.090 
six inches that are just hand wired
together<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:32.380> think<00:01:33.380> it's<00:01:33.560> kind<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.770> hard<00:01:33.920> to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
together I think it's kind of hard to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.760 
together I think it's kind of hard to
see<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.460> camera<00:01:35.530> but<00:01:36.530> they're<00:01:36.680> there<00:01:36.830> and

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
see in the camera but they're there and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.580 
see in the camera but they're there and
then<00:01:39.770> up<00:01:39.920> here<00:01:40.780> it's<00:01:41.780> hard<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.170> see<00:01:42.320> as<00:01:42.440> well

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
then up here it's hard to see as well

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.790 
then up here it's hard to see as well
which<00:01:43.160> is<00:01:43.310> by<00:01:43.820> design<00:01:44.179> there's<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.289> wire<00:01:45.530> that

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
which is by design there's a wire that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.469 
which is by design there's a wire that
goes<00:01:45.860> across<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.880> tie<00:01:47.060> him<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.929> other<00:01:48.080> cabinet

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
goes across to tie him the other cabinet

00:01:49.479 --> 00:02:02.139 
goes across to tie him the other cabinet
for<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:50.630> side<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.929> kitchen<00:02:00.970> these<00:02:01.970> are

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
for this side of the kitchen these are

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.160 
for this side of the kitchen these are
white<00:02:02.300> hat<00:02:02.569> LEDs<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.850> they<00:02:05.030> project<00:02:05.780> out

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
white hat LEDs so that they project out

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.170 
white hat LEDs so that they project out
about<00:02:06.560> 120<00:02:07.220> degree<00:02:07.520> angle<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.470> space<00:02:09.739> them

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
about 120 degree angle and I space them

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.840 
about 120 degree angle and I space them
66<00:02:11.180> inches<00:02:11.450> apart<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.950> give<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.130> nice<00:02:13.370> lighting

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
66 inches apart to give a nice lighting

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:23.709 
66 inches apart to give a nice lighting
pattern<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.329> the<00:02:14.420> wall<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.900> that's<00:02:21.079> about<00:02:21.590> it
