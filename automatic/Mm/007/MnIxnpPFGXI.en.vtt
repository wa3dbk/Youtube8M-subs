00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.400
 The action alliance Neuruppin remains had to a rally against the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 neo-Nazi march in the city called 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.980
 the subsequent demonstration train led through the city center 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.980
 Kirchplatz for a picnic instead 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.780
 we had expected that the 90s he had this intense rights scene 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.540
 Even then there was already civil commitment 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.920
 the attorney before this a little bit pushed back the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.870
 second watch it was clear we have to do something 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.490
 around noon the neo-Nazis arrived at the station 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.510
 However, the elevator was not only under loud protest of the citizens and 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.330
 Citizens but also with significantly fewer participants than announced 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.960
 even before the neo-Nazis started walking 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.250
 had a few hundred counter-demonstrators becomes a crossroads 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.250
 occupied on the route of the Nazis 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.130
 Here he meets 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.890
 Herbert Nauderer blockade by two halves is good that we made it 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.070
 have and now that's going on with 3 4 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.770
 and although no problems ran the right rhythm and therefore 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.650
 may now be accompanied by an exploitation of the police on 1 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.650
 is watching 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.740
 because of the high cost here if they have to explain to me 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.730
 Invite here No to take his own home 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 at the home-wm 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.040
 that is a possibility here 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.670
 Do not be surprised to show it out while there are still people out there 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.010
 Region gained across all strata region traveled by academics 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.290
 work unemployed I think it is a clear sign the environment 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.950
 Percent the government does not want we have them very well for years 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.940
 Our today it can happen that they no longer have their good morning 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.940
 but can tell and show enough people 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.550
 after the sitting blockade quickly grew to around 400 people, but clearly 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.089
 the Nazis would not get through today 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:49.269
 the blockade was not cleared and the neo-Nazis had to go after only a few 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.629
 turn back one hundred meters 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.080
 a kind of rounds and the interaction of organizations and all involved 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.560
 was crucial for the success of the Action Alliance 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.499
 Reported key portals to go 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.319
 and it will leave again 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.319
 and that really works 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.699
 Background of the act was really given 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.049
 that's it 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.149
 we made it 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.569
 thus to negotiate the land
