with because of the Stars they move the
Eagle<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.610> scrunch<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> word<00:01:51.240> America

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
Eagle up and scrunch the word America

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.450 
Eagle up and scrunch the word America
together<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> word<00:01:52.950> America<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
together here the word America is a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
together here the word America is a
little<00:01:53.640> further<00:01:53.850> spread<00:01:54.479> out<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.170> those<00:01:55.290> are

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
little further spread out so those are

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
little further spread out so those are
the<00:01:55.530> two<00:01:55.680> different<00:01:55.920> varieties<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.329> them

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the two different varieties I like them

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.670 
the two different varieties I like them
equally<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> think<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.219> the<00:02:00.020> variety<00:02:01.020> two<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
equally I think that the variety two is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
equally I think that the variety two is
actually<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> little<00:02:02.310> bit<00:02:02.520> better

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
actually a little bit better

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.030 
actually a little bit better
aesthetically<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.860> better

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
aesthetically because it's just better

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.300 
aesthetically because it's just better
centered<00:02:05.719> but<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.530> as<00:02:07.649> well<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
centered but I like this one as well and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
centered but I like this one as well and
of<00:02:09.060> course<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.390> all<00:02:09.509> familiar<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
of course you're all familiar with the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.750 
of course you're all familiar with the
back<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.690> Washington<00:02:12.690> Quarter

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
back of the Washington Quarter

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.339 
back of the Washington Quarter
also<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> nice-looking<00:02:15.329> bird<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:18.170> really<00:02:19.170> like

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
also a nice-looking bird I really like

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.699 
also a nice-looking bird I really like
how<00:02:19.500> American<00:02:19.950> coins<00:02:20.189> have<00:02:21.530> Eagles<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
how American coins have Eagles on the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.229 
how American coins have Eagles on the
back<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.189> that<00:02:23.250> they<00:02:23.459> don't<00:02:23.670> all<00:02:23.909> have<00:02:23.969> to<00:02:24.150> be

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
back and that they don't all have to be

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.970 
back and that they don't all have to be
the<00:02:24.390> same<00:02:24.659> eagle<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.319> think<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.829> that's

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the same eagle I think that that's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.000 
the same eagle I think that that's
really<00:02:26.280> cool<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:27.000> artist<00:02:27.329> has<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:28.469> choice

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
really cool that the artist has a choice

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.119 
really cool that the artist has a choice
on<00:02:29.430> how<00:02:29.459> they<00:02:29.939> want<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.269> Eagle<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.980> look

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
on how they want the Eagle to to look

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.440 
on how they want the Eagle to to look
whether<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:32.730> flight<00:02:33.030> whether<00:02:33.269> it's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
whether it's in flight whether it's

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.250 
whether it's in flight whether it's
perched<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:34.170> or<00:02:34.500> whatnot<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.870> all<00:02:36.870> right<00:02:37.079> so

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
perched or or whatnot but all right so

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.809 
perched or or whatnot but all right so
we'll<00:02:37.590> move<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:38.010> next<00:02:38.129> denomination

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
we'll move on to the next denomination

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.679 
we'll move on to the next denomination
in<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.000> next<00:02:39.180> video

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
in the next video

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.620 
in the next video
silver<00:02:40.230> pick<00:02:40.379> her<00:02:40.469> out
