00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.940 
score just got left to level 80 so it's
not<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.310> good<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:35.660> after<00:02:36.660> my<00:02:37.500> forming

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
not that good so after my forming

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.250 
not that good so after my forming
running<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.340> took<00:02:38.550> me<00:02:38.700> about<00:02:39.150> 1<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.810> 1/2<00:02:39.870> hour

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
running it took me about 1 and 1/2 hour

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.729 
running it took me about 1 and 1/2 hour
I<00:02:40.590> believe<00:02:40.709> maybe<00:02:41.489> two<00:02:41.670> hours<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:43.050> did<00:02:43.440> fly

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
I believe maybe two hours but I did fly

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.680 
I believe maybe two hours but I did fly
back<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.130> other<00:02:44.250> end<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.580> then<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:44.880> did<00:02:45.269> use

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
back to the other end and then I did use

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.380 
back to the other end and then I did use
the<00:02:45.720> teleport<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:47.310> portal<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:48.150> go<00:02:48.330> to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
the teleport the portal to go to

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.809 
the teleport the portal to go to
Orgrimmar<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.230> list<00:02:49.440> all<00:02:49.650> my<00:02:49.769> items<00:02:49.950> items

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
Orgrimmar and list all my items items

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.890 
Orgrimmar and list all my items items
and<00:02:52.190> after<00:02:53.190> 12<00:02:53.550> hours<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.120> checked<00:02:54.390> my<00:02:54.510> mail<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
and after 12 hours I checked my mail and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.660 
and after 12 hours I checked my mail and
I<00:02:54.989> have<00:02:55.680> made<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> profit<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.670> about<00:02:57.410> 5<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.920> 6<00:02:59.160> K

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
I have made a profit of about 5 to 6 K

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.140 
I have made a profit of about 5 to 6 K
and<00:03:00.360> that's<00:03:00.780> 5<00:03:00.989> 6<00:03:01.260> K<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.799> well<00:03:02.579> about<00:03:02.790> one<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.090> a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and that's 5 6 K in well about one and a

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.319 
and that's 5 6 K in well about one and a
half<00:03:03.180> hour<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.900> think<00:03:04.110> that's<00:03:04.470> not<00:03:04.620> too<00:03:05.070> bad

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
half hour and I think that's not too bad

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.660 
half hour and I think that's not too bad
so<00:03:06.329> it's<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.660> very<00:03:07.079> good<00:03:07.260> way<00:03:07.440> if<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.040> are<00:03:08.400> just

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
so it's a very good way if you are just

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.630 
so it's a very good way if you are just
gotten<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.510> level<00:03:09.630> 80<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.680> make<00:03:10.860> very<00:03:11.459> much

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.110
