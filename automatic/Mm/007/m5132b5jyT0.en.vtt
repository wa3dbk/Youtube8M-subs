little<00:01:38.880> bit<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.360> I've<00:01:39.659> never<00:01:39.869> had<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> problem

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
little bit so I've never had the problem

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.740 
little bit so I've never had the problem
but<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.860> might<00:01:41.009> slow<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.280> down<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.689> know

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
but it might slow you down I don't know

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.030 
but it might slow you down I don't know
else<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.170> suggest<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.740> i<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:43.890> know

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
but like I said what I've seen it seems

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.820 
but like I said what I've seen it seems
to<00:02:12.629> be<00:02:12.720> pretty<00:02:12.959> fixed<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.590> I

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830

honest<00:02:55.290> because<00:02:55.380> I've<00:02:55.560> never<00:02:55.709> had<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
honest because I've never had the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.510 
honest because I've never had the
problem<00:02:56.180> um<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.230> Chris<00:02:58.470> 2000<00:02:59.100> are<00:02:59.250> since

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
problem um just a Chris 2000 are since

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.420 
problem um just a Chris 2000 are since
you<00:02:59.610> will<00:02:59.700> be<00:02:59.850> doing<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.120> tip<00:03:00.300> videos<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:01.500> could

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
you will be doing the tip videos I could

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.220 
you will be doing the tip videos I could
do<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.790> thought<00:03:03.090> process<00:03:03.300> video<00:03:03.810> where<00:03:04.200> I

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
do like a thought process video where I

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.720 
do like a thought process video where I
make<00:03:04.380> mistakes<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.920> explain<00:03:05.190> why<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
make mistakes and I explain why I and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.910 
make mistakes and I explain why I and
when<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:05.910> went<00:03:06.180> wrong<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:07.380> am<00:03:07.530> thinking

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
when I went wrong and I am thinking

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.020 
when I went wrong and I am thinking
about<00:03:07.980> doing<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.520> have<00:03:08.700> been<00:03:08.850> thinking

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
about doing that I have been thinking

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.840 
about doing that I have been thinking
about<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.390> for<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.630> long<00:03:09.750> long<00:03:09.900> time<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.850> I'm

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
about it for a long long time and I'm

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.010 
about it for a long long time and I'm
just<00:03:12.120> trying<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.300> figure<00:03:12.450> out<00:03:12.540> our<00:03:12.600> best<00:03:12.780> way

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
just trying to figure out our best way

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.110 
just trying to figure out our best way
to<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.530> because<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.580> quite<00:03:14.730> hard<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.970> do

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
to do it because it's quite hard to do

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.310 
to do it because it's quite hard to do
at<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.300> moment<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.930> can't<00:03:16.110> go<00:03:16.230> to

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
at the moment because of you can't go to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.110 
at the moment because of you can't go to
match<00:03:16.470> highlights<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.950> clubs<00:03:17.220> meaning<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
match highlights in clubs meaning I

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.390 
match highlights in clubs meaning I
can't<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.570> pause<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.050> rewind<00:03:19.260> kind<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:19.980> like

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
can't like pause it rewind kind of like

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.670 
can't like pause it rewind kind of like
slow<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.790> down<00:03:21.080> so<00:03:22.080> I'm<00:03:22.140> not<00:03:22.290> too<00:03:22.410> sure<00:03:22.560> I'm

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
slow it down so I'm not too sure I'm

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.750 
slow it down so I'm not too sure I'm
trying<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.890> figure<00:03:22.980> out<00:03:23.100> how<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.340> do<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.730> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
trying to figure out how to do it and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.670 
trying to figure out how to do it and
I'll<00:03:24.120> probably<00:03:24.239> come<00:03:24.420> up<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.570> solution<00:03:25.080> and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
I'll probably come up a solution and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.320 
I'll probably come up a solution and
hopefully<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.160> guys<00:03:26.340> will<00:03:26.640> enjoy<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:27.180> when<00:03:27.269> I

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
tell me how in the next video um I'm

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.880 
tell me how in the next video um I'm
just<00:03:42.180> trying<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.959> think<00:03:43.110> really<00:03:43.350> depends

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
just trying to think really depends

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.490 
just trying to think really depends
where<00:03:44.310> about<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.820> long<00:03:44.970> shot<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.330> placed<00:03:45.630> if

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
where about the long shot is placed if

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.440 
where about the long shot is placed if
you're<00:03:46.950> not<00:03:47.010> positioned<00:03:47.459> right<00:03:47.700> then

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
you're not positioned right then

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.910 
you're not positioned right then
obviously<00:03:49.050> that's<00:03:49.500> going<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.680> be<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> big

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
obviously that's going to be a big

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.410 
obviously that's going to be a big
factor<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.370> where<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.700> can<00:03:50.850> save<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:52.130> maybe

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
factor in where you can save it maybe

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.300 
factor in where you can save it maybe
it's<00:03:54.420> just<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.720> shots<00:03:55.350> too<00:03:55.560> good<00:03:55.830> maybe<00:03:56.040> if

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
it's just a shots too good maybe if

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.800 
it's just a shots too good maybe if
you're<00:03:56.489> but<00:03:56.700> if<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:56.910> do<00:03:57.000> not<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.660> high

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
you're but if you do not like a high

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.870 
you're but if you do not like a high
rated<00:03:58.140> goalie<00:03:58.320> your<00:03:59.040> positioning<00:03:59.519> might<00:03:59.730> not

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
rated goalie your positioning might not

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.640 
rated goalie your positioning might not
be<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.300> full<00:04:00.540> ability<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.410> could<00:04:01.620> be

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
be to the full ability that it could be

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.759 
be to the full ability that it could be
um<00:04:02.690> I'm<00:04:03.690> just<00:04:03.930> trying<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.200> think<00:04:04.260> are<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.620> are

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
um I'm just trying to think are you are

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.259 
um I'm just trying to think are you are
you<00:04:04.890> accidentally<00:04:05.459> diving<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> wrong<00:04:06.090> way

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
you accidentally diving the wrong way

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.610 
you accidentally diving the wrong way
and<00:04:06.390> then<00:04:06.510> by<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.660> time<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:07.080> actually<00:04:07.170> go<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
and then by the time it actually go the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.100 
and then by the time it actually go the
right<00:04:07.680> way<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.980> can't<00:04:08.340> buy<00:04:09.060> adjust<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.959> I'm

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
right way you can't buy adjust it I'm

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.870 
right way you can't buy adjust it I'm
not<00:04:10.260> too<00:04:10.380> sure<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.830> don't<00:04:11.130> have<00:04:11.670> many

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
not too sure but I don't have many

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.060 
not too sure but I don't have many
problems<00:04:12.120> with<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.620> long<00:04:13.620> shots<00:04:13.890> is

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
problems with that long shots is

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.130 
problems with that long shots is
something<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.580> just<00:04:14.760> really<00:04:15.030> practiced<00:04:15.510> it's

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
something is just really practiced it's

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.440 
something is just really practiced it's
not<00:04:16.260> really<00:04:16.380> much<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:16.859> do<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:18.180> basically

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
not really much you can do so basically

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.060 
not really much you can do so basically
one<00:04:18.600> was<00:04:18.750> going<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:18.959> say<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.109> keep<00:04:19.560> practicing

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
one was going to say to keep practicing

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.270 
one was going to say to keep practicing
and<00:04:21.020> hopefully<00:04:22.020> it<00:04:22.109> goes<00:04:22.229> well<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:22.860> let<00:04:23.220> me

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
and hopefully it goes well and let me
