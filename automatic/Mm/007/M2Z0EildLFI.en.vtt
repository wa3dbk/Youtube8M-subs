00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
it the angular brush does it but not as

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
it the angular brush does it but not as
much<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:45.289> if<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.160> what<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> like

much and if you you know what I like
about<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.230> uh<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:50.789> angular<00:00:51.239> brush

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
about it is that uh the angular brush

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.560 
about it is that uh the angular brush
gives<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.969> said<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.360> dry

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
gives you that like I said that dry

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.380 
gives you that like I said that dry
brush<00:00:54.930> feeling<00:00:55.350> you're<00:00:55.500> actually<00:00:55.920> dragging

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
brush feeling you're actually dragging

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.280

the<00:00:57.390> color<00:00:57.809> over<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.780> surface<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:03.080> enjoy<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the color over the surface so I enjoy it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.520 
the color over the surface so I enjoy it
it's<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.799> easier<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> control<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:07.290> build

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it's it's easier to control and to build

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.490 
it's it's easier to control and to build
up<00:01:07.740> especially<00:01:08.490> when<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.850> use<00:01:09.030> layers<00:01:09.570> this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
up especially when you use layers this

two<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.229> palette<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> I'm<00:01:17.250> using<00:01:17.330> just

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
two on the palette and I'm using just

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
two on the palette and I'm using just
the<00:01:18.630> brushes<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.770> palette<00:01:20.189> with

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the brushes that are on the palette with

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
the brushes that are on the palette with
the<00:01:21.930> preset<00:01:22.439> side<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> actually

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the preset side this one I actually

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.460 
the preset side this one I actually
changed<00:01:24.210> some<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> presets<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
changed some of the presets so that I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.060 
changed some of the presets so that I
can<00:01:25.680> use<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.250> an<00:01:26.369> ink<00:01:26.580> brush<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.890> other

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
can use it as an ink brush but the other

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.069 
can use it as an ink brush but the other
brushes<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.909> changing<00:01:30.329> any<00:01:30.479> new<00:01:30.630> presets

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

brushes I'm not changing any new presets
I'm<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.439> using<00:01:31.680> what<00:01:32.490> comes<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
I'm just using what comes with the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.640 
I'm just using what comes with the
program<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.180> another<00:01:36.180> video<00:01:37.110> I'll<00:01:37.320> probably

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
program and another video I'll probably

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.520 
program and another video I'll probably
show<00:01:38.040> how<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.240> make<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:40.020> own<00:01:40.200> brushes

things from it but what I'm gonna do is
just<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.810> show<00:02:34.080> how<00:02:35.150> using<00:02:36.150> these<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:37.020> support

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
just to show how using these to support

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.980 
just to show how using these to support
this<00:02:37.650> particular<00:02:37.920> brush<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:39.360> can<00:02:39.540> actually

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
this particular brush you can actually

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.090 
this particular brush you can actually
make<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.500> look<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:41.760> an<00:02:42.240> oil<00:02:42.600> painting<00:02:42.960> or<00:02:43.320> I

liked painting something not as as clean
and<00:02:50.370> smooth<00:02:50.670> as<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.180> been<00:02:51.510> airbrushed<00:02:52.050> like

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
and smooth as it's been airbrushed like

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.590 
and smooth as it's been airbrushed like
a<00:02:52.500> lot<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.070> digital<00:02:53.400> paintings<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.480> to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
a lot of digital paintings I like it to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780 
a lot of digital paintings I like it to
look<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:54.810> an<00:02:55.110> oil<00:02:55.350> painting<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.770> like<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
look like an oil painting I like the

look like an oil painting I like the
strokes<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.630> show<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.740> look<00:02:58.890> kind<00:02:59.160> of

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
strokes to show for it to look kind of

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.870 
strokes to show for it to look kind of
course<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.910> look<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.870> don't<00:03:04.880> hate

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
course so that it can look I don't hate

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.880 
course so that it can look I don't hate
to<00:03:06.060> use<00:03:06.240> terms<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.690> impressionistic<00:03:07.470> or

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
to use terms like impressionistic or

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.530 
to use terms like impressionistic or
things<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.700> because<00:03:09.030> that's<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.360> what

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
I'm trying to do I'm just trying to be

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.780 
I'm trying to do I'm just trying to be
the<00:03:12.710> best<00:03:13.710> me<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:15.560> but<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:17.070> like

the best me that I can but I like

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.860 
the best me that I can but I like
showing<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.890> an<00:03:20.250> artist<00:03:21.060> has<00:03:21.270> been<00:03:21.300> here

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
showing that an artist has been here

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.740 
showing that an artist has been here
that<00:03:22.620> an<00:03:22.920> artist<00:03:23.310> placed<00:03:23.640> these<00:03:23.880> strokes<00:03:24.240> that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
that an artist placed these strokes that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.900 
that an artist placed these strokes that
it's<00:03:25.380> not<00:03:25.650> smooth<00:03:26.100> out<00:03:27.170> trying<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.350> look<00:03:28.910> just

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
it's not smooth out trying to look just

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:39.400 
it's not smooth out trying to look just
too<00:03:30.180> clean<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.810> too<00:03:30.870> airbrushed

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.510 

I<00:03:39.730> put<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.380> initial<00:03:42.800> background<00:03:43.010> layer

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
I put just the initial background layer

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.810 
I put just the initial background layer
on<00:03:43.700> a<00:03:43.790> separate<00:03:44.590> layer<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.890> then<00:03:46.040> start

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
on a separate layer and then start

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.810 
on a separate layer and then start
painting<00:03:47.660> on<00:03:47.900> top<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.770> what<00:03:49.400> I'll<00:03:49.520> do

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
painting on top of it and what I'll do

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.420 
painting on top of it and what I'll do
is<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.090> I'll<00:03:50.390> keep<00:03:50.720> creating<00:03:51.290> layers<00:03:51.530> then

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
is that I'll keep creating layers then

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.580 
is that I'll keep creating layers then
most<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.210> time<00:03:53.360> I'm<00:03:53.630> just<00:03:53.870> merging<00:03:54.440> them

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
most of the time I'm just merging them

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.040 
most of the time I'm just merging them
down<00:03:54.800> after<00:03:55.070> I'm<00:03:55.340> finished<00:03:55.790> with<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:56.050> either

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
down after I'm finished with it either

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.860 
down after I'm finished with it either
like<00:03:57.830> this<00:03:58.070> one<00:03:58.340> I<00:03:58.610> kind<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.270> leave<00:03:59.570> the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
like this one I kind of leave the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.920 
like this one I kind of leave the
opacity<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.500> where<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:02.090> I'll<00:04:02.600> just

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
opacity of where it is and I'll just

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.650 
opacity of where it is and I'll just
keep<00:04:03.710> adding<00:04:04.040> stuff<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:08.000> then<00:04:08.510> I'll

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
keep adding stuff to it and then I'll

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:16.090 
keep adding stuff to it and then I'll
move<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.110> down<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:15.230> other<00:04:15.440> layers<00:04:15.770> like

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
move it down and in other layers like

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.260 
move it down and in other layers like
this<00:04:16.400> one<00:04:16.700> what<00:04:17.540> I'll<00:04:17.720> do<00:04:18.049> is<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.380> I'll

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
this one what I'll do is that I'll

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.600 
this one what I'll do is that I'll
decrease<00:04:20.270> the<00:04:20.480> opacity<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:21.350> so<00:04:21.980> it<00:04:22.130> will<00:04:22.280> feel

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
decrease the opacity and so it will feel

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.360 
decrease the opacity and so it will feel
like<00:04:22.670> your<00:04:23.090> your<00:04:23.360> glazing<00:04:24.080> color<00:04:24.440> over

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
like your your glazing color over

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.300 
like your your glazing color over
another<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.760> this<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.300> good<00:04:26.630> when<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:28.190> know

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
another and this is good when you know

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.980 
another and this is good when you know
if<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:29.090> painting<00:04:29.540> is<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.500> either<00:04:31.400> too<00:04:31.790> warm<00:04:32.210> too

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
if the painting is a either too warm too

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.690 
if the painting is a either too warm too
much<00:04:33.200> into<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.650> red<00:04:33.890> or<00:04:34.100> something<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.490> want

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
much into the red or something you want

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.180 
much into the red or something you want
to<00:04:34.790> introduce<00:04:35.000> some<00:04:35.420> blues<00:04:35.720> or<00:04:36.140> some<00:04:36.860> greens

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
to introduce some blues or some greens

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.520 
to introduce some blues or some greens
or<00:04:37.490> some<00:04:37.730> cooler<00:04:37.970> colors<00:04:38.510> or<00:04:38.810> whatever<00:04:39.170> or

or some cooler colors or whatever or
just<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.980> glaze<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.240> color<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.810> make<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.410> change

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
just a glaze the color to make a change

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.010 
just a glaze the color to make a change
in<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.510> you<00:04:44.510> know<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:45.050> this<00:04:45.830> one<00:04:46.070> I'm<00:04:46.250> just

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
in it you know and this one I'm just

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.990 
in it you know and this one I'm just
adding<00:04:48.020> another<00:04:48.770> layer<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.370> paint<00:04:49.610> it<00:04:49.760> to<00:04:49.910> the
