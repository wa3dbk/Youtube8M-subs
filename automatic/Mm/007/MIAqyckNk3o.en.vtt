00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
especially if your vision is getting a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.450 
especially if your vision is getting a
little<00:00:10.769> bit<00:00:10.950> fuzzy<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.550> mine<00:00:12.049> I<00:00:13.250> used<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.340> use

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
little bit fuzzy like mine I used to use

anymore

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.700 
anymore
primary<00:00:18.270> reason<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.690> they<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.020> generate<00:00:19.410> some

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
primary reason is they can generate some

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.330 
primary reason is they can generate some
heat<00:00:20.510> especially<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.080> top<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.100> lamp

like<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.609> one<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:24.930> shavings<00:00:25.470> up<00:00:25.619> there

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
like this one you get shavings up there

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.040 
like this one you get shavings up there
and<00:00:26.160> shavings<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.910> go<00:00:27.090> everywhere<00:00:27.810> when

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and shavings do go everywhere when

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.540 
and shavings do go everywhere when
you're<00:00:28.170> turning<00:00:28.500> they<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.769> start<00:00:28.980> smoldering

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
you're turning they can start smoldering

some of the scratches you've left behind
and<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.500> couldn't<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.920> inside<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> shop<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and you couldn't see inside the shop and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030 
and you couldn't see inside the shop and
the<00:01:21.689> idea<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.110> these<00:01:22.229> lights<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:22.890> give

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the idea with these lights is they give

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.640 
the idea with these lights is they give
you<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.460> natural<00:01:23.520> spectrum<00:01:24.650> basically

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you more of a natural spectrum basically

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
you more of a natural spectrum basically
what<00:01:25.770> our<00:01:25.890> eyes<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.400> evolved<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.090> best

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
what our eyes have evolved to see best

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.350 
what our eyes have evolved to see best
in<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.310> allows<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.060> more

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
in and so it just allows you to see more

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.850 
in and so it just allows you to see more
the<00:01:30.509> detail<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> fine<00:01:31.290> little<00:01:31.530> stuff<00:01:31.770> like

the detail the fine little stuff like
those<00:01:32.159> scratches<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
those scratches so you don't have to

those scratches so you don't have to
take<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> bowl<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> start<00:01:34.890> sanding

take the bowl back in and start sanding

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.980 
take the bowl back in and start sanding

little<00:01:39.479> lamps<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> two-foot<00:01:41.009> elbow

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
little lamps on about a two-foot elbow

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.420 
little lamps on about a two-foot elbow
or<00:01:42.299> Bend<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.979> maneuver<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
or Bend I like it you can maneuver it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.670 
or Bend I like it you can maneuver it
into<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:45.030> any<00:01:45.479> position<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
into just about any position that you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.670 
into just about any position that you
want<00:01:47.540> works<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> lot<00:01:48.750> better<00:01:48.810> than<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> elbow

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
want works a lot better than the elbow

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.520 
want works a lot better than the elbow
lamps<00:01:50.390> if<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.750> friends<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.290> your

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
lamps if you are friends with your

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.289 
lamps if you are friends with your
dentist<00:01:52.950> or<00:01:53.100> some<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> doctors<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:54.119> have

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
dentist or some of the doctors they have

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.030 
dentist or some of the doctors they have
these<00:01:54.450> real<00:01:54.689> fancy<00:01:55.140> things<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
these real fancy things that go on the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.740 
these real fancy things that go on the
wall<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.909> moved<00:01:57.090> into<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.659> about

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
wall they can be moved into just about

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
wall they can be moved into just about
any<00:01:58.079> position<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.920> they'll<00:01:59.189> stay<00:01:59.490> there<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
any position and they'll stay there and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
any position and they'll stay there and
again<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.110> those<00:02:01.439> lights<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.860> pretty

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
again I think those lights are pretty

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.179 
again I think those lights are pretty
much<00:02:02.250> into<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> natural<00:02:02.790> spectrums<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
much into the natural spectrums I

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.319 
much into the natural spectrums I
usually<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.670> light<00:02:05.909> shining

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
usually like to have one light shining

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.940 
usually like to have one light shining
on<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.450> back<00:02:06.719> side<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.350> top<00:02:07.469> and

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
on the back side or on the top and

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.680 
on the back side or on the top and
another<00:02:08.160> light<00:02:08.459> shining<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.420> side

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
another light shining on to this side

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.240 
another light shining on to this side
which<00:02:10.080> basically<00:02:10.349> covers<00:02:10.739> every<00:02:11.039> direction

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
which basically covers every direction

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.170 
which basically covers every direction
which<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.819> will

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
which I will

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.080 
which I will
turning<00:02:12.450> from<00:02:12.829> I<00:02:13.829> do<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.549> floor<00:02:14.879> lamp

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
turning from I do have a floor lamp

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.240 
turning from I do have a floor lamp
which<00:02:15.329> I<00:02:15.450> use<00:02:15.629> also<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.769> does<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.219> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
which I use also so this does have a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.910 
which I use also so this does have a
magnetic<00:02:17.760> base<00:02:18.170> makes<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.319> easy<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.650> place

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
magnetic base makes it easy to place

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.339 
magnetic base makes it easy to place
anywhere<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.549> want<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.260> for<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
anywhere you want to and for the

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.349 
anywhere you want to and for the
inevitable<00:02:22.620> times<00:02:23.219> when<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:23.609> drop<00:02:23.879> something

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
inevitable times when you drop something

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.300 
inevitable times when you drop something
small<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.959> metallic<00:02:25.469> into<00:02:25.859> your<00:02:26.010> wood

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
small and metallic into your wood

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
small and metallic into your wood
shavings<00:02:26.790> which<00:02:26.939> are<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.329> floor<00:02:27.569> like

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
shavings which are on the floor like

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.420 
shavings which are on the floor like
Allen<00:02:28.290> wrenches<00:02:28.879> nuts<00:02:29.879> bolts<00:02:30.239> screws<00:02:31.370> even<00:02:32.370> an

Allen wrenches nuts bolts screws even an
occasional<00:02:32.700> gouge<00:02:33.269> or<00:02:33.599> scraper<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:34.980> use

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
occasional gouge or scraper you can use

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.009 
occasional gouge or scraper you can use
this<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.579> find<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:36.090> fish<00:02:36.389> forward<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
this to find it fish forward and the

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.780 
this to find it fish forward and the
shavings<00:02:37.469> rather<00:02:37.769> than<00:02:38.010> having<00:02:38.219> to<00:02:38.519> sift

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
shavings rather than having to sift

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.309 
shavings rather than having to sift
through<00:02:38.879> it<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.689> course<00:02:39.719> if<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.109> have<00:02:40.230> to

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
through it and of course if you have to

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.300 
through it and of course if you have to
sift<00:02:40.500> through<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.739> you're<00:02:40.920> never<00:02:41.099> going<00:02:41.280> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
sift through it you're never going to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.849 
sift through it you're never going to
find<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.760> anyway<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.989> very<00:02:43.290> valuable<00:02:43.650> tool

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
find it anyway but a very valuable tool

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.979 
find it anyway but a very valuable tool
to<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.459> shop<00:02:44.639> so<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.389> is<00:02:45.569> my<00:02:45.720> floor

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
to have in the shop so this is my floor

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.580 
to have in the shop so this is my floor
lamp<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.769> position<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.370> anywhere<00:02:48.409> it<00:02:49.409> does

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
lamp I can position it anywhere it does

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.190 
lamp I can position it anywhere it does
have<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.799> bendable<00:02:50.220> top<00:02:50.579> here<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.870> can

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
have a bendable top here and you can

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.089 
have a bendable top here and you can
adjust<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:54.299> puts<00:02:54.569> out<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.989> lot<00:02:55.079> of<00:02:55.620> light<00:02:55.859> and

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
adjust it it puts out a lot of light and

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.949 
adjust it it puts out a lot of light and
again<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.609> natural<00:02:57.180> spectrum<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:57.900> you

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
again it's that natural spectrum so you

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.420 
again it's that natural spectrum so you
can<00:02:58.109> see<00:02:58.230> lots<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.530> details<00:02:58.950> as<00:02:59.159> your<00:02:59.280> not

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
can see lots of details as your not

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.220 
can see lots of details as your not
going<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.609> see<00:02:59.669> with<00:02:59.939> standard<00:03:00.359> lighting<00:03:00.599> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
going to see with standard lighting and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.649 
going to see with standard lighting and
unlike<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.189> regular<00:03:02.669> fluorescent<00:03:03.060> bulbs

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
unlike the regular fluorescent bulbs

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.929 
unlike the regular fluorescent bulbs
they<00:03:03.780> don't<00:03:03.989> flicker<00:03:04.319> they<00:03:04.590> don't<00:03:04.799> strobe<00:03:05.250> I

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
they don't flicker they don't strobe I

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.420 
they don't flicker they don't strobe I
found<00:03:06.719> them<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.900> be<00:03:06.959> very<00:03:07.379> easy<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:08.069> my<00:03:08.250> eyes

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
found them to be very easy on my eyes

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.459 
found them to be very easy on my eyes
and<00:03:08.969> if<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.150> live<00:03:09.359> in<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.569> damp<00:03:09.810> place<00:03:10.079> like<00:03:10.319> the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
and if you live in a damp place like the

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.050 
and if you live in a damp place like the
northwest<00:03:10.919> here<00:03:11.099> where<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:11.489> gray<00:03:11.760> all<00:03:11.939> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
northwest here where it's gray all the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.670 
northwest here where it's gray all the
time<00:03:12.269> they're<00:03:12.480> also<00:03:12.599> kind<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:13.049> therapy<00:03:13.469> lamp

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
time they're also kind of a therapy lamp

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.720 
time they're also kind of a therapy lamp
so<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.889> get<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> little<00:03:14.129> bit<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.370> sunlight

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
so you get a little bit of sunlight

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.150 
so you get a little bit of sunlight
during<00:03:14.939> the<00:03:15.060> day
