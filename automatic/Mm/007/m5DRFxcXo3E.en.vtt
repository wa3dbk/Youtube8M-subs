00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
resolutions and I knew this some things

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.880 
resolutions and I knew this some things
to<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> next<00:00:20.609> year<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.439> I<00:00:22.439> come<00:00:22.769> up
