till<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:26.310> all<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:27.029> solve<00:00:27.330> Mass<00:00:27.900> Effect<00:00:27.930> 3<00:00:28.380> was

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
till now all we solve Mass Effect 3 was

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.950 
till now all we solve Mass Effect 3 was
action<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.300> battles<00:00:30.840> are

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
action and how the the battles are

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.729 
action and how the the battles are
working<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.099> role<00:00:32.669> playing<00:00:32.969> game

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
working what about the role playing game

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
working what about the role playing game
well<00:00:34.739> that's<00:00:35.280> actually<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> focus<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.059> us<00:00:36.120> on

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
well that's actually a focus for us on

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.540 
well that's actually a focus for us on
mass<00:00:36.510> effect<00:00:36.750> 3<00:00:36.989> we've<00:00:37.469> deep<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> RPG

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
mass effect 3 we've deep in the RPG

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
mass effect 3 we've deep in the RPG
elements<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> number<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.329> ways<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
elements in a number of ways so the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.110 
elements in a number of ways so the
first<00:00:41.100> thing<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.550> want<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
first thing that we want to do is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.850 
first thing that we want to do is
basically<00:00:42.390> add<00:00:42.840> more<00:00:43.290> options<00:00:43.770> for

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
basically add more options for

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.979 
basically add more options for
customizations<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.910> powers<00:00:45.329> within<00:00:45.750> each

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
customizations of powers within each

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
customizations of powers within each
power<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.800> within<00:00:46.950> each<00:00:47.129> power<00:00:47.340> there's<00:00:47.579> now

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
power so within each power there's now

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850 
power so within each power there's now
six<00:00:48.149> ways<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.170> evolve<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
six ways in which you can evolve the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.010 
six ways in which you can evolve the
power<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.700> no<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:51.000> shepherds<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.780> same

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
power so no two shepherds of the same

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
power so no two shepherds of the same
class<00:00:52.320> are<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.800> alike<00:00:53.070> we've<00:00:53.850> also

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
class are going to be alike we've also

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
class are going to be alike we've also
added<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.660> rich<00:00:54.989> level<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.620> customization<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
added a rich level of customization to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
added a rich level of customization to
the<00:00:56.699> weapon<00:00:57.030> system<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:58.140> put

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the weapon system so you can now put

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.369 
the weapon system so you can now put
your<00:00:58.379> weapons<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.250> bench<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.379> select

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
your weapons on a bench and select

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
your weapons on a bench and select
different<00:01:01.500> modifications<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.730> each<00:01:03.030> weapon

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
different modifications for each weapon

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.210 
different modifications for each weapon
so<00:01:03.719> each<00:01:03.840> weapon<00:01:04.019> will<00:01:04.260> behave<00:01:04.799> differently

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so each weapon will behave differently

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.580 
so each weapon will behave differently
depending<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.640> how<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> modify<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.409> so<00:01:07.409> why

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
depending on how you modify it so why

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.710 
depending on how you modify it so why
you<00:01:07.650> don't<00:01:08.040> show<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.340> cool<00:01:08.790> system<00:01:09.180> well

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
you don't show that cool system well

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.980 
you don't show that cool system well
well<00:01:09.930> show<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.860> part<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> demo<00:01:12.510> here
