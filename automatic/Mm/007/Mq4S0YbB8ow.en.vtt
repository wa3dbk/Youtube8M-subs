00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.299
 Hi, I'm away, it 's charging and you're in my 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.150
 house that is your house and today I'm going to 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.129
 teach how he organized 1011 for 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.519
 take him to work and not walk 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.550
 eating terrible things on the street 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.550
 here I have prepared a delicious 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550
 Salmon 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.550
 with a little shredded meat and 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.489
 so what I'm going to do is serve the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.739
 portion that I'm going to eat I'll 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.980
 I recommend one of the things that most 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.980
 trouble is knowing vide 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.920
 how much amount you should put 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.809
 all you have to do is put the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.300
 jelly on the plate in which normally 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.250
 it's the comedies and that's going to 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.890
 let you know if it's a portion 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.130
 adequate 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.780
 in the case of the service I'm not going to 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.270
 put the vinaigrette more and it will not be 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.810
 for making all the lettuce 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.680
 and I have it 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.190
 To place 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.190
 will be 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.990
 I already have my soup cold 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.990
 but because it is cold 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.390
 is 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.030
 today's food is what we eat 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.140
 tomorrow so that it is cold and not 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.920
 introduce food here 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.920
 because it's nothing 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.380
 meat with lettuce and then remember that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.440
 is to eat populations I have with some 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.050
 delicious girls for noon not me 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.420
 I carry them in these bags that are very 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.640
 practical and very comfortable and especially the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.380
 I can wash again and do not occupy a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.219
 place 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.860
 let's see if you walk at noon and 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.509
 some delicious to the girls of payment that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.509
 it's protein for the layer 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.380
 here I have the vinaigrette nothing more 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.150

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.540

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.540

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.209
 warm up we can put some toast 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:39.319
 here 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:42.640
 and obvious so they can eat then 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.950
 closing our night 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.460

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.030

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.030
