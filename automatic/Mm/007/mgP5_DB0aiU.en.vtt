one is Prague's i that's what we have
here<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:40.660> these<00:00:40.720> are<00:00:40.780> quite<00:00:41.020> a<00:00:41.079> bit<00:00:41.140> smaller

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440

than the Burmese pythons that we are
used<00:00:45.969> to<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.800> I<00:00:48.160> am<00:00:48.550> going<00:00:48.879> to<00:00:49.059> take<00:00:49.270> their

used to now I am going to take their
take<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.590> eggs<00:00:50.739> away<00:00:50.920> here<00:00:51.399> start<00:00:52.239> over<00:00:52.420> here

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
take the eggs away here start over here

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.220 
take the eggs away here start over here
and<00:00:54.300> now<00:00:55.300> while<00:00:55.510> they're<00:00:55.660> perfectly<00:00:55.989> capable

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
and now while they're perfectly capable

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.709 
and now while they're perfectly capable
of<00:00:56.680> incubating<00:00:57.579> their<00:00:57.789> own<00:00:57.910> eggs<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.480> in<00:00:58.629> the

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
wild of course they all do that in

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.810 
wild of course they all do that in
captivity<00:01:02.230> most<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.829> time<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.039> like<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.399> do<00:01:03.670> it

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
captivity most the time I like to do it

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.880 
captivity most the time I like to do it
I<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.719> to<00:01:04.750> take<00:01:04.989> care<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.259> that<00:01:05.409> process

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
I like to take care of that process

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.730 
I like to take care of that process
myself<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.779> see<00:01:07.990> those<00:01:08.170> are<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.709> a

nice<00:01:09.009> nice<00:01:09.579> clutch<00:01:09.909> of<00:01:10.119> eggs<00:01:10.659> there<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.529> looks

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
nice nice clutch of eggs there it looks

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.090 
nice nice clutch of eggs there it looks
like<00:01:11.829> we've<00:01:12.009> got<00:01:12.039> I<00:01:12.779> don't<00:01:13.779> know<00:01:13.950> we'll<00:01:14.950> call

we're making life that we get and ready
for<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.969> this<00:01:22.270> purpose<00:01:22.749> and<00:01:23.560> then<00:01:23.889> I<00:01:24.359> can<00:01:25.359> keep

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
for the this purpose and then I can keep

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.629 
for the this purpose and then I can keep
this<00:01:25.599> one<00:01:25.659> from<00:01:25.929> biting<00:01:26.139> me<00:01:29.249> we'll<00:01:30.249> take<00:01:30.399> her

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:30.639 
this one from biting me we'll take her

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:34.169 
this one from biting me we'll take her
eggs<00:01:31.859> you<00:01:32.859> can<00:01:32.979> see<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.249> pattern<00:01:33.579> on<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:33.880> and

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
eggs you can see the pattern on this and

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.449 
eggs you can see the pattern on this and
these<00:01:34.299> are<00:01:34.359> a<00:01:34.509> little<00:01:34.630> different<00:01:34.749> than<00:01:35.169> the

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
these are a little different than the

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:44.190 
these are a little different than the
then<00:01:36.459> divot<00:01:37.209> ATIS<00:01:37.509> Vivat<00:01:37.840> itis<00:01:38.169> and<00:01:38.729> i'm

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.220 

right<00:01:45.200> here<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.820> have<00:01:47.060> brought<00:01:47.890> over<00:01:48.890> a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.920 

just<00:01:54.230> a<00:01:54.380> there<00:01:54.640> this<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:56.390> is<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.600> pivot

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
just a there this is this is a pivot

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
just a there this is this is a pivot
ATIS<00:01:57.200> libertate<00:01:57.680> o<00:01:57.710> seg<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.220> can<00:01:58.370> see<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
ATIS libertate o seg and you can see the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.730 
ATIS libertate o seg and you can see the
difference<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.070> size<00:02:01.280> there<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.870> it<00:02:03.530> seems

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
difference in size there it is it seems

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.560 
difference in size there it is it seems
to<00:02:03.830> me<00:02:03.980> always<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.670> smaller<00:02:04.970> snakes<00:02:05.330> lay

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
to me always that smaller snakes lay

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.360 
to me always that smaller snakes lay
more<00:02:05.870> elongated<00:02:06.140> eggs<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.860> bigger<00:02:07.040> snakes

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
more elongated eggs and bigger snakes

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.040 
more elongated eggs and bigger snakes
are<00:02:07.610> more<00:02:08.000> likely<00:02:08.180> to<00:02:08.330> lay<00:02:08.600> an<00:02:08.720> egg<00:02:08.810> that's

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
are more likely to lay an egg that's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.760 
are more likely to lay an egg that's
rounder<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.990> can<00:02:12.140> see<00:02:12.290> these<00:02:12.440> are<00:02:12.620> some

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
rounder so you can see these are some

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.250 
rounder so you can see these are some
long<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.370> slender<00:02:13.760> eggs<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.720> say<00:02:15.080> that's

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
long and slender eggs and I say that's

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:24.430 
long and slender eggs and I say that's
about<00:02:15.470> another<00:02:16.450> dozen<00:02:17.450> or<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:17.780> but<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:23.440> again

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
about another dozen or so but but again

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.620 
about another dozen or so but but again
there's<00:02:24.860> a<00:02:24.950> comparison<00:02:25.280> between<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.820> an

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
there's a comparison between the an

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.870 
there's a comparison between the an
average<00:02:26.990> sized<00:02:27.200> egg<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.800> burmese<00:02:28.490> python

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
average sized egg of the burmese python

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.400 
average sized egg of the burmese python
that<00:02:28.970> we<00:02:29.090> used<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.300> see<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> dwarf<00:02:30.200> type

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.490 
that we used to see and the dwarf type
here<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:32.150> found<00:02:32.600> imitators<00:02:33.170> Prague's<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:35.500> set

it<00:03:10.790> successfully<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:13.030> don't<00:03:14.030> think<00:03:14.300> there'll

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
it successfully I don't think there'll

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.670 
it successfully I don't think there'll
be<00:03:14.600> any<00:03:14.690> trouble<00:03:15.470> with<00:03:15.650> with<00:03:17.680> succeeding

animals<00:03:21.380> they<00:03:21.500> should<00:03:21.980> be<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:22.520> easy<00:03:22.730> to

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
animals they should be just as easy to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.199 
animals they should be just as easy to
breed<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:24.680> any<00:03:24.830> other<00:03:25.040> Burmese<00:03:25.459> python<00:03:25.910> so

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
breed as any other Burmese python so

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.780 
breed as any other Burmese python so
anyway<00:03:27.170> we'll<00:03:27.380> check<00:03:27.560> back<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.770> about<00:03:27.950> 56<00:03:28.550> days

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
anyway we'll check back in about 56 days

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.740 
anyway we'll check back in about 56 days
hopefully<00:03:29.030> we'll<00:03:29.330> have<00:03:29.390> some<00:03:29.570> nice<00:03:29.690> little
