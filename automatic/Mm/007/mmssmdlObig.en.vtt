of video that one shot I'll have to give
you<00:00:31.040> but<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.369> usually<00:00:32.610> slow<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.320> doesn't

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
it's not really iPad compatible the only

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's not really iPad compatible the only
notable<00:00:37.469> feature<00:00:37.770> about<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:39.090> your

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
notable feature about it is it's your

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.380 
notable feature about it is it's your

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
playability now let's get started

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.860 
playability now let's get started
I<00:00:42.739> like<00:00:43.739> photon<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.360> one<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I like photon because it's one of the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.560 
I like photon because it's one of the
first<00:00:46.110> apps<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> first<00:00:47.850> flash<00:00:48.180> apps

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
first apps one of the first flash apps

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.229 
first apps one of the first flash apps
ever<00:00:49.559> invented<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> iPad

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.840 

and<00:00:55.980> it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.860 

you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.810 

perhaps<00:01:05.870> it<00:01:06.230> is<00:01:06.260> a<00:01:06.800> streaming<00:01:07.160> session

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
perhaps it is a streaming session

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.330 
perhaps it is a streaming session
however<00:01:08.630> which<00:01:09.170> means<00:01:09.380> all<00:01:09.620> of<00:01:09.650> your<00:01:09.830> activity

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
however which means all of your activity

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.440

can<00:01:10.550> be<00:01:10.580> monitored

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
can be monitored

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.830 
can be monitored
just<00:01:11.750> like<00:01:11.900> with<00:01:12.080> every<00:01:12.500> dollar<00:01:12.650> flat<00:01:12.950> shot

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
just like with every dollar flat shot

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.190 
just like with every dollar flat shot

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
now puffin is very good for a completing

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.640 
now puffin is very good for a completing
tasks<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:19.490> usually<00:01:19.790> fast<00:01:20.650> depending

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
tasks and it's usually fast depending

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.800 
tasks and it's usually fast depending
even<00:01:22.220> if<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:22.580> have<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.940> slowest<00:01:23.360> bandwidth

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
even if you have the slowest bandwidth

to do this because I'd evolved every

YouTube<00:02:06.350> video<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.770> saw<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.160> that's<00:02:07.880> all<00:02:08.060> about

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
YouTube video I saw it that's all about

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.500 
YouTube video I saw it that's all about
it<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.959> know<00:02:09.080> doing<00:02:09.399> evaluation<00:02:10.399> I'm<00:02:11.180> it's

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
it you know doing evaluation I'm it's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.770 
it you know doing evaluation I'm it's
very<00:02:11.780> intuitive<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.650> very<00:02:13.250> fast<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.480> almost

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
very intuitive and very fast it's almost

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.340 
very intuitive and very fast it's almost
like<00:02:15.580> almost<00:02:16.580> like<00:02:16.790> Safari<00:02:17.239> for<00:02:17.570> iPad<00:02:17.959> but

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
like almost like Safari for iPad but

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.130 
like almost like Safari for iPad but
with<00:02:19.360> flash<00:02:20.360> there<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.340> maybe<00:02:22.420> 0.2<00:02:23.420> seconds<00:02:23.959> of

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
with flash there is maybe 0.2 seconds of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.190 
with flash there is maybe 0.2 seconds of
lag<00:02:24.440> before<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.250> are<00:02:25.459> able<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.790> watch<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.200> but

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
lag before you are able to watch it but

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.610 
lag before you are able to watch it but
it<00:02:27.590> gives<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.190> best<00:02:28.459> quality<00:02:29.410> whatsoever

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
it gives you the best quality whatsoever

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.680 
it gives you the best quality whatsoever
um<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.190> doesn't<00:02:31.220> really<00:02:31.519> have<00:02:31.760> airplay<00:02:32.300> like

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
um it doesn't really have airplay like
