companies can approach solving these

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.030 
companies can approach solving these
challenges<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:34.020> example<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> lot<00:00:34.920> of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
challenges so for example a lot of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.530 
challenges so for example a lot of
companies<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.610> different<00:00:35.790> plants<00:00:36.390> they

manage<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.200> different<00:00:37.649> fields<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
manage have different fields and so on

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
manage have different fields and so on
and<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.540> all<00:00:39.780> want<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.140> able<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> operate

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
and they all want to be able to operate

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
and they all want to be able to operate
each<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.340> those<00:00:41.460> plants<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.329> efficiently<00:00:43.020> as
