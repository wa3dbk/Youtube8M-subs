so i'm just gonna hop in to log on here

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.880 
so i'm just gonna hop in to log on here
there<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.559> go

there we go

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
there we go
log<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.690> spin<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:43.610> there<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.149> now<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
log on spin on there we go and now the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.760 
log on spin on there we go and now the
site<00:00:45.660> will<00:00:45.809> start<00:00:46.020> spinning<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.500> i<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.739> just

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
site will start spinning and i can just

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.639 
site will start spinning and i can just
walk<00:00:47.309> forward<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.440> walk

walk forward and as you see as I walk

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.420 
walk forward and as you see as I walk
forward<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.670> entire<00:00:50.789> log<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.960> himself<00:00:52.500> glue

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
forward the entire log on himself glue

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.069 
forward the entire log on himself glue
chilli<00:00:53.789> moves<00:00:54.059> forward<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> want

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
chilli moves forward and then if I want

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
chilli moves forward and then if I want
to<00:00:55.170> move<00:00:55.260> back<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.190> well<00:00:56.730> go

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
to move back I can just well go

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.599 
to move back I can just well go
backwards<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.620> clearly

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
backwards as you can see I can clearly

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.930 
backwards as you can see I can clearly
move<00:01:00.180> forward<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.690> backward<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> be

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
move forward and backward you get to be

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
move forward and backward you get to be
excited<00:01:03.359> sometimes<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.809> spiral<00:01:04.260> energy<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
excited sometimes the spiral energy is a

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.960 
excited sometimes the spiral energy is a
bit<00:01:05.070> too<00:01:05.309> strong

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
bit too strong

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.350 
bit too strong
hey<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.900> move<00:01:07.350> around<00:01:07.700> yeah<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.180> may<00:01:09.299> be

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
hey this one move around yeah you may be

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600 
hey this one move around yeah you may be
asking<00:01:09.750> yourself<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.950> where<00:01:11.490> am

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
asking yourself how can this be where am

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
asking yourself how can this be where am
i<00:01:11.670> drawing<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.090> these<00:01:12.180> commands<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:12.810> well

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
i drawing all these commands from well

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.469 
i drawing all these commands from well
it<00:01:13.830> moves<00:01:14.220> beyond<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> blocks<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
it moves beyond the blocks it was a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.870 
it moves beyond the blocks it was a
second<00:01:15.930> before<00:01:16.130> little<00:01:17.130> by<00:01:17.220> little<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
second before little by little it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
second before little by little it
advances<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> bit<00:01:18.720> further<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.259> each<00:01:19.439> step

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
advances a bit further with each step

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.630 
advances a bit further with each step
that's<00:01:20.490> how<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> redstone<00:01:21.600> works<00:01:22.340> yeah<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that's how the redstone works yeah and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340 
that's how the redstone works yeah and
then<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> commands<00:01:24.900> like

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
then as you can see in the commands like

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.870 
then as you can see in the commands like
I'm<00:01:25.470> using<00:01:25.650> I'm<00:01:25.890> using<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.250> clone<00:01:26.490> command

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
I'm using I'm using the clone command

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.020 
I'm using I'm using the clone command
basically<00:01:27.509> I'm<00:01:27.810> cloning<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.530> log<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.700> from<00:01:29.850> up

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
basically I'm cloning I log on from up

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
basically I'm cloning I log on from up
there<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> moving<00:01:30.750> him<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.290> forward<00:01:31.680> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
there and moving him like forward and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.190 
there and moving him like forward and
backward<00:01:32.220> now<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.079> him

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
backward now I was going to have him

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800 
backward now I was going to have him
rotate<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.579> maybe<00:01:36.060> I'll<00:01:36.240> still<00:01:36.450> add<00:01:36.570> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
rotate but maybe I'll still add that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.270 
rotate but maybe I'll still add that
maybe<00:01:37.079> I'll<00:01:37.259> still<00:01:37.439> add<00:01:37.530> something<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.009> Giga

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
maybe I'll still add something like Giga

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
maybe I'll still add something like Giga
drill<00:01:38.579> break<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:39.000> something<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.659> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
drill break or something I don't know I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.649 
drill break or something I don't know I
just<00:01:40.079> felt<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.770> should<00:01:41.299> at<00:01:42.299> least<00:01:42.360> show

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
just felt that I should at least show

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.560 
just felt that I should at least show
you<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.740> far<00:01:44.299> let<00:01:45.299> me<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.509> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
you what I got so far let me know if you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.940 
you what I got so far let me know if you
want<00:01:45.689> me<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.840> finish<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.710> it'd<00:01:46.920> be

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
want me to finish this I think it'd be

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.499 
want me to finish this I think it'd be
funny<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> finish<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.180> might<00:01:48.329> take<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
funny to finish but it might take a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.569 
funny to finish but it might take a
little<00:01:48.689> bit<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.020> time<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.560> operate<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.430> yeah<00:01:50.549> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
little bit of time to operate but yeah I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.789 
little bit of time to operate but yeah I
thought<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.180> did<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.840> fun<00:01:52.110> little<00:01:52.140> job<00:01:52.590> here

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
thought I did like a fun little job here

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590 
thought I did like a fun little job here
you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:53.009> how<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:53.670> little

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you know how you have the little little

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.870 
you know how you have the little little
hand<00:01:54.869> operating<00:01:55.590> things<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.250> logon<00:01:56.640> has

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
hand operating things that logon has

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240 
hand operating things that logon has
it's<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.570> bigger<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> same<00:01:59.009> time

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it's a bit bigger but at the same time

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.219 
it's a bit bigger but at the same time
I'm<00:01:59.790> pretty<00:02:00.090> happy<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.079> bit

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
I'm pretty happy with it it's a bit

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.560 
I'm pretty happy with it it's a bit
nonsensical<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.159> don't<00:02:03.060> know<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.299> thought

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
nonsensical I don't know I just thought

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.179 
nonsensical I don't know I just thought
it<00:02:03.630> would<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> bit<00:02:04.049> funny<00:02:04.259> also<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> whole

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it would be a bit funny also the whole

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.679 
it would be a bit funny also the whole
plate<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.729> frame<00:02:05.820> thing<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> doesn't

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
plate and frame thing that that doesn't

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.540 
plate and frame thing that that doesn't
matter<00:02:06.930> basically<00:02:07.649> I'm<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.009> putting<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
matter basically I'm just putting in a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.979 
matter basically I'm just putting in a
site<00:02:08.910> than<00:02:09.060> an<00:02:09.149> item<00:02:09.270> frame<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.780> then<00:02:09.869> I'm
