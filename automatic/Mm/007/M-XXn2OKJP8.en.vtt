00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.370
 how 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.370
 ah 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.550
 very good everyone locates as always 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.040
 bad field 4 third map we have of 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.220
 end are in this case is hangar 21 or 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.930
 hunger twenty one and it's a pretty map 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.580
 first and foremost as interesting 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.169
 how are you going to be able to see me here I will be 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.450
 touring the map especially in this 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.700
 example in this example and sorry I decided 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.740
 dedicate myself to travel the map to 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.650
 show them in their entirety let's say and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.750
 do not focus on himself in the shootings on me 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.910
 and killing people and so on and so on 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.040
 that they will see how I walk different 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.710
 parts of the map the flags of more is 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.380
 but on top of that it's a pretty map 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.480
 peculiar let's say first to start is 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.100
 the only map that we have that is everything 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.250
 night since he starts me until 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.720
 ends the map is always at night like 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.730
 you can see here I'm using one of 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.340
 these launchers or launch bots there 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.560
 around the map is one of the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.810
 new features that has the 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.460
 final lcd are are we are in the 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.640
 four maps I think are in this 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.810
 I just need to see the last one obviously 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.150
 but if I'm not mistaken they are only 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.649
 here and on this particular map as well as 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.050
 they will know if they saw the previous videos 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.900
 they all have as well as some clue 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.550
 fil 2,142 on the map we saw yesterday it 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.260
 they were building the battle walkers 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.680
 that are like robots with two legs 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.990
 and they have a pretty important arsenal 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.000
 but on this map this time it 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.120
 is building the first prototype of 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.550
 a titan of that wisdom let's say how can we 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.220
 say giant transporter that 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.960
 we saw floating in butterfield 2.142 and 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.340
 that was part of a game mode 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.320
 of the same one in which you had to destroy 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.210
 the enemy titan as you can see here 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.070
 just up from where from my head 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.750
 let's say where I'm going with 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.670
 a chip inside the hangar is being 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.170
 building the first prototype of one 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.190
 of these titans that obviously do not 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.140
 you can use because you are in 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.420
 construction and it would be completely out 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.820
 of balance sheet but besides that we have 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.280
 as we said night map 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.830
 the titan that is building here is a 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.500
 map that is quite separate as in 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.840
 two sections of both have a map 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.760
 which is basically based on infantry 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.410
 that is inside the hangar we have the 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.820
 air flags which are 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.280
 positioned in a little way 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.380
 peculiar could also use the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.600
 word no since there is a flag behind 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.080
 of the other and it is almost impossible to access 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.570
 Alava 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.730
 the background that I think is the idea without 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.560
 go through the flag should obviously there 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.240
 a large number of roads to 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.000
 enter the hangar there are below by 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.500
 sides above can be opened or 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.850
 close the door we eat at the beginning 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.980
 of the gameplay to prevent them from entering 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.170
 vehicles as you are going to see me try 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.520
 to me but on top of that not only 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.930
 we have those two flags that are 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.610
 inside the hangar and let's say if 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.440
 we protect a practically we are 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.790
 protecting the two and the exit of the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.740
 hangar there is another that is the flag of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.390
 charly let 's say it 's like doors 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.280
 of the hangar but on the other side 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.840
 we have a completely different map 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.440
 much more open although there's no 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.050
 vehicles like vtr or contra vehicles 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.550
 in anthrax fanfare or tanks we have 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.990
 many aerial vehicles we have two 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.850
 transport two helicopters 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.450
 transport by helicopters team 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.330
 attack and houses around the bases 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.730
 obviously we also have a pair of jet 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.470
 skis for the snow here are almost all 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.330
 the bases and some quads also 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.550
 but as I already tell you, the map is very 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.170
 divided between what is pure gameplay 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.900
 of infantry inside the hangar 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.910
 close combat gameplay as they can 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.790
 see right here I'm trying to defend 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.739
 the band 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.030
 It leads us to see here on the screen 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.280
 Little sony vegas but 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.870
 probably the flag should and is 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.310
 all very centered around what is 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.599
 infantry combat probably 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.640
 let's see what the modes of 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.650
 domination and everything against all teams 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.689
 inside the hangar while the part 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.950
 from outside is more based with help from 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.569
 the vehicles where the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.939
 Helicopter attack helicopters 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.250
 of transport and good where we have to 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.319
 walk for several meters let's say 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.030
 during a certain time to go from a 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.650
 flag to the other a team starts 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.420
 down the mountain and the other team 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.120
 start next to the hangar which is 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.189
 also pretty flashy let's say how 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.769
 are besieged how are the 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.510
 flags and we'll see how that works 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.819
 when playing a game of truth 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.260
 it's 64 players but where half of 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.510
 the players that we are playing here 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.189
 we are trying to explore the map or 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.320
 see how the new things of the 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.120
 etc etc etc but as I already 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.769
 I say it caught my attention how 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.650
 the flags are on how is it 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.610
 made the map the truth is one of my 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.650
 favorites that I see now 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.940
 obviously we go though I saw the last one in 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.860
 videos from youtube because when I'm 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.199
 commenting on the same day as you 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.030
 they are going to see it yet, although not yet 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.730
 I could play the last map 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.320
 hammerhead I think hammer head something 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.550
 so I have seen it in gameplays of 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.920
 youtube from other youtubers that already 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.090
 they went up but as I 'm telling you the truth 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.470
 is that he has called me quite a lot 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.780
 the attention this map one of my 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.970
 favorites for now especially because it's 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.610
 quite varied try to include a little 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.440
 of everything and the truth is that we say 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.180
 changed some things with respect to 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.500
 have made some differences with 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.300
 Regarding the other maps, he called me 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.860
 quite the attention but as always 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.360
 I hope you liked the video, I do not know 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.740
 forget to leave me a comment on what 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.330
 these maps are looking like 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.320
 as we see them and see you 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.320
 next ciao
