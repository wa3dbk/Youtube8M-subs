00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.459 
town I decided to set it fictionally
because<00:00:09.879> I<00:00:09.969> like<00:00:10.209> the<00:00:10.360> idea<00:00:10.389> of<00:00:10.929> creating<00:00:11.349> my

own architecture and creating my own
country<00:00:14.199> town<00:00:15.330> partly<00:00:16.330> because<00:00:16.480> of<00:00:16.630> cowardice

firstly because I set out to write a

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.790 
firstly because I set out to write a
book<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.710> Southern<00:00:57.040> gothic<00:00:57.160> fiction<00:00:57.580> and<00:00:58.800> more

or less because I wanted to have a go I

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.590 
or less because I wanted to have a go I
just<00:01:01.630> really<00:01:01.900> loved<00:01:02.820> southern<00:01:03.820> gothic<00:01:03.970> works

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
just really loved southern gothic works

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.350 
just really loved southern gothic works
for<00:01:04.900> some<00:01:05.050> reason<00:01:05.500> I<00:01:05.770> can't<00:01:06.490> quite<00:01:06.790> adequately

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
for some reason I can't quite adequately

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.140 
for some reason I can't quite adequately
put<00:01:07.540> my<00:01:07.630> finger<00:01:07.930> on<00:01:07.960> that<00:01:08.410> I<00:01:08.620> just<00:01:08.920> really<00:01:09.280> love

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
put my finger on that I just really love

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.490 
put my finger on that I just really love
that<00:01:10.180> ilk<00:01:10.540> of<00:01:10.630> literature<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.110> has<00:01:11.170> a<00:01:11.260> very

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
that ilk of literature it has a very

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.230 
that ilk of literature it has a very
strong<00:01:11.770> emotional<00:01:12.460> connection<00:01:12.490> with<00:01:13.060> me<00:01:13.210> and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
strong emotional connection with me and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.590 
strong emotional connection with me and
so<00:01:13.630> I<00:01:14.909> love<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.060> idea<00:01:16.510> of<00:01:18.480> crafting<00:01:19.480> an

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
so I love the idea of crafting an

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.230 
so I love the idea of crafting an
Australian<00:01:20.140> Gothic<00:01:20.950> piece<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:22.000> think

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
Australian Gothic piece and I think

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.630 
Australian Gothic piece and I think
setting<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.780> mid<00:01:22.930> 60s<00:01:23.350> was<00:01:23.710> just<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.490> way

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
setting it in the mid 60s was just a way

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.670 
setting it in the mid 60s was just a way
initially<00:01:24.970> for<00:01:25.330> me<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.720> have<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.230> read<00:01:26.500> more

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
initially for me to have it read more

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.890 
initially for me to have it read more
authentically<00:01:27.159> as<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.550> work<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:28.000> gothic

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
authentically as a work of gothic

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.149 
authentically as a work of gothic
fiction<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.610> soon<00:01:31.060> discovered<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:32.159> given

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
fiction but I soon discovered that given

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.830 
fiction but I soon discovered that given
that<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.310> book<00:01:33.520> is<00:01:33.820> really<00:01:34.690> about

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
that the book is really about

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.670 
that the book is really about
coming-of-age<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.960> differences<00:01:38.500> I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
coming-of-age and the differences I

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.160 
coming-of-age and the differences I
think<00:01:38.920> between<00:01:39.640> coming-of-age<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.720> becoming

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
think between coming-of-age and becoming

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.980 
think between coming-of-age and becoming
adult<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.729> reason<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.090> said<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.479> 60s<00:01:43.900> I

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
adult the reason I said it in the 60s I

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.100 
adult the reason I said it in the 60s I
think<00:01:44.100> subconsciously<00:01:45.100> perhaps<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.810> the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
think subconsciously perhaps is that the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.530 
think subconsciously perhaps is that the
60s<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.590> Australia<00:01:48.070> particularly<00:01:48.460> is<00:01:48.729> sort<00:01:49.510> of

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
60s in Australia particularly is sort of

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.750 
60s in Australia particularly is sort of
held<00:01:49.810> aloft<00:01:50.140> as<00:01:50.470> this<00:01:50.710> bastion<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.400> social

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
held aloft as this bastion of social

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.570 
held aloft as this bastion of social
politics<00:01:52.180> where<00:01:52.810> Australia<00:01:53.500> came<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:54.010> age<00:01:54.130> but

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
politics where Australia came of age but

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.390 
politics where Australia came of age but
I<00:01:54.760> guess<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:55.210> my<00:01:55.330> contention<00:01:55.540> on<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.830> few

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
I guess it's my contention on a few

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.359 
I guess it's my contention on a few
levels<00:01:57.549> that<00:01:58.320> maybe<00:01:59.320> we<00:01:59.500> didn't<00:01:59.770> really<00:02:00.220> come

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
levels that maybe we didn't really come

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.649 
levels that maybe we didn't really come
of<00:02:00.460> age<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.729> think<00:02:00.790> one<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.240> reasons<00:02:01.540> it's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
of age I think one of the reasons it's

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.430 
of age I think one of the reasons it's
so<00:02:02.220> immediately<00:02:03.270> identifiable<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.960> not

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
so immediately identifiable is that not

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.500 
so immediately identifiable is that not
so<00:02:05.650> much<00:02:05.890> as<00:02:06.070> moved<00:02:06.340> on<00:02:06.490> or<00:02:06.729> not<00:02:06.940> as<00:02:07.060> much<00:02:07.090> as<00:02:07.360> we

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
so much as moved on or not as much as we

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.649 
so much as moved on or not as much as we
tend<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.840> give<00:02:07.990> ourselves<00:02:08.110> credit<00:02:08.439> for
