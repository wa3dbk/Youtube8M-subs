00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
which will put a twist in the rope we

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.140 
which will put a twist in the rope we
now<00:01:23.570> have<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:24.220> effectively<00:01:25.220> our<00:01:25.430> simple<00:01:25.940> loop

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
now have a effectively our simple loop

some nuts to add strength and Dulce make
the<00:04:45.630> supply<00:04:45.900> slip<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.320> bit<00:04:46.470> neater<00:04:46.880> we're<00:04:47.880> going

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
the supply slip a bit neater we're going

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.420 
the supply slip a bit neater we're going
to<00:04:48.180> tape<00:04:48.389> with<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.690> cord<00:04:49.470> down<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:53.130> ensure

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
to tape with a cord down to ensure

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.760 
to tape with a cord down to ensure
there's<00:04:53.700> no<00:04:53.850> lumps<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.360> bumps<00:04:54.419> in<00:04:54.840> it

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:08.670 

removing<00:04:58.770> any<00:04:58.949> excess

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.700 

we<00:05:09.220> do<00:05:09.370> this<00:05:09.520> by<00:05:09.760> taking<00:05:09.940> a<00:05:10.180> small<00:05:10.510> bed<00:05:10.780> and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
we do this by taking a small bed and

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:24.010 
we do this by taking a small bed and
gently<00:05:12.130> put<00:05:13.120> in<00:05:13.320> each<00:05:14.320> of<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.680> 12<00:05:14.830> strands

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.270 

and<00:05:24.530> repeat<00:05:24.890> this<00:05:25.190> down<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.090> road<00:05:27.190> until<00:05:28.190> you

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
and repeat this down the road until you

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.270 
and repeat this down the road until you
have<00:05:28.490> something<00:05:28.940> that<00:05:29.300> looks<00:05:29.480> like<00:05:29.630> this<00:05:30.280> what

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
have something that looks like this what

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.980 
have something that looks like this what
we<00:05:31.460> do<00:05:31.640> is<00:05:32.060> take<00:05:32.270> our<00:05:32.480> knife<00:05:34.510> let<00:05:35.510> me<00:05:35.600> chop<00:05:35.840> up

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
we do is take our knife let me chop up

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:54.990 
we do is take our knife let me chop up
it<00:05:36.170> each<00:05:36.500> strand

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.190 

just<00:05:56.000> take<00:05:56.270> this<00:05:56.450> down<00:05:56.630> the<00:05:56.810> core<00:05:58.780> which<00:05:59.780> in

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
just take this down the core which in

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:15.020 
just take this down the core which in
turn<00:06:00.470> improves<00:06:01.070> the<00:06:01.580> strength<00:06:01.850> of<00:06:02.450> this<00:06:02.600> class

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.630 

it's<00:06:16.030> now<00:06:16.180> time<00:06:16.240> to<00:06:16.450> finish<00:06:16.720> this<00:06:16.990> flight

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
it's now time to finish this flight

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.080 
it's now time to finish this flight
showing<00:06:18.640> the<00:06:18.730> net<00:06:18.910> for<00:06:19.090> splicing<00:06:19.450> flaps<00:06:20.440> it<00:06:20.590> up

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
showing the net for splicing flaps it up

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.510 
showing the net for splicing flaps it up
we<00:06:22.090> then<00:06:22.270> slide<00:06:23.170> our<00:06:23.320> fingers<00:06:23.710> and<00:06:23.950> milk<00:06:24.220> the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
we then slide our fingers and milk the

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.200 
we then slide our fingers and milk the
outer<00:06:25.450> core<00:06:25.870> over<00:06:26.530> the<00:06:26.650> inner<00:06:26.800> core<00:06:27.210> until

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
outer core over the inner core until

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:36.620 
outer core over the inner core until
they're<00:06:30.720> cool<00:06:32.940> finishes<00:06:33.940> inside<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.540> rape

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
they're cool finishes inside the rape

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.540 
they're cool finishes inside the rape
this<00:06:37.630> then<00:06:37.900> produces<00:06:38.530> a<00:06:38.620> nice<00:06:38.830> smooth<00:06:39.190> taper

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
this then produces a nice smooth taper

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.340 
this then produces a nice smooth taper
down<00:06:40.500> the<00:06:41.500> line<00:06:42.060> we<00:06:43.060> can<00:06:43.240> then<00:06:43.419> take<00:06:43.900> our<00:06:44.140> block

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
down the line we can then take our block

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.770 
down the line we can then take our block
and<00:06:46.080> simply<00:06:47.080> count<00:06:47.320> it<00:06:47.500> chip
