now it's the first time that I've used
this<00:01:08.540> head<00:01:09.580> gear<00:01:10.580> for<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.290> GoPro<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:12.470> I'm<00:01:12.530> not

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
this head gear for a GoPro so I'm not

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
quite sure what I'm filming at the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.670 
quite sure what I'm filming at the
moment<00:01:14.509> cuz<00:01:15.409> might<00:01:15.650> as<00:01:15.740> well<00:01:15.860> just<00:01:16.190> be<00:01:17.680> it's

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.320 
moment cuz might as well just be it's
not<00:01:18.799> too<00:01:19.040> bad<00:01:19.250> I<00:01:19.280> guess<00:01:19.400> it's<00:01:19.700> all<00:01:19.820> point<00:01:20.180> in

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330

not too bad I guess it's all point in
the<00:01:20.450> right<00:01:20.540> direction<00:01:21.670> there<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:22.790> go<00:01:24.250> and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250

the right direction there we go and
we're<00:01:25.430> off<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:25.580> running<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:26.600> this<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:26.930> a

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
we're off and running now this is a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.200 
we're off and running now this is a
pouch<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.649> can<00:01:27.830> fill<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:28.100> by<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.880> way<00:01:29.060> it's

few<00:02:32.510> maggots<00:02:32.870> in<00:02:37.330> now<00:02:38.330> it's<00:02:38.450> pretty<00:02:38.690> easy<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
few maggots in now it's pretty easy and

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.440 
few maggots in now it's pretty easy and
Norfolk<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.400> honest<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.880> catch<00:02:41.120> quite<00:02:41.330> a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
Norfolk to be honest to catch quite a

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.699 
Norfolk to be honest to catch quite a
variety<00:02:41.750> fish<00:02:42.290> now<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> small<00:02:43.220> one

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.820 

tiny<00:02:48.709> little<00:02:48.950> hit<00:02:49.340> on<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.550> float<00:02:49.790> then<00:02:50.830> what

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
tiny little hit on the float then what

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.819 
tiny little hit on the float then what
waiting<00:02:52.190> for<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.610> float<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.030> disappear

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
waiting for is that float to disappear

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.190 
waiting for is that float to disappear
under<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:54.920> surface<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> water<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.930> then

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
under the surface of the water and then

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.500 
under the surface of the water and then
the<00:02:58.100> idea<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.700> strike<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> opposite<00:02:59.390> way

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
the idea is to strike the opposite way

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.600 
the idea is to strike the opposite way
to<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.810> flow<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:00.890> when<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:01.250> goes<00:03:01.400> like<00:03:01.579> that

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
to the flow so when it goes like that

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.520 
to the flow so when it goes like that
come<00:03:02.420> off<00:03:04.570> quick<00:03:05.570> look<00:03:05.720> at<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.959> maggot

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
come off quick look at that maggot

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.229 
come off quick look at that maggot
just<00:03:06.920> want<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.130> keep<00:03:07.340> feed-in<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.000> swim

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
just want to keep feed-in the swim

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.410 
just want to keep feed-in the swim
really<00:03:08.480> slowly<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.730> keep<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.209> fish

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
really slowly just to keep the fish

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.150 
really slowly just to keep the fish
interested<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.260> what<00:03:12.350> does<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.650> brings<00:03:13.010> a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
interested and what does it brings a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.259 
interested and what does it brings a
small<00:03:13.340> fish<00:03:13.610> in<00:03:14.440> which<00:03:15.440> brings<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:16.670> perch<00:03:16.940> in

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
small fish in which brings the perch in

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.170 
small fish in which brings the perch in
as<00:03:17.630> they<00:03:17.810> feed<00:03:18.049> on<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.230> small<00:03:18.410> fish<00:03:19.180> then

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
as they feed on the small fish then

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.600 
as they feed on the small fish then
every<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:20.570> often<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:21.230> will<00:03:21.680> cast<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.280> try<00:03:22.519> and

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
every so often I will cast and try and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.740 
every so often I will cast and try and
catch<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.850> pike<00:03:24.940> they<00:03:25.940> tend<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.299> come<00:03:26.480> in<00:03:26.510> and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
catch a pike they tend to come in and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.350 
catch a pike they tend to come in and
feed<00:03:26.930> on<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.140> other<00:03:27.230> fish<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.030> there's<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.150> food

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
feed on the other fish so there's a food

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.449 
feed on the other fish so there's a food
chain<00:03:29.600> going<00:03:29.870> on<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.620> floats<00:03:30.920> blown<00:03:31.220> away

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
chain going on the floats blown away

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.580 
chain going on the floats blown away
there<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.630> feels<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.959> bit<00:03:32.989> bigger<00:03:33.410> that's

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
there it feels a bit bigger that's

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.140 
there it feels a bit bigger that's
probably<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.220> bigger<00:03:34.850> pouch<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:36.970> few<00:03:37.970> problems

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
probably a bigger pouch a few problems

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
probably a bigger pouch a few problems

yachts<00:04:47.330> are<00:04:47.600> so<00:04:47.750> annoying<00:04:48.020> up<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.410> down<00:04:48.530> the

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
yachts are so annoying up and down the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.440 
yachts are so annoying up and down the
river<00:04:48.830> because<00:04:49.160> they<00:04:49.280> tacked<00:04:49.640> left<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.270> right

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
river because they tacked left to right

left to right zigzag water out the river

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.830 
left to right zigzag water out the river
and<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:55.220> rule<00:04:55.490> is<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.910> pass<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.660> have<00:04:56.750> a

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.430 

stirrin<00:05:06.410> I<00:05:06.500> think<00:05:06.680> they<00:05:06.800> call<00:05:07.040> it<00:05:08.230> pass<00:05:09.230> the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
stirrin I think they call it pass the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.520 
stirrin I think they call it pass the
stone<00:05:10.570> which<00:05:11.570> some<00:05:11.840> people<00:05:12.110> find<00:05:12.290> quite

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
stone which some people find quite

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.580 
stone which some people find quite
difficult<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.980> do<00:05:13.220> sometimes<00:05:17.500> there's<00:05:18.500> a
