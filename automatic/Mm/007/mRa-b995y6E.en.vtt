for the brows I don't know what's wrong
with<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.609> but<00:02:20.989> so<00:02:21.989> basically<00:02:22.890> movie<00:02:23.189> box<00:02:23.400> is

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.259 
with it but so basically movie box is
probably<00:02:23.969> the<00:02:24.090> best<00:02:24.329> one<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.810> my<00:02:25.230> opinion

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
probably the best one in my opinion
