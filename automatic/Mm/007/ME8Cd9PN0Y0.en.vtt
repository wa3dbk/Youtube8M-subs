 that never 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.670
 cross 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.430

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.540
 better the thickness is a lot remains 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.540
 quite content though it is not 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.080
 cash content 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.960
 all 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:42.620
 this product should be considered as a 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:44.410
 drama because there are hd or hd but how 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.360
 clear as a market position 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.170
 that the possession of the whole will be seen 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.410
 as soon as it comes out a little more 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.830

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.139
 more at the level of giving performance 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.280
 it looks pretty good there aren't any 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.800
 effects of degan 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.870

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.870
 water and suspended particles 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.700
 however we have no delay and also 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.730
 output

 we know if it will come will be difficult 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.160
 in europe it should arrive expected within 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.750
 the end of the year still not only price
