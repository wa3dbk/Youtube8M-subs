00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.970 

yeah<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.210> didn't<00:03:22.660> know<00:03:22.720> what<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.900> expect<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.950> I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
yeah I didn't know what to expect so I

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.730 
yeah I didn't know what to expect so I
kind<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.460> just<00:03:24.610> made<00:03:24.850> this<00:03:25.260> little<00:03:26.260> wall

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:37.710 

around<00:03:29.740> my<00:03:29.920> little<00:03:30.220> island<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:34.980> hid<00:03:35.980> um<00:03:36.720> I

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
around my little island and hid um I

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.270 
around my little island and hid um I
thought<00:03:38.050> using<00:03:38.380> this<00:03:38.530> map<00:03:38.860> would<00:03:39.100> be

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
thought using this map would be

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.270 
thought using this map would be
appropriate<00:03:39.640> since<00:03:40.240> I<00:03:40.450> did<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.810> whole

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
appropriate since I did the whole

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.200 
appropriate since I did the whole
vampire<00:03:42.280> thing<00:03:42.610> in<00:03:43.300> this<00:03:43.780> exact<00:03:44.200> spot<00:03:44.230> and

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
vampire thing in this exact spot and

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.940 
vampire thing in this exact spot and
then<00:03:46.210> you<00:03:46.420> know<00:03:46.540> with<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.810> infection<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:47.800> that

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
then you know with the infection so that

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.120 
then you know with the infection so that
it's<00:03:48.160> kind<00:03:48.310> of<00:03:48.430> like<00:03:49.170> my<00:03:50.170> monster<00:03:50.740> math<00:03:50.950> I

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
it's kind of like my monster math I

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.980 
it's kind of like my monster math I
guess<00:03:53.880> but<00:03:54.880> yeah<00:03:55.060> definitely<00:03:55.510> check<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.780> out

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
guess but yeah definitely check it out

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.560 
guess but yeah definitely check it out
it's<00:03:56.470> really<00:03:56.680> cool<00:03:57.750> especially<00:03:58.750> if<00:03:59.170> you<00:04:00.570> you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
it's really cool especially if you you

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.320 
it's really cool especially if you you
like<00:04:01.780> getting<00:04:02.020> soup<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:05.550> I'm<00:04:06.550> told<00:04:06.820> that<00:04:06.940> they

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
like getting soup and I'm told that they

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.820 
like getting soup and I'm told that they
do<00:04:07.920> two<00:04:08.920> hearts<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.430> damage<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:11.170> definitely<00:04:11.650> be

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
do two hearts of damage so definitely be

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.550 
do two hearts of damage so definitely be
careful<00:04:12.250> when<00:04:12.400> you're<00:04:12.490> trying<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.790> fight<00:04:12.970> them

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
careful when you're trying to fight them

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.630 
careful when you're trying to fight them
because<00:04:16.320> if<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.560> don't<00:04:17.709> kill<00:04:17.980> them<00:04:18.220> they<00:04:18.459> will

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
because if you don't kill them they will

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.590 
because if you don't kill them they will
kill<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.980> so<00:04:20.980> that's<00:04:21.580> it<00:04:21.820> for<00:04:21.850> me<00:04:22.120> I'll<00:04:22.390> see

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600
