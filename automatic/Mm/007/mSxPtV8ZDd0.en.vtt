00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.600
 and there is a way 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.600
 how our enemies continue 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.939
 about kings of tooth magicians we know and 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.640
 we know many more things 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:22.019
 efe 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.019
 how many lives 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.450
 for a single style of video 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.080
 here you have it 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.610
 it sounds 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.940
 this explosion 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.210
 follow ours 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.930
 as it is and I do not know how to know many things 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.810
 of you 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.390
 discounting this before we want 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.630
 I will go looking towards you we need 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.730
 measures only our parks who 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.380
 you inform them of how they have behaved 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.380
 children throughout the year 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.810
 we have a lot scattered throughout the 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.990
 world although he had my ideas that he did not 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.990
 they collect the information of our children 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.790
 and so the current of the 220 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.390
 I would demonstrate 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.390
 the doors to this store does not work 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.360
 at home and is also reverse is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.360
 initial and sugar 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.360
 and we want to know that we just have to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.360
 look at this 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 here 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.640
 It's definitely what you have 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.790
 traditional 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.770
 although we know that here we have 13 of 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.530
 Funniest prey exception 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.280
 it's about extending the effort 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.280
 we're 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.040
 but then 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.670
 very well 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.989
 in space 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.740
 everything has deep if in that state 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.740
 really power are specific 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.740
 now it only remains to know what you want 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.569
 he has done it we are already receiving the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.700
 terms of many children 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.310
 yes when we give him food that is 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.340
 surely administrator 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.630
 on my feet what they want is to remove 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.630
 these windows 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.110
 when 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.080
 We are very happy 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.930
 1 point and happy holidays 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.930
