00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
feeling like it was going very well so I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.869 
feeling like it was going very well so I
switched<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.440> over<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> sumo<00:00:44.070> pulled<00:00:44.760> that

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
switched back over to sumo pulled that

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.900 
switched back over to sumo pulled that
first<00:00:45.149> rep<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> 655<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.410> really<00:00:46.829> slow<00:00:47.190> but

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
first rep to 655 it was really slow but

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.819 
first rep to 655 it was really slow but
then<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.260> mentally<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
then kind of got more mentally in the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
then kind of got more mentally in the
groove<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.430> pulled<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> second<00:00:51.300> rep<00:00:51.420> even

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
groove and pulled the second rep even

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
groove and pulled the second rep even
better<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> third<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.800> away

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
better and then the third one got away

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369 
better and then the third one got away
from<00:00:53.219> me<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> front<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.719> still<00:00:55.170> came<00:00:55.350> up

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
from me in the front but still came up

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
from me in the front but still came up
pretty<00:00:55.649> easy<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.760> did<00:00:56.910> some<00:00:57.059> snatch<00:00:57.270> grab

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.109 
ever much came in and based the camera
that<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.470> got<00:01:55.649> off<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> whatever<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.000> could

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that I got off of whatever I could

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.450 
that I got off of whatever I could
afford<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.960> actually<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.189> little

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
afford but now I actually have a little

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.600 
afford but now I actually have a little
bit<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> room<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.270> some<00:02:00.299> research<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
bit of room to do some research and

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.800 
bit of room to do some research and
figure<00:02:02.610> out<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.850> best<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.270> I've<00:02:03.420> got<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> lot

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
figure out the best one I've got a lot

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.179 
figure out the best one I've got a lot
of<00:02:03.840> different<00:02:03.990> people<00:02:04.380> saying<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.979> lot<00:02:05.070> of

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
of different people saying a lot of

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.469 
of different people saying a lot of
different<00:02:05.460> things<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:05.939> far<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.210> what<00:02:06.360> they

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
different things as far as what they

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.520 
different things as far as what they
would<00:02:06.630> recommend<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
would recommend for that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.809 
would recommend for that
but<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.039> looks<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.280> we're<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> able
