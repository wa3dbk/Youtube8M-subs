00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.450
 if I have a pool table that can 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.000
 be this rectangle and I want to put a 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.579
 giving a blow ball so that 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.930
 enter the third time after 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.300
 hit twice on the wall 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.280
 for example that hits here then hit 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.590
 here and then you get in this hole 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.440
 Well, I have to operate from the next 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.600
 form doubled the board as if it did 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.910
 a symmetry about this one axis 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.530
 symmetry towards him and then I go back to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.780
 duplicate it 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.860
 then I have to whether or not this point 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:38.580
 with this let's call it point 3 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.620
 so hit here twice once twice 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.190
 times and the third would come if there were 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.559
 three boards good what object has 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.370
 this is because this has the purpose that in 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.700
 riad 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.100
 when I hit here according to the laws of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.920
 the reflection and the mechanics following 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.070
 a rectilinear trajectory hits the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 board and it will come out at an equal angle 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.050
 the incident and reflected will be the same 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.150
 to the incident that means that in 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.300
 reality when shock here is going to come 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.290
 with the same angle but it turns out that this 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.620
 line is the symmetric of this one 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.550
 we are going to call this line to this 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.830
 line b this will be the symmetric b d premium 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.630
 and then we also have that once 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.560
 shock here will come out with equal angle 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.880
 it will also be directed towards 3 and 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.860
 because it will be directed backwards 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.520
 because in real the symmetric of this is 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.619
 is 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.890
 and we have then that the symmetric of 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.770
 this is this then this would be the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.399
 trajectory ce this would be ce prima and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.920
 this second c we have to hit two 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.869
 times already the third entry then 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 we have a blow two blows and the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.289
 third entry 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.840
 well that would be the procedure for 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.729
 calculate the trajectory so that 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.110
 we can know after how many hits 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.049
 is going to enter the hole we are going to put 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.329
 another example if we have a board 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.090
 billiards and we also want you to enter the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.829
 third after giving two hits 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.290
 let's give it another trajectory by 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.450
 example this one 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.510
 we put it in this way we put another 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.769
 once the stick here we will give the blow 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.890
 to the ball and we want to know the 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.540
 trajectory that should continue well then 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.549
 is going to enter this hole after 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.349
 once twice to hit the 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.970
 boards 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.299
 Well, we have the same thing, here is a 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.299
 symmetry 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.500
 of some incident and returns to the reflected 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 and then there will be a direct path 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.870
 towards the hole because entity if I take 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.550
 this axis of symmetry and I do here the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.280
 symmetry I have this point it 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.930
 corresponds with this and then I have 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.880
 in highlight this line that will come by 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.670
 here whose incident angle has equal 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.040
 therefore it will be the symmetric of 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.459
 this is going to be this one but when I turn around 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.920
 here the plane then this line goes to 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.590
 come to stop here because the center since 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.110
 this would be point 3 and we have if this 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.030
 is the straight line and this is the straight line b for its 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.160
 symmetric here to cousin and here 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.400
 vertimientos that we would have here bs 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.650
 goodness after two strokes to the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.290
 third enters the hole 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.439
 let's put a final example 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.799
 if for example we have here a 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.799
 rectangle 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.980
 but this time I went in after a 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.440
 hit more I have here 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.150
 in the ball and I have to give it a 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.650
 trajectory so you can get to the fourth 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.459
 so for example I'm going to do these 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.459
 symmetries 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.260
 doubled here by symmetries the board 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.140
 four times 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.819
 and I say good is going to crash will come here 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.810
 and it's going to hit so much 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.980
 once twice three times already 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.349
 fourth entry we have one more time 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.739
 Well, according to that, we will have 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.840
 the symmetric of this line of this 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.840
 trajectory is going to be this 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.010
 we have also 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.380
 if we follow this path his 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.090
 symmetric here is in this or that the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.650
 symmetric of this line here will be 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.870
 here 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.290
 that here the incident angle is going to be 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.360
 equal to the reflected angle that therefore 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.039
 then also here the same incident 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.910
 reflected and then it will come around here 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.229
 direct to point 4 which will be this 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.690
 then this is going to be point 1 on 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.020
 point 12 point 3 and in 4 it enters 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.199
 enter through the good hole as we see if 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.940
 we do here the symmetric the symmetric 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.409
 of this line 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.050
 it will be this 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.270
 well once we have that curve 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.170
 of that line 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.030
 we have now that the symmetric of 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.400
 the next line of this that comes by 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.400
 here is going to be this line 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.900
 then the symmetric of this line goes to 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:15.190
 be this then let's go naming 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:18.650
 if we study this this d 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:22.220
 well let's call the first 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.100
 yes sometimes with these three we get 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.210
 this good series is already two we would have 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.790
 the first symmetric we have a premium the 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.980
 next incident and reflected huelva 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.260
 we will have the symmetric of b that will be 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.790
 is 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.020
 but in reality this is the continuation 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.910
 of this would be second or third 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.950
 second premium status 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.409
 well we have then the symmetric of 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.110
 this line would be this 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.869
 Regarding this, we have to rent the 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.870
 flat because this crashes here comes here is 

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:57.260
 The next 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.810
 and we have also 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.670
 that actually now the symmetric of 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.670
 this line would be this 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.030
 would be the symmetric of this that enters by 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.890
 this point and that actually corresponds 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.530
 this line that means that according to 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:19.170
 this plane of symmetry by rotating this 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.870
 this line that is here 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.630
 corresponds to this and now when doing 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.180
 here the axis of symmetry because we have to 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.700
 deliver this comes to stop here and its 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.160
 now symmetrical about this axis as 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.980
 will be this that is always this angle 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.560
 just like this one and the same thing here is going to 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.310
 be the same line as regards this 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.200
 axis 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.900
 I think that if we prolong this and this 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.910
 we would also have the same axis here 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.910
 so good a synthesis 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.500
 we have here the line and its symmetrical 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.120
 then it hits an angle 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.920
 incident equal to the reflected that 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.520
 it would correspond that this line but its 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.110
 symmetric is this and then 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.630
 would follow this line that its symmetric is 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.450
 this one and the symmetric of it with respect to 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.300
 this axis is this and the symmetric of this 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.200
 line with respect to this axis is this 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.460
 then we have the trajectory 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.669
 rectilinear 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.610
 intercepting here at a point in two 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.650
 in three and in the fourth it's good 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:25.449
 here would be the second blow the third 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.449
 hit and in the room would enter
