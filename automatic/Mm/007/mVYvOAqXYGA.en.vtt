00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.969
 So next question like to come along 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.530
 sometime the pcs of celje choir in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.870
 your shop 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.770
 I've been thinking about it for a while now 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.539
 had now only the topic with 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.890
 citric acid from mold we 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.600
 also have the problem in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.160
 quote that we are not exactly 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.359
 Know where the people from others 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.960
 come from manufacturers 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.680
 The pcs of sunny cars are loud senior 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.059
 itself from corn that means that we would be 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.430
 of course with the one 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.960
 more natural with a vegetable 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 source, so to speak, serves the problem of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.050
 series core as with all other us 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.280
 marks is that the import most of the time 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.140
 happened over holland or something 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.809
 outside of Germany 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.359
 the whole containerwise 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.979
 we know that from the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.650
 quest bars import the quest pass 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.600
 For example, we control ourselves and customs 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.260
 There are e-mails what you can do on it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.479
 the problem is that series core 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.659
 through this through this import to one 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.119
 high-priced also more expensive 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.950
 Manufacturer is actually in 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.140
 america already are you are in america 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.479
 already very high priced because of that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.979
 So far we only have the c4 there 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.320
 I wonder every once in a while 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.790
 over the c4 prices with others live the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.079
 cheaper I have to be completely open 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.950
 confess I'm on it last time 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.170
 been addressed 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.270
 I know the price policy of the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.130
 the other shops but not for 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.930
 the ten euros less offered there 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.509
 may be I can know my people 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.799
 I do not pay more staff so 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.990
 that's always the problem with which 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.750
 which market strategy you have in the market 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.990
 end effect as reseller than 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.640
 reseller so I have at the us 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.320
 just my own 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.460
 cost that people buy something 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.189
 and hope you have something else 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.560
 take 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.320
 I do not know I have to look 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.450
 So the prices are so meanwhile 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.360
 at a supplier at my eu 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.830
 Suppliers of the us brands have it 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.660
 It may be in the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.920
 give new prices next 12 months 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.040
 a little less a bit 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.930
 maybe this is a small percentage 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.610
 only be small but that goes to the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.230
 end customer price, of course, as a percentage 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.290
 higher again apology from the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.630
 ground to percentage continues as much 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.300
 but further from that of europrise 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.610
 Of course it is a lot less 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 I hope that I offer them 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.510
 can 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.920
 because as I said celica I hold 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.850
 actually a lot of them but they are just 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.850
 very high priced
