00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.900 

so<00:00:20.060> time<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.590> work<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> things<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so time to work on the things that and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.290 
so time to work on the things that and
I've<00:00:24.029> been<00:00:24.210> thinking<00:00:24.449> about<00:00:25.140> doing<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
I've been thinking about doing and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.200 
I've been thinking about doing and
figuring<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.369> scratching<00:00:29.369> my<00:00:29.490> head<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.900> I

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
figuring out and scratching my head on I

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.690 
figuring out and scratching my head on I
picked<00:00:33.210> up<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.649> set<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.680> mufflers<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.550> I'm

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
picked up a set of mufflers and I'm

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.940 
picked up a set of mufflers and I'm
going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.050> hack<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.320> them<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
going to hack on them a little bit and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.799 
going to hack on them a little bit and
make<00:00:40.950> myself<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.730> two<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.780> system<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.809> hang

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
make myself a two in one system and hang

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.330 
make myself a two in one system and hang
a<00:00:45.870> toolbox<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.770> side<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.440> little

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
a toolbox on this side and a a little

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.630 
a toolbox on this side and a a little
bit<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> inspiration<00:00:50.820> from<00:00:51.449> caribou<00:00:51.960> cases<00:00:52.640> or

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
bit of inspiration from caribou cases or

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.889 
bit of inspiration from caribou cases or
whoever<00:00:54.090> their<00:00:54.270> whatever<00:00:54.660> their<00:00:54.930> name<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:56.899> do

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
whoever their whatever their name is do

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.349 
whoever their whatever their name is do
a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> fabrication<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.480> and<00:01:02.359> get

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
a little bit of fabrication here and get

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
a little bit of fabrication here and get
some<00:01:03.390> cases<00:01:04.019> mounted<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.070> an<00:01:05.309> early

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
some cases mounted up here as an early

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.170 
some cases mounted up here as an early
04<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:07.250> didn't<00:01:08.250> come<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> rack

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
04 so it's didn't come with a rack

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.030 
04 so it's didn't come with a rack
system<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.680> make<00:01:10.740> something

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
system so I want to make something

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.609 
system so I want to make something
that's<00:01:11.250> relatively<00:01:11.960> lightweight<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that's relatively lightweight out of the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.340 
that's relatively lightweight out of the
way<00:01:14.750> use<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> rigidity<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> box

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
way use some of the rigidity of the box

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.609 
way use some of the rigidity of the box
for<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> structure<00:01:20.390> least<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
for the structure least that's the the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.270 
for the structure least that's the the
idea<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:24.560> as<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.770> say<00:01:25.950> I've<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
idea and then as you can say I've got a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.080 
idea and then as you can say I've got a
little<00:01:26.460> few<00:01:27.090> beauty<00:01:27.420> marks<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.250> on

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
little few beauty marks here and and on

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.840 
little few beauty marks here and and on
my<00:01:30.299> favorite<00:01:30.840> side<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.170> fall<00:01:31.350> down<00:01:31.820> even<00:01:32.820> more

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
my favorite side to fall down even more

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.810 
my favorite side to fall down even more
in<00:01:33.799> that<00:01:34.799> special<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.759> we've<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:37.020> Kevlar

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
in that special so we've got some Kevlar

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.880 
in that special so we've got some Kevlar
back<00:01:38.820> over<00:01:39.210> here

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.100 

in<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.580> pile<00:01:45.990> next<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.740> turbos<00:01:48.330> go<00:01:49.330> figure

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.890 

got<00:01:53.110> some<00:01:53.290> Kevlar<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.300> do<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.510> little<00:01:55.720> bit<00:01:55.869> of

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
got some Kevlar and I do a little bit of

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.740 
got some Kevlar and I do a little bit of
work<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.740> my<00:01:56.890> wife's<00:01:57.100> like<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.640> good<00:01:58.540> place
