00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.550
 third consequence of the bike tips or 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.099
 in equipment videos who put today 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.900
 we backpack you the trouble the annoying 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.279
 my brother always used before 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.580
 which he applies a little to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.660
 get and I'll ask today 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.439
 now just before 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.029
 First, we have one up here 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.330
 helmfach where we sometimes sometimes 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.180
 if we just build a ne harke 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.910
 Rheinpark or something like a few 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.960
 different things or for example 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.059
 also the folding spade I 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.660
 would be presented in treatment videos 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.079
 have the fits in here then also good 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 and that's just the helmfach then there 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.930
 it still a smaller fold 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.170
 there may be several pockets in there 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.160
 we have a first here now 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 Help pack in it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.110
 and another biscuit and the bag 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 for the mobile and something that's all 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.549
 good and one more trailer for one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.479
 key with it manifest and thus 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.689
 he does not get lost somewhere then 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.689
 there is next the big part 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.799
 For example, we also have the Eigler 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 reingemacht 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.939
 we take it to the movie but it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.939
 are just so basic things in it 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.770
 anyway like a hose pump like that 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.450
 what's just what you always need 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.689
 then there was one in the back 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.750
 small mesh pocket in it 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.860
 I hope you see is now and there came 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.619
 just a few small ones again 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:52.100
 make things rhyme 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:55.049
 yes, and then there is the back there 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.869
 extra extra extra one more 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.610
 extension because he now has 15 + 2 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.390
 liter that they are just these two 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.400
 liter extension of this whole 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.979
 More practical storage space is needed 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:15.630
 and then it's in the back 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:19.320
 a bag is right in the back 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.840
 bag for not what that does 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.020
 but if that is a bag 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 for the projector you either have it 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.680
 are just four versions of it as 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.860
 first there are two a blue and one 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.840
 the black who comes without projects and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.890
 one that comes directly with protector though 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.560
 The project can be there too 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.820
 reorder 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.060
 the protector just in and the 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.980
 circuit breaker because of the back therefore 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.540
 good and then you can still up here 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.950
 make a drinking bubble rhyme 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.440
 which then also take care to 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:56.820
 I would say that was it for 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.070
 the video as a small conclusion for the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.780
 is really great on the back and he 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.720
 also has enough storage space so mine 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.100
 opinion, you do not need more 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.020
 then I would say that was it for the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.360
 third followed or was already the fourth 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.830
 I do not remember what the third one is 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:19.640
 Winner has fallen then let 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.640
 a rating and asthma or people
