 that would ask him welcome on my hunger 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.130
 today if he hesitates and make a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.900
 very very simple video it's going to be pretty 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.179
 fast because it's another trait 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.210
 minimalist but awesome in phase on a 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.609
 your very good looks with a lot of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.750
 big cons president and I was inspired 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.449
 the cover of the month of July beyond 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.449
 from the chatelaine magazine so I read here 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.399
 I will insert a photo too 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 with the beautiful karine vanasse one of my 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.469
 May customers to nice to help because 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.570
 that she is a person absolutely 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.309
 fabulous severity of the crisis has for 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.500
 you no longer have the child really time 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.000
 today I did that with 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.379
 powders I know that not bad everything had 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 it was really I think it was 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.039
 not even rotten I was making a clear 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.039
 video of the photoshoot you will see 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.260
 how the karen beam looks very trÃ©s 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.000
 I posed -13 illuminated very very in 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 health there is nothing troops or re 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 but today I decided to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 to show a completely worn alternative 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.229
 more outside and that will last a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.650
 little longer because these 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.229
 attacks 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
 when not come fix the makeup 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.250
 it will not repair much effect but it was 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.380
 not the easiest thing to bring to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.810
 the outside of a day without or worse 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.570
 start tomorrow so I start with 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.490
 my lawyer at make up geek who 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 will be called panzo it's a company 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 cream colored and I would say she 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.189
 is a little nacry like jacques 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.620
 exodus all over the mobile eyelid 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.840
 until the reprieve 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.850
 then to go to define the hollow of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.410
 my skin cage is going to be worn creme brulee 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.870
 or once in makeup geek 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.120
 you will see I received a package of 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.560
 at make up geek so thanks and 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.890
 I use a lot of Congratulations 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.960
 Pierre 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.600
 today so just a little bit 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.340
 i'm going very very very slightly just 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.160
 to define them a little scared and write 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.150
 the dimension 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.350
 this time I take the number 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.750
 eyelids that's called knock 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.280
 I use another evasive brush but 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.290
 a little bit smaller that will help me to 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.550
 define them a little bit more the hollow 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.600
 of the eyelid and as we can see 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.270
 we should really be trying 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.060
 to create a natural number with floods of 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.020
 the strength and that's exactly what I 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.890
 thanks I mix and two shadows to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.240
 Magic act in the eyes of spotlight 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.790
 metallic eye shadows 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.470
 descheemaeker geek it's absolutely 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.110
 fabulous those eye shadows 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.640
 I dream I wanted to eat so much that 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.960
 it's beautiful so I mix the two 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.660
 together I fixed on the eyelid 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.180
 mobile and then with a flexible 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.770
 unjust ashmawy belays a little bit just 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.790
 to make sure we do not have a line 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.850
 still too distinguished afterwards for 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.530
 read also the finished texture game 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.030
 I apply the same eye shadows 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.550
 but this time on the finger you go 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.040
 to see that gave even more effect 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.140
 chandeliers and metal for what is 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.270
 from Montreal have I take nightend from 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.790
 in mac which is a half length 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.800
 Favorite with his spear that corner 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.170
 internal of the eye then go next 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.690
 applied it just under the eyebrow that is going 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.840
 really high all that is really going 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.020
 give a glare to the look today we 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.790
 uses all night stone shadows 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.160
 who have finished metal or who have a 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.230
 effect illustrated this shna creed 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.940
 I resume the struck color and I will 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.630
 call it really adjusts slightly 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.090
 under the eye 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.340
 so I would say the box if of the eye 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.070
 lower francs if you went chemistry 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.080
 all that and in regard to the eye 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.210
 lower internal I mix in my 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.920
 head my due manage applies both 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.570
 eyeshadow mix I learned 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.250
 on the mobile eyelid for what has 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.250
 interest in delhaize will enlarge the eye 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.280
 with my new chili favorite chili either 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.660
 ixabel nude velvet I do not believe that 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.640
 it's going to be a limited edition I think 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.380
 that's always going to be the so you 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.710
 have a table and the Sticks but I 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.710
 love 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.530
 to avi define their distillate I'm going 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.120
 go sting bada bing which is a strand 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.440
 still quite dark with a whole 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.450
 little bit the inner drama 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.160
 it's totally optional but I 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.960
 the applied individual cells that 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.340
 will help hide the fossil's root 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.200
 so before I apply your little ones 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.240
 fossils I still like applied from 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.620
 mascara it will give volume to missile 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.260
 then we have to follow that go well 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.000
 hang on to that so if one thing that 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.830
 I hate it's good to apply 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.720
 individual eyelashes on myself I find 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.480
 it's extremely difficult I do not know 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.710
 for you but let me know this 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.420
 that they are raising something very 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.050
 nine with a little bit of brown so 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.630
 I take brad the stick dechy jovian this 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.470
 direct like a square lip balm 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.450
 magic tintin 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.370
 you can see alone there is still 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.720
 young hue and over for a 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.900
 effect a little more glossy 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.740
 I'll take the way a plexiglass 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.230
 at make up for ever 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.810
 it's a color still six numbers 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.550
 of page what will enhance and give a 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.550
 little more heat to get up 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.419
 for the players applies a blush that 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.090
 is called optical simic romance then 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.250
 this blocher and peach dig with a 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.380
 little bit of reflection inside 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.210
 absolutely fabulous and like real is 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.699
 today that I change that I 'm applying 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.830
 whisper of guilt from mac who is a 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.130
 must's is favorite happy that I 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.020
 have used them so here we can 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.169
 see if the look very very far and very 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.630
 very shattered when I saw the 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.849
 cover of the chatelet j falls to love 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.889

 karin for the charlene blanket 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.849
 since as many ask me 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.530
 no it was team charlie sheen 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.130
 who are very very talented and who in 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.380
 does a perfect job and then it's

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.229
 is really really beautiful but if I 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.090
 can allow me 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.330
 when you open the first page of the 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.280

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.530
