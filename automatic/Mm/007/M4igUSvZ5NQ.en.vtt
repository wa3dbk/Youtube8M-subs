rookies<00:01:19.119> that<00:01:19.329> they<00:01:19.689> had<00:01:19.840> why<00:01:20.409> it's<00:01:20.590> so<00:01:20.709> tough

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
rookies that they had why it's so tough

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.649

for<00:01:20.979> mushers<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.639> do<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.909> classes<00:01:22.329> if<00:01:22.509> the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
for mushers to do the classes if the

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.620 
for mushers to do the classes if the
dogs<00:01:22.869> don't<00:01:23.139> know<00:01:23.350> where<00:01:23.529> they're<00:01:23.649> going<00:01:24.630> it's

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
dogs don't know where they're going it's

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.379 
dogs don't know where they're going it's
a<00:01:25.719> lot<00:01:25.869> more<00:01:26.319> difficult<00:01:26.859> psychologically<00:01:27.670> so

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389 
a lot more difficult psychologically so

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.209 
a lot more difficult psychologically so
to<00:01:28.450> have<00:01:28.689> veteran<00:01:29.200> dogs<00:01:29.439> every<00:01:29.770> year<00:01:30.009> and

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
to have veteran dogs every year and

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.469 
to have veteran dogs every year and
that's<00:01:30.369> why<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.549> do<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:30.880> race<00:01:31.119> over<00:01:31.299> here<00:01:31.420> it

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
that's why I do this race over here it

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.199 
that's why I do this race over here it
makes<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.810> quest<00:01:32.049> a<00:01:32.139> lot<00:01:32.289> easier<00:01:32.499> to<00:01:32.740> do<00:01:33.209> so

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
makes the quest a lot easier to do so

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.539 
makes the quest a lot easier to do so
none<00:01:34.389> of<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.599> rookies<00:01:34.959> made<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.439> they<00:01:36.399> all

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
none of the rookies made it they all

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
that way so i already know he's probably

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.520 
that way so i already know he's probably
know<00:03:14.519> when<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> races<00:03:15.120> weren't<00:03:15.269> together<00:03:16.019> so

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the more I realized that I beat him a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.150 
the more I realized that I beat him a
couple<00:03:19.049> years<00:03:19.170> ago<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.590> more<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.799> realized

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
couple years ago the more I realized

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.840

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
just keep plugging away and I knew that

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.199 
just keep plugging away and I knew that
this<00:03:25.830> year<00:03:26.040> was<00:03:26.160> sort<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.430> transition<00:03:27.030> here

so<00:03:41.150> it's<00:03:42.150> always<00:03:42.390> about<00:03:42.680> enjoying<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.860> moment

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
so it's always about enjoying the moment

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.680 
so it's always about enjoying the moment
but<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.400> was<00:03:44.549> thinking<00:03:45.030> about<00:03:45.090> what's<00:03:45.570> next

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
but I was thinking about what's next

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.470 
but I was thinking about what's next
round<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.590> bend<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.950> surprise<00:03:47.190> racing

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
round the bend the surprise racing

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
round the bend the surprise racing
that's<00:03:50.480> why<00:03:50.600> we<00:03:50.690> come<00:03:50.810> back<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.110> do<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.260> quest

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
that's why we come back and do the quest

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.750 
that's why we come back and do the quest
every<00:03:51.740> years<00:03:51.890> because<00:03:52.070> we<00:03:52.220> know<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.520> can<00:03:52.640> do

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
every years because we know we can do

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760 
every years because we know we can do
better<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.720> sometimes<00:03:53.960> it's<00:03:54.290> like<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.410> fool's

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
better and sometimes it's like a fool's

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.460 
better and sometimes it's like a fool's
game<00:03:55.250> we<00:03:55.970> play<00:03:56.150> with<00:03:56.330> ourselves<00:03:56.480> because

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
game we play with ourselves because

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.050 
game we play with ourselves because
usually<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.980> don't<00:03:58.130> do<00:03:58.370> much<00:03:58.550> better<00:03:58.760> because

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
usually you don't do much better because

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.060 
usually you don't do much better because
the<00:03:59.180> trail<00:03:59.420> tends<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.960> rely<00:04:00.290> make<00:04:00.710> you<00:04:00.830> realize

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
the trail tends to rely make you realize

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.760 
the trail tends to rely make you realize
that<00:04:01.100> you're<00:04:01.370> just<00:04:01.520> a<00:04:01.670> human<00:04:01.870> but<00:04:02.870> we<00:04:03.560> keep

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
that you're just a human but we keep

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.120 
that you're just a human but we keep
trying<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:05.330> quest<00:04:05.600> is<00:04:05.750> what<00:04:06.350> I'm<00:04:06.470> all<00:04:06.590> about<00:04:06.620> I

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
trying the quest is what I'm all about I

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.740 
trying the quest is what I'm all about I
mean<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.760> have<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.970> imagine<00:04:08.090> when<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.450> moved<00:04:08.630> up

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
mean you have to imagine when I moved up

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.450 
mean you have to imagine when I moved up
here<00:04:08.810> from<00:04:08.960> Chicago<00:04:09.620> all<00:04:09.770> I<00:04:09.830> knew<00:04:09.950> about<00:04:09.980> was<00:04:10.310> I

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
here from Chicago all I knew about was I

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.680 
here from Chicago all I knew about was I
did<00:04:10.640> her<00:04:10.730> out<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:10.880> didn't<00:04:11.120> know<00:04:11.270> what<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.450> quest

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
did her out I didn't know what the quest

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.340 
did her out I didn't know what the quest
was<00:04:11.930> but<00:04:12.710> once<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.190> started<00:04:13.370> dog<00:04:14.060> mushing<00:04:14.350> the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
was but once I started dog mushing the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.960 
was but once I started dog mushing the
quest<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.740> definitely<00:04:16.220> completely<00:04:16.430> different

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
quest is definitely completely different

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.340 
quest is definitely completely different
from<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.150> idea<00:04:17.330> to<00:04:17.450> have<00:04:17.540> in<00:04:17.660> many<00:04:17.780> respects

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
from the idea to have in many respects

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.650 
from the idea to have in many respects
it's<00:04:19.070> more<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.340> an<00:04:19.460> old-school<00:04:20.090> dog<00:04:20.360> mushing

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
it's more of an old-school dog mushing

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.510 
it's more of an old-school dog mushing
style<00:04:21.110> and<00:04:21.290> that's<00:04:21.770> why<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:21.920> like<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.400> got

to be on your own you got to be

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.770 
to be on your own you got to be
self-sufficient<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:25.210> for<00:04:26.210> me<00:04:26.300> it's<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.630> real

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780
