00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.209 

so<00:00:13.990> how<00:00:14.110> do<00:00:14.170> you<00:00:14.230> get<00:00:14.379> the<00:00:14.530> bubbles<00:00:14.950> in<00:00:15.129> the

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
so how do you get the bubbles in the

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.400 
so how do you get the bubbles in the
bottle<00:00:15.520> to<00:00:15.639> make<00:00:15.760> champagne<00:00:16.240> well<00:00:16.930> it's<00:00:17.230> a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
bottle to make champagne well it's a

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.590 
bottle to make champagne well it's a
special<00:00:17.980> process<00:00:18.400> called<00:00:18.910> secondary

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
special process called secondary

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.130 
special process called secondary
fermentation<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:22.180> you<00:00:22.330> take<00:00:22.539> though<00:00:22.779> take<00:00:23.109> a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
fermentation and you take though take a

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.050 
fermentation and you take though take a
wine<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:23.919> you<00:00:24.039> like<00:00:24.249> and<00:00:24.519> put<00:00:24.730> it<00:00:24.849> in<00:00:24.970> a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
wine that you like and put it in a

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.029 
wine that you like and put it in a
special<00:00:25.300> bottle<00:00:25.869> a<00:00:25.960> champagne<00:00:26.439> bottle

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
special bottle a champagne bottle

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.159 
special bottle a champagne bottle
that's<00:00:27.249> extra<00:00:27.939> heavy<00:00:28.320> add<00:00:29.320> sugar<00:00:29.829> and<00:00:30.189> yeast

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
that's extra heavy add sugar and yeast

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.970 
that's extra heavy add sugar and yeast
to<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.200> wine<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.390> beer<00:00:34.810> cap<00:00:35.050> on<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:35.500> which

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
to the wine put a beer cap on it which

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.780 
to the wine put a beer cap on it which
keeps<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.399> pressure<00:00:36.579> in<00:00:36.940> and<00:00:37.329> the<00:00:38.140> yeast

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
keeps the pressure in and the yeast

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.340 
keeps the pressure in and the yeast
ferments<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:39.910> sugar<00:00:40.270> inside<00:00:40.600> here<00:00:40.960> creates

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
ferments the sugar inside here creates

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.000 
ferments the sugar inside here creates
carbon<00:00:41.800> dioxide<00:00:42.370> which<00:00:43.210> is<00:00:43.420> dissolved<00:00:43.840> in<00:00:44.740> the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
carbon dioxide which is dissolved in the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.060 
carbon dioxide which is dissolved in the
wine<00:00:45.310> and<00:00:46.170> carbonates<00:00:47.170> it<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.560> also<00:00:47.680> puts

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
wine and carbonates it and also puts

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
wine and carbonates it and also puts
pressure<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.370> what<00:00:51.550> are<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:51.730> doing<00:00:51.970> now<00:00:52.150> oh

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
pressure in so what are you doing now oh

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.370 
pressure in so what are you doing now oh
this<00:00:53.710> is<00:00:53.830> called<00:00:54.070> riddling<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:56.050> is<00:00:56.200> how<00:00:56.320> you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
this is called riddling this is how you

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.260 
this is called riddling this is how you
get<00:00:56.590> all<00:00:56.710> that<00:00:56.890> dead<00:00:57.550> yeast<00:00:57.880> from<00:00:58.120> the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
get all that dead yeast from the

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.900 
get all that dead yeast from the
secondary<00:00:58.720> fermentation<00:00:59.310> to<00:01:00.310> go<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.700> top

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
secondary fermentation to go to the top

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.679 
secondary fermentation to go to the top
of<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.150> bottle<00:01:02.340> after<00:01:03.340> it's<00:01:03.670> done<00:01:03.910> shake<00:01:04.509> it

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
of the bottle after it's done shake it

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:11.100 
of the bottle after it's done shake it
up<00:01:05.700> upside<00:01:06.700> down<00:01:07.150> twist<00:01:08.079> it<00:01:08.460> turn<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.960> all

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
up upside down twist it turn it it all

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.870 
up upside down twist it turn it it all
settles<00:01:11.560> down<00:01:11.710> over<00:01:12.010> period<00:01:12.430> weeks<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
settles down over period weeks to the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.710 
settles down over period weeks to the
top<00:01:13.120> of<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.360> bottle<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.150> have<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.420> little

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
top of the bottle and you have a little

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.340 
top of the bottle and you have a little
plug<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.230> gunk<00:01:20.190> so<00:01:21.190> what<00:01:21.400> are<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.550> doing<00:01:21.850> oh

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
plug of gunk so what are you doing oh

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.170 
plug of gunk so what are you doing oh
this<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.470> called<00:01:23.740> disgorgement<00:01:24.490> fizzes

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
this is called disgorgement fizzes

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.550 
this is called disgorgement fizzes
getting<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:27.060> junk<00:01:28.060> out<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.420> bottle<00:01:31.560> so

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
getting the junk out of the bottle so

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.610 
getting the junk out of the bottle so
the<00:01:33.300> all<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.570> yeast<00:01:34.780> from<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.140> secondary

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
the all the yeast from the secondary

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.890 
the all the yeast from the secondary
fermentation<00:01:35.860> runs<00:01:36.640> down<00:01:36.909> into<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.240> bottom

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
fermentation runs down into the bottom

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.180 
fermentation runs down into the bottom
like<00:01:38.080> this<00:01:38.970> put<00:01:39.970> it<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.210> this<00:01:40.470> frozen<00:01:41.470> dry<00:01:41.950> ice

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
like this put it in this frozen dry ice

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.620 
like this put it in this frozen dry ice
and<00:01:42.460> alcohol<00:01:42.640> bath<00:01:43.560> let<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.680> freeze<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.630> then

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
and alcohol bath let it freeze and then

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.490 
and alcohol bath let it freeze and then
pop<00:01:46.930> off<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.350> top<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:49.860> POW<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.960> goes<00:01:53.260> all<00:01:53.470> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
pop off the top and POW out goes all the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.300 
pop off the top and POW out goes all the
junk<00:01:53.890> from<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.159> secondary<00:01:54.580> fermentation<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
junk from the secondary fermentation and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.920 
junk from the secondary fermentation and
the<00:01:57.369> bottle<00:01:57.850> is<00:01:58.020> recapped<00:01:59.020> again<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.840> it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
the bottle is recapped again and it

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.449 
the bottle is recapped again and it
quickly<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:03.220> not<00:02:03.369> too<00:02:03.520> much<00:02:03.670> pressure<00:02:05.640> lost

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
quickly so not too much pressure lost

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.339 
quickly so not too much pressure lost
it's<00:02:09.459> ready<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.700> go

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
