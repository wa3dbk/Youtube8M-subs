likely there's going to be a 29 inch
wheel<00:01:27.320> set<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:27.800> this<00:01:27.890> is<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.310> largest<00:01:28.729> wheel

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
better a bigger wheel gives you more

so<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.360> always<00:02:03.630> recommend<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.920> big<00:02:05.369> of

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
so we always recommend you get as big of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.490 
so we always recommend you get as big of
a<00:02:05.640> wheel<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:06.570> comfortable<00:02:07.080> with<00:02:07.200> many

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
a wheel as you're comfortable with many

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.919 
a wheel as you're comfortable with many
of<00:02:07.649> us<00:02:07.799> ride<00:02:08.340> 29<00:02:08.880> errs<00:02:09.030> here<00:02:09.269> but<00:02:09.720> ultimately

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
of us ride 29 errs here but ultimately

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.100 
of us ride 29 errs here but ultimately
that<00:02:10.830> decision<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.900> recommend

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that decision is up to you we recommend

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.160 
that decision is up to you we recommend
that<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.680> try<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.069> bikes<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> trail<00:02:15.510> so

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that you try the bikes on the trail so

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.809 
that you try the bikes on the trail so
you<00:02:16.230> are<00:02:16.530> comfortable<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.100> your<00:02:17.310> decision

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
you are comfortable with your decision

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.020 
you are comfortable with your decision
but<00:02:17.970> go<00:02:18.209> as<00:02:18.390> big<00:02:18.630> as<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.350> can<00:02:19.500> possibly<00:02:19.650> go

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.090 

so<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> big<00:02:26.300> question<00:02:26.510> these<00:02:26.930> days<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.500> which

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
so a big question these days is which

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.200 
so a big question these days is which
wheel<00:02:28.640> size<00:02:28.910> do<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.210> go<00:02:29.480> with<00:02:29.660> 29<00:02:30.460> 650b<00:02:31.460> it's<00:02:32.060> a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
wheel size do I go with 29 650b it's a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.160 
wheel size do I go with 29 650b it's a
great<00:02:32.510> question

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
great question

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.520 
great question
here<00:02:33.740> at<00:02:33.830> specialize<00:02:34.310> we've<00:02:34.670> spent<00:02:34.970> years

here at specialize we've spent years

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.990 
here at specialize we've spent years
dialing<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.650> our<00:02:36.800> geometries<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.610> make<00:02:37.790> the

best riding 29 errs out there we really

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.460 
best riding 29 errs out there we really
believe<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.910> them<00:02:41.030> it's<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.360> big<00:02:41.690> wheel<00:02:41.900> it's

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
believe in them it's a big wheel it's

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.560 
believe in them it's a big wheel it's
stable<00:02:43.010> they're<00:02:43.430> super<00:02:43.790> fun<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.150> ride<00:02:44.300> and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
stable they're super fun to ride and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.260 
stable they're super fun to ride and
we've<00:02:45.020> made<00:02:45.260> low<00:02:45.650> bottom<00:02:46.070> brackets<00:02:46.520> roomy<00:02:47.030> top

stays<00:02:49.340> out<00:02:49.580> there<00:02:49.760> these<00:02:49.910> bikes<00:02:50.240> are<00:02:50.450> light

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
stays out there these bikes are light

but<00:02:53.810> not<00:02:54.680> everybody<00:02:55.040> wants<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.370> ride<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.580> 29er

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
but not everybody wants to ride a 29er

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.870 
but not everybody wants to ride a 29er
and<00:02:56.360> we're<00:02:56.600> okay<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.530> have<00:02:57.770> a<00:02:58.040> huge

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
and we're okay with that we have a huge

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.510 
and we're okay with that we have a huge
range<00:02:59.210> of<00:02:59.570> 650b<00:03:00.410> bikes<00:03:00.890> out<00:03:01.070> there<00:03:01.310> and

range of 650b bikes out there and
there's<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.030> couple<00:03:02.240> of<00:03:02.510> options<00:03:02.660> that<00:03:03.530> might

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
there's a couple of options that might

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.490 
there's a couple of options that might
be<00:03:04.460> intriguing<00:03:04.940> for<00:03:05.210> you<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.480> try<00:03:05.690> out<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.380> if

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
be intriguing for you to try out so if

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.440 
be intriguing for you to try out so if
you're<00:03:06.620> looking<00:03:06.770> at<00:03:07.040> 29<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.610> you're<00:03:08.030> thinking

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
you're looking at 29 and you're thinking

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.720 
you're looking at 29 and you're thinking
man<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:09.020> know<00:03:09.560> what<00:03:09.710> I<00:03:09.740> would<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:10.550> to

man you know what I would just like to
have<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:10.910> bike<00:03:11.210> that<00:03:11.540> changes<00:03:12.290> direction<00:03:13.130> a

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
have a bike that changes direction a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.950 
have a bike that changes direction a
little<00:03:13.460> bit<00:03:13.730> quicker<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.150> bike<00:03:14.540> that's<00:03:14.810> going

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
little bit quicker a bike that's going

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.510 
little bit quicker a bike that's going
to<00:03:15.020> have<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.230> wheel<00:03:15.560> that's<00:03:15.770> just<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.130> little<00:03:16.370> bit

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
to have a wheel that's just a little bit

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.220 
to have a wheel that's just a little bit
lighter<00:03:16.850> that's<00:03:17.630> okay

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
lighter that's okay

lighter that's okay
650<00:03:19.040> B<00:03:19.250> might<00:03:19.880> be<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.090> good<00:03:20.390> option<00:03:20.570> for<00:03:20.960> you<00:03:21.080> the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
650 B might be a good option for you the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.620 
650 B might be a good option for you the
second<00:03:22.160> one<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.490> if<00:03:22.670> you're<00:03:23.060> looking<00:03:23.390> at<00:03:23.510> the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
second one is if you're looking at the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.440 
second one is if you're looking at the
bike<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.140> you're<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.650> going<00:03:24.830> man<00:03:25.430> that's<00:03:26.270> a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
bike and you're just going man that's a

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.710 
bike and you're just going man that's a
big<00:03:26.840> wheel<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> 29<00:03:28.280> inch<00:03:28.490> wheel<00:03:28.550> just<00:03:29.000> looks<00:03:29.330> too

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
big wheel a 29 inch wheel just looks too

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.590 
big wheel a 29 inch wheel just looks too
big<00:03:29.750> it's<00:03:30.260> intimidating<00:03:30.980> or<00:03:31.580> you<00:03:32.480> know<00:03:32.570> I

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
big it's intimidating or you know I

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.380 
big it's intimidating or you know I
don't<00:03:32.840> really<00:03:32.990> fit<00:03:33.410> well<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:33.980> bike<00:03:34.190> 650<00:03:35.180> B

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
don't really fit well on the bike 650 B

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.450 
don't really fit well on the bike 650 B
probably<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.230> good<00:03:36.410> option<00:03:36.620> for<00:03:36.800> you<00:03:37.070> as<00:03:37.250> well

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
probably a good option for you as well

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.300 
probably a good option for you as well
we<00:03:38.210> really<00:03:38.240> encourage<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:39.050> go<00:03:39.770> bigger

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
we really encourage you to go bigger

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.810 
we really encourage you to go bigger
than<00:03:40.430> 26<00:03:41.210> 650<00:03:41.840> B<00:03:42.020> is<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> bigger<00:03:42.740> better<00:03:43.520> wheel

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
than 26 650 B is a bigger better wheel

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.920 
than 26 650 B is a bigger better wheel
than<00:03:44.180> 26<00:03:44.750> but<00:03:45.640> ultimately<00:03:46.640> we<00:03:46.970> think<00:03:47.000> 29<00:03:47.690> is

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
than 26 but ultimately we think 29 is

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.140 
than 26 but ultimately we think 29 is
going<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.470> work<00:03:48.620> best<00:03:49.010> for<00:03:49.460> most<00:03:49.610> riders<00:03:49.850> out

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
going to work best for most riders out

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.420 
going to work best for most riders out
there<00:03:50.210> at<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.350> end<00:03:51.500> of<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.680> day<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:52.280> decision

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
there at the end of the day the decision

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.550 
there at the end of the day the decision
on<00:03:52.850> your<00:03:52.910> wheel<00:03:53.180> size<00:03:53.450> is<00:03:53.780> ultimately<00:03:54.320> up<00:03:54.530> to

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
on your wheel size is ultimately up to

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920
