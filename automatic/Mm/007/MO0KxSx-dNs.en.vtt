00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.360
 content to see what you can find 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.800
 black ops 12 depending on whether it is the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.479
 cooks are usually more rounds 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.159
 elevated although in whites 2 because there 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.960
 special weapons because there are traps 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.489
 although good we are also 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.100
 starting to implement now but good 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.989
 round is very high you can find them 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.089
 some world record that another one is worth 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.489
 as we call it world record 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.100
