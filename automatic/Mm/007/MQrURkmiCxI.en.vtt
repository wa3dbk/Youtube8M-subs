00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.250
 the plants of the subdivision 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.400
 gymnosperms as well as the plants of the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.220
 angiosperm subdivision belong to the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.900
 division sperm with either tourists or 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.119
 seeds also called phanerogams 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.820
 these gymnosperm plants are 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.370
 they differ from angiosperms in that 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.590
 the ovules and the seeds are not formed 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.620
 in closed cavities are not 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.850
 covered by a fruit are plants 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.449
 Woody of varied size 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.079
 they can be trees or shrubs and 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:53.510
 they comprise the 5 coniferous lines 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.510
 yes chains and tucked 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.710
 the gymnosperms are believed to have made their 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.750
 appearance 350 million years ago 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.330
 they were the most dominant large vegetation 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.460
 part of them went extinct but in 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.229
 currently there are several species 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.229
 highlighting the conifers 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.060
 Among the features more 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.030
 important of this group of plants 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.799
 Coniferous calls stand out for their great 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.020
 bearing 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.439
 some of these plants have reached 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.350
 up to 150 meters high are plants 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.550
 woody with very resistant trunks and 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.730
 very branched 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.480
 the gymnosperms develop cones like 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.510
 Fruiting organs 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.420
 present evergreen leaves capable of 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.890
 endure the long winter presenting 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.860
 variable shapes like needles scales 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.230
 fans and so on present their flowers 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.500
 men who produce pollen grains 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:01.060
 also female flowers that contain 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.860
 the ovules are rather fruitless 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.620
 most important feature of 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.530
 gymnosperms is that precisely their 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.600
 ovules are not protected by a fruit 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.810
 or berti floral cilia 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.760
 unlike angiosperms that if 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.760
 present the protected ovules 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.329
 the subdivision that permach us 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.409
 classified as follows in 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:32.340
 four classes five coniferous lines and 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:36.170
 chains and me tubs inside the class of 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.329
 the five lines highlights the ginko biloba 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.329
 it is said of this ginkgo biloba that it is a 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.879
 true living fossil it's about a 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.919
 Oico tree with female flowers and 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.790
 males lying on plants 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:52.769
 independent the leaves are deciduous in 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.280
 fan shape and conservation 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.829
 dichotomous in this species just like 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.530
 in the conifers the pollen is produced in 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.049
 some cones or strobe is fertilization 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.689
 they take place after receiving estrogen 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.659
 female pollen dispersed in a way 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:13.260
 nema gamma or by wind the 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:16.560
 seed is presented naked or is not 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.650
 within any fruit has this plant 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.650
 medicinal applications in certain 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.799
 Asian countries 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.439
 Ginkgo biloba can be the plant 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.569
 oldest gymnosperm that exists 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.109
 on earth 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.230
 a copy of 5 can live more than 3000 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.230
 years 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.489
 within the conifer class highlights the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.939
 final order and within the final order 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.760
 is the family and born there where we have 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.890
 as exemplars to many of the pines 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.370
 that we know 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.319
 For example, the pine tree named 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.540
 pinus pinea scientist 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.459
 we have other pine trees like pine 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.610
 scientific name pinus pinus 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.670
 halepensis 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.920
 within the final order we also have 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.270
 to a family of importance called 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:17.019
 family q prose seae 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:20.530
 cypresses belong to this family 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.240
 among the most important we have 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.960
 cupressus macrocarpa 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 funeral cupressus and cupressus 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.990
 sempervirens 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.979
 the class if strings within this class 

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:39.499
 we have an order of importance that is 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.569
 the order if channels and within this 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:45.680
 order if channels we have the family 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.460
 sanz either in this family is me 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.919
 and 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.749
 we have the name lion rib 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:56.059
 scientist will be cough mexican amia 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.289
 we also have the rubber palm of 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.580
 scientific name 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.580
 samia linden i 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.010
 they are also called sperm appointments are 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.820
 a link between the ferns and the 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.620
 sperm all have a huge resemblance 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.160
 with tree ferns or 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.650
 palm trees have simple flowers and 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.380
 lacking periana that even after 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.100
 of falling the flower continue to grow 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.260
 floral shafts as well as conifers 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.350
 the flowers are grouped in cones or strobe 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.020
 the so-called coated pineapples 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.020
 of flakes that are separated to allow 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.690
 the pollination which is carried out 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.639
 usually by the wind or in a way 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.150
 to nemo gamma 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:47.430
 finally we have the tub class 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.530
 this class includes very plants 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.290
 similar in appearance to angiosperms 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.480
 They are trees or bushes of various 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.550
 regions and even desert 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.640
 as a representative we have the 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.090
 kalahari striker by name 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.860
 scientist or the whiskey mirabilis these 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.890
 plants usually have flowers 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.510
 simple with stamens breaks though 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.510
 present sometimes sperian
