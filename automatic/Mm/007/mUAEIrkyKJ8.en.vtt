glad to be on okay so what are the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
glad to be on okay so what are the
implications<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:26.189> mankind<00:00:26.730> now<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> we

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
implications for mankind now that we

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
implications for mankind now that we
have<00:00:27.240> found<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.260> rocket<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.369> shot

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
have found with that rocket that we shot

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.999 
have found with that rocket that we shot
into<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.359> earth<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> surface<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
Moon that we found this water there what

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
Moon that we found this water there what
are<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.649> implications<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.399> us<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
are the implications for us this is a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.590 
are the implications for us this is a
potential<00:00:37.050> game-changer<00:00:37.500> nASA<00:00:38.460> has<00:00:38.670> hit<00:00:39.120> pay

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
potential game-changer nASA has hit pay

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.990 
potential game-changer nASA has hit pay
dirt<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.079> realize<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.500> ice<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> worth<00:00:41.550> five

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
dirt you realize that ice is worth five

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.479 
dirt you realize that ice is worth five
times<00:00:42.110> pound-for-pound<00:00:43.110> five<00:00:43.950> times<00:00:44.280> the

times pound-for-pound five times the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.209 
times pound-for-pound five times the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
value of gold on the moon this could

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.369 
value of gold on the moon this could
change<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.610> way<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.879> view<00:00:47.910> space<00:00:48.480> exploration

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
change the way we view space exploration

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.010 
change the way we view space exploration
living<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.460> land<00:00:50.489> using<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> ice<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.930> the

living off the land using the ice of the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.650 
living off the land using the ice of the
Moon<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.760> then<00:00:54.030> go<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
Moon and because if we then go to the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900 
Moon and because if we then go to the
moon<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.410> could<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:55.770> set<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> permanent<00:00:56.520> basis

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
moon we could then set a permanent basis

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
moon we could then set a permanent basis
there<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.510> deeper<00:00:57.809> exploration<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
there for deeper exploration is that

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.529 
there for deeper exploration is that
right<00:00:58.920> that's<00:00:58.949> right<00:00:59.399> hydrogen<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.329> used

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
right that's right hydrogen can be used

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.420 
right that's right hydrogen can be used
for<00:01:00.660> rocket<00:01:01.109> fuel<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.649> oxygen<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> water

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
for rocket fuel the oxygen in the water

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
for rocket fuel the oxygen in the water
could<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:02.969> used<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.239> breathing<00:01:03.809> water<00:01:04.409> could

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
could be used for breathing water could

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.429 
could be used for breathing water could
be<00:01:04.769> purified<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.369> drunk<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> also<00:01:06.960> water<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
be purified and drunk and also water is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
be purified and drunk and also water is
a<00:01:07.470> good<00:01:07.740> shielding<00:01:08.369> against<00:01:08.850> solar<00:01:09.180> flares

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
a good shielding against solar flares

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.230 
a good shielding against solar flares
and<00:01:09.840> cosmic<00:01:10.049> rays<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.860> out<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.220> space<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.060> was

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and cosmic rays in out of space this was

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840 
and cosmic rays in out of space this was
an<00:01:12.360> 80<00:01:12.630> million<00:01:13.020> dollar<00:01:13.350> gamble<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.400> it's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
an 80 million dollar gamble it's it's

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
an 80 million dollar gamble it's it's
it's<00:01:15.210> simply<00:01:15.570> paid<00:01:15.900> off<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.110> spades<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it's simply paid off in spades so is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.039 
it's simply paid off in spades so is
this<00:01:17.610> politically<00:01:18.240> important<00:01:18.689> though<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
this politically important though if the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.510 
this politically important though if the
President<00:01:19.470> Obama<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.130> people<00:01:20.340> saying

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
President Obama a lot of people saying

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.710 
President Obama a lot of people saying
well<00:01:20.580> how<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.030> afford<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
well how can we afford this right that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.899 
well how can we afford this right that
mission<00:01:22.290> where<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.799> blasted<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.520> thing<00:01:23.729> into

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
mission where we blasted that thing into

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.660 
mission where we blasted that thing into
the<00:01:24.000> surface<00:01:24.330> cost<00:01:24.540> 80<00:01:24.840> million<00:01:25.170> dollars<00:01:25.710> does

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the surface cost 80 million dollars does

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
the surface cost 80 million dollars does
this<00:01:26.850> gamble<00:01:27.299> pay<00:01:27.509> off<00:01:27.740> politically<00:01:28.740> for

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
this gamble pay off politically for

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.649 
this gamble pay off politically for
President<00:01:29.340> Obama<00:01:29.369> puts<00:01:29.820> pressure<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.450> obama

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
President Obama puts pressure on obama

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.840 
President Obama puts pressure on obama
because<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> augustine<00:01:31.920> report<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:32.579> said

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
because the augustine report has said

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.090 
because the augustine report has said
more<00:01:33.180> or<00:01:33.329> less<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.720> yanks<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.380> not<00:01:34.619> coming
