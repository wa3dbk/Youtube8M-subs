00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
what you were seeing through the look

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.810 
what you were seeing through the look
see<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:58.110> there's<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.830> alien<00:01:59.430> lady<00:01:59.670> oh<00:02:00.560> I

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
see and there's the alien lady oh I

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.430 
see and there's the alien lady oh I
could<00:02:02.820> show<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.000> some<00:02:03.150> better<00:02:03.390> clips<00:02:03.780> anyway

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
could show you some better clips anyway

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.620 
could show you some better clips anyway
you<00:02:04.590> get<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> idea<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:06.150> they're<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> clip

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
you get the idea and they're so I clip

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.210 
you get the idea and they're so I clip
it's<00:02:06.780> 30<00:02:06.990> seconds<00:02:07.350> long<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.560> basically<00:02:08.160> you

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
it's 30 seconds long so basically you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.889 
it's 30 seconds long so basically you
saw<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.490> woman<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.450> said<00:02:09.600> I<00:02:09.630> want<00:02:09.840> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
saw the woman and you said I want to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.690 
saw the woman and you said I want to
save<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.130> jumped<00:02:11.370> back<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
save that and then it jumped back and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
save that and then it jumped back and
that's<00:02:11.820> why<00:02:11.910> they<00:02:12.030> were<00:02:12.090> feet<00:02:12.330> there<00:02:12.510> because

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
that's why they were feet there because

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.020 
that's why they were feet there because
you<00:02:12.810> weren't<00:02:12.959> expecting<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.980> button<00:02:14.370> exactly

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
you weren't expecting the button exactly

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.449 
you weren't expecting the button exactly
and<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.080> app<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.590> allows<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.160> shrink

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
and on the app it allows you to shrink

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.890 
and on the app it allows you to shrink
the<00:02:17.610> clip<00:02:17.820> if<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.120> said<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.390> want<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> show
