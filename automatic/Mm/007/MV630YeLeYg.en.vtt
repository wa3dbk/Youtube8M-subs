00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
overwhelmed some people feel that

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.540 
overwhelmed some people feel that
Malignaggi<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.290> foolish<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.530> try<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.280> engage

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
Malignaggi was foolish to try and engage

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.979 
Malignaggi was foolish to try and engage
because<00:00:38.850> he<00:00:38.940> did<00:00:39.090> try<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.390> engage<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> little

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
because he did try and engage a little

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.970 
because he did try and engage a little
bit<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.290> Shawn<00:00:41.070> Porter<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:42.620> perhaps<00:00:43.620> that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
bit with Shawn Porter and perhaps that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.139 
bit with Shawn Porter and perhaps that
backfired<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.360> uh<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.739> lot<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.039> people

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
backfired but uh I think a lot of people

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.130 
backfired but uh I think a lot of people
overestimated<00:00:48.149> pulling<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.570> Elijah<00:00:48.780> coming

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
overestimated pulling on Elijah coming

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.660 
overestimated pulling on Elijah coming
into<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> fight<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.950> how<00:00:50.190> well<00:00:50.430> he

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
into the fight because of how well he

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.459 
into the fight because of how well he
did<00:00:50.820> against<00:00:52.399> Adrien<00:00:53.399> Broner<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:55.230> fact
