00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.760
 how is my name joanne biliary and in 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.309
 this video would like to tell you about 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.580
 important gobieno at the time of starting 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.770
 this photo good handling in the hour 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.160
 that I am in the studio 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.890
 I always try to take my pictures in 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.570
 raw format since it is by format me 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:37.770
 gives more options to be able to change settings 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 inside raw camera and things that jpg not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.290
 can give that option since it is a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.780
 compressed format to be able to open in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 any raw format image viewer 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.850
 often does not open with when with a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.320
 windows image viewer but to 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.350
 less than we achieve with breaks 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.520
 we can not see it good that I opened this 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 image as you can see, notice that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.409
 clicking twice on bridge opens me 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.039
 directly the photoshop image 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.130
 so when I'm going to start it's not the 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.850
 idea the idea is that when abraham equal 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.859
 to him now directly to rare camera 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.650
 as you can see in this image that has 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:28.300
 a comparison they see that the others do not have it 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.670
 it's because these images are jb and these 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.540
 jpg that I have it looks like I had 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 selected 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.830
 you can open it by 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 through an option 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.560
 that we have in bridge to be able to open more 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.470
 in that is the good draw for there what 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.480
 what I do is that you pressed advanced key 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.580
 more r 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.730
 and I will generate this comrade image 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.260
 as you see now I already have my low and 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.710
 open on camera or as you can see already 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.369
 I will be able 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.910
 and make some adjustments using this 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.510
 plan is that we see here on the right and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.510
 as well 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.630
 we can make that process revealed 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.330
 that we need so much to carry out 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.330
 this photo manipulation 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.730
 as you see 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.660
 here I can move the exhibition a little 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:46.250
 to give and the fact that potero 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.250
 be maintained to be able to open the next 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.830
 the next time I tell you again very 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.890
 good as you can see or execute the 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.880
 image again or this error generated it 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.950
 because he has not yet closed the main jpg 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.230
 I had open 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:12.620
 and close now we apply twice 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:15.769
 and if it is if it is executed as if it were 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.440
 an image this is not an idea but 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.670
 although 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.130
 this type of retouching needs images 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.620
 in degree 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.130
 would fight this option as they see 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.630
 this fishing says open image for that 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.350
 then I will explain how to adjust everything 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.470
 this 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.800
 to be able to use 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.800
 this option as an intelligent object
