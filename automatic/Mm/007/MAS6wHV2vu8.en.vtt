00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.800
 introduction and 360 degree view 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.410
 always there and always ready mobile phone 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.240
 or smartphone cameras are out of ours 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.130
 everyday life is indispensable 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.020
 it fits in well with the picture that the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.150
 smartphone cameras are getting better and better 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.070
 and cheap compact cameras always 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.570
 come closer 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.910
 that is another reason why there has been a trend in 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.980
 Photo market is developing away from the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.010
 cheap compact cameras to the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.900
 good smartphone camera 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.600
 We got three high end smartphones 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.559
 The lab was brought with three good ones 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.170
 digital cameras want to convince 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.909
 Now, of course, the question arises 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.350
 a smartphone a simple one 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.870
 replace compact camera 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.000
 after a longer downtrend has 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.000
 nokia end of last year with the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.269
 lumia 920 again a highend smartphone 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.210
 Launched on the market is the Nokia Lumia 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.610
 920 is the second with the pure view 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.590
 technology equipped smartphone and 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.799
 places special emphasis on the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.440
 integrated digital camera the optics of 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.869
 lumia 920 is from carl zeiss and 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.899
 has the first smartphone objectively 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.369
 an optical image stabilizer 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.380
 that lets you take the pictures and videos 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.869
 without the disadvantages of a digital one 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.030
 image stabilization absorb the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.549
 focal length of carl zeiss optik 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.240
 at 26 mm small image equivalent 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.009
 the light intensity f2 as a picture sensor becomes 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.259
 a back-illuminated cmos sensor 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.289
 used one third is so big 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.939
 and set from iso 100 to iso 800 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.789
 can be 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.329
 the image resolution of the lumia 920 is 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.799
 at 8 7 megapixel videos will be in full 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.320
 hd resolution 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.520
 in the dark the pictures should 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.770
 a dual led to be brightened 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.619
 A little less far is click 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.570
 galaxy s3 equipped because samsung almost 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.460
 can not give any information to the camera 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.979
 Here we are just a focal length of something 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.989
 less than 30 millimeters also estimate 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.420
 The size of the image sensor is unknown 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.379
 Its sensor sensitivity can be 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.849
 set between iso 100 and iso 800 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.739
 after all, the lens of the lens can 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.160
 read from the exile formations 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.549
 become 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.620
 she is at f2 6 also apple wraps herself 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.110
 Silence to the camera of the iPhone 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 The focal length of the iPhone 5 is in 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.099
 each case significantly less wide angle 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.200
 me as the other two models 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.290
 It should be about a focal length 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.440
 Just under 35 mm, the aperture of the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.870
 Objective is at f2 4 the iso value 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.880
 came iphone 5 did not change 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.819
 however, it automatically becomes between iso 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.819
 50 and iso 3,200 set
