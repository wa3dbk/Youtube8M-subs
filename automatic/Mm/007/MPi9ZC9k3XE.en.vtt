less and more or more insignificant

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690 
less and more or more insignificant
because<00:01:13.200> they're<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.890> strong<00:01:14.010> or<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.460> as

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
because they're not as strong or not as

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
because they're not as strong or not as
big<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.299> ripped<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.530> know

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
big or not as ripped or not as you know
and<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.610> guess<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.970> type<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> hate<00:01:18.420> goes

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and and I guess this type of hate goes

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
and and I guess this type of hate goes
on<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.960> every<00:01:19.170> type<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.590> sport<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.189> every<00:01:20.610> type

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
on in every type of sport and every type

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.390 
on in every type of sport and every type
of<00:01:21.000> thing<00:01:21.299> whether<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.750> business<00:01:21.960> or<00:01:22.409> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
of thing whether it's business or you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
of thing whether it's business or you
know<00:01:23.520> looks<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.060> otherwise<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.840> there's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
know looks or otherwise you know there's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.640

think this community would be a lot

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.370 
think this community would be a lot
nicer<00:01:30.060> community<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> part<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.350> people
