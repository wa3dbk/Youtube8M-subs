00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
it's curved around the edge so it kind

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.350 
it's curved around the edge so it kind
of<00:03:22.590> looks<00:03:22.769> like<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.280> top<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.090> an<00:03:24.209> ice<00:03:24.300> cream
