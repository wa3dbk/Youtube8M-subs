00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
all right now I'm actually just working

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.620 
all right now I'm actually just working
on<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.230> horse<00:04:14.680> man<00:04:14.950> achievement<00:04:15.819> Friday<00:04:16.509> I

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
on the horse man achievement Friday I

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.300 
on the horse man achievement Friday I
think<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:16.989> was<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.109> horse<00:04:17.289> man<00:04:17.470> won<00:04:17.669> but<00:04:18.669> writing

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
think it was a horse man won but writing

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.490 
think it was a horse man won but writing
I<00:04:21.870> think<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.900> hundred<00:04:23.199> miles<00:04:23.770> on<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.940> force

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
I think a hundred miles on the force

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.159 
I think a hundred miles on the force
which<00:04:26.500> is<00:04:26.850> ludicrous

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
which is ludicrous

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.529 
which is ludicrous
it's<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:31.060> insane<00:04:33.210> now<00:04:34.210> if<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.389> was<00:04:34.479> a

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
it's it's insane now if it was a

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.840 
it's it's insane now if it was a
ten-mile<00:04:34.870> achievement<00:04:35.380> I'll<00:04:35.500> be<00:04:35.620> okay<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.370> kind

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
ten-mile achievement I'll be okay I kind

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.510 
ten-mile achievement I'll be okay I kind
of<00:04:36.940> get<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.090> makes<00:04:37.840> sense<00:04:39.900> oh<00:04:41.250> my<00:04:42.250> what's

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520

leave flow yeah all right so just make a
way<00:05:34.240> through<00:05:34.419> this<00:05:34.539> tunnel<00:05:34.750> and<00:05:38.280> we're

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
way through this tunnel and we're

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.909 
way through this tunnel and we're
actually<00:05:39.430> very<00:05:39.610> close<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.479> it<00:05:40.599> now<00:05:40.860> all<00:05:41.860> right

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
actually very close to it now all right

actually very close to it now all right
when<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.370> get<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.520> this<00:05:42.789> sequence<00:05:43.330> where

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
when you get to this sequence where

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.629 
when you get to this sequence where
you're<00:05:43.780> doing<00:05:43.930> a<00:05:44.050> lot<00:05:44.259> of<00:05:44.289> the<00:05:44.530> air<00:05:44.919> gliding

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
you're doing a lot of the air gliding

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.760 
you're doing a lot of the air gliding
and<00:05:45.819> then<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.240> well<00:05:47.110> I'm<00:05:47.169> going<00:05:47.319> to<00:05:47.349> say<00:05:47.560> hook

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
and then the well I'm going to say hook

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.930 
and then the well I'm going to say hook
shotting<00:05:48.360> just<00:05:49.360> because<00:05:49.629> I<00:05:49.750> like<00:05:49.900> Zelda<00:05:50.940> when

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
shotting just because I like Zelda when

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.460 
shotting just because I like Zelda when
you<00:05:52.000> get<00:05:52.120> to<00:05:52.240> this<00:05:52.360> area<00:05:52.419> you're<00:05:53.080> going<00:05:53.199> to<00:05:53.289> go

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
you get to this area you're going to go

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.080 
you get to this area you're going to go
there<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.720> go<00:05:55.720> backwards<00:05:56.879> so<00:05:57.879> what<00:05:58.000> I<00:05:58.030> did

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
there and go backwards so what I did

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.469 
there and go backwards so what I did
there

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
there

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.450 
there
I<00:05:58.509> basically<00:05:59.500> went<00:05:59.740> backwards<00:06:00.159> from<00:06:00.340> that

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
I basically went backwards from that

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.100 
I basically went backwards from that
area<00:06:00.639> instead<00:06:01.030> of<00:06:01.120> going<00:06:01.270> forward<00:06:01.509> and<00:06:01.780> your

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
area instead of going forward and your

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.159 
area instead of going forward and your
chest<00:06:02.319> would<00:06:02.500> actually<00:06:02.889> be<00:06:03.009> right<00:06:03.430> up<00:06:03.550> here

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
chest would actually be right up here

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.490 
chest would actually be right up here
somewhere<00:06:05.169> I<00:06:05.590> think<00:06:05.909> kind<00:06:06.909> of<00:06:06.969> this<00:06:07.569> area<00:06:07.960> or

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
somewhere I think kind of this area or

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.629 
somewhere I think kind of this area or
maybe<00:06:09.039> even<00:06:09.129> on<00:06:09.520> this<00:06:09.759> thing<00:06:10.199> the<00:06:11.199> ads<00:06:11.379> there

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
maybe even on this thing the ads there

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.459 
maybe even on this thing the ads there
so<00:06:12.639> go<00:06:12.759> collect<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:13.180> then<00:06:13.539> start<00:06:13.870> doing<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.169> XP

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
so go collect it then start doing the XP

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.730 
so go collect it then start doing the XP
farming<00:06:14.860> and<00:06:15.750> yeah<00:06:16.750> if<00:06:17.349> you<00:06:17.469> have<00:06:17.560> any<00:06:17.650> more
