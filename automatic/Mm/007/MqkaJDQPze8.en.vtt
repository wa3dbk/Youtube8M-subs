00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.760
 so still there is one piece of advice when we go out 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.900
 open country 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.129
 we can make noise is miss low round 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.349
 immediate round we went further than this 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.770
 car we are trying to understand where is 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.500
 adversary ie he is either on 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.740
 zigzag either on the steps or there in 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.010
 dark either just far away either 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.320
 swp either just with the ring we are trying 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.260
 about check let's say we give a few 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.270
 patrons where there might be 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.190
 the enemy that is, into the darkness we give there 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.650
 because here it can be calm 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.390
 adversary to become on wait we can not 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.850
 mean just kill us all the more 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.460
 you know that i have a black cat shape 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.680
 can merge with this spot of shadow and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.880
 so you can just give other 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.149
 there a couple of rounds and check if there 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.280
 the enemy is usually 10 percent for example 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.829
 when you shoot correctly 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.560
 correctly give these two patrons which 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.140
 whether children will be in principle 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.240
 to the level of the opponent's head you can 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.670
 here these other kiev they say so 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.460
 kill the enemy you are not easy there 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.460
 do some kind of check if he's there you are 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.680
 just shoot back get either 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.399
 the fact that you killed him or that you 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.399
 he was torn down 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.060
 more than half hp so just 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.030
 learn on 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 loud rounds inflicted in rounds on 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.970
 arkadak do here such here 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.490
 shooting let's say so if you know what 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.450
 this content is shot through in my opinion he 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.030
 not immediately 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.030
 It does not sweep sweep and not 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:52.000
 no you can just go to the bomble 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.520
 barrels shoot for example there here 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.049
 again in x-go now there are few things 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:03.369
 who are shooting through so i think 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:07.619
 that you can not do this so 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.619
 try and shoot and fall
