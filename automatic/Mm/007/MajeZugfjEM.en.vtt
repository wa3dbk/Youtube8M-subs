00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
to follow this sign this sign will be

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.770 
to follow this sign this sign will be
either<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:34.200> top<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> bottom<00:00:35.600> near<00:00:36.600> the

sink in the same direction and put it in
the<00:00:44.789> slot<00:00:49.039> after<00:00:50.039> putting<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> slot

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the slot after putting it in the slot

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
the slot after putting it in the slot
just<00:00:51.300> put<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.079> finger<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.160> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
which has a micro SIM slot let me try it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:21.480 
which has a micro SIM slot let me try it
out

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:39.609 

switch<00:01:22.490> on<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.729> phone

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.889 

so<00:01:40.490> if<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.820> doesn't<00:01:41.000> give<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.450> same<00:01:41.630> color

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
so if it doesn't give the same color

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:50.260 
so if it doesn't give the same color
that<00:01:42.259> means<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.679> seam<00:01:42.859> is<00:01:43.009> working<00:01:43.369> fine<00:01:49.270> you

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
that means the seam is working fine you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.800 
that means the seam is working fine you
go

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
go

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:04.670 
go
so<00:01:51.679> it<00:01:52.399> has<00:01:52.609> rector<00:01:53.030> simcha<00:01:53.509> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
