00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.069 
at some point a game by yasser seer juan
playing<00:03:31.230> black<00:03:31.500> where<00:03:31.799> he<00:03:31.950> played<00:03:32.190> Bishop<00:03:32.579> d7

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
playing black where he played Bishop d7

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.000 
playing black where he played Bishop d7
obviously<00:03:34.079> not<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.350> position<00:03:34.560> but

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
obviously not in this position but

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.530 
obviously not in this position but
Bishop<00:03:35.280> e7<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:37.500> author<00:03:37.709> John<00:03:38.579> poo-pooed

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
Bishop e7 and the author John poo-pooed

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.630 
Bishop e7 and the author John poo-pooed
this<00:03:39.780> move<00:03:40.019> thinking<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.950> was<00:03:41.070> not<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.430> good

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
this move thinking it was not so good

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.310 
this move thinking it was not so good
and<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:41.970> think<00:03:42.030> maybe<00:03:42.359> Yasser<00:03:42.750> may<00:03:42.959> have<00:03:43.049> drawn

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
and I think maybe Yasser may have drawn

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.979 
and I think maybe Yasser may have drawn
the<00:03:43.500> game<00:03:43.709> or<00:03:43.950> possibly<00:03:44.340> lost<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.000> game<00:03:45.239> but

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
the game or possibly lost the game but

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.259 
the game or possibly lost the game but
it<00:03:46.109> wasn't<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.560> good<00:03:46.709> idea

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
it wasn't a good idea

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.259 
it wasn't a good idea
fast<00:03:48.269> forward<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.780> chapter<00:03:49.230> 8<00:03:49.769> of<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.820> very

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
position you had to go do a search for

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.640 
position you had to go do a search for
all<00:05:16.860> games<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:18.569> reach<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:19.080> position<00:05:19.500> and

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
all games that reach that position and

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.409 
all games that reach that position and
then<00:05:20.250> got<00:05:20.490> all<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.699> information<00:05:20.909> from<00:05:21.270> those
