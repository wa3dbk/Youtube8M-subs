that<00:04:13.920> then<00:04:14.920> what<00:04:15.160> you<00:04:15.250> want<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.520> do<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.850> make

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
that then what you want to do is make

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.640 
that then what you want to do is make
sure<00:04:16.060> this<00:04:16.540> is<00:04:16.750> pushed<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.230> all<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.410> way

flush and that's properly closed and

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.690 
flush and that's properly closed and
then<00:04:23.470> your<00:04:23.620> screen<00:04:24.010> should<00:04:24.220> be<00:04:24.340> back<00:04:24.550> to
