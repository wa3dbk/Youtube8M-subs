00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:16.140 
hi this is zoom the new video star skull

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.779 
hi this is zoom the new video star skull
using<00:00:17.140> a<00:00:17.470> park<00:00:18.000> black<00:00:19.000> and<00:00:19.180> white<00:00:19.300> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
using a park black and white and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.630 
using a park black and white and
transplant<00:00:21.789> colors<00:00:22.179> yellow<00:00:22.960> green<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:23.499> red

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.069 

so<00:00:27.640> this<00:00:27.789> is<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:28.419> first<00:00:28.800> cover<00:00:29.800> stencil<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:32.050> I

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
so this is the first cover stencil so I

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.540 
so this is the first cover stencil so I
need<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:33.540> dark<00:00:34.540> background<00:00:36.810> do<00:00:37.810> like<00:00:38.170> some

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
need the dark background do like some

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:50.820 
need the dark background do like some
freehand<00:00:40.830> flame<00:00:41.830> stuff<00:00:48.900> so<00:00:49.900> you<00:00:49.960> have<00:00:50.470> like

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
freehand flame stuff so you have like

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.880 
freehand flame stuff so you have like
the<00:00:50.860> dark<00:00:52.050> star<00:00:53.050> shape<00:00:54.990> now<00:00:55.990> this<00:00:56.200> second

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
the dark star shape now this second

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.690 
the dark star shape now this second
stencil<00:00:57.250> we're<00:00:57.400> using<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:58.180> same<00:00:58.540> white<00:00:58.810> but

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
stencil we're using the same white but

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.350 
stencil we're using the same white but
just<00:01:00.700> with<00:01:00.910> less<00:01:01.150> up<00:01:01.420> Bekasi<00:01:01.990> so<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.119> light

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
just with less up Bekasi so it's a light

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.890 
just with less up Bekasi so it's a light
gray

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.960 

then<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:12.650> change<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.700> black<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:15.190> POC<00:01:16.190> black

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.180 

the<00:01:19.970> switch<00:01:20.270> stencil<00:01:23.350> but<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.500> can<00:01:24.650> do<00:01:24.830> like<00:01:25.160> a

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
the switch stencil but you can do like a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:36.399 
the switch stencil but you can do like a
hundred<00:01:25.640> percent<00:01:25.760> black

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.779 

so<00:01:37.040> now<00:01:37.250> comes<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:37.670> number<00:01:38.090> four<00:01:38.329> with<00:01:38.659> with

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
so now comes to number four with with

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.060 
so now comes to number four with with
again<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.820> black<00:01:41.350> but<00:01:42.350> just<00:01:43.280> glass<00:01:43.490> legacy<00:01:44.119> so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
again the black but just glass legacy so

00:01:45.070 --> 00:02:01.130 
again the black but just glass legacy so
like<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.280> light<00:01:46.490> gray

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.300 

so<00:02:01.680> now<00:02:01.920> I'm<00:02:02.070> using<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.640> first<00:02:04.310> negative

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so now I'm using the first negative

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.779 
so now I'm using the first negative
stance<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:06.030> positives<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.690> them<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.550> put<00:02:08.550> on

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
stance all positives of them and put on

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.720 
stance all positives of them and put on
some<00:02:09.210> shadows<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.350> edges<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.100> star<00:02:11.460> so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
some shadows at the edges of the star so

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.990 
some shadows at the edges of the star so
that<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.990> image<00:02:13.320> appears<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:14.070> inside<00:02:14.700> to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that the image appears to be inside to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.760 
that the image appears to be inside to
starve<00:02:15.740> because<00:02:16.740> they<00:02:16.890> are<00:02:17.010> shadow<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.550> lines

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
starve because they are shadow of lines

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.610 
starve because they are shadow of lines
now<00:02:19.770> I'm<00:02:19.890> using<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.460> Trenton<00:02:21.060> colors<00:02:21.620> I'm

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
now I'm using the Trenton colors I'm

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.250 
now I'm using the Trenton colors I'm
first<00:02:22.950> using<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.580> work<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.970> yellow<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.020> as

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
first using the work the yellow and as

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.520 
first using the work the yellow and as
you<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.560> everything<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.280> that's<00:02:27.150> white

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
you can see everything that that's white

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.930 
you can see everything that that's white
now<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.709> yellow<00:02:29.070> everything<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:29.700> black

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
now is yellow everything that's black

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.660 
now is yellow everything that's black
stays<00:02:30.300> black<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.050> that's<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.560> huge<00:02:32.040> advantage

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
stays black so that's a huge advantage

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.699 
stays black so that's a huge advantage
of<00:02:33.209> transport<00:02:33.990> colors<00:02:34.580> now<00:02:35.580> I'm<00:02:35.700> using<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
of transport colors now I'm using the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.490 
of transport colors now I'm using the
green<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.750> should<00:02:40.560> see<00:02:40.770> again<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.630> can<00:02:42.630> mix

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
green and I should see again I can mix

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.490 
green and I should see again I can mix
the<00:02:44.010> colors<00:02:44.040> yellow<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.090> green<00:02:45.360> directly<00:02:46.350> on

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the colors yellow and green directly on

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.760 
the colors yellow and green directly on
the<00:02:46.650> surface<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.750> get<00:02:49.080> different<00:02:49.260> shades

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
the surface so you get different shades

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:57.470 
the surface so you get different shades
of<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.250> green<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:55.980> was<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.700> for<00:02:57.209> drawing

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
of of green so this was just for drawing

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.380 
of of green so this was just for drawing
the<00:02:57.900> picture<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:01.220> now<00:03:02.220> I'm<00:03:02.520> using<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.090> park

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the picture and now I'm using you park

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.920 
the picture and now I'm using you park
white<00:03:03.600> again<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.380> do<00:03:04.650> some<00:03:04.860> highlights<00:03:05.930> inside

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
white again to do some highlights inside

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:24.790 
white again to do some highlights inside
the<00:03:07.140> skull<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.890> star<00:03:08.160> shape

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.380 

so<00:03:25.280> then<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.790> have<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.450> highlights<00:03:28.390> in

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
so then you have like the highlights in

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.330 
so then you have like the highlights in
the<00:03:29.660> skull<00:03:30.910> again<00:03:31.910> now<00:03:32.090> I'm<00:03:32.300> starting<00:03:32.950> with<00:03:33.950> II

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
the skull again now I'm starting with II

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.330 
the skull again now I'm starting with II
transplant<00:03:35.330> Keller<00:03:35.570> sound<00:03:35.960> just<00:03:36.860> paint<00:03:37.160> over

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
transplant Keller sound just paint over

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:49.020 
transplant Keller sound just paint over
the<00:03:37.490> white<00:03:37.520> again<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:43.220> using<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.850> green<00:03:44.120> also

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.940 

so<00:03:50.030> that<00:03:50.240> at<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.690> third<00:03:50.960> time<00:03:51.200> at<00:03:51.410> are<00:03:51.560> using

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
so that at the third time at are using

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.280 
so that at the third time at are using
the<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.580> white<00:03:52.760> stencil<00:03:53.240> I<00:03:53.390> can<00:03:53.960> lay<00:03:54.140> out

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
the the white stencil I can lay out

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.580 
the the white stencil I can lay out
really<00:03:54.710> the<00:03:54.830> highlights<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.760> skull<00:03:56.590> same

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
really the highlights of the skull same

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.300 
really the highlights of the skull same
with<00:03:57.890> flames<00:04:00.160> just<00:04:01.160> adding<00:04:01.640> some<00:04:02.120> new<00:04:03.310> shapes

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
with flames just adding some new shapes

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.140 
with flames just adding some new shapes
in<00:04:04.580> there<00:04:05.140> which<00:04:06.140> we<00:04:06.380> can<00:04:06.520> afterwards<00:04:10.150> make

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
in there which we can afterwards make

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.570 
in there which we can afterwards make
yellow<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.690> green<00:04:11.810> again<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:16.100> this<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.400> using

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
yellow and green again so this is using

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.030 
yellow and green again so this is using
the<00:04:16.730> first<00:04:16.970> stencil<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.799> make<00:04:18.799> some

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
the first stencil to make some

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:35.390 
the first stencil to make some
highlights<00:04:19.900> behind<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.140> star

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.879 

so<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.300> for<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.720> effect<00:04:37.110> if<00:04:37.290> you<00:04:37.380> like<00:04:37.680> it

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
so this is for the effect if you like it

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.400 
so this is for the effect if you like it
to<00:04:38.190> make<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.419> eyes<00:04:39.720> glow

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.230 

so<00:04:43.729> again<00:04:44.729> yellow<00:04:46.160> for<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.280> full<00:04:47.550> eye<00:04:47.880> and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
so again yellow for the full eye and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:05:14.240 
so again yellow for the full eye and
then<00:04:48.620> like<00:04:49.620> a<00:04:49.650> little<00:04:49.770> rat<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:51.540> make<00:04:51.750> some<00:04:51.990> glow

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.970 

so<00:05:14.940> then<00:05:15.180> we<00:05:15.390> add<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.960> first<00:05:16.110> stencil<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.830> is

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
so then we add the first stencil it is

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.360 
so then we add the first stencil it is
the<00:05:17.160> white<00:05:17.580> stencil<00:05:18.060> again<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:19.310> this<00:05:20.310> time

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
the white stencil again and this time

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.270 
the white stencil again and this time
you<00:05:20.910> know<00:05:21.060> do<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.690> whole<00:05:21.720> stencil<00:05:22.530> white<00:05:22.890> but

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
you know do the whole stencil white but

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.920 
you know do the whole stencil white but
just<00:05:23.750> some<00:05:26.300> special<00:05:27.300> spots<00:05:27.810> where<00:05:28.230> you<00:05:28.380> think

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
just some special spots where you think

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.200 
just some special spots where you think
there<00:05:30.930> would<00:05:31.140> be<00:05:31.170> a<00:05:31.320> highlight<00:05:31.890> in<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:33.060> whole

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
there would be a highlight in the whole

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.190 
there would be a highlight in the whole
skull<00:05:35.360> so<00:05:36.360> that<00:05:36.600> resists<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:38.600> teeth<00:05:39.600> pop<00:05:39.960> out

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
skull so that resists the teeth pop out

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:48.980 
skull so that resists the teeth pop out
or<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:42.240> skeleton<00:05:42.750> parts<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.820> then<00:05:48.180> again<00:05:48.420> like

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
or the skeleton parts so then again like

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.370 
or the skeleton parts so then again like
use<00:05:49.710> yellow<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:50.400> green<00:05:52.130> to<00:05:53.900> mask<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:55.110> little

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
use yellow and green to mask a little

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.570 
use yellow and green to mask a little
bit<00:05:55.500> of<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:56.250> white<00:05:56.430> inside<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.870> flames<00:05:58.580> so

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
bit of the white inside the flames so

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.490 
bit of the white inside the flames so
that<00:05:59.790> there<00:05:59.970> are<00:06:00.090> different<00:06:00.600> green<00:06:01.170> shades

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
that there are different green shades

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:08.150 
that there are different green shades
not<00:06:01.830> white<00:06:04.340> so<00:06:05.340> everything<00:06:05.850> is<00:06:06.570> really<00:06:07.320> nice

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160
