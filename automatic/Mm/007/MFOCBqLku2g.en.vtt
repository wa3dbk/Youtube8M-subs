upwards of three hundred thousand

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.350 
upwards of three hundred thousand
dollars<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.079> lot<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.349> coin<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:49.180> i

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
dollars so it is a lot of coin but i

not a car like the i8 not any there is

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.710 
not a car like the i8 not any there is

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
no car that has that specific clever

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
you architecture this new material like

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.330 
you architecture this new material like
carbon<00:04:04.269> fibre<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.750> such<00:04:04.780> an<00:04:05.080> extent<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.739> of

carbon fibre to such an extent and of

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
course if you look at the design there

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.650 
course if you look at the design there
is<00:04:08.410> nothing<00:04:08.769> like<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.730> ayat<00:04:09.970> goes<00:04:10.239> on<00:04:10.420> sale

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
is nothing like it the ayat goes on sale

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.199 
is nothing like it the ayat goes on sale
in<00:04:11.069> 2014<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.250> arguably<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.000> biggest

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
in 2014 and arguably the biggest

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.240 
in 2014 and arguably the biggest
challenge<00:04:13.780> will<00:04:14.050> be<00:04:14.080> convincing<00:04:14.709> buyers<00:04:14.950> that

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
challenge will be convincing buyers that

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.039 
challenge will be convincing buyers that
three<00:04:15.519> cylinders<00:04:16.030> is<00:04:16.180> all<00:04:16.449> you<00:04:16.600> need<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.959> a

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
three cylinders is all you need in a

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
sports car like that it costs about
