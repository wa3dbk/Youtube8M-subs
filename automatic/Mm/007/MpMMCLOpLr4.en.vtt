00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.830
 Hi, I 'm Ana 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.740
 These days I went to a local lecture 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.990
 that was and will be opened makes less than 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.840
 one year that that building was 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.320
 opened and will use materials 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.730
 accounts for the technologies that are 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.610
 super high 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.660
 the refinement found all the materials 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.290
 from the floor on the walls ceiling in 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.750
 lighting us in the armchairs felipe 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.899
 the building is really beautiful and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.219
 lush and some people who were 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.750
 participating in the talk meet me 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.379
 relate those of some potential 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.949
 constructive of which he was the employee 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.710
 that building at a certain moment 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.220
 some people have questioned me about 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 vibration because the ceiling was 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.520
 moving there also brings this 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.750
 space and those behind also did 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.409
 housing and question me low 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.580
 will that be his normal response to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.409
 this is as follows a calculation exists 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.990
 What do we do when we go? 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.000
 to conclude how we are going to approve 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.150
 project in the city hall or 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.549
 also follow this project 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.770
 to make it look perfect. 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.380
 This car works structural calculation 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.220
 it is done just to know the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 size and weight of each person who should 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.540
 pillars beams for slab aa 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.680
 that building stands with 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.950
 a chair 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.799
 you have the base of the chair there is not a 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.350
 strap that connects all ends of the chain 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.039
 and legs if you break a leg 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.349
 she gets limp then changes 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.740
 happens the same thing there are beams 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.730
 pillars and the slab holding all 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.640
 so that remain standing okay but 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.090
 there are some investment materials 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.330
 that they end up not making this change 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.330
 dilatation and also they can not 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.840
 to be so there you will to the point of not 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.090
 finding and not playing is the case of plaster 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.540
 every time you saw jesus you go 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.650
 that on the wall border and the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.980
 Jesus exists a connection a correction and 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.010
 makes a sense of an inverted l 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.970
 this imposition is called tanaka the Serbian 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.800
 in the image that the house tab is placed on 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:02.100
 where this connection plasterboard 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.410
 and when it is ready and called system 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.680
 negative then the day in a building 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.260
 there is a negative of the plaster 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.070
 this entry that has a corner of the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.460
 walls that causes it to occur 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.770
 crack to occur there in the river 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.370
 action happens and cracks in the plaster 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.230
 happens there and not through the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.750
 the whole project executed 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.580
 is then the main function of the factory is 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.150
 just someone is that drive 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.700
 making it do not ruin the way you 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.620
 you just run right hope 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.840
 this tip has been valuable and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.580
 projects that you can make a 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.330
 ever better design 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.330
 A kiss, bye.
