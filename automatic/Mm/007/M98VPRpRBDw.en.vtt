grades<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:01.530> also<00:03:01.769> useful<00:03:02.360> system<00:03:03.360> for

grades it's also useful system for

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.930 
grades it's also useful system for
reporting<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.860> recording<00:03:05.370> severity<00:03:05.760> of

reporting and recording severity of

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.680 
reporting and recording severity of
lameness<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:07.640> response<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.850> treatment<00:03:09.299> can<00:03:09.540> be

lameness so response to treatment can be
seen<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.350> for<00:03:10.560> example<00:03:11.130> if<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.760> horse<00:03:11.970> at<00:03:12.120> one

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
seen so for example if a horse at one

treatment<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.120> implemented<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.109> then<00:03:16.590> it's

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
treatment is implemented and then it's

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.740 
treatment is implemented and then it's
reassessed<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.400> month<00:03:17.579> later<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.480> horses

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
reassessed a month later and the horses

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.259 
reassessed a month later and the horses
are<00:03:18.900> grade<00:03:19.200> one<00:03:19.440> out<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.650> five<00:03:19.980> lame<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:21.030> can

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
are grade one out of five lame you can

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.509 
are grade one out of five lame you can
then<00:03:21.480> easily<00:03:21.720> see<00:03:22.260> from<00:03:22.680> your<00:03:23.100> medical
