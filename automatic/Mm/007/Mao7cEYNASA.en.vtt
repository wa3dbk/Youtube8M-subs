00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.099
 the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.230
 so you do not put too much flour in now 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.309
 the raiba must incorporate the sheer 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.050
 the potatoes are squeezed out for 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.280
 Of course you need the robber 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.930
 potato onion a little bit of flour 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.650
 and salt pepper and if you like one 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.650
 little muscle 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.800
 we now have 800 grams of potatoes 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.079
 Take 2 tablespoons of flour 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.350
 It should always be that way 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.080
 Carefully dose with it at the end of the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.830
 raiba dacia or potato pancakes not 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.180
 only after mil tastes but after it 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.340
 always depends a bit on it 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.720
 how well you squeeze the potatoes 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 that for a variety is therefore 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.930
 so that the raiba dacia or 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.479
 potato pancakes or frying cakes too 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.689
 really what will it be important for that 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.750
 they are fried in a lot of fat so 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.360
 it is also important that the swimming is 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.630
 Temperature is not too hot so prefer 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.670
 you wait a bit longer because 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.409
 otherwise they are burned outside and inside 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.409
 still raw and nobody wants that 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.220
 hello barbara hey you're just coming 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.220

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.830
 first with a man 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.250
 In our case we have the discount 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.690
 sweet yet flavored with cinnamon and 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.910
 sugar in the end but you can of course 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.740
 Also well known for use 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.740

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:10.139
