00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.180
 hello this is a video where you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.550
 I will talk about things that have to do 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.680
 with the fists of the bicycle as per 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.810
 example correctly remove the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.630
 Fists tab that commonly 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.390
 it always hinders as well as removing form 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.269
 easy fists and bÃ¡rents as well as 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.550
 also place them some prices and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.269
 fist marks that can be accommodated 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 te and tips for the care of fists and 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.269
 avoid getting chewed the ones that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.269
 they mistreat faster 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 and good starting, then you need 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.310
 obviously the fists 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.310
 its neighborhoods 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.660
 a cutter of preference and a lightning bolt or 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.520
 screwdriver like to make a lever and 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.520
 let the fist take off 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.609
 let's try to be these parts of 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.049
 easy way without damaging the fist and that 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.049
 stay as straight as you can 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.030
 and this one is already cut try to do the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.040
 cut as evenly as possible since 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.150
 this can be achieved more easily with 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.160
 the cutter 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.650
 another thing that I forget to mention is 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.570
 that in these waters like a comisa door 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.620
 or something with which you can introduce water 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.170
 in the good fist I stopped a codex and 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.450
 turtles 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.960
 then there is a lot of variety according to 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.119
 prices quality designs and colors in the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.450
 fists you can choose the ones that you most 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.450
 please 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.220
 well these are yours are very 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.650
 famous for being tough with a 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.410
 somewhat higher price compared to 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.150
 many but good this in the long run 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.150
 reward for its duration 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.509
 good are also the cousin of yours who 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.160
 They are very economical and they are a good 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.780
 option if you do not want to spend much 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.780
 in the fist or not enough 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.850
 the animal fists that this is already 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.520
 Average price said to the duration is 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.350
 medium to long depending on how 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.380
 you use 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.080
 the flashbacks that also 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.060
 only good resistance 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.060
 a slightly accessible weight 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.140
 The sun and 6 fists are of a very price 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.450
 accessible they have the most bars 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.160
 resistant in plastic or of the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.260
 more resistant in plastics so that 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.390
 they hold up well in cuts without 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.100
 deformed in both the prices that 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.050
 appear here are an approximate no 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.300
 it means that it is the right price 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.680
 as well as some that do not appear 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.570
 here but they are also very good 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.920
 quality and very good price for the 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.230
 fist eyelash cut yo 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.990
 I recommend that you take a putter because 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.460
 the scissors often leave the cut 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.440
 not very uniform 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.510
 and good the cut is relatively easy 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.760
 you just have to follow the shore 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.489
 of the tab 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.170
 there are fists that already come with that shore 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.709
 more marked for what 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.510
 I like to bring the tab to remove it and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.800
 just follow that part 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.200
 and it's very easy 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.330
 and it is very even of one of a single 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.290
 passed with the cutter unlike that 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.290
 to do it with the light ones 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.200
 although to mount them then first there is 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.200
 that being the bars already have 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.670
 and good the probos to mean the 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.400
 making fist aside for the must 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.550
 repaired 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.380
 my father 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.840
 and that in this way there is much more 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.610
 easy so in the marine sector and now 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.610
 you can play with more force 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.810
 and it does not matter what type of variant is 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.940
 example this of those who squeeze with the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.800
 allen key and it does not matter from what system 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.800
 it does not matter 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.430
 and good to take off the fist because you can 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.430
 use a lightning bolt or a screwdriver 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.409
 and introduce it and try to use a 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.850
 atomizer to pour water on me in this 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:29.920
 moment I did not have an atomizer so 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.830
 simply 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.060
 with the beam try to take off 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.160
 the fist that is what is usually stuck 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.280
 so doing it a little easier can 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.729
 are both things combined so much 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.830
 take off in the fist in this way 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.759
 and at the same time pour water to make it 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.759
 Too much faster 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.000
 finally draw your fist if it's going to be 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.940
 easier if it is that if you occupy the water and 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.610
 if it takes off fist inside since 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.020
 it's always stuck and that's what makes 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.020
 do not leave very easily 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.400
 to place the fist you have to wet 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.400
 very good and manucho 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.750
 you also have to try to introduce 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.930
 a little water on him in his fist this goes 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.360
 to make it easy for you 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.140
 correctly enter fist and 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.140
 very simple way 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.569
 and good with a few twists and one 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:42.270
 I try to leave the side you cut 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.270
 together with the bar in gondomar the bar in 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.980
 I liked it too 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.930
 6 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.240
 colors and then you do not need many 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.150
 assumptions actually work 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.460
 too 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.310
 and to put these bars because that's what 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.390
 same take out the fritters well and give 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.390
 strings between 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.040
 good finally in these brave ones then 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.430
 unscrew the good ones so that they do not 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.430
 Iran 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.100
 and they are very good, it is not noticed for 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.500
 the cut and that for me is one of the 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.010
 easier and faster ways to put 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.010
 some fists 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:42.150
 and the duration is the children then 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:45.120
 depending on how much you practice 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.960
 and how often you do it and what 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.780
 type of tricks 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.850
 execute 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.639
 I do not practice much because it's obvious that 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.070
 these fists will last you much more 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.169
 he also tells a lot that he will go through 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.380
 for example the party is one of the 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:04.470
 tricks that spend more your fists already 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.710
 that generates a lot of friction with 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.710
 they 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.090
 Y 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.160
 and the care you can take with your 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.090
 fists is to try 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.300
 clean them by simply pouring water 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.080
 without 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:29.379
 nothing more since commonly the hands 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.980
 they are always dirty and dirt 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:35.770
 the earth worked 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:38.070
 and the sweat of the hands makes the 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.010
 studies are made chews 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.530
 and the grip is very committed the 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.120
 grip is very important because it is 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.600
 what makes them execute correctly 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.120
 the tricks and they also serve a lot to 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.430
 Do not beat yourself 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.680
 and well that's all I hope you serve 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.229
 something the video do not forget to subscribe and 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.560
