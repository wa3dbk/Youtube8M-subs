this mascara can be quite clumpy if you

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.300

apply too much at once but I always say
clumpy<00:01:48.880> eyelashes<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.750> better<00:01:50.140> than<00:01:50.440> no

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
clumpy eyelashes is better than no

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:59.899 
clumpy eyelashes is better than no
eyelashes

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.969 

so<00:02:00.909> for<00:02:01.119> my<00:02:01.240> lower<00:02:01.450> lashes<00:02:01.780> I'm<00:02:02.260> using<00:02:02.320> the

Loreal
telescopic<00:02:04.299> mascara<00:02:04.650> I've<00:02:05.650> been<00:02:06.070> using<00:02:06.280> this

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
for mums and mums and I think it's great

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.130

for<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.459> lower<00:02:09.610> lashes<00:02:09.880> because<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.750> has<00:02:10.959> a

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
for the lower lashes because it has a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.770

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.509 

again<00:02:19.780> I'm<00:02:19.959> using<00:02:20.140> my<00:02:20.379> spoolie<00:02:21.010> brush<00:02:21.040> to

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.110 
again I'm using my spoolie brush to
avoid<00:02:21.969> any<00:02:22.329> excess<00:02:22.810> clumping<00:02:23.769> in<00:02:24.040> then<00:02:24.819> we're

avoid any excess clumping in then we're

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.119 
avoid any excess clumping in then we're
going<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.359> go<00:02:25.540> back<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.989> with<00:02:26.349> my<00:02:26.650> eyelash

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
going to go back in with my eyelash

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.459 
going to go back in with my eyelash
curler<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.819> clamp<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.689> just<00:02:29.079> for<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.349> few
