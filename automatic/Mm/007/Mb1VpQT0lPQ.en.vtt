00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.970
 Meyer 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.469
 Dr 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.200
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.499
 to get to this segment video 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.499
 similar because technical change it at the Microsoft Germany GmbH 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.989
 the theme of this video shows this hyperreal woman 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.470
 So the Heidelberg Sion 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.100
 the Villis with Windows Server 2008 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 2 will be delivered 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.530
 one of the most important innovations with the housing area 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 you are a live stalwart 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.990
 as with Windows Server 2008 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.370
 are the high availability is options of Heike w 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.600
 so Cremer Greek format and now live involved 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.270
 came about through the integration of Haribo and almost lost say 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.150
 Klingberg Director is still available 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.120
 You see They see 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.280
 the ones on the screen that I have quite a few 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.280
 m integrated virtual machines into the class 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.420
 make a right click on such a machine then we have these two 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.870
 Options can say 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.900
 that's rainy 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660
 in contributions 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.170
 that looks like this 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.980
 the machine will 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.960
 pause 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.480
 we see it in a sociable 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.200
 that is, the machine is not so Gudenus now available 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.850
 to warn the ranks 4 comparable to know-how cover to collapse 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.640
 Würz the memory disk written 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.220
 to see that user plate moved to each other's gresser node now 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.530
 various restaurants started 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.910
 and if that is through 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.130
 then the machines either left online in the same state that they were frozen 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.280
 were 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.660
 and available to users again 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.570
 his downtime from 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.180
 a few seconds to 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.060
 a few minutes downtime is always dependent on the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.689
 Memory Size of the virtual machine memory 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.689
 and the speed of their so sparing system 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.349
 the second option is a crime 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.739
 I have this option with the option Leismann Red 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.599
 if we do that 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.379
 Do you see anything there? 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.789
 but the machine is still in the hall Kosor Hanning 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.359
 that means she is beautiful - Euro 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.700
 she was this out there are still available as long as someone in 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.889
 with Stephan Andersen had access to it 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:36.999
 and 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.260
 now the machine is already out of the other knot as Grange 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.119
 always be more 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:45.189
 they have seen it in quite a large selection that is because of inertia 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.999
 the console 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.059
 failure 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.719
 at least one shot 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:54.509
 300 milliseconds mostly in the range between 10 and 20 milliseconds 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.930
 means they put these machines kids and just keep running it 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 However, the most important difference is not the duration of the failure 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.799
 "For one thing, this difference is between completely unequal people 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.480
 Valais wants to get the rejoicing 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.539
 the operating system bristle running from there 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.009
 these processes were not included 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.199
 that means I do not need a specific operating system, I do not have to 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.469
 managed to configure a way 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.469
 I can run any operating system that is grueling 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.719
 Sounds like grazing but this means that I use the machine 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.059
 Film again thaw the operating system 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:35.609
 and everything is out of hand so that every operating system also join each one of them 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.689
 if you are weekly 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.790
 but all of you would have to wait for a run 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.139
 slightly melancholic mature 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.289
 that means hyper-v migration for Windows Server 2008 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.249
 on had 4 2 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.179
 a special requirement if she loves children Grischin 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:57.519
 come as well 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.659
 No in hall 4 1 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.319
 then maybe they can break out of companies like the two before 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.799
 only thing they have to do 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.799
 is installing the release 2 of Windows Server 2008 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.300
 at the club ring as well 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.129
 the integration compromise brings it up to date it means pro 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.129
 the system may have a new opportunity 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.040
 and that was otherwise no 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.609
 further investments 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.199
 necessary 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.259
 an investment of our site, however, necessary to 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.139
 to make logical as possible they know classically 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.210
 it was class in Zeuthen 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.340
 hope that access to one now 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.090
 Alfons are stored 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.860
 always possible, Fillon is a single patch knot 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 that should now be changed that classic wool USD 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.850
 You can see I have set up three voices here you can clear up as well 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.559
 and then see the sizes of the available ones 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:53.499
 for a shade place 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:55.099
 want at a classic 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.650
 and it is so now 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.610
 that want access to this from a classic above at the same time 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.639
 is possible 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.759
 that means for one 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.219
 a live migration 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.339
 I do not have access anymore 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.150
 only one dog left at 7 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.240
 the serum Robin had been because Wismar alone and want to do that 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.129
 Mountain as processes in total should need the 300 milliseconds 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.969
 was definitely too long for a live ticker to the problem 10 to 20 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:26.909
 Go for milliseconds 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.059
 average 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.059
 as downtime 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.719
 classic successes are designed to last for weeks 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.900
 Let's first consider the case that one of our two Klaws is the knot yes 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.520
 Example shown are holding out » 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.130
 our virtual machine is running in the right place to the top 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:51.409
 were relieved 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.099
 operates the classic 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.819
 On top of this form both odds can put on the same time 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.960
 access 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.490
 Of course, wanting to build is only a matter of one 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.349
 Both class can come anyway while reading the fire at the same time 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.349
 and directly write access 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.460
 Vettel put the driver bursts the knot 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.069
 Zidanes is 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.330
 so want us up 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.879
 on the objection that the node special class node becomes if necessary 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:28.460
 a very short at colleges to perform for 300 to 500 milliseconds 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.629
 have to 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.810
 but you will not notice that as a user of these virtual machines 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:37.159
 that is, only one insists that these rights are nodes 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.819
 also on that we give them 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.659
 Objects in that means pulling 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:43.330
 must change 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.990
 the virtual machine 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.610
 who does not need to access their virtual disks is above the levels 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.319
 accesses but horror Euro directly from the light knot 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.319
 now should also be able to cause the 2 0 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.059
 the fine stays on the real Kloten
