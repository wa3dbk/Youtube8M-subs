right now it seems to be mostly other

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.249 
right now it seems to be mostly other
birds<00:01:47.340> rather<00:01:47.970> than<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.509> brown<00:01:48.750> lemmings

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.100 
birds rather than the brown lemmings
that<00:01:49.560> usually<00:01:50.189> make<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.670> 90%<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> snowy

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.880 
owl diet in any given year
yeah<00:01:54.659> we've<00:01:54.840> also<00:01:55.020> been<00:01:55.290> monitoring<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
yeah we've also been monitoring the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.240 
yeah we've also been monitoring the
lemmings<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.700> 23<00:01:57.210> years<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.570> well<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:59.100> your

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
lemmings for 23 years as well so your

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.830 
lemmings for 23 years as well so your
typical<00:01:59.399> winter<00:01:59.759> nest<00:02:00.030> looks<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.630> this

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
typical winter nest looks like this this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
typical winter nest looks like this this
is<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:00.990> pretty<00:02:01.110> good-sized<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.369> can

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
is a pretty good-sized one and you can

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.870 
is a pretty good-sized one and you can
see<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:02.939> here's<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> nest<00:02:03.479> chamber<00:02:04.880> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
see here here's a nest chamber and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.940 
see here here's a nest chamber and
apparently<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.479> keeps<00:02:06.810> them<00:02:07.079> warm<00:02:07.619> enough

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
apparently this keeps them warm enough

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410 
apparently this keeps them warm enough
with<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> good<00:02:08.610> snow<00:02:08.849> covered<00:02:09.209> during<00:02:09.300> the
