00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
seconds I don't know even less maybe a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.760 
seconds I don't know even less maybe a
little<00:01:28.619> bit<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:28.950> um<00:01:30.229> let's<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
little bit more um let's see it's got a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.310 
little bit more um let's see it's got a
20<00:01:33.710> gigabyte<00:01:35.689> hard<00:01:36.689> drive<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.950> new<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
20 gigabyte hard drive it is new it is

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.249 
20 gigabyte hard drive it is new it is
very<00:01:40.579> clean<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.990> fast<00:01:45.049> let's<00:01:46.049> demonstrate

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
very clean and fast let's demonstrate

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.510 
very clean and fast let's demonstrate
now<00:01:46.649> how<00:01:48.829> applications<00:01:49.829> open<00:01:49.979> how<00:01:50.280> quickly

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
now how applications open how quickly

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.039 
now how applications open how quickly
they<00:01:50.700> open<00:01:51.030> we'll<00:01:51.990> go<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.430> Microsoft<00:01:53.430> Word

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
they open we'll go to Microsoft Word

new<00:03:45.900> you'll<00:03:46.650> probably<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.460> replace<00:03:47.790> it

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090
