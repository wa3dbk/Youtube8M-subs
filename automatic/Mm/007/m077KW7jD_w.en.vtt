tutorial but today's tutorial is gonna
be<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:40.610> random<00:00:41.690> mm<00:00:43.610> random<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.200> time

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
be on random mm random and time

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.889 
be on random mm random and time
effectors<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.250> both<00:00:48.320> text<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.820> objects

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
effectors on both text and objects

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.490 
effectors on both text and objects
alright<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.710> let's<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.520> started<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:54.500> text

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
alright so let's get started with text

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840 
alright so let's get started with text
which<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.640> bit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
which is because it's a little bit

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
which is because it's a little bit
easier<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.050> picked<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.500> text<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.219> going

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
is go down here to transform and

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.770 
is go down here to transform and
transform<00:01:26.220> oh<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.290> mess<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:29.390> how<00:01:30.390> many

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
transform oh you can mess with how many

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.620 
transform oh you can mess with how many
mess<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.200> most<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.210> random

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
mess with most of that know the random

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.399 
mess with most of that know the random
mode<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:35.060> four<00:01:36.060> different<00:01:36.509> types<00:01:37.140> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
mode you got four different types I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
mode you got four different types I
really<00:01:37.920> haven't<00:01:38.189> figured<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.360> four

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
really haven't figured out what all four

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.429 
really haven't figured out what all four
of<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.430> but<00:01:44.000> they<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.060> something<00:01:45.439> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
of these do but they do something so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.789 
of these do but they do something so
just<00:01:46.740> keep<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.159> random<00:01:48.380> if<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> can't<00:01:49.619> tell

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
just keep it at random if you can't tell

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
just keep it at random if you can't tell
right<00:01:49.979> now<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.640> sick<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.229> it's

need<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.640> random<00:01:56.909> effector<00:01:57.360> is

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
need to do for the random effector is

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.440 
need to do for the random effector is
move<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.219> how<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
move this to how you want it see if you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.319 
move this to how you want it see if you
wanted<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> go<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.490> if<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.610> want<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> text

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
wanted to go like if you want the text

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.830 
wanted to go like if you want the text
to<00:02:03.360> move<00:02:03.630> from<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.140> certain<00:02:04.610> place<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
to move from a certain place you have it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.499 
to move from a certain place you have it
all

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
all

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.830 
all
sit<00:02:09.379> around<00:02:09.679> let's<00:02:10.159> let's<00:02:10.549> go<00:02:10.729> spit<00:02:11.420> all<00:02:11.659> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
sit around let's let's go spit all the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.339 
sit around let's let's go spit all the
text<00:02:12.260> out<00:02:12.939> and<00:02:13.939> then<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:16.040> comes<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:17.079> or<00:02:18.079> but<00:02:18.290> you

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
text out and then it comes in or but you

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.819 
text out and then it comes in or but you
could<00:02:18.860> also<00:02:19.010> add<00:02:19.189> some<00:02:19.400> rotation<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.829> make

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
could also add some rotation to it make

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.240 
could also add some rotation to it make
it<00:02:21.980> look<00:02:23.230> good<00:02:24.230> now<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.680> can't<00:02:24.890> really<00:02:24.920> see<00:02:25.220> it

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
it look good now you can't really see it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.649 
it look good now you can't really see it
now<00:02:26.560> nope<00:02:27.560> nope<00:02:29.379> so<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.470> can<00:02:30.620> see<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:31.659> this

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
now nope nope so you can see that this

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.280 
now nope nope so you can see that this
is<00:02:32.870> giving<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.530> text<00:02:33.920> some<00:02:34.069> rotation<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.900> when

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
is giving the text some rotation so when

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.180 
is giving the text some rotation so when
you<00:02:36.409> bring<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.799> in<00:02:37.599> all<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:38.870> see<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.290> boom<00:02:40.129> see

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
you bring it in all you see is boom see

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.170 
you bring it in all you see is boom see
and<00:02:43.190> that's<00:02:43.250> what<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.519> use<00:02:43.640> for<00:02:43.670> some<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.150> my

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
and that's what I use for some of my

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.420 
and that's what I use for some of my
intros<00:02:44.569> it's<00:02:44.870> better<00:02:45.079> with<00:02:45.620> random<00:02:46.010> effector

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
intros it's better with random effector

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.649 
intros it's better with random effector
I<00:02:46.459> think<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:48.470> plays<00:02:48.650> out<00:02:48.829> nice<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.190> easy<00:02:49.310> all

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
I think it plays out nice and easy all

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.589 
I think it plays out nice and easy all
what<00:02:50.659> you<00:02:50.780> need<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.049> do<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:51.829> to<00:02:52.040> uh<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:53.450> get

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
what you need to do for it to uh to get

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.879 
what you need to do for it to uh to get
it<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.810> keyframe<00:02:54.079> you<00:02:54.260> can't<00:02:54.470> actually<00:02:54.680> the

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
it to keyframe you can't actually the

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:55.930 
it to keyframe you can't actually the
keyframe<00:02:55.190> with<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.549> have<00:02:55.639> to<00:02:55.730> turn

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
keyframe with that you have to turn

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.199 
keyframe with that you have to turn
AutoKey<00:02:56.359> frame<00:02:57.370> go<00:02:58.370> up<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.519> what<00:02:58.639> you<00:02:58.730> need<00:02:58.909> I

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
AutoKey frame go up to what you need I

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.300 
AutoKey frame go up to what you need I
usually<00:02:59.930> do<00:03:00.019> it<00:03:00.139> around<00:03:00.230> 90<00:03:00.769> if<00:03:00.889> I'm<00:03:01.010> doing<00:03:01.250> a

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
usually do it around 90 if I'm doing a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.240 
usually do it around 90 if I'm doing a
full<00:03:01.519> intro<00:03:01.879> do<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.299> about<00:03:02.480> 90<00:03:02.840> brain<00:03:03.799> strength

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
full intro do it about 90 brain strength

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.180 
full intro do it about 90 brain strength
all<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.489> way<00:03:04.670> down<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.970> zero<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:05.799> go<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.859> being

all the way down to zero and go to being
should<00:03:07.430> stay<00:03:07.609> at<00:03:07.670> 100<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:09.349> have<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:09.829> all

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
should stay at 100 and you have this all

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.740 
should stay at 100 and you have this all
of<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.639> text<00:03:10.970> coming<00:03:11.269> in<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:14.510> have<00:03:14.720> a

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
of the text coming in and you have a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.949 
of the text coming in and you have a
random<00:03:14.959> effector<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> text<00:03:16.099> um<00:03:16.970> let<00:03:17.900> me

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
random effector on the text um let me

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.039 
random effector on the text um let me
get<00:03:18.079> rid<00:03:18.199> of<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:18.440> random<00:03:18.919> effector<00:03:19.699> and

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
get rid of this random effector and

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.150 
get rid of this random effector and
let's<00:03:21.049> see<00:03:21.139> if<00:03:21.169> town<00:03:21.410> effect<00:03:21.709> will<00:03:21.829> work<00:03:21.980> for

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
let's see if town effect will work for

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.189 
let's see if town effect will work for
me<00:03:22.250> I'm<00:03:23.030> having<00:03:23.389> some<00:03:23.569> troubles<00:03:23.900> with<00:03:23.930> time

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
me I'm having some troubles with time

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.460 
me I'm having some troubles with time
effector<00:03:24.590> it's<00:03:24.739> not<00:03:24.859> showing<00:03:25.190> up<00:03:26.139> like<00:03:27.139> okay

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
effector it's not showing up like okay

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.280 
effector it's not showing up like okay
this<00:03:27.889> time<00:03:27.949> I<00:03:28.129> showed<00:03:28.280> up<00:03:28.720> time<00:03:29.720> effector<00:03:30.139> is

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
this time I showed up time effector is

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.589 
this time I showed up time effector is
really<00:03:31.419> just<00:03:32.419> moving<00:03:32.629> whole<00:03:33.139> text<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.829> not

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
really just moving whole text and not

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.970 
really just moving whole text and not
like<00:03:35.599> certain<00:03:36.019> letters<00:03:36.349> it's<00:03:36.680> just<00:03:36.859> moving

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
like certain letters it's just moving

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.589 
like certain letters it's just moving
the<00:03:37.430> text<00:03:37.819> as<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.060> whole<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:42.340> no<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.790> want<00:03:44.449> you

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
the text as a whole so no I want you

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.099 
the text as a whole so no I want you
down<00:03:45.879> what<00:03:46.879> you<00:03:47.030> do<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.389> you<00:03:47.690> can<00:03:47.840> move<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.079> to

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
down what you do is you can move it to

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.839 
down what you do is you can move it to
the<00:03:48.290> side<00:03:48.849> move<00:03:49.849> it<00:03:49.970> up<00:03:50.150> move<00:03:50.859> and<00:03:51.859> back<00:03:52.430> forth

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
the side move it up move and back forth

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.750 
the side move it up move and back forth
up<00:03:53.180> down<00:03:53.449> left<00:03:53.750> right<00:03:53.959> side<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.440> side<00:03:54.650> turn<00:03:55.609> the

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
up down left right side to side turn the

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.550 
up down left right side to side turn the
text<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:58.010> what<00:03:58.129> you<00:03:58.250> want

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
text do what you want

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.659 
text do what you want
bring<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.680> down<00:04:02.199> and<00:04:03.199> see<00:04:04.069> with<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:04.459> it

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
bring it down and see with this it

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.539 
bring it down and see with this it
actually<00:04:05.030> just<00:04:05.209> will<00:04:05.690> play<00:04:05.930> through<00:04:06.400> leave<00:04:07.400> at

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
actually just will play through leave at

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.610 
actually just will play through leave at
a<00:04:07.579> hundred<00:04:07.819> you'll<00:04:08.180> see<00:04:08.359> what<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:08.599> does<00:04:11.620> but

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
a hundred you'll see what it does but

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.219 
a hundred you'll see what it does but
this<00:04:12.709> is<00:04:12.859> going<00:04:13.040> from<00:04:13.510> from<00:04:14.510> zero<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.079> a

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
this is going from from zero to a

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.050 
this is going from from zero to a
hundred<00:04:15.319> not<00:04:15.829> a<00:04:15.859> hundred<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.340> zero<00:04:16.609> which<00:04:16.909> is

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
hundred not a hundred to zero which is

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.920 
hundred not a hundred to zero which is
how<00:04:17.209> we<00:04:17.269> gonna<00:04:17.599> have<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:18.950> put<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.159> here<00:04:19.930> at

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
how we gonna have it you put it here at

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.140 
how we gonna have it you put it here at
90<00:04:21.260> frames

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
90 frames

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.260 
90 frames
auto-keyframe<00:04:23.890> hundred<00:04:26.530> damn<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.820> makes<00:04:29.120> it

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
auto-keyframe hundred damn this makes it

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:37.030 
auto-keyframe hundred damn this makes it
go<00:04:29.300> up<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.900> back<00:04:32.350> it's<00:04:33.350> pretty<00:04:33.500> easy<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:36.080> then

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
go up and back it's pretty easy and then

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.610 
go up and back it's pretty easy and then
you<00:04:37.160> can<00:04:37.280> add<00:04:37.400> actually<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.900> can<00:04:39.080> do<00:04:39.200> like<00:04:39.500> I

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
you can add actually you can do like I

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.560 
you can add actually you can do like I
do<00:04:39.680> in<00:04:39.950> couple<00:04:40.370> my<00:04:40.520> intros<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:41.090> had<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.240> random

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
do in couple my intros I had a random

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.080 
do in couple my intros I had a random
and<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:42.020> time<00:04:42.230> effector<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.950> so<00:04:43.700> it<00:04:43.760> gives<00:04:43.940> it

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
and a time effector to it so it gives it

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.470 
and a time effector to it so it gives it
a<00:04:44.150> nice<00:04:44.300> little<00:04:44.800> nice<00:04:45.800> little<00:04:45.830> feel<00:04:46.280> to<00:04:46.520> it

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
a nice little nice little feel to it

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.550 
a nice little nice little feel to it
might<00:04:47.690> be<00:04:47.780> kind<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:47.990> hard<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:48.170> see<00:04:48.320> because<00:04:48.380> I'm

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
might be kind of hard to see because I'm

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.550 
might be kind of hard to see because I'm
I'm<00:04:48.770> way<00:04:49.070> zoomed<00:04:49.430> out<00:04:49.580> on<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.970> but<00:04:50.560> moving

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
I'm way zoomed out on it but moving

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.700 
I'm way zoomed out on it but moving
everything<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:54.310> just<00:04:55.330> have<00:04:56.330> no<00:04:56.710> science

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
everything and it just have no science

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.970 
everything and it just have no science
to<00:04:57.980> this<00:04:59.230> it<00:05:00.230> spoke<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.530> 90<00:05:02.560> bring<00:05:03.560> this<00:05:03.740> down

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
to this it spoke to 90 bring this down

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.510 
to this it spoke to 90 bring this down
to<00:05:04.130> zero<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:06.220> this<00:05:07.220> kind<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:07.610> just<00:05:07.850> plays<00:05:08.630> out

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
to zero and this kind of just plays out

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.780 
to zero and this kind of just plays out
Zee<00:05:10.520> hype<00:05:11.020> see<00:05:12.020> how<00:05:12.080> that<00:05:12.260> works

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
Zee hype see how that works

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.520 
Zee hype see how that works
see<00:05:13.790> right<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.060> effectors<00:05:14.540> look<00:05:15.020> good<00:05:15.290> by

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
see right and effectors look good by

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.780 
see right and effectors look good by
themselves<00:05:16.240> time<00:05:17.240> effectors<00:05:17.720> do<00:05:17.900> not<00:05:18.730> so<00:05:19.730> you

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
themselves time effectors do not so you

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.520 
themselves time effectors do not so you
had<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.360> time<00:05:20.630> effector<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.260> a<00:05:21.320> random

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
had a time effector and a random

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.000 
had a time effector and a random
effector<00:05:22.040> to<00:05:22.670> your<00:05:23.030> text<00:05:23.450> and<00:05:23.660> you<00:05:24.320> have<00:05:24.560> what

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
effector to your text and you have what

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.300 
effector to your text and you have what
you<00:05:25.160> see<00:05:25.370> in<00:05:25.490> front<00:05:25.640> of<00:05:25.850> you<00:05:26.030> it<00:05:26.860> looks<00:05:27.860> pretty

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
you see in front of you it looks pretty

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.370 
you see in front of you it looks pretty
damn<00:05:29.150> cool<00:05:29.450> and<00:05:30.700> in<00:05:31.700> my<00:05:31.850> opinion<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:33.200> let's

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
damn cool and in my opinion so let's

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.800 
damn cool and in my opinion so let's
let's<00:05:33.740> get<00:05:33.890> rid<00:05:34.130> of<00:05:34.160> no<00:05:34.640> let's<00:05:35.240> get<00:05:35.420> rid<00:05:35.570> of<00:05:35.630> all

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
let's get rid of no let's get rid of all

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.470 
let's get rid of no let's get rid of all
of<00:05:35.840> this<00:05:37.570> so<00:05:38.570> auto-keyframe<00:05:39.790> let's<00:05:40.790> see<00:05:41.060> let's

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
of this so auto-keyframe let's see let's

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:52.240 
of this so auto-keyframe let's see let's
add<00:05:41.840> now<00:05:47.200> let's<00:05:48.200> add<00:05:48.500> some<00:05:48.530> tubes<00:05:51.040> all<00:05:52.040> right

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
add now let's add some tubes all right

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.720 
add now let's add some tubes all right
let's<00:05:52.580> take<00:05:53.180> these<00:05:53.390> coordinates<00:05:57.430> say<00:05:58.430> this

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
let's take these coordinates say this

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.680 
let's take these coordinates say this
bring<00:05:59.090> this<00:05:59.240> up<00:05:59.510> to<00:06:00.160> 90<00:06:01.160> degrees<00:06:01.610> so<00:06:02.450> it's<00:06:02.600> a

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
bring this up to 90 degrees so it's a

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.880 
bring this up to 90 degrees so it's a
perfect<00:06:03.320> up<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.710> down<00:06:05.470> sorry<00:06:06.470> it's<00:06:06.680> a<00:06:06.830> little

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
perfect up and down sorry it's a little

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:13.970 
perfect up and down sorry it's a little
bit<00:06:07.160> late<00:06:07.780> do<00:06:08.780> that<00:06:09.020> out<00:06:09.830> of<00:06:09.890> radius

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:26.510 

and<00:06:14.520> a<00:06:14.640> radius<00:06:16.340> copy<00:06:20.510> turn<00:06:23.450> and<00:06:24.450> yeah<00:06:25.460> so<00:06:26.460> we

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
and a radius copy turn and yeah so we

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.740 
and a radius copy turn and yeah so we
have<00:06:26.670> this<00:06:26.910> and<00:06:27.180> if<00:06:27.840> you<00:06:28.290> see<00:06:28.430> that<00:06:29.750> select

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
have this and if you see that select

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.990 
have this and if you see that select
both<00:06:30.960> of<00:06:30.990> them<00:06:31.670> both

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
both of them both

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.350 
both of them both
you<00:06:33.810> see<00:06:34.050> these<00:06:34.610> with<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:35.700> Rama<00:06:35.880> factor<00:06:36.240> it

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
you see these with the Rama factor it

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.770 
you see these with the Rama factor it
does<00:06:36.570> nothing<00:06:36.920> because<00:06:37.920> that's<00:06:38.850> because<00:06:39.480> what

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
does nothing because that's because what

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.860 
does nothing because that's because what
you're<00:06:39.930> gonna<00:06:40.020> have<00:06:40.200> to<00:06:40.320> do<00:06:40.470> is<00:06:40.830> add<00:06:41.870> fracture

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
you're gonna have to do is add fracture

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.030 
you're gonna have to do is add fracture
object<00:06:43.820> fracture<00:06:44.820> object<00:06:45.410> pit<00:06:46.410> both<00:06:46.680> of<00:06:46.920> these

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
object fracture object pit both of these

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.650 
object fracture object pit both of these
under<00:06:47.490> your<00:06:47.640> fracture<00:06:48.120> objects<00:06:48.600> and<00:06:50.270> then<00:06:51.270> you

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
under your fracture objects and then you

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:58.580 
under your fracture objects and then you
have<00:06:51.870> to<00:06:51.990> add<00:06:52.140> the<00:06:57.110> gonna<00:06:58.110> have<00:06:58.260> to<00:06:58.350> add<00:06:58.440> the

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
have to add the gonna have to add the

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.270 
have to add the gonna have to add the
random<00:06:59.040> effector<00:07:00.290> under<00:07:01.290> those<00:07:01.440> and<00:07:01.800> then<00:07:02.010> you

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
random effector under those and then you

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.650 
random effector under those and then you
see<00:07:02.460> it<00:07:02.580> works<00:07:04.460> and<00:07:05.460> now<00:07:05.610> it<00:07:05.760> completely<00:07:06.360> works

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 
see it works and now it completely works

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.420 
see it works and now it completely works
and<00:07:07.430> everything<00:07:08.430> goes<00:07:08.580> everywhere<00:07:09.060> and<00:07:09.120> it

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
and everything goes everywhere and it

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.100 
and everything goes everywhere and it
looks<00:07:11.430> nice<00:07:11.820> and<00:07:13.580> professional<00:07:14.580> and<00:07:14.990> you<00:07:15.990> have

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
looks nice and professional and you have

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.250 
looks nice and professional and you have
it<00:07:16.260> going<00:07:16.620> boom<00:07:16.920> oh<00:07:17.160> when<00:07:17.700> one<00:07:18.170> whatever<00:07:19.170> you

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
it going boom oh when one whatever you

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.200 
it going boom oh when one whatever you
want<00:07:20.870> just<00:07:21.870> go<00:07:21.960> all<00:07:22.140> the<00:07:22.260> way<00:07:22.290> up<00:07:22.590> I<00:07:23.210> really

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
want just go all the way up I really

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.570 
want just go all the way up I really
don't<00:07:24.420> care<00:07:24.540> and<00:07:25.350> see<00:07:25.950> it<00:07:26.040> goes<00:07:26.250> really<00:07:26.460> fast

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 
don't care and see it goes really fast

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.990 
don't care and see it goes really fast
and<00:07:28.280> turn<00:07:29.280> that<00:07:29.550> on<00:07:29.610> and<00:07:30.330> good<00:07:31.260> at<00:07:31.380> that<00:07:31.530> and<00:07:32.000> go

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
and turn that on and good at that and go

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.510 
and turn that on and good at that and go
it<00:07:33.180> down<00:07:33.390> mmm<00:07:34.400> you<00:07:35.400> have<00:07:35.670> a<00:07:37.070> spinning<00:07:38.070> thing

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 
it down mmm you have a spinning thing

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.640 
it down mmm you have a spinning thing
this<00:07:39.480> is<00:07:39.630> random<00:07:39.870> effectors<00:07:40.200> and<00:07:40.230> I<00:07:40.380> don't<00:07:40.530> use

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.650 
this is random effectors and I don't use

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.710 
this is random effectors and I don't use
time<00:07:40.860> effectors<00:07:41.250> for<00:07:41.280> this<00:07:41.610> I'm<00:07:42.210> gonna<00:07:42.540> check

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 
time effectors for this I'm gonna check

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.530 
time effectors for this I'm gonna check
the<00:07:42.810> Facebook<00:07:45.650> yeah<00:07:46.670> sorry<00:07:47.670> I<00:07:47.910> check<00:07:48.420> for
