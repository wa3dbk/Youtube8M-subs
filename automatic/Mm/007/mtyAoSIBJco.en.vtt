00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
love this drill it's 9.6 volts you can

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.740 
love this drill it's 9.6 volts you can
see<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.840> bottom<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> battery<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:24.539> can

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
see on the bottom of the battery it can

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.920 
see on the bottom of the battery it can
do<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.140> about<00:00:25.230> anything<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.920> needed<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.930> two

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
do just about anything I needed to two

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.040 
do just about anything I needed to two
things<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:29.660> just<00:00:30.660> before<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:30.960> get

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
things to know about just before you get

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.620 
things to know about just before you get
started<00:00:31.470> here's<00:00:32.340> your<00:00:32.790> trigger<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.480> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
started here's your trigger so this is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
started here's your trigger so this is
how<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.809> turn<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> off<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.820> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
how you turn it on and off and this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130 
how you turn it on and off and this
button<00:00:36.149> right<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.510> slides<00:00:36.750> back<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
button right here that slides back and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.639 
button right here that slides back and
forth<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.399> forward<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.030> reverse<00:00:39.840> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
forth this is forward and reverse so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.369 
forth this is forward and reverse so
that's<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.100> direction<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.640> where<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that's the direction of where the the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.760 
that's the direction of where the the
actual<00:00:44.309> drill<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> turn<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.680> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
actual drill is going to turn so if you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.220 
actual drill is going to turn so if you
look<00:00:46.920> now<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.550> forward<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:48.989> see

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
look now it's in forward so you can see

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.930 
look now it's in forward so you can see
it<00:00:49.320> turning<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> right<00:00:50.039> that's<00:00:50.430> drilling

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it turning to the right that's drilling

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.740 
it turning to the right that's drilling
you<00:00:51.449> need<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> extract<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.260> screw<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.860> drill<00:00:53.160> a

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
you need to extract a screw or a drill a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.830 
you need to extract a screw or a drill a
yeah<00:00:54.800> drill<00:00:55.800> bit<00:00:55.949> push<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.719> can

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
yeah drill bit push that in and you can

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.700 
yeah drill bit push that in and you can
see<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.620> counterclockwise<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:01.350> put<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
see now going counterclockwise to put in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.969 
see now going counterclockwise to put in
one<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> drill<00:01:02.730> bits<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.710> case<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
one of the drill bits or in this case a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.940 
one of the drill bits or in this case a
bit<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> screw<00:01:06.630> driver<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.170> put<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
bit for a screw driver you put it in

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.070 
bit for a screw driver you put it in
reverse<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.210> hold<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.510> outside

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
reverse and you just hold this outside

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
reverse and you just hold this outside
edge<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:11.490> how<00:01:11.580> there's<00:01:11.760> two<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
edge right here see how there's two of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.580 
edge right here see how there's two of
them<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.659> want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> hold<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.110> top<00:01:13.350> one

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
them you want to hold this top one

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.789 
them you want to hold this top one
you'll<00:01:14.220> notice<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.729> top<00:01:15.030> gets<00:01:15.390> wider<00:01:15.799> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
you'll notice how the top gets wider so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.230 
you'll notice how the top gets wider so
now<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.340> slide<00:01:17.700> something<00:01:18.119> in

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
now you can just slide something in

outside there now what is this noise

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.539 
outside there now what is this noise
that<00:01:36.600> noise<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.470> Chuck<00:01:37.829> part<00:01:38.159> right<00:01:38.310> here

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that noise is this Chuck part right here

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
these numbers whatever number is aligned

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.920 
these numbers whatever number is aligned
at<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> top<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:45.060> actual<00:01:45.750> number

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
at the top here is the actual number

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.090 
at the top here is the actual number
that<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.549> set<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.659> turn<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.140> what

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that it's set to so as you turn it what

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.780 
that it's set to so as you turn it what
it<00:01:50.220> does<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:50.880> drive<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:52.170> force<00:01:52.790> into

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it does is it will drive more force into

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.780 
it does is it will drive more force into
your<00:01:53.970> drilling<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> hold<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.829> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
your drilling so when you hold this and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.209 
your drilling so when you hold this and
you<00:01:56.880> turn<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.270> always<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.899> louder<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:59.100> you'll

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you turn it always it louder but you'll

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.190 
you turn it always it louder but you'll
notice<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.610> when<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.180> drill<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.780> will<00:02:00.960> drill

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
notice that when you drill it will drill

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.679 
notice that when you drill it will drill
in<00:02:01.380> further<00:02:01.680> before<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.430> stops<00:02:02.790> what<00:02:03.600> do<00:02:03.659> I

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
in further before it stops what do I

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.730 
in further before it stops what do I
mean<00:02:03.840> by<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.469> you're<00:02:04.590> drilling

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
mean by that so if you're drilling

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.069 
mean by that so if you're drilling
something<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.310> soft<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.780> don't<00:02:06.960> want

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
something really soft and you don't want

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.390 
something really soft and you don't want
to<00:02:07.110> crush<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:08.479> let's<00:02:09.479> say<00:02:09.629> drywall<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.400> might

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
to crush it let's say drywall you might

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.950 
to crush it let's say drywall you might
want<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.610> set<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> at<00:02:12.000> three<00:02:12.239> or<00:02:12.450> four

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
want to set it at three or four

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.780 
want to set it at three or four
and<00:02:13.050> then<00:02:13.620> it'll<00:02:13.860> stop<00:02:14.100> at<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> certain<00:02:14.610> point

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and then it'll stop at a certain point

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.480 
and then it'll stop at a certain point
because<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.960> pressure<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.100> top<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.460> that

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
because the pressure on the top of that

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.520 
because the pressure on the top of that
clutch<00:02:17.850> will<00:02:18.510> cause<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.080> not<00:02:19.110> drill

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
clutch will cause it to not drill

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.900 
clutch will cause it to not drill
anymore<00:02:19.740> see<00:02:20.580> how<00:02:20.640> about<00:02:20.880> moving<00:02:21.210> now<00:02:22.670> no<00:02:23.670> turn

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
anymore see how about moving now no turn

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.570 
anymore see how about moving now no turn
so<00:02:24.360> anyway<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.440> very<00:02:25.830> important<00:02:26.340> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
so anyway that is very important the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.740 
so anyway that is very important the
clutch<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:27.060> something<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.450> need<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.600> learn

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
clutch is something you need to learn

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.020 
clutch is something you need to learn
how<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.990> adjust<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.370> simply<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.910> by

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
how to adjust you just simply do it by

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.600 
how to adjust you just simply do it by
adjusting<00:02:30.450> these<00:02:30.600> dials<00:02:31.050> if<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.040> go<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
adjusting these dials if you go all the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.270 
adjusting these dials if you go all the
way<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.970> top<00:02:33.800> see<00:02:34.800> where<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.070> little

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
way to the top see where that little

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.880 
way to the top see where that little
drill<00:02:36.000> bit<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:37.050> means<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.440> will<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:37.710> go

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
drill bit is that means it will just go

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400 
drill bit is that means it will just go
and<00:02:38.160> go<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.340> go<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.060> until<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.930> run<00:02:40.170> out<00:02:40.380> of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
and go and go in it until you run out of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.440 
and go and go in it until you run out of
juice<00:02:41.310> basically<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:43.200> same<00:02:44.040> thing<00:02:44.250> goes<00:02:44.490> also

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
juice basically so same thing goes also

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.740 
juice basically so same thing goes also
for<00:02:45.720> putting<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.320> drill<00:02:46.560> bit<00:02:47.480> set<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.630> to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
for putting in a drill bit set it to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.420 
for putting in a drill bit set it to
reverse<00:02:49.050> hold<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.070> top<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.490> chuck<00:02:52.430> it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
reverse hold the top of your chuck it

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.640 
reverse hold the top of your chuck it
comes<00:02:53.670> out<00:02:54.530> going<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.650> put<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:55.890> on<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:57.530> drill<00:02:58.530> bit

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
comes out going to put in on a drill bit

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.530 
comes out going to put in on a drill bit
stick<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> top<00:02:59.460> put<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.240> in<00:03:00.330> forward

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
stick in to the top put it in forward

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.080 
stick in to the top put it in forward
all<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.500> top<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.130> it's<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> one-handed<00:03:02.910> meal

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
all the top it so it's a one-handed meal

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.840 
all the top it so it's a one-handed meal
and<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.990> make<00:03:04.380> sure<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.710> tight<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
and then to make sure it's tight the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.800 
and then to make sure it's tight the
other<00:03:06.000> thing<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.150> was<00:03:06.210> going<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.450> show<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.660> is

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
other thing I was going to show you is

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.680 
other thing I was going to show you is
they<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:06.960> have<00:03:07.820> bits<00:03:08.820> like<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.210> on<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.450> back

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
they do have bits like this on the back

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.320 
they do have bits like this on the back
this<00:03:10.500> will<00:03:10.680> grip<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.250> bottom<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.790> lot<00:03:12.120> better

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
this will grip the bottom a lot better

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.760 
this will grip the bottom a lot better
if<00:03:12.570> you're<00:03:12.810> trying<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> lot<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.470> really

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
if you're trying to do a lot of really

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.850 
if you're trying to do a lot of really
hard<00:03:14.540> drilling<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.690> driving<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.380> they<00:03:16.650> make

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
hard drilling and driving and they make

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.290 
hard drilling and driving and they make
little<00:03:17.100> pieces<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.270> are

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
little pieces like this that are

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.990 
little pieces like this that are
magnetized<00:03:19.020> so<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.160> magnetized<00:03:20.730> at<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
magnetized so this is magnetized at the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.440 
magnetized so this is magnetized at the
top<00:03:21.210> if<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.540> want<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:22.440> on<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.710> get<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.450> hold

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
top if you want to get on to get a hold

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.430 
top if you want to get on to get a hold
the<00:03:24.720> actual<00:03:24.930> screw<00:03:25.650> onto<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.310> end<00:03:26.550> of<00:03:26.730> the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
the actual screw onto the end of the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.720 
the actual screw onto the end of the
screwdriver<00:03:28.440> last<00:03:29.040> thing<00:03:29.220> I'll<00:03:29.310> show<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.520> is

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
screwdriver last thing I'll show you is

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.520 
screwdriver last thing I'll show you is
this<00:03:29.820> number<00:03:30.120> up<00:03:30.240> top<00:03:30.390> what<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.900> that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
this number up top what is that that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.500 
this number up top what is that that
number<00:03:31.800> two<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> speed<00:03:32.550> it's<00:03:33.210> just<00:03:33.420> a

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
number two is the speed it's just a

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.850 
number two is the speed it's just a
flick<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> switch<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.410> drill<00:03:34.650> and

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
flick of the switch on this drill and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.130 
flick of the switch on this drill and
they're<00:03:35.400> going<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.670> lot<00:03:35.790> slower<00:03:35.960> hit<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:37.080> on

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
they're going a lot slower hit it on

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.830 
they're going a lot slower hit it on
number<00:03:37.500> two<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:42.390> really<00:03:42.540> get<00:03:42.750> it

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
number two and you can really get it

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.230 
number two and you can really get it
moving<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.490> to<00:03:44.610> take<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> battery

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
moving so that's it to take the battery

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.690 
moving so that's it to take the battery
out<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:46.650> just<00:03:46.800> squeeze<00:03:47.100> these<00:03:47.280> two<00:03:47.340> together

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
out you just squeeze these two together

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.170 
out you just squeeze these two together
and<00:03:48.120> then<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.170> stick<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.650> charger

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
and then you stick it in the charger

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.370
