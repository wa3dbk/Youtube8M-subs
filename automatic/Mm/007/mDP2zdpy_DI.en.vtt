00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
plenty enough even if you've had a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.809 
plenty enough even if you've had a
one-sixteenth<00:02:08.670> evo<00:02:09.119> V<00:02:09.450> Excel<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.050> had<00:02:10.319> I

one-sixteenth evo V Excel like I had I

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.740 
one-sixteenth evo V Excel like I had I
still<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.000> much<00:02:12.209> speed<00:02:12.510> difference

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
still don't see much speed difference

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.750 
still don't see much speed difference
and<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.080> thing<00:02:13.319> so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760
