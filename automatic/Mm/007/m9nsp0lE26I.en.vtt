00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.319
 Well, now I have coffee and as promised in the video where he went 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.440
 today we have a real flagship for how in some things this mouse has no blogett equal 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.590
 against quartz like everything in the new lineup here is very futuristic and beautiful 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.449
 design it looks super finally ski so decided to do something that 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.289
 different from their previous design and and I believe that it is not for nothing here and convenience 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.690
 and the look is combined and it’s as if they say you a ray in your hand is as if 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.190
 under me did unless grip the fingers will hold is not so convenient have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 reach for these keys here principle with the design is the same as in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 same 402 it is not surprising materials a bit 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.270
 to others here is matt do not get dirty plastic as in 402 but here it is already more tenacious and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.100
 soft rubber is held in hand very cool gloss here is pure for design 10 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.119
 buttons that can be customized as you wish under the two main 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.420
 omron switches from a resource of 20 million clicks 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.950
 under the top additional omrn too but for 5 million clicks 3 side 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.729
 buttons have Zebes resources switches, too, 5 million clicks 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.299
 You must agree that the press is very clear and pleasant, and quickly one clicks on the click. 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.350
 side pleasure are pressed a little tighter and move them 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.300
 slightly longer than the upper ladies wheel fully metal with 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.050
 branded loggia of sky chip scrolling mode of long documents 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.240
 scrolling the tape in eco or facebook with it is very simple and fast to eat and normal 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.500
 mode and horizontal scrolling due to the fact that the scroll metal weight 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.140
 Of course, too, in the order of 16 grams is a lot but due to the fact that it is four-position 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.900
 then he hangs a little, but there is no other way 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.970
 the wire here is in a soft cloth braid but some kind of it is very large and with 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.950
 over time, the wire can be exposed could be made and smaller 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.899
 Yes, and the wire itself was too needed to be made thinner, but protection from 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.080
 kink here sensor here optical mw 3366 dn 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.730
 This is the same pixar product 3366, but as I understand it, it was somehow finished because 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.950
 no optics shows 12,000 resolution and lasers such as l i don't 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.950
 I saw and here the optics and sensor of this bomb it is so smooth so soft that 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.120
 I just have nothing to complain about, despite the fact that I don’t like a smooth height sensor 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.950
 separation of about one and a half millimeters and control is very sharp you legs here 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 different sizes of people he you them the mouse slides perfectly on them as under her so 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.100
 and on plastic, the only thing is that if you shove a bunch of weights on the bottom, then it 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.510
 a little bulging scratches on the carpet but most likely it's just my copy 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.380
 weights can be placed differently from this way to adjust the balance 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.489
 mouse if you need some kind of your cool for fans of non-standard 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.330
 I didn't use the settings because the mouse is so heavy 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.660
 about 120 grams software has not changed loggitek gaming 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.730
 saves here everything is as before the setting of de peau that you are polling re-keying 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.050
 managing profiles and creating macros 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.670
 calibration of the sensor under the surface there are presets that is to set manually after 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.160
 This sensor works a little smoother. logic g502 is a minus in the form of a wire. 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.290
 someone may not like so many buttons, but someone will not do 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.290
 Wheels with me with this mouse even appear some additional 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.180
 confidence in the games I know now I will go out of the corner and now I put the headshots 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.030
 it is a pleasure to play with such a feeling that the mouse is very comfortable and well made 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.519
 with a bunch of frills and all sorts of chips and the fastest sensor at the moment but for 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.260
 those who like simpler have a hi in front of or on this all with you was an online store 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.360
 fotos.ua and my name is Maxim subscribe to our YouTube channel and yours will come true 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.940
