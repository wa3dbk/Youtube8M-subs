00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.980
 and 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.350
 let's make a ring and a necklace 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.840
 coffin 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.340
 The materials that you are going to use are 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.340
 home of or me 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.769
 scissors 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.420
 spring or elastic 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.260
 a chain or a necklace that you no longer use 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.750
 is more white and preferably that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.750
 have the very thin brush 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.900
 black adhesive tape this tape the 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.710
 they use a lot in the facilities 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.710
 electric 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.239
 finally thread and needle 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.720
 we start by cutting a rectangle and 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.520
 then you are going to cut the edges until 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.520
 make a coffin shape 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.299
 now you will make a smaller figure 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 with black adhesive tape 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 will cover the entire coffin both sides 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.420
 as for the center that is all even 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.370
 that does not have any type of bubble 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.370
 or anything that is all covered 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.210
 now it will cut the ends of equal 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.210
 so that you get the coffin shape 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.220
 Repeat the same steps with the piece more 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.220
 little 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.630
 and the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.110
 jose the spring or the elastic with 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.180
 smaller coffin by the part of 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.689
 in the middle 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.689
 and 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.700
 and 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.320
 measure the spring on your finger and sew the two 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.320
 extremities 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.239
 and ready we have the ring now only 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.450
 we have to decorate it like we 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.519
 we want now I'm going to make a hand 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.489
 of skeleton but you can do what 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.920
 you can make a skull 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.709
 you can make a skeleton you can do 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.799
 some ribs or you can make a cross 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.829
 what you want just blows your 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.829

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:48.340
