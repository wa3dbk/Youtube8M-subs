that I need to mention first thing is

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.479 
that I need to mention first thing is
that<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.820> accepts<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:57.510> ddr3<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.040> just<00:00:59.340> like

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that it accepts now ddr3 so just like

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.940 
that it accepts now ddr3 so just like
the<00:00:59.640> Intel<00:00:59.970> Core<00:01:00.270> i7<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.440> also<00:01:01.590> takes

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
the Intel Core i7 this one also takes

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.789 
the Intel Core i7 this one also takes
ddr3<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.000> using<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.450> 45<00:01:04.170> nanometer

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
ddr3 it's using the 45 nanometer

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.249 
ddr3 it's using the 45 nanometer
architecture<00:01:05.579> now<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.060> die<00:01:06.210> size<00:01:06.509> so<00:01:07.140> it's

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
architecture now the die size so it's

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.289 
architecture now the die size so it's
going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:07.560> less<00:01:07.920> energy<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> use

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
going to use less energy and if you use

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.020 
going to use less energy and if you use
the<00:01:09.479> built-in<00:01:09.840> AMD<00:01:10.500> tools<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.369> keep<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.820> cool

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
degrees Celsius which is super low this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.620 
degrees Celsius which is super low this
is<00:02:20.519> great<00:02:20.849> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
is great and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.020 
is great and
it's<00:02:21.810> at<00:02:21.960> full<00:02:22.350> load<00:02:22.620> I'm<00:02:23.340> looking<00:02:23.820> at<00:02:23.910> about

29 to 30 degrees Celsius which is just

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.050 
29 to 30 degrees Celsius which is just
incredible<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.860> shows<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.730> could

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
incredible it shows you that I could

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.000 
incredible it shows you that I could
probably<00:02:30.270> overclock<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.260> even<00:02:31.650> more<00:02:31.950> than

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
probably overclock this even more than

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.470 
probably overclock this even more than
3.4<00:02:32.940> gigahertz<00:02:33.330> easy<00:02:33.900> okay<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.340> just<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.700> for

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
3.4 gigahertz easy okay but just for for

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.110 
3.4 gigahertz easy okay but just for for
now<00:02:36.630> since<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.260> got<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.530> stable<00:02:37.920> at<00:02:37.980> 3.4<00:02:38.670> we're

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
now since I got it stable at 3.4 we're

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.760 
now since I got it stable at 3.4 we're
gonna<00:02:39.240> stick<00:02:39.570> at<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.870> now<00:02:40.350> let's<00:02:40.560> look<00:02:40.620> at

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
gonna stick at that now let's look at

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.430 
gonna stick at that now let's look at
some<00:02:40.920> 3d<00:02:41.220> mark<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:41.700> 3d<00:02:42.090> Vantage<00:02:42.510> results<00:02:43.020> all

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
some 3d mark and 3d Vantage results all

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
my tests are at 1280 x 1024 and i tried

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.800 
my tests are at 1280 x 1024 and i tried
to<00:02:47.460> have<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.700> always<00:02:48.030> maxed<00:02:48.930> out<00:02:49.110> okay<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.810> 1750

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
to have it always maxed out okay so 1750

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.310 
to have it always maxed out okay so 1750
1<00:02:51.930> 0<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.560> compare<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:54.320> future

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320

give<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> good<00:03:05.130> idea<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.730> other<00:03:06.090> Intel<00:03:06.630> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
give you a good idea on other Intel and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.710 
give you a good idea on other Intel and
phantom<00:03:07.730> processors<00:03:08.730> ok<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.570> use

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
phantom processors ok so you can use

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.380 
phantom processors ok so you can use
that<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.950> 3d<00:03:11.190> Vantage<00:03:11.820> result<00:03:12.210> the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
that here is the 3d Vantage result the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.020 
that here is the 3d Vantage result the
p1<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:12.990> eight<00:03:13.290> eight<00:03:13.530> zero<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.580> CPU

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
p1 one eight eight zero and the CPU

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.810 
p1 one eight eight zero and the CPU
score<00:03:15.450> I've<00:03:15.960> got<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> very<00:03:16.500> decent<00:03:16.920> result<00:03:17.580> and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
score I've got a very decent result and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.090 
score I've got a very decent result and
again<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.630> can<00:03:18.810> compare<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.350> on<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.800> future

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
again you can compare that on the future

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.340 
again you can compare that on the future
mark<00:03:20.310> website<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:21.300> three<00:03:21.840> other<00:03:21.990> similar

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
mark website to three other similar

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.920 
mark website to three other similar
systems<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.280> here<00:03:23.910> are<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.270> results<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:24.870> you

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
systems and here are the results so you

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.700 
systems and here are the results so you
get<00:03:25.080> an<00:03:25.170> idea<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.860> what<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.580> comparable<00:03:27.360> to

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
get an idea on what it is comparable to

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.530 
get an idea on what it is comparable to
ok<00:03:28.710> so<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.160> can<00:03:29.220> use<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.580> again<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.390> your

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
ok so you can use that again for your

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.050 
ok so you can use that again for your
reference<00:03:31.020> now<00:03:31.770> let's<00:03:32.010> take<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> look<00:03:32.400> at<00:03:32.610> the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
reference now let's take a look at the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.980 
reference now let's take a look at the
Sandra<00:03:33.800> software<00:03:34.800> here<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.550> some<00:03:35.760> other

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
Sandra software here for some other

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.690 
Sandra software here for some other
benchmarks<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.080> support<00:03:37.560> these<00:03:37.710> results<00:03:38.280> and

benchmarks to support these results and

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.590 
benchmarks to support these results and
you<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:38.820> see<00:03:39.000> here<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.990> when<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.170> ran<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.680> CPU

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
you can see here that when I ran the CPU

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.550 
you can see here that when I ran the CPU
results<00:03:42.600> here<00:03:42.780> like<00:03:42.960> for<00:03:43.110> example<00:03:43.200> the

looking<00:04:09.750> at<00:04:10.280> something<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.459> wouldn't<00:04:12.030> be

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
looking at something that wouldn't be

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.000 
looking at something that wouldn't be
fair<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.870> compare<00:04:13.050> against<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.500> triple<00:04:13.800> core

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010

necessarily<00:04:14.670> now<00:04:15.030> let's<00:04:15.390> take<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.630> look<00:04:15.840> at

which is a newer game that when I was

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.790 
which is a newer game that when I was

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
getting a lower frame rate but then

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.460 
getting a lower frame rate but then
again<00:04:55.890> it<00:04:56.220> was<00:04:56.340> decent<00:04:56.670> and<00:04:57.290> Crysis<00:04:58.290> warhead

depending on the levels of course that

depending on the levels of course that
you're<00:05:08.640> running<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:09.030> on<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:09.690> but<00:05:09.990> other<00:05:10.230> than

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
you're running it on so but other than

you're running it on so but other than
that<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:11.160> was<00:05:11.220> a<00:05:11.370> very<00:05:11.670> nice<00:05:11.940> experience<00:05:12.420> to<00:05:12.630> to

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
that it was a very nice experience to to

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.260 
that it was a very nice experience to to
overclock<00:05:13.740> this<00:05:14.100> and<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.460> proves<00:05:14.760> that<00:05:14.970> I<00:05:15.000> can

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
overclock this and it proves that I can

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.030 
overclock this and it proves that I can
really<00:05:15.480> take<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:15.930> further<00:05:16.290> if<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.620> wanted

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
really take this further if I wanted

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.510 
really take this further if I wanted
without<00:05:17.490> any<00:05:18.000> water<00:05:18.840> cooling<00:05:19.290> so<00:05:19.650> definitely

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
without any water cooling so definitely

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.880 
without any water cooling so definitely
for<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.760> price<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.330> recommend<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.440> CPU

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
for the price I recommend the CPU

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.520 
for the price I recommend the CPU
because<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:23.310> can<00:05:23.460> do<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.580> lot<00:05:23.940> with<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.930> ok<00:05:25.500> and

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
because you can do a lot with it ok and

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.750 
because you can do a lot with it ok and
you<00:05:25.860> don't<00:05:26.010> have<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.220> go<00:05:26.310> out<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.520> get<00:05:26.610> another

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
you don't have to go out and get another

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.850 
you don't have to go out and get another
motherboard<00:05:27.450> for<00:05:27.810> example<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.380> you<00:05:28.470> can<00:05:28.650> use

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
motherboard for example and you can use

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.920 
motherboard for example and you can use
the<00:05:29.040> new<00:05:29.220> DDR<00:05:29.640> Ram<00:05:29.670> when<00:05:30.120> when<00:05:30.540> it<00:05:30.630> comes<00:05:30.810> down

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
the new DDR Ram when when it comes down

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.440 
the new DDR Ram when when it comes down
in<00:05:31.080> price<00:05:31.290> so<00:05:31.830> there<00:05:31.980> you<00:05:32.070> go<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.180> hope

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
in price so there you go and you hope

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.150
