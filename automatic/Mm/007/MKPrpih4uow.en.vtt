00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.910
 let me explain now how that diet 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.130
 the maintenance of the isabelle for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.960
 really all that happened in the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.390
 her life to be a reality and a 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.199
 child is one of the years that we have 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.080
 what to expect 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.960
 I know she obeyed she had what the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.900
 people hope we determined it is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.810
 Isabelle fulfilled this is a success. 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.640
 Okay, I just wanna watch her. 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.200
 every three months 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 because now I'm going to give a maintenance to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.550
 she's much more calories 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.070
 She's going to have two days off you go. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.270
 leave it at birthday parties 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.280
 she will choose that we already 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.250
 talked to her about the quantities 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.140
 she goes on if she wants one if she stops 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.180
 in front of mac donald if you want some 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 thing things everything we taught 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.140
 You'll leave because we already showed. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.449
 to her 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.879
 we show for the consequences by 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.719
 example or when eating excess of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.910
 sugar 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.949
 only it never erases from her memory 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.200
 that sugar will pay for sand in the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.180
 her blood that if she convinces 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.420
 fat it will clog her vein 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.640
 that her stomach is very different from 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.080
 an adult's stomach 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 if she wants, never force her to brig 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.990
 let there that after you show 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.729
 consequence of the three-month cnaa 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.700
 when the holiday is over, it's going to be a 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.290
 good chance 10 for isabelle who 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 She's going to have a pool. 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.509
 barbecue she goes to her friends' house 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.369
 it will have several different things and 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.280
 let's see how she will follow her 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.750
 dealing with weight maintenance 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.369
 She's going to have both days off very much. 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.220
 more calories we will put the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.500
 sweet popsicles she likes everything 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.570
 I'll work out this diet and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.210
 I 'll give it to you, I 'll give you two. 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.610
 diets that I'm going to encourage her to do 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.560
 one hour of physical activity per day 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.799
 if she does an hour of activity 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.290
 physics by day jumping rope joking 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.640
 do not jump jumping on you 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.420
 will give the diet that have more calories 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.730
 she will be able to eat 400 more calories 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 maybe two slices of pizza 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.930
 maybe the pasta 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.599
 Costa understands why she will understand 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.110
 that the day she spends she can eat 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.050
 more and from here 96 in three months 90 days 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.660
 We see what will happen, I will. 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.420
 Give it to Isabelle, I want to. 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.160
 that you use it here with her 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.750
 this here is going to help him stuff 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.930
 interesting in the part of education 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.430
 for us to keep is all 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.550
 this learning she learned 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.860
 during the weight loss process 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.620
 these bracelets which are which is the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.319
 Her goal it starts with 6 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.500
 bracelets on left hand 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.170
 is the recommendation is that a child 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.250
 consume six servings of fruit and 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.489
 vegetables 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.380
 I do not know of every 16 author then every 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.690
 Portion nightmare for fear of it passes 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.250
 for being the right hand at the end of the night 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.049
 It's interesting you check with her. 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.840
 to show her that every initiative 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.150
 try to get six servings of 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.400
 is watching his legal daughter 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.040
 celebrating you as I own you 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.320
 You like I had that mother put on the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.260
 not even for your snack 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.989
 okay so that would be a way from her 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.420
 eating six servings of fruit and vegetable is 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.420
 one has a lot of stomach to think about 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.569
 eat other things understand this dish 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.600
 helps her tune in at the time she 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.160
 It is there on the stove that is serving 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.459
 interesting you leave isabelle 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.239
 independent and observe the upper part 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.519
 she would have to put vegetable salad or 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.100
 fruit that has a child who likes to eat 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.980
 lettuce with strawberry or a salad with 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.470
 Then pineapple would be in that part, right? 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.310
 only part of this part 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.010
 round here it is here it has the part 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.220
 of carbohydrate where it puts noodles 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.889
 por and rice and here the part of the protein 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.500
 where she can put the beef 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.139
 the fish or chicken ok she can not 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.560
 repeat because it is interesting 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:19.829
 because there is to pass or Arabic that happens 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.919
 The biggest mistake is at the time of 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.830
 food meal because the bread 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.379
 yogurt 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.409
 This has calories on the label but the food 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.699
 she can not come and put more 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.930
 understand she can not go back with this 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.340
 dish 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.830
 here is a 11 booklet with 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.379
 Related searches 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.080
 and you can then get others to know 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:46.719
 because everything you do so that the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.479
 isabella is always in contact with the 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:53.919
 commercial is interesting to her. 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55.599
 book is a joke story so 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.169
 she has it in her mind so she can 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:02.370
 consume her mind and this is your 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.050
 The bag that is written here is 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.210
 reserved for healthy food only 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.830
 When she was in the market I do not know if 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.560
 You have this habit but this is a 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.520
 Interesting thing to do with you 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.639
 for her to choose her food she knows 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.900
 Mother I want this and Czech they think 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.300
 This is healthy child because here in 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.180
 can only get healthy food 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.029
 Okay then with all this I'm sure 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.060
 that she is going to keep she is all with 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:34.169
 all the material for the mother of that weight and 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.779
 in 90 days we see the result 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:41.650
 I hope it is the result that the 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.879
 people are not building on her 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.009
 however in this period you need 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.120
 any help if you have to call 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.979

 something happens a trip of 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.509
 two weeks that you feel lost is 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:55.629

 Isabelle 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.610
 where the grandmother
