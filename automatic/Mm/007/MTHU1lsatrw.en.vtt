00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
tack today and it's quite surprising

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.090 
tack today and it's quite surprising
because<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.590> how<00:02:34.680> well<00:02:34.890> they've<00:02:35.070> done

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100

of<00:02:59.790> play<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.210> I<00:03:00.270> think<00:03:00.450> as<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.660> first<00:03:00.960> real

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200

Bishop on this near touch line he plays

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.060 
Bishop on this near touch line he plays
that<00:03:05.460> infield<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.750> laid<00:03:07.050> off<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.440> fry<00:03:07.740> he

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
that infield it's laid off to fry he

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.070 
that infield it's laid off to fry he
