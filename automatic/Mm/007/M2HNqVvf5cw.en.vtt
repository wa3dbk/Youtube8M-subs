would be a real pain in them in the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.860 
would be a real pain in them in the
bottom<00:02:43.460> all<00:02:44.460> right<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.630> 3

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
bottom all right so this is the 3

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.060 
bottom all right so this is the 3
millimeter<00:02:46.970> lock<00:02:47.970> nuts<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:52.440> 3

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
millimeter lock nuts and the 3

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.270 
millimeter lock nuts and the 3
millimeter<00:02:53.280> by<00:02:53.670> 30<00:02:54.090> socket<00:02:54.870> head<00:02:55.050> scrub<00:02:55.770> caps

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
millimeter by 30 socket head scrub caps

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.730 
millimeter by 30 socket head scrub caps
group<00:03:02.390> okay<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.450> for<00:03:03.990> this<00:03:04.110> part<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.710> should

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
group okay so for this part you should

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.460 
group okay so for this part you should
be<00:03:05.070> using<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.610> 1/8<00:03:06.240> size<00:03:06.720> drill<00:03:07.230> bit<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.470> this

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
be using the 1/8 size drill bit and this

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.600 
be using the 1/8 size drill bit and this
is<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> drill<00:03:11.489> bit<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.370> reason

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
is this is the drill bit and the reason

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.490 
is this is the drill bit and the reason
why<00:03:14.700> we're<00:03:14.850> using<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.450> because<00:03:15.959> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
why we're using this is because the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.580 
why we're using this is because the
screw<00:03:17.190> actually<00:03:17.670> does<00:03:17.880> not<00:03:18.180> fit<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:19.050> begin

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
screw actually does not fit to begin

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.910 
screw actually does not fit to begin
with<00:03:19.970> so<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.270> current<00:03:21.630> holes<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.500> not<00:03:22.680> quite

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
with so the current holes just not quite

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.479 
with so the current holes just not quite
big<00:03:23.100> enough<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:24.500> large<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.890> hole<00:03:26.100> you

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
big enough so just large in the hole you

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:37.460 
big enough so just large in the hole you
know<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:32.220> if<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.850> look<00:03:33.060> now<00:03:33.510> oh<00:03:35.570> it's<00:03:36.570> yes<00:03:37.140> it

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
know so if you look now oh it's yes it

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.330 
know so if you look now oh it's yes it
is<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.739> 1/8<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:41.750> now<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.810> screw<00:03:43.410> will<00:03:44.040> fit

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
is the 1/8 but now the screw will fit

00:03:44.340 --> 00:04:00.920 
is the 1/8 but now the screw will fit
and<00:03:45.860> that's<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:47.070> good<00:03:47.220> thing

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.809 

and<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:02.579> have<00:04:02.790> finished<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.450> installation<00:04:04.140> of

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
and I have finished the installation of

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.559 
and I have finished the installation of
the<00:04:05.819> upgrade<00:04:06.420> slash<00:04:06.900> repair<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:09.090> steering

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
the upgrade slash repair of the steering

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.880 
the upgrade slash repair of the steering
linkage<00:04:09.689> on<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.439> axial<00:04:11.040> scx10<00:04:12.470> now<00:04:13.470> if<00:04:13.739> you

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
linkage on the axial scx10 now if you

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.770 
linkage on the axial scx10 now if you
notice<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.780> did<00:04:15.780> by<00:04:16.759> three<00:04:17.759> millimeter<00:04:18.269> by

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
notice I did by three millimeter by

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.939 
notice I did by three millimeter by
thirty<00:04:19.560> millimeter<00:04:20.039> socket<00:04:20.789> head<00:04:20.940> cap<00:04:21.150> screws

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
thirty millimeter socket head cap screws

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.980 
thirty millimeter socket head cap screws
the<00:04:22.949> reason<00:04:23.280> for<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:23.940> we<00:04:24.419> did<00:04:24.600> know<00:04:24.780> that

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
the reason for that and we did know that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.040 
the reason for that and we did know that
it<00:04:25.110> was<00:04:25.199> too<00:04:25.350> long<00:04:25.530> when<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:25.860> bought<00:04:26.160> them<00:04:27.050> is

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
it was too long when I bought them is

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.529 
it was too long when I bought them is
because<00:04:28.500> not<00:04:29.310> only<00:04:29.370> did<00:04:29.729> they<00:04:29.850> not<00:04:29.880> have<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
because not only did they not have the

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.100 
because not only did they not have the
20<00:04:31.440> either<00:04:32.370> 20<00:04:32.639> or<00:04:32.759> 25<00:04:33.180> millimeter<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.750> think<00:04:34.020> it

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
20 either 20 or 25 millimeter I think it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.409 
20 either 20 or 25 millimeter I think it
was<00:04:34.260> in<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:36.000> right<00:04:36.270> type<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.870> screw<00:04:37.800> but<00:04:38.419> also

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
was in the right type of screw but also

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.460 
was in the right type of screw but also
this<00:04:40.410> way<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.680> have<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.160> extra<00:04:41.340> space<00:04:42.090> on<00:04:42.470> it

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
this way you have the extra space on it

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.980 
this way you have the extra space on it
that<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.949> can<00:04:44.100> play<00:04:44.280> around<00:04:44.400> with<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.900> you

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
that you can play around with so you

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.500 
that you can play around with so you
cannot<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.800> mean<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.970> can<00:04:48.120> always<00:04:48.330> go<00:04:48.479> out

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
cannot I mean you you can always go out

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.540 
cannot I mean you you can always go out
up<00:04:48.750> with<00:04:48.840> some<00:04:48.990> bolt<00:04:49.199> cutters<00:04:49.289> and<00:04:49.680> cut<00:04:50.400> it

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
up with some bolt cutters and cut it

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.409 
up with some bolt cutters and cut it
shorter<00:04:50.880> if<00:04:50.910> you<00:04:51.090> have<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.419> deal<00:04:51.680> right<00:04:53.419> that

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
shorter if you have to deal right that

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.029 
shorter if you have to deal right that
much<00:04:54.599> but<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:55.020> way<00:04:55.169> we<00:04:55.349> just<00:04:55.500> had<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.770> extra

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
much but this way we just had the extra

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.350 
much but this way we just had the extra
space<00:04:56.250> just<00:04:56.490> in<00:04:56.610> case<00:04:56.789> there's<00:04:57.090> something

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
space just in case there's something

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.839 
space just in case there's something
extra<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.139> way<00:04:58.260> that<00:04:58.740> we<00:04:59.130> wanted<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.490> add<00:04:59.669> on

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
extra that way that we wanted to add on

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.879 
extra that way that we wanted to add on
there<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.270> mean<00:05:01.050> this<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:01.349> a<00:05:01.380> pretty<00:05:01.680> good

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
there I mean this is a pretty good

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.879 
there I mean this is a pretty good
distance<00:05:02.099> between<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.759> top<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.900> where<00:05:04.770> the

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
distance between the top and where the

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.300 
distance between the top and where the
bottom<00:05:05.220> blocking<00:05:06.320> with<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.349> bottom<00:05:07.710> insert

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
bottom blocking with the bottom insert

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.760 
bottom blocking with the bottom insert

lock nuts with barbed nylon locknut it

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.540 
lock nuts with barbed nylon locknut it
is<00:05:11.810> but<00:05:12.810> yeah<00:05:13.289> so<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:13.889> the<00:05:14.419> entity<00:05:16.550> at

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
is but yeah so that is the entity at
