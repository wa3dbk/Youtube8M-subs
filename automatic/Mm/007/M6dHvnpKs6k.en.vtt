00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
first reason has to do with low light a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260 
first reason has to do with low light a
tripod<00:01:28.619> allows<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> shoot<00:01:29.820> things<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
really low light where a flash just

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.240 
really low light where a flash just
can't<00:01:33.000> help<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:34.020> example<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.829> was

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.450 
on my camera isn't going to light up an
entire<00:01:41.070> city<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:42.990> tripod<00:01:43.979> allowed<00:01:44.310> me

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
entire city and so my tripod allowed me

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880 
entire city and so my tripod allowed me
to<00:01:44.490> shoot<00:01:44.759> really<00:01:45.240> long<00:01:45.450> exposures<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.590> low

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
to shoot really long exposures with low

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.639 
to shoot really long exposures with low
ISO<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> reduce<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.420> noise<00:01:48.600> while<00:01:49.200> keeping<00:01:49.530> my

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
ISO to reduce the noise while keeping my

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.469 
ISO to reduce the noise while keeping my
camera<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.220> moving<00:01:50.369> around<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> was

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
camera from moving around and so I was

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.999 
camera from moving around and so I was
able<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> create<00:01:52.200> some<00:01:52.439> really<00:01:52.470> nice

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009

low-light<00:01:53.850> photographs<00:01:54.390> where<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> flash<00:01:54.930> just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
low-light photographs where a flash just

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.109 
low-light photographs where a flash just
wouldn't<00:01:55.649> work<00:01:55.799> now<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.280> travels<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.909> want<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119

to do the trick

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.780 
to do the trick
the<00:02:03.689> second<00:02:04.259> reason<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.710> chose<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.460> bring<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the second reason I chose to bring a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.940 
the second reason I chose to bring a
tripod<00:02:06.149> was<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.200> allows<00:02:07.409> me<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> do<00:02:07.770> some

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950

really<00:02:08.099> awesome<00:02:08.640> things<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.149> scenic

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
really awesome things in scenic

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.990 
really awesome things in scenic
photography<00:02:09.840> specifically<00:02:10.739> with<00:02:11.009> water<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
photography specifically with water it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220 
photography specifically with water it
allows<00:02:12.270> me<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.569> drag

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
allows me to drag

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.809 
allows me to drag
the<00:02:13.470> shutter<00:02:13.800> using<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.250> neutral<00:02:14.640> density

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
the shutter using a neutral density

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.600 
the shutter using a neutral density
filter<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.500> go<00:02:16.680> into<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.099> forests

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
filter and so I can go into the forests

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.369 
filter and so I can go into the forests
or<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.730> jungles<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.360> create<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.140> really

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
or the jungles and create that really

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.740 
or the jungles and create that really
glass-like<00:02:19.890> effect<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.910> water<00:02:21.269> it's

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
glass-like effect on water it's

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.540 
glass-like effect on water it's
something<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.440> flash<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:23.129> won't<00:02:23.340> help

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
something that a flash just won't help

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.550 
something that a flash just won't help

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
wobbly and it can make a sort of motion

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.400 
wobbly and it can make a sort of motion
sick<00:02:35.819> because<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.330> really<00:02:36.630> not<00:02:36.959> still<00:02:37.319> you

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
need a tripod you can see these boats

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.289 
need a tripod you can see these boats
behind<00:02:39.750> me<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.900> shot<00:02:40.260> two<00:02:40.560> videos<00:02:41.040> one<00:02:41.340> handheld

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
and you can see it's sort of all over

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.570 
and you can see it's sort of all over
the<00:02:43.590> place<00:02:43.650> even<00:02:43.980> though<00:02:44.099> I'm<00:02:44.190> holding<00:02:44.549> that

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580

being<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.549> handheld<00:02:47.849> just<00:02:48.180> isn't<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> match<00:02:48.660> for

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
being a handheld just isn't a match for

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.990 
being a handheld just isn't a match for
having<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.260> tripod<00:02:49.799> on<00:02:49.950> your<00:02:50.099> camera<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.880> is

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.860 
the stars I was out one night and said
wow<00:03:41.010> these<00:03:41.280> stars<00:03:41.519> are<00:03:41.639> amazing<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.660> got

this<00:03:43.049> shot<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.680> stars<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.400> would<00:03:44.489> have

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
this shot of the stars it would have

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.580 
this shot of the stars it would have
been<00:03:44.730> totally<00:03:45.090> impossible<00:03:45.630> without<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.989> tripod

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
been totally impossible without a tripod

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.340 
been totally impossible without a tripod
and<00:03:46.910> more<00:03:47.910> notably<00:03:48.239> none<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.019> those<00:03:49.139> would

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
and more notably none of those would

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.440 
and more notably none of those would
have<00:03:49.380> been<00:03:49.470> possible<00:03:49.950> with<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.340> flash<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.120> so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
have been possible with the flash and so

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.809 
have been possible with the flash and so
for<00:03:51.690> me<00:03:51.810> my<00:03:52.079> options<00:03:52.889> for<00:03:53.040> travel<00:03:53.340> photography

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
for me my options for travel photography

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.550 
for me my options for travel photography
are<00:03:53.910> much<00:03:54.209> greater<00:03:54.569> with<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> tripod<00:03:55.319> than

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
are much greater with the tripod than

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.960 
are much greater with the tripod than
they<00:03:55.650> are<00:03:55.680> with<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:55.980> flash<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.639> that's<00:03:56.730> why<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
they are with the flash and that's why I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.000 
they are with the flash and that's why I
chose<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.510> one<00:03:57.660> over<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.200> flash<00:03:58.410> again<00:03:58.739> if

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
chose that one over the flash again if

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.770 
chose that one over the flash again if
you<00:03:59.099> can<00:03:59.220> bring<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.430> flash<00:03:59.639> bring<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.359> but<00:04:00.660> if

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
you can bring a flash bring it but if

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.599 
you can bring a flash bring it but if
you<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.200> choose<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.769> think<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.250> winner<00:04:02.430> is

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
you have to choose I think the winner is

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.550 
you have to choose I think the winner is
