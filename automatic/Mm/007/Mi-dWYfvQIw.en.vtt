00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.440 

robbing<00:00:04.130> difficult<00:00:04.460> to<00:00:04.609> know<00:00:04.730> where<00:00:04.970> to<00:00:05.000> start

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
robbing difficult to know where to start

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.059 
robbing difficult to know where to start
really<00:00:05.689> but<00:00:05.870> what's<00:00:06.439> your<00:00:06.529> reaction<00:00:06.680> to<00:00:07.040> that

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
really but what's your reaction to that

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.850 
really but what's your reaction to that
different<00:00:07.609> here<00:00:07.760> today

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
different here today

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.880 
different here today
I<00:00:09.940> think<00:00:10.940> it's<00:00:11.140> unless<00:00:12.140> result<00:00:12.470> if<00:00:12.680> you<00:00:12.710> look

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
I think it's unless result if you look

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.790 
I think it's unless result if you look
at<00:00:13.010> the<00:00:13.070> game<00:00:13.220> sounds<00:00:14.210> crazy<00:00:14.480> maybe<00:00:14.870> but<00:00:15.230> it<00:00:15.650> is

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
at the game sounds crazy maybe but it is

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.880 
at the game sounds crazy maybe but it is
when<00:00:16.430> he<00:00:16.519> was<00:00:16.670> much<00:00:17.029> better<00:00:17.240> than<00:00:17.449> us<00:00:17.740> so<00:00:18.740> we

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
when he was much better than us so we

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.420 
when he was much better than us so we
have<00:00:19.010> to<00:00:19.100> deal<00:00:19.250> with<00:00:19.430> that<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.410> look<00:00:21.410> for<00:00:22.310> here

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
have to deal with that and look for here

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.859 
have to deal with that and look for here
for<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.789> for<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.119> next<00:00:23.300> game<00:00:23.449> which<00:00:23.630> is<00:00:23.660> in

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
for the for the next game which is in

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:24.900 
for the for the next game which is in
two<00:00:23.960> weeks

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
two weeks

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.130 
two weeks
was<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.000> difficult<00:00:26.210> in<00:00:26.449> that<00:00:26.510> second<00:00:26.990> half

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
was it difficult in that second half

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.109 
was it difficult in that second half
mention<00:00:27.980> early<00:00:28.130> were<00:00:28.250> three<00:00:28.520> one<00:00:28.730> up<00:00:28.880> and

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
mention early were three one up and

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.019 
mention early were three one up and
teams<00:00:29.990> get<00:00:30.199> in<00:00:30.350> a<00:00:30.470> situation<00:00:31.430> where<00:00:31.670> they<00:00:31.820> can

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
teams get in a situation where they can

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.450 
teams get in a situation where they can
they<00:00:32.930> can<00:00:33.140> concede<00:00:33.559> goes<00:00:33.769> cheaply<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.399> it

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
they can concede goes cheaply and it

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.930 
they can concede goes cheaply and it
seemed<00:00:34.699> us<00:00:36.010> yeah<00:00:37.010> we<00:00:37.280> had<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.399> couple<00:00:37.820> of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
seemed us yeah we had a couple of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.780 
seemed us yeah we had a couple of
chances<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:39.649> free<00:00:39.950> one<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:40.370> thought<00:00:40.520> and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
chances and the free one we thought and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.440 
chances and the free one we thought and
I<00:00:40.969> felt<00:00:41.899> that<00:00:41.960> if<00:00:42.200> you<00:00:42.320> had<00:00:42.430> taken<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:43.610> yeah

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
I felt that if you had taken that yeah

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.030 
I felt that if you had taken that yeah
one<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.719> them<00:00:44.899> that<00:00:45.380> would<00:00:45.649> have<00:00:45.829> been<00:00:46.010> a

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
one of them that would have been a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.490 
one of them that would have been a
different<00:00:46.430> game<00:00:46.579> but<00:00:46.610> it's<00:00:47.450> always<00:00:47.600> ifs<00:00:48.050> and

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
different game but it's always ifs and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.299 
different game but it's always ifs and
buts<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.200> if<00:00:51.200> you<00:00:51.350> look<00:00:51.500> at<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.680> facts<00:00:52.010> it's

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
buts but if you look at the facts it's

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.180 
buts but if you look at the facts it's
just<00:00:52.989> simply<00:00:53.989> not<00:00:54.110> good<00:00:54.289> enough<00:00:54.320> when<00:00:55.070> he<00:00:55.100> was

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
just simply not good enough when he was

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.580 
just simply not good enough when he was
much<00:00:55.489> better<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.059> they<00:00:56.809> punished<00:00:57.140> us<00:00:57.320> hard

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
much better and they punished us hard

much better and they punished us hard
and<00:00:58.120> yeah<00:01:00.340> we<00:01:01.340> can't<00:01:01.579> change<00:01:01.789> anything

we've been one one because it turned

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.760 
we've been one one because it turned
into<00:01:25.219> two<00:01:25.429> nil<00:01:25.639> quite<00:01:25.849> quickly<00:01:26.109> yes<00:01:27.109> a<00:01:27.409> couple

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
into two nil quite quickly yes a couple

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.609 
into two nil quite quickly yes a couple
of<00:01:27.829> years<00:01:27.950> later<00:01:28.249> was<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.729> nil<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.119> what<00:01:29.929> about

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
of years later was to nil and what about

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.980 
of years later was to nil and what about
that<00:01:30.829> I<00:01:31.249> was<00:01:31.849> quite<00:01:32.060> confident<00:01:32.450> before<00:01:32.659> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
that I was quite confident before the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.069 
that I was quite confident before the
been<00:01:33.469> about<00:01:34.310> my<00:01:34.459> corner<00:01:34.880> but<00:01:35.569> he<00:01:35.689> saved<00:01:35.929> it

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
been about my corner but he saved it

been about my corner but he saved it
well<00:01:36.319> I<00:01:36.349> think<00:01:36.469> it<00:01:36.770> was<00:01:36.889> okay<00:01:37.609> taking<00:01:37.880> penalty

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.039 
well I think it was okay taking penalty
good<00:01:40.099> safe<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.639> those<00:01:41.389> things<00:01:41.630> happened<00:01:41.990> you

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
good safe and those things happened you

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
yeah there was a bit of a turning point

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.190 
yeah there was a bit of a turning point
as<00:01:51.649> well<00:01:51.829> because<00:01:52.249> if<00:01:52.819> that<00:01:53.029> one<00:01:53.270> had<00:01:53.840> gone<00:01:54.020> in

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
a sense that wasn't quite the real last

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.919 
a sense that wasn't quite the real last
about<00:02:03.950> there<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:04.369> if<00:02:04.909> eight<00:02:05.299> or<00:02:05.509> nine<00:02:05.659> players

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929

about there so if eight or nine players
out<00:02:06.200> there<00:02:06.229> suspension<00:02:06.829> or<00:02:06.919> injury<00:02:07.189> today<00:02:07.429> was

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
out there suspension or injury today was

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.430 
out there suspension or injury today was
there<00:02:07.849> a<00:02:07.880> sense<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.239> that<00:02:08.569> wasn't<00:02:08.840> quite<00:02:09.170> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
there a sense that that wasn't quite the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.469 
there a sense that that wasn't quite the
real<00:02:09.679> arson<00:02:10.069> about

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
real arson about

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.720 
real arson about
today<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.170> will<00:02:11.680> get<00:02:11.890> stronger<00:02:12.099> it's<00:02:12.580> not

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
today and you will get stronger it's not

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.610 
today and you will get stronger it's not
the<00:02:12.819> excuse<00:02:13.180> because<00:02:13.780> they<00:02:14.020> had<00:02:14.140> players<00:02:14.379> out

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
the excuse because they had players out

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.559 
the excuse because they had players out
as<00:02:14.800> well<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:17.129> no<00:02:18.129> I<00:02:18.430> don't<00:02:19.000> think<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.300> we<00:02:19.420> can

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
as well so no I don't think that we can

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.580 
as well so no I don't think that we can
hide<00:02:19.810> behind<00:02:20.470> injuries<00:02:21.129> or<00:02:21.459> suspensions<00:02:22.590> this

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
hide behind injuries or suspensions this

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.890 
hide behind injuries or suspensions this
is<00:02:23.709> what<00:02:23.860> happens<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.280> football<00:02:24.900> everyone

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
our maximum but it was clearly not good

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.350 
our maximum but it was clearly not good
enough<00:02:40.180> can<00:02:41.110> also<00:02:41.230> come<00:02:41.470> back<00:02:41.620> from<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:42.360> well

home<00:02:47.170> which<00:02:48.069> is<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.250> good<00:02:48.459> opponent<00:02:49.590> could

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
home which is a good opponent could

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.000 
home which is a good opponent could
challenge<00:02:52.030> for<00:02:52.180> us<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:52.630> I'm<00:02:53.500> looking<00:02:53.829> forward
