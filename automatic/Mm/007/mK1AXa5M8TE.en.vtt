00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.400
 so hello to all 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.570
 while I'm a little commented video on multiplayer 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.469
 of assassin's creed brotherhood 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.169
 she this high point of this round 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.479
 so must we recognize his words 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.479
 since it shows that to show their condolences that gm 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.759
 what I have ever seen 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.210
 white laurent so note also that the romantic douala card 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.259
 since it is rather recent 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.329
 so then I'll give everything a good little touch in the es4 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.760
 not at all 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.929
 but here I had rather little originals 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.929
 why not we can show this part 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 the price of its tires which do you speak 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.290
 the Basque coast the pylons 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.620
 balaj which is very very bad 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.620
 all targets hit and 9 may 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.690
 So here is 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.330
 on the map of rome 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.610
 at the time of learning more that came out 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.390
 it's just an update to make 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.260
 so I took officers if the mythical mount 3 and the political color 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.930
 my superior 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 an idea 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.190
 and I'm with a team that wins 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.440
 I understood what happened like that 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.290
 lepage is a topic I know I've done since 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.850
 right now that's why I'm scared 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.630
 I had a lot of luck we will say in practice what luck against sometimes 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.460
 it's signed by everyone if you are and I remained the last survivor 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 underground door open it takes a lot of small right now 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.969
 so I said to myself I'm obliged to give in to everything we know 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.639
 chess their heart 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.559
 we still know sarko in 2006 concluded not finished because we have an area 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:24.559
 good part and I built myself Gaddafi but the second run 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.159
 and actually debate 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.149
 I really did a good score and 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.149
 early May while the kraft company 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.400
 because the problem is that the parties are actually stalking there 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.109
 address 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.569
 and why a mexican mantra follows the fact of the super early game 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.249
 I am very first 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.249
 I think that practice all good action plans 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.179
 city ​​is this does that very quickly 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.039
 for a while I'm not at all 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.699
 and I am very quickly made feel his helmet 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.419
 I am little cramped way 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.659
 the players have very quickly 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.659
 I grew up the title 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.359
 or small deezer 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.359

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.939
 iic raise the score why i did a try 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.459
 here are the top standards like scott forstall and 300 wounded according to this 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.459
 growth is good with the ball and djibouti 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.439
