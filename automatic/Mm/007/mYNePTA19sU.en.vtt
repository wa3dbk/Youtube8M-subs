00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.490
 and back with high displacements of mine 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.699
 brother today we'll talk about a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.140
 moto and is in the category ultimate sport 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.449
 tur is the hayabusa 1300 cc and for 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.560
 talk more about this machine here in the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.599
 Comrade we live in a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.330
 dealer authorized here in the city 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.090
 Manaus talk to the rock and he 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.890
 will explain everything this machine can 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.930
 offer for the rock symbol and the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.760
 pleasure you knox input Louçã 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.500
 thank you for understanding and we are here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.899
 to help you grow a little more the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 doubt that the public is on the issue of 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.520
 hayabusa is a bike that is already part of 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.770
 of the history of motorcycling is a tire 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.800
 another that comes with 1300 dead displacements 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.480
 first motorcycle series that hit the 300 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.270
 kilometers per hour originally from 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.219
 factory and the bike that the one wanted by 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.050
 dream of any motorcycle rider. 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.600
 motorcyclist who sees this bike 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.970
 really wants to have her in the garage and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.560
 take a road and at full speed 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.750
 no one does not want anyone who does not want one 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.299
 idea this note 9 with 1300 displacements 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.580
 she comes with electronic injection is the motorcycle 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.340
 which was produced in a wind tunnel, right? 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.320
 that is a driver of that bike from 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.840
 from the moment he begins to direct the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.920
 bike he will feel the air passing through 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.270
 on top of him and down to the tail 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 just to stabilize the bike 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.250
 understood she comes with an ugly double was the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.110
 dis is both front and rear 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.110
 here comes the reason 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.890
 an interesting thing that we can 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.230
 to see from her name is not abused there 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.420
 Man, why the name of this girl today? 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.030
 the hayabusa means peregrine falcon 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.210
 because peregrine falcon was understood 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 is a Japanese hawk ken your dive is 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.070
 capable of killing there the 320 kilometers 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.510
 for an hour then to have a bike so 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.340
 fast as this 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.530
 soon her name had to be hayabusa 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.180
 I could not have another name for another 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.260
 cool thing you said that is the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.300
 system that the bike gains speed 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.740
 as according to the wind help as 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.920
 It works more or less that way in 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.610
 my region is to repair over 200 km 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.800
 per hour 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.560
 this system that this air intake you 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.950
 You can be voting here, it helps in 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.630
 mixture of combustible air is 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.190
 providing the pressure to enter 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.500
 with which the combustible air and mixture 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.270
 better in this technology if 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.240
 manages to gain about 10 horses 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.700
 Just know your two cv inputs 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.470
 in front of the cool bike and that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.290
 Speed ratio is also speaking 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.510
 that it has three modules in the audio spin 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.300
 Kisses and for those who do not know very well 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.100
 How does this motorcycle explain more or 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.470
 less how is each of the dead 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.450
 john these field modes is thus were 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.760
 so you have a control you did not see right? 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.500
 which is three modes of language I do not see 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.630
 this turn can get all the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.420
 power of the bike the spin see if you can 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.930
 have 90% of the bike and the spins and can 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.950
 have about 60 to 70 percent of the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.510
 motorcycle power 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.370
 that means then for those 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.920
 people who do not want to venture out soon 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.470
 first-rate at high speeds may have 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.209
 let alone one say stability 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.280
 a little bigger to enjoy 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.769
 this motorcycle without reaching the speed 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.600
 total is not that what the beginner to 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.820
 people advise is always using acted 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.370
 It 's because Manaus does not have the 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.810
 The track for us is using the whole 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.670
 bike power right 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.590
 already to intermediate old council 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.810
 causing professional b whirl that 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.519
 face that is more accustomed to high 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.970
 speed in the total spin of the bike 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.970
 giruá 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.349
 her model from the swiss model 2012 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.060
 he still comes with fredes model 2003 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.010
 already come with abs understood 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.590
 is an act that comes with different graphics 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.120
 but the design remains even until 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.220
 because it was produced in the tunnel of 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.379
 and wind and still failed 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.360
 overcome this design still this issue 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.970
 from the wind tunnel you said that 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.680
 is advantageous for motorcycles of 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.409
 High displacement begins here that 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.590
 hayabusa that she will bring to advantage 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.659
 the stability of the pilot both the pilot 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.000
 the bike and you can win in 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.639
 aerodynamics more speed it comes with 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.699
 a 21-liter tank she does on average 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.440
 16 to 18 kilometers chosen if 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.169
 can run on average more or less 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.449
 350 km to 380 km with one 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.880
 full tank we can also say 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.639
 that bike here we can say 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.340
 that this technological love bike is a 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.979
 In fact, since 1999 it has 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.419
 continues in the market and continues 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.169
 being the dream of any motorcyclist 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.169
 that is preached 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.180
 the rock for us can stay 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.620
 Motorcycle technology in this regard 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.260
 even in the panel né 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.750
 and that's right, john john this bike she comes 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.810
 with marker drm marker 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.330
 temperature marker and 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.770
 mileage is the way it comes complete 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.900
 Can you get the rider? 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.760
 have all the security that we have already 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.840
 I had spoken, can you have it on the panel? 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.730
 also ne 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.860
 for small and large trips and will 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.960
 to have this control forever of death 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.030
 have all the control of the bike as much as you 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.130
 already starts with the power of this bike already 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.380
 can have this control is a panel 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.630
 complete is shorter in the category 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.210
 we can say that the person is 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.760
 take a long trip suddenly out there 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.130
 our interiors or you can go to 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.110
 another country she can be carefree 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.090
 because all the information that she 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.770
 need to meet in the country and urged 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.960
 necessary information because the 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.450
 people going to pass on the panel will have this 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.960
 monitoring then total security 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.960
 on this bike 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.469
 ae 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.509
 on rock face here we can see that 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.520
 this bike can be so much used 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.680
 by the pilot point by the passenger is not 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.419
 that's right joão eça speck that the pilot 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.490
 he has the option of walking with the 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.439
 passenger or insulate the seat 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.909
 alone to make small or large 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.219
 great trip he has this option too 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:09.199
 in something else we can see from 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:11.990
 different faith in this show also that 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.909
 draws a lot of attention is her design 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.710
 that she even had one 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.530
 fairing here that will provide 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.020
 further improving the aerodynamics as already 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.150
 had spoken of the dynamics of this 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.580
 she is impeccable she does not have any motorcycle in the 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.979
 market that exceeds this aerodynamic 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.080
 new and rock face to anyone 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.759
 to get a bike like this 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.370
 your dream of having a bike like this 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.479
 drugs, how does he make his brother 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.969
 He comes here on President Avenue. 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.180
 white castle in the waterfall number 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:44.360
 1160 make a visit or call 3 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.409
 6 6 3 35 60 and talk to one of our 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.060
 consultants 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:49.689
 and you also have the option to e-mail the 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.879
 game can pass on sales at and arrears 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:55.310
 moto.com.br then lower fall does not lose 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.229
 this opportunity to get your 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:01.089
 dream that is such a high- powered bike 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.089
 I was honored then
