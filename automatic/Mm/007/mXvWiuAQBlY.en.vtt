another zipper in here and more cost
lots<00:02:24.370> here<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:26.410> think<00:02:26.860> it's<00:02:27.010> because<00:02:27.460> of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
lots here and I think it's because of

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.330 
lots here and I think it's because of
all<00:02:27.880> these<00:02:28.150> compartments<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:29.440> they<00:02:30.190> are

all these compartments that they are

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
all these compartments that they are
very<00:02:31.020> structured<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:33.010> terms<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.670> having<00:02:34.000> hard

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
very structured in terms of having hard

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.150 
very structured in terms of having hard
base<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.260> between<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.240> think<00:02:37.240> because<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.870> that

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.480 

it<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:43.000> doesn't<00:02:43.450> give<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:47.490> flexibility

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
it it doesn't give you the flexibility

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.790 
it it doesn't give you the flexibility
or<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.270> want<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.570> stuff<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.380> know<00:02:50.530> if<00:02:50.620> I'll

or if you want to stuff you know if I'll

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.980 
or if you want to stuff you know if I'll
put<00:02:51.130> like<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.970> me<00:02:52.090> if<00:02:52.270> I<00:02:52.360> want<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.660> put<00:02:52.810> all<00:02:52.840> my

stuff in these case become very bulky

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.890 
stuff in these case become very bulky
and<00:02:56.170> lose<00:02:56.950> its<00:02:57.310> shape<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:58.330> it's<00:02:58.570> getting
