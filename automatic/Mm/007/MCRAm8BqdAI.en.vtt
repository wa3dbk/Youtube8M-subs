00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.710 
crest lighting solutions today we're
just<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.589> talk<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:05.009> beam<00:00:05.490> angle<00:00:05.940> one

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
just going to talk about beam angle one

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.390 
just going to talk about beam angle one
of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.870> great<00:00:07.049> things<00:00:07.290> about<00:00:07.379> LED<00:00:07.950> lights<00:00:08.189> is

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
of the great things about LED lights is

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.919 
of the great things about LED lights is
that<00:00:08.550> they<00:00:08.670> give<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.000> lot<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.240> flexibility

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
that they give you a lot of flexibility

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.200 
that they give you a lot of flexibility
even<00:00:10.200> within<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.769> same<00:00:10.800> light<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.550> choosing

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
even within the same light of choosing

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.660 
even within the same light of choosing
different<00:00:12.750> beam<00:00:13.200> spreads<00:00:13.710> there's<00:00:14.400> always

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
different beam spreads there's always

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.340 
different beam spreads there's always
been<00:00:14.969> different<00:00:15.360> beam<00:00:15.509> spreads<00:00:15.929> you've<00:00:16.139> had

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
been different beam spreads you've had

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.410 
been different beam spreads you've had
spotlights<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.279> floodlights<00:00:17.789> basically

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
spotlights and floodlights basically

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.300 
spotlights and floodlights basically
forever<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.140> addition<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.010> course<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
forever in addition to of course the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.870 
forever in addition to of course the
light<00:00:20.550> bulb<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.970> shines<00:00:21.210> all<00:00:21.600> directions

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
light bulb that shines all directions

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.450 
light bulb that shines all directions
but<00:00:24.260> LEDs<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.590> give<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> little<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.310> more

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
but LEDs just give you a little bit more

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
but LEDs just give you a little bit more
opportunity<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.900> these<00:00:28.080> LEDs

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
opportunity and with these LEDs

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.099 
opportunity and with these LEDs
especially<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.539> opportunity<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
especially we have the opportunity to

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
especially we have the opportunity to
even<00:00:31.320> change<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.769> lens<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.669> want<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
even change the lens if you want to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.209 
even change the lens if you want to
alter<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.230> special<00:00:34.590> reasons<00:00:35.329> so

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
alter that for special reasons so

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.139 
alter that for special reasons so
understanding<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.700> best<00:00:38.879> choice

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
understanding which is the best choice

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.630 
understanding which is the best choice
of<00:00:39.329> lens<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.379> little<00:00:40.649> bit<00:00:40.770> tricky<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
of lens is a little bit tricky and the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.110 
of lens is a little bit tricky and the
best<00:00:41.820> way<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.640> so<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:45.030> I've

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
best way is to just see it so what I've

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.229 
best way is to just see it so what I've
got<00:00:45.149> here<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.230> 20<00:00:46.649> degree<00:00:46.770> lens<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.370> 38<00:00:47.910> degree

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
got here is a 20 degree lens a 38 degree

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.650 
got here is a 20 degree lens a 38 degree
lens<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> 60<00:00:49.260> degree<00:00:49.379> lens<00:00:53.210> 28<00:00:54.210> degree<00:00:54.480> lens

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
lens and a 60 degree lens 28 degree lens

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.380 
lens and a 60 degree lens 28 degree lens
is<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.850> spot<00:00:56.850> pretty<00:00:57.600> tight<00:00:57.930> spot<00:00:59.090> 20<00:01:00.090> degrees

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
is a spot pretty tight spot 20 degrees

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.399 
is a spot pretty tight spot 20 degrees
this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> 38<00:01:01.530> degrees<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.430> medium<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
this is 38 degrees which is medium and

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.090 
this is 38 degrees which is medium and
over<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> 60<00:01:06.330> degree<00:01:06.799> which<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
over here we have a 60 degree which is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.580 
over here we have a 60 degree which is
wide<00:01:08.820> I'll<00:01:09.180> try<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> put<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:09.750> things<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
wide I'll try to put these things the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.100 
wide I'll try to put these things the
same<00:01:10.770> distance<00:01:11.130> apart<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.479> 20

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
same distance apart so you can see 20

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.740 
same distance apart so you can see 20
degree<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.560> very<00:01:13.799> very<00:01:14.070> focused<00:01:14.390> 60<00:01:15.390> degree<00:01:15.659> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
degree is very very focused 60 degree is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.490 
degree is very very focused 60 degree is
very<00:01:15.960> wide

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
very wide

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
very wide
I'm<00:01:16.770> only<00:01:17.130> maybe<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.640> 2<00:01:17.909> feet<00:01:18.180> away<00:01:18.330> from

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
I'm only maybe about 2 feet away from

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.800 
I'm only maybe about 2 feet away from
the<00:01:18.900> surface<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.759> obviously<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> light's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the surface so obviously the light's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.690 
the surface so obviously the light's
going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> spread<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.770> much<00:01:23.040> more<00:01:23.340> when<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
going to spread that much more when you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.820 
going to spread that much more when you
get<00:01:23.880> further<00:01:24.119> away<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.750> let's<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.680> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
get further away and let's look at that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.780 
get further away and let's look at that
on<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.159> painting<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.850> now<00:01:27.770> if<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.979> chose<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> 60

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
on a painting just now if we chose a 60

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
on a painting just now if we chose a 60
degree<00:01:29.909> lens<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> light

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
degree lens you see that the light

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.969 
degree lens you see that the light
doesn't<00:01:32.909> appear<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.329> intense<00:01:33.780> enough<00:01:34.079> but

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
doesn't appear to be intense enough but

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
doesn't appear to be intense enough but
the<00:01:35.130> light<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.549> being<00:01:35.759> spread<00:01:36.119> over<00:01:36.240> such<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the light is being spread over such a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
the light is being spread over such a
huge<00:01:36.990> area<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.430> appears<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.820> we've

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
huge area that it appears that we've

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.480 
huge area that it appears that we've
lost<00:01:39.240> intensity

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.719 

so<00:01:44.299> for<00:01:44.570> if<00:01:44.810> we're<00:01:44.960> looking<00:01:45.080> at<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.729> specific

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
so for if we're looking at a specific

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.490 
so for if we're looking at a specific
piece<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:47.210> work<00:01:47.600> like<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:47.930> painting

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.740 

essentially<00:01:51.500> that's<00:01:51.650> that's<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.610> kind<00:01:53.600> of

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
essentially that's that's a kind of

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.149 
essentially that's that's a kind of
spotlighting<00:01:54.409> because<00:01:54.680> we're<00:01:54.830> trying<00:01:55.010> to

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
spotlighting because we're trying to

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.340 
spotlighting because we're trying to
illuminate<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.700> specific<00:01:56.240> object<00:01:56.420> if<00:01:57.170> we're

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
illuminate a specific object if we're

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.320 
illuminate a specific object if we're
trying<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.619> illuminate<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.549> entire<00:01:58.880> room

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
trying to illuminate the entire room

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.660 
trying to illuminate the entire room
usually<00:02:00.140> what<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.590> want<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:01.040> a<00:02:01.070> sixty<00:02:01.550> degree

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
usually what you want is a sixty degree

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.270 
usually what you want is a sixty degree
lens<00:02:02.119> because<00:02:02.810> if<00:02:03.110> you<00:02:03.409> have<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.619> narrow<00:02:03.950> beam

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
lens because if you have a narrow beam

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.639 
lens because if you have a narrow beam
lens<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.020> lights<00:02:06.200> coming<00:02:06.440> from<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
lens and the lights coming from the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.469 
lens and the lights coming from the
ceiling<00:02:06.920> you're<00:02:07.580> going<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.880> get<00:02:08.000> little<00:02:08.119> pools

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
ceiling you're going to get little pools

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.300 
ceiling you're going to get little pools
of<00:02:08.720> light<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.289> entire<00:02:09.590> room<00:02:09.860> will<00:02:10.009> not<00:02:10.190> be

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
of light and the entire room will not be

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.880 
of light and the entire room will not be
fully<00:02:10.550> equally<00:02:11.300> illuminated<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.530> those<00:02:12.739> are

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
fully equally illuminated so those are

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.160 
fully equally illuminated so those are
kind<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.160> rules<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.550> thumb<00:02:13.989> if<00:02:14.989> you're

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
kind of the rules of thumb if you're

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.550 
kind of the rules of thumb if you're
trying<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.160> get<00:02:17.030> intense<00:02:17.420> focus<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.140> smaller

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
trying to get intense focus on smaller

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.860 
trying to get intense focus on smaller
objects<00:02:19.220> then<00:02:19.970> you're<00:02:20.360> going<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.540> go<00:02:20.660> for

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
objects then you're going to go for

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.240 
objects then you're going to go for
narrower<00:02:21.140> beams<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:21.860> want<00:02:22.040> general

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
narrower beams if you want general

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.699 
narrower beams if you want general
illumination<00:02:22.900> probably<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.019> want<00:02:24.260> sixty

illumination probably you want sixty

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.770 
illumination probably you want sixty
