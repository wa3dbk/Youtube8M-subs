00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.740
 Hello, how are you next week? 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.019
 end the world begins and obviously 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.209
 we have prepared roasts together with the 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.889
 friends to see all the matches and if 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.289
 It's raining too, we're going to want to do something 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.420
 although the space becomes smaller by 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.280
 that today we want to give a solution 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.720
 that optimizes the space we are going to do 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.640
 a table that we can open and close 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.110
 how many times do we want according to the amount 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.570
 of people and also going to have drawers 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.130
 to keep the utensils 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.260
 it's about a structure of the pine fingers 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.879
 which can be divided into three parts a 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.920
 central column composed of its 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.870
 skeleton and six drawers two feet 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.030
 mobile phones that give the closing and opening to 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.540
 the table and finally the cover that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.310
 divided into three parts 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.110
 The good thing about this table is that you can 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.970
 occupy for all not only in the 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.690
 terrace but also without any problem 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.580
 in the interior of the house the finger pine 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.890
 comes in plates in this case we're going to 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.360
 use an 18 millimeter thick and 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.210
 The good thing is that we can order the pieces 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.640
 sized in all stores to 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.350
 the central structure we need four 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.380
 pieces of 72 x 4 centimeters 4 more than 76 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.080
 x 8 centimeters and 2 of 18 x 4 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.960
 centimeters the drawers are made with a 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.930
 front 18 x 20 centimeters one 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.680
 back 18 x 18 centimeters two 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.050
 laterals of 30 x 18 and a bottom of 35 x 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.750
 13 centimeters to make both feet 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.170
 that move they need two pieces of 72 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.509
 x 4 centimeters and 2 of 52 x 4 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.600
 centimeters and finally the covers 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.210
 we make them with two pieces of 80 x 63 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 centimeters and one more girl of 80 x 26 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.310
 [Music] 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.110
 3 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.180
 we will begin sanding the pieces already 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.000
 mentioned to get the chips and 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.800
 lower the songs and now these four 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.840
 sticks that are going to be part of the foot 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.400
 We are going to round off one of your mobile 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.140
 ends so they do not take with the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.219
 structure many years 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.219
 [Music] 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.130
 all right 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.940
 [Music] 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.940
 and for you 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.980
 how are we 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.690
 The first thing we are going to do in the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.690
 central column where the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.940
 drawers everything will go together with dowels 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.130
 We are not going to a bar klaus or screws 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.990
 the key of this work is to make the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.060
 perforations to the exact measurements 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.250
 we start by making the holes in the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.080
 two edges of the horizontal ones we measure 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.650
 the length already one centimeter of each 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.650
 extreme 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.350
 we make a mark after we measure what 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.510
 wide and we mark but to 9 millimeters that 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.370
 is the center since the club measures 18 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.040
 millimeters with 8 mm drill 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.660
 we drill these horizontal pieces and 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.370
 we put a mark to know how far 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.810
 we have to drill 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.580
 [Music] 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 of these perforations are going to guide us 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.020
 to make the holes in the pieces 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.480
 vertical but we also have to have 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.620
 very clear the distance between the pieces 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.140
 horizontal 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.330
 and the horizontal of the fronts goes to 8 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.870
 centimeters from below and by the 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.879
 sides 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.730
 the first horizontal goes at a distance 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.349
 12 centimeters from the ground is marked 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.170
 width of the table that is 4 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.299
 centimeters one after the second one goes 16 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.700
 centimeters is drawn again the 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.610
 wide then the horizontal third is going to 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.760
 16 centimeters higher and the last one 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.190
 11 centimeters always leaving the width 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.080
 corresponding to each horizontal 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.090
 using the perforations we made 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.190
 we were previously guided to mark 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.620
 where will the new holes that 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.900
 they also go to 9 millimeters and once 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.220
 we have all the perforations 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.080
 we started the union of verticals and 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.140
 horizontal with cold tail and slope 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.660
 [Music] 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:16.700
 [Applause] 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:19.670
 [Music] 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.440
 here are the drawers these are not going to 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.210
 take screws the unions we're going to 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.730
 do with the male system females that 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.230
 we do it with a strawberry and a tupi 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.810
 taking advantage of the catalog for 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.090
 professionals we can know a lot 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.590
 better the tool I had to thank 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.720
 your strawberries we can make different 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.249
 moldings and openings of different sizes 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.199
 and shapes 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.119
 to know the distance and measures that 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.949
 will have the lace the best is to use a 

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:45.619
 template that is available in our 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.799
 website www points do it yourself 

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:51.019
 point cl and she gives us the diagonals and 

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:53.089
 fair separation of 4 and 2 centimeters 

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:54.830
 so that the fitting system can 

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:56.900
 function 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.910
 if it is used on the one hand it serves for the 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.490
 openwork male and on the other for 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.290
 female lace then with the grave and the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.780
 strawberry we make the drafts in the piece 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.730
 from the front of the drawer and the sides 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.470
 We cut with the jigsaw if it is 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.980
 necessary the rebate is adjusted in 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.280
 diagonal with formaldehyde 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.220
 [Music] 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:26.480
 [Applause] 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:29.360
 [Music] 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.310
 ok the drawers of the table we finished them 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.050
 joining their pieces with cold cola is 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.020
 well then have them all together to 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.820
 make the draft of the shooter online a 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.980
 Once the position is marked, the cut is made 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.840
 with jigsaw to sign the 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.210
 drawers inside the table and that 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.490
 can slide we fix with tips and 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.950
 cool tail with them in the first three 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.500
 horizontal 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.500
 [Music] 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.370
 this is the strongest way to do the 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.840
 drawers and generally do 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.510
 furniture makers you know in this way 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.730
 the can vary now the fundamental thing is 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.410
 the folding foot that makes it possible 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.360
 open or close the table this is the 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.000
 structure that we have to form and that 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.350
 at the end it will open like this the two 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.860
 horizontal with their rounded edges 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.230
 they go 16 centimeters from below and 6.5 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.570
 from the upper end and the vertical 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.210
 shorter is set at 10 centimeters towards 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.160
 inside these pieces are fixed with the 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.040
 same perforation procedure with 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.089
 the cold and slope 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.089
 [Music] 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.440
 but the vertical short goes with tips and 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.890
 outside so it does not touch the 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.890
 structure 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.729
 to join the two feet to the column 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.069
 central that we did at the beginning we're going to 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.710
 occupy these screws that are going to 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:52.990
 allow to use it as a pin and so the 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.510
 feet are foldable 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.850
 this pin is fixed in the encounter of 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.660
 the two pieces and aeg of the piece that has 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.660
 its rounded tips 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.930
 to the sides and up here are the three 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.910
 covers that are going to need this table 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.920
 the one above is fixed with some tangos 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.880
 and that of the sides that are the ones 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:23.850
 move fixed van with hinges 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:26.850
 [Music] 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.850
 discarding 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.230
 I 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.400
 the end of the table can 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.199
 do with a wood sealer 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.419
 protector or varnish but the most 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:41.380
 important is that it be opaque and natural 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:44.090
 so that the vein of the fine film of 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.560
 the table looks great on the terrace 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.510
 side of the grill but also if 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.460
 it rains we can center it and accommodate 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.990
 side of the television and when the 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.020
 World serves as a daily dining room 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.850
 up or desk as you see we use the 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.680
 football as a pretext and we are left with 

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.449
 an excellent piece of furniture for the house 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.860
 we see next week in another do it 

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:02.860
 You yourself leave a center sun
