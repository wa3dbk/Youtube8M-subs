00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
Chris Brown which you know don't exactly

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.410 
Chris Brown which you know don't exactly
have<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.070> best<00:01:38.100> record<00:01:38.610> when<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:38.939> comes<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
have the best record when it comes to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.149 
have the best record when it comes to
that<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.960> important<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> company<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> keep

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that it's important the company you keep

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.880 
that it's important the company you keep
many<00:01:41.729> say<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> reflection<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
many say that it is a reflection of you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.819 
many say that it is a reflection of you
so<00:01:44.340> hopefully<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.229> case<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.710> do

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
so hopefully that's not the case I do
