to test it you know so we want to use
recreational<00:00:35.460> users<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> way<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.510> to

recreational users all the way up to
pros<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:38.040> think<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> lot<00:00:38.520> more

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
pros and I think that's a lot more

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
pros and I think that's a lot more
effective<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.180> designing<00:00:39.480> stuff<00:00:39.690> rather

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
effective and designing stuff rather

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.160 
effective and designing stuff rather
than<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> said<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:40.890> getting<00:00:41.340> kind<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.030> a

than like I said just getting kind of a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.810 
than like I said just getting kind of a
skewed<00:00:43.170> feedback<00:00:43.530> from<00:00:43.770> pros<00:00:44.040> shoulder

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
skewed feedback from pros shoulder

integrated to the aluminum frame in the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.959 
integrated to the aluminum frame in the
back<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:50.039> frame<00:00:50.280> goes<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:50.700> our<00:00:50.820> hip

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
pad so he bends side to side the pack

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
pad so he bends side to side the pack
actually<00:00:56.250> moves<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.670> him<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.480> blue

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
actually moves with him and this blue

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
actually moves with him and this blue
strap<00:00:57.989> adjusts<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.500> can't<00:00:58.800> dangle<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
strap adjusts the can't dangle so you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.270 
strap adjusts the can't dangle so you
