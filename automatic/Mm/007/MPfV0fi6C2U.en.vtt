00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.530 
there is another version of this knife I
believe<00:00:44.230> it's<00:00:44.380> called<00:00:44.530> point<00:00:44.980> guard<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:45.730> the

believe it's called point guard and the
only<00:00:46.719> difference<00:00:47.110> is<00:00:47.469> the<00:00:48.219> handle<00:00:48.840> scales<00:00:49.840> are

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
only difference is the handle scales are

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.310 
only difference is the handle scales are
made<00:00:50.829> of<00:00:51.040> g10<00:00:51.570> instead<00:00:52.570> of<00:00:52.719> this<00:00:53.020> synthetic

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
and one of them I'll show you right now

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.270 
and one of them I'll show you right now
is<00:01:57.190> that<00:01:57.849> it<00:01:58.030> pushes<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.630> knife<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.679> one<00:01:59.890> side

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
is that it pushes the knife to one side

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.930 
is that it pushes the knife to one side
and<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:02.110> gets<00:02:02.349> caught<00:02:02.679> up<00:02:02.950> on<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:04.690> edge<00:02:05.940> right

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
and it gets caught up on the edge right

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.710 
and it gets caught up on the edge right
there<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:09.910> when<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.119> go<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.270> put<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.569> in

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
there and so when you go to put it in

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.259 
there and so when you go to put it in
you<00:02:11.349> actually<00:02:11.590> have<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.130> just<00:02:12.370> twist<00:02:12.909> it<00:02:13.030> just

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
you actually have to just twist it just

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.569 
you actually have to just twist it just
a<00:02:13.329> little<00:02:13.450> bit<00:02:13.689> and<00:02:13.930> I'll<00:02:14.170> go<00:02:14.290> ahead<00:02:14.579> that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
a little bit and I'll go ahead that

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.800 
a little bit and I'll go ahead that
sounded<00:02:15.969> nasty

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
sounded nasty

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.510 
sounded nasty
usually<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> little<00:02:18.320> practice<00:02:18.800> it's<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.400> lot

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
usually a little practice it's a lot

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.730 
usually a little practice it's a lot
smoother<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.480> still<00:02:20.900> not<00:02:21.170> as<00:02:21.320> smooth<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.710> it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
smoother but still not as smooth as it

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.690 
smoother but still not as smooth as it
could<00:02:21.890> be<00:02:22.220> or<00:02:22.850> should<00:02:22.880> be<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:25.220> can<00:02:25.400> see<00:02:25.550> right

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
could be or should be you can see right

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.130 
could be or should be you can see right
there<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:28.100> goes<00:02:28.310> into<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.700> point<00:02:29.000> at<00:02:29.600> which<00:02:29.930> I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
there it goes into that point at which I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.390 
there it goes into that point at which I
have<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.440> turn<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.770> knife<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.040> little<00:02:31.070> bit
