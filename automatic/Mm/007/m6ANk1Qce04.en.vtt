bit and scraped it a little bit but not
too<00:00:19.650> much<00:00:20.029> I<00:00:21.029> was<00:00:21.750> debating<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:23.119> whether<00:00:24.119> to

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
too much I was debating on whether to

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.269 
too much I was debating on whether to
pull<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> head<00:00:25.199> or<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.830> pull<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> head

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
pull the head or not to pull the head

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.609 
pull the head or not to pull the head
it's<00:00:29.279> not<00:00:29.340> too<00:00:29.640> much<00:00:29.760> more<00:00:30.000> work<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.660> decide<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it's not too much more work so decide to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.430 
it's not too much more work so decide to
go<00:00:31.740> ahead<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:34.110> think<00:00:34.350> I'm

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
go ahead and go with it and I think I'm

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.170 
go ahead and go with it and I think I'm
glad<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.710> did<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.309> looks<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:37.820> it<00:00:38.820> doesn't<00:00:39.000> look

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
glad I did it looks like it doesn't look

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.930 
glad I did it looks like it doesn't look
like<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.510> any<00:00:39.600> leaks<00:00:40.020> per<00:00:40.379> se<00:00:40.940> going

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
outside of the cylinder or outside of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.139 
outside of the cylinder or outside of
the<00:00:45.390> block<00:00:46.129> but<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.550> wet<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.910> here

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
