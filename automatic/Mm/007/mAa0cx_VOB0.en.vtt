so<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.979> would<00:01:32.130> cover<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.299> how

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
so that it would cover it so this is how

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.410 
so that it would cover it so this is how
this<00:01:33.810> works<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.320> sand<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> flat<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:39.119> see<00:01:39.329> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this works we sand that flat you see it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.539 
this works we sand that flat you see it
just<00:01:39.600> completely<00:01:40.049> disappears<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.130> it's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
just completely disappears and now it's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
just completely disappears and now it's
like<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.030> never<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.420> hole<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
like there was never a hole there and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.240 
like there was never a hole there and
that's<00:01:43.320> how<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.560> works

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that's how that works

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's how that works
we're<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> rest<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
we're gonna do that with the rest of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.490 
we're gonna do that with the rest of
them<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.110> well<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.689> see<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.259> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
them as well and you can see how that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.950 
them as well and you can see how that
just<00:01:49.770> evens<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.430> okay<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> nice

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
just evens out okay so we get a nice

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.660 
just evens out okay so we get a nice
smooth<00:01:52.290> surface<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.799> use<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.220> hand<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.549> go

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
smooth surface so use your hand and go

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.280 
smooth surface so use your hand and go
back<00:01:53.909> over<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.869> will<00:01:54.990> let<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.259> know

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
back over it and that will let you know

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.429 
back over it and that will let you know
wherever<00:01:55.649> any<00:01:55.920> rough<00:01:56.219> spots<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:57.200> just<00:01:58.200> sand

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
wherever any rough spots are just sand

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.490 
wherever any rough spots are just sand
those<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.950> flat<00:01:59.570> and<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.750> bump<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.229> up

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
those out flat and then bump this up

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.770 
those out flat and then bump this up
side<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> little<00:02:02.219> more<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.240> by<00:02:03.570> doing

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
side a little more as well and by doing

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
side a little more as well and by doing
this<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.079> work<00:02:04.439> every<00:02:04.950> square<00:02:05.250> inch<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
this we work every square inch of the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240 
this we work every square inch of the
gym<00:02:06.149> then<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.079> run<00:02:07.290> our<00:02:07.500> hands<00:02:07.950> over

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
gym then we want to run our hands over

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.710 
gym then we want to run our hands over
it<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.369> make<00:02:08.520> sure<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.239> really

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
