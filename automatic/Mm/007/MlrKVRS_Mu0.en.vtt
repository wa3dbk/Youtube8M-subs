00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.929 
forward and then we have our token
pieces<00:01:31.400> now<00:01:32.400> these<00:01:32.640> now<00:01:33.680> different<00:01:34.680> poses<00:01:35.490> for

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
pieces now these now different poses for

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.190 
pieces now these now different poses for
the<00:01:36.030> same<00:01:36.240> characters<00:01:38.780> let<00:01:39.780> me<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.140> again

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the same characters let me do that again

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.690 
the same characters let me do that again
the<00:01:40.619> angle<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> light<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.090> good

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.080 

so<00:01:47.270> these<00:01:47.420> fit<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.990> 16<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.580> game<00:01:49.790> calls

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
so these fit in the 16 the game calls

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.359 
so these fit in the 16 the game calls
for<00:01:50.299> 16<00:01:50.900> of<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.140> little<00:01:51.380> stands<00:01:54.040> got<00:01:55.040> it

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
for 16 of the little stands got it

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.389 
for 16 of the little stands got it
but<00:01:56.149> that's<00:01:56.330> green<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:57.860> each<00:01:58.009> one<00:01:58.189> has<00:01:58.250> a

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
but that's green so each one has a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.370 
but that's green so each one has a
different<00:01:58.460> color<00:01:58.909> tab<00:01:59.240> on<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> bottom<00:01:59.720> see<00:02:00.140> so

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
different color tab on the bottom see so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.859 
different color tab on the bottom see so
that's<00:02:00.500> yellow<00:02:01.210> that's<00:02:02.210> how<00:02:02.360> you'd<00:02:02.479> set<00:02:02.659> that

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
that's yellow that's how you'd set that

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.859 
that's yellow that's how you'd set that
up<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.509> let's<00:02:05.720> see<00:02:06.850> object<00:02:07.850> be<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.600> first

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
up so let's see object be the first

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.050
