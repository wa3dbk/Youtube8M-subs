00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.259
 environmental management taking the photograph until the end of the 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.069
 process 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.320
 When we work with photoshop we have to remember that we have four 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.650
 models for obtaining color 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.560
 hsbc 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.119
 Saturation and brightness tone 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.170
 rgb 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.380
 red green and blue 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.830
 lava color I made my magenta box yellow and black 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.300
 we also have to remember that we have differentiated color modes 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.380
 within those modes we have 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.440
 grayscale rgb scenic and color la 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.760
 let's look at this process of work now and within it the models and modes of 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.700
 color this also the color spaces 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.420
 and the color profiles 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.800
 we usually when we take a photograph the camera itself 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.230
 photographic is embedded world a color profile to our document that 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.860
 color profile will describe the color space of the device's 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.790
 entry in this case our camera 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.630
 when we started to process inside our computer that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.320
 document 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.070
 the color management system will identify 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.830
 the actual colors of the document and what it will do 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.690
 color profile that we have assigned to the monitor 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.810
 convert the numerical values ​​of the document into the color space that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.189
 we had defined 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.369
 and finally also when we go there to print or take out for a 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.670
 output device our document the color management system is going to 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.490
 convert the numerical values ​​of the document into the color values ​​of the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.229
 output device so that it is printed with a correct appearance we 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.430
 at all times with photoshop inside 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 edition 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.270
 color adjustments we will be able to define both these color spaces and the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.679
 color management standards 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.049
 come the default settings in which we are going to be able to 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.420
 select 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.320
 what will be the work system that we are going to have 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.100
 normally the end of most of our images are going to be either 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.130
 Printed in gold or printed 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.560
 ortiz photographic chemical printing systems 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.640
 with which at the moment we are going to select pre-printing in the case of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.790
 Ecuador special output device 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.739
 those same devices would have some color profiles that we would have 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.349
 to load into our program through the menus download 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.170
 d those color profiles 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.000
 and in this way work coherently with them on the other hand at the time of 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.479
 define the workspace we are working in the regev space 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.840
 that is, what space 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.090
 when we have our image in rg b 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.930
 we want that color transformation normally done by digital cameras 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.799
 they are recording all ncr gb 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.989
 what's interesting if we do not have any assigned and we want to assign one would be 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.870
 work in adobe rgb since it is a wider range and with more nuances than the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.170
 srgb range 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.599
 with which the color profile adobe rgb 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.310
 it would be a good option 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.609
 when it comes to working 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.280
 On the other hand we would also have to see 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.480
 what we were discussing before what our system of 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.819
 output our printing system 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.159
 In the case that we had a specific one, we had to take that 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.939
 color profile and work with it to thus have no problems to the 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.379
 time of conversion 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.700
 normally for the printing system we use is 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.980
 and then on the other hand we have the color management rules that is to say that 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.780
 we want him to do or how we want our program to behave when 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.819
 have images in rgb today zenic images that do not match in your 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.429
 color space with the colored spaces that we have defined 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:36.479
 On the one hand we are going to be able to say what deactivates the space of color ie 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.699
 Delete the color profile d 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.929
 that document that we have opened which would not be interesting because it would happen 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:47.719
 have been assigned a description of the color minutes, I simply took a value 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.389
 numeric to define that color 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.859
 so when we convert that image to another profile that numerical value 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.579
 would be converted into another numerical value and there could be variations 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.579
 important with which we could conserve the embedded profiles or 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.310
 convert to rcn 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.680
 this is going to depend on the process that we are going to do in a moment 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.650
 given if we are going to touch the image 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.620
 maybe it was interesting to convert to work regenerate mode that we had 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.329
 because in this way it will behave with the same configuration that it has 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.270
 our monitor and in the retouching we would be seeing the actual result if 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.949
 we keep the embedded profile there may be different variations 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.600
 also we will paper issue configure how it behaves ie 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.430
 when there are differences in profiles and we want you to ask obs and we want 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.940
 ignore the question and here the process without more equal than when missing profiles 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.819
 You also have to ask to give us the option to decide 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.900
 at that precise moment that we are going to do in that situation 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.310
 if we activate the option plus options we will also be able to define the mode 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.139
 Of conversation 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.930
 that is, what procedure do we want the program to use to convert the 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.879
 colors 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.839
 toothed we could use adobe engines or microsoft fumes to leave the 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:02.529
 adobe 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:06.349
 and on the other hand we could use the conversion systems 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:07.949
 perceptual saturation 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.449
 relative colorimetric and colorimetric 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.370
 each of them is defined for a system or for a type of work 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.070
 the perceptual what it is going to do is that when there are colors out of range baa 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.790
 compress them to fit within the range 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.840
 all colors change to allow the existing relationship to be maintained 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.979
 among them 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.660
 although this may cause a loss of saturation which would not be 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.659
 interesting in our work process 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.089
 On the other hand, there is the saturation method where the 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.610
 saturation over all other parameters this method would be 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.809
 important for example for company presentations where we want 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:50.289
 that the color that is striking and remains constantly with which no 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.289
 would be worth it in our systems of photo retouching 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.089
 on the other hand is the absolute colorimetric this one keeps a relation 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:03.469
 direct with the relative that we have not yet explained but really not 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.870
 would be advisable for the usual workflow of a photographer 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.830
 since it is more oriented arsys printing issues of color proofs 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.469
 and finally there is color and mexico 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.989
 relative this method keeps the colors that are within the range is 

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:22.330
 say that they exist in the destination profile and change the ones that are 

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:26.319
 outside the range to the most approximate tones that the 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.330
 exit profile that we have 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.220
 trying to always get 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.840
 as pure white as possible in the destination profile 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.510
 with which in the case of photo retouching this would be the profile that 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.060
 it should be activated constantly since it has the target 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.240
 as a reference when making the calculations 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.460
 with which would be the conversion engine that we would leave by default 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.740
 On the other hand we have to remember that we will always be able to 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.220
 assign a profile to the images that we are okón dress the profile that already 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.849
 own our image 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.839
 of the adjustments that we make of color in many occasions will depend on the 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:05.770
 final result that we obtain from our work process from the 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.319
 photograph until the final impression or output by the device that 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.479
 want 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:13.300
