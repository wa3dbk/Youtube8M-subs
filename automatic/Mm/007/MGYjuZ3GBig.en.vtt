and<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.549> thought<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.110> think<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.530> okay

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and I thought I think it would be okay

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.060 
and I thought I think it would be okay
if<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.460> cut<00:01:30.150> my<00:01:30.180> bangs<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.829> cut<00:01:32.040> my

own<00:01:32.189> bangs<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.470> more<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> thought<00:01:34.890> about<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
own bangs and the more I thought about I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.980 
own bangs and the more I thought about I
thought<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> great

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
thought you know that's actually a great

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.590 
thought you know that's actually a great
idea<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.579> pretty<00:01:38.790> easy<00:01:38.909> like

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
idea because it's pretty easy like

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.450 
idea because it's pretty easy like
they're<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.770> front<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> your<00:01:41.189> face

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
they're just right in front of your face

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.740 
they're just right in front of your face
it's<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.970> they're<00:01:42.119> back<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.570> where

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
it's not like they're back here where

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.670 
it's not like they're back here where
you<00:01:42.840> can't<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.560> thought

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you can't really see and I just thought

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.859 
you can't really see and I just thought
that<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.220> an<00:01:47.310> awesome<00:01:47.430> idea<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> went

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that that was an awesome idea so I went

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.770 
that that was an awesome idea so I went
with<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.140> idea<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.850> got<00:01:51.329> everything

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
with that idea it was I got everything

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.200 
with that idea it was I got everything

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
like it was about here where I wanted to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.080 
like it was about here where I wanted to
cut<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> let's<00:02:06.990> say<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.459> need<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.910> little

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
cut and let's say that I need a little

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.410

mistake<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.590> went

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
mistake and I just went

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.140 
mistake and I just went
a<00:02:11.450> little<00:02:11.750> bit<00:02:11.870> too<00:02:12.080> far<00:02:12.319> on<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.770> side<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:14.120> it

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
a little bit too far on this side so it

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.610 
a little bit too far on this side so it
was<00:02:14.330> kind<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.660> uneven<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.380> going<00:02:15.560> down

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
was kind of uneven it was going down

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.290

like<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.250> thought<00:02:16.370> okay<00:02:16.730> no<00:02:16.910> big<00:02:17.090> deal

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.229 
like this and I thought okay no big deal
I'll<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:18.110> make<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.470> even<00:02:19.370> again<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.209> I

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239

point<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.269> all<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.989> had<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.190> many

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
point of all this I had so many

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.930 
point of all this I had so many
headbands<00:03:56.079> that<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.370> was<00:03:58.519> wearing<00:03:58.850> them

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
headbands that and I was wearing them

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.080 
headbands that and I was wearing them
often<00:03:59.480> so<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.260> just<00:04:00.590> thought<00:04:00.769> why<00:04:01.370> don't<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.730> wear

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
often so I just thought why don't I wear

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.250 
often so I just thought why don't I wear
my<00:04:02.840> headbands<00:04:03.489> until<00:04:04.489> my<00:04:05.239> bangs<00:04:05.510> get<00:04:05.870> long

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
my headbands until my bangs get long

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.199 
my headbands until my bangs get long
enough<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:06.829> that<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.040> can<00:04:07.310> like<00:04:07.549> actually<00:04:07.790> wear

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
enough so that I can like actually wear

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.789 
enough so that I can like actually wear
them<00:04:08.389> in<00:04:08.540> public<00:04:09.049> and<00:04:09.230> they<00:04:09.500> don't<00:04:09.650> look

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
them in public and they don't look

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.569 
them in public and they don't look
ridiculous<00:04:10.609> and<00:04:11.829> if<00:04:12.829> I<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:13.069> thought<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.489> was

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
ridiculous and if I just thought it was

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.170 
ridiculous and if I just thought it was
a<00:04:13.639> great<00:04:13.819> idea<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.870> that's<00:04:15.109> what<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.260> did<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.739> wore

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180

about<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.780> no<00:04:37.780> need<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.050> worry<00:04:38.230> your<00:04:38.530> hair<00:04:38.740> will

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980

grow back
eventually<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:42.990> what<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.020> recommend<00:04:44.710> is<00:04:44.860> just

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
eventually and what I recommend is just

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.640 
eventually and what I recommend is just
wear<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.730> headband<00:04:46.240> until<00:04:46.720> it<00:04:47.110> gets<00:04:47.350> long

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
wear a headband until it gets long

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.670 
wear a headband until it gets long
enough<00:04:47.980> that<00:04:48.820> you<00:04:49.210> actually<00:04:49.540> like<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:49.990> or<00:04:50.380> or

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
enough that you actually like it or or

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.980 
enough that you actually like it or or
can<00:04:50.710> go<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.100> your<00:04:51.430> hairdresser<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.450> fix<00:04:52.750> it

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.680 
can go to your hairdresser and fix it
and<00:04:53.200> you<00:04:54.010> don't<00:04:54.460> have<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.700> go<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:54.880> Lululemon

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
and you don't have to go to Lululemon

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.890 
and you don't have to go to Lululemon
per<00:04:56.140> se<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.440> get<00:04:56.910> headbands<00:04:57.910> e<00:04:58.150> these<00:04:58.510> are<00:04:58.570> just

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
wouldn't stay so for that situation you

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.850 
wouldn't stay so for that situation you
have<00:05:51.790> to<00:05:51.820> use<00:05:52.060> headbands<00:05:52.570> but<00:05:52.900> if<00:05:53.169> you<00:05:53.620> still
