00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
there you go yeah and this is the clone

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.759 
there you go yeah and this is the clone

that's<00:04:34.330> but<00:04:34.570> different<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.930> normal<00:04:35.200> range

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
that's but different to the normal range

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.750 
that's but different to the normal range
attilio<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:36.040> mad<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.310> can<00:04:36.430> remove<00:04:36.550> its

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
attilio just mad you can remove its

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.850 
attilio just mad you can remove its
shadow<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.990> if<00:04:38.140> you<00:04:38.230> let<00:04:38.320> me<00:04:38.380> lock<00:04:38.530> shadows

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
shadow so if you let me lock shadows

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.070 
shadow so if you let me lock shadows
just<00:04:38.890> get<00:04:39.190> rid<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.720> there<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:40.780> go<00:04:40.870> because

just get rid of it there you go because
you<00:04:41.140> can<00:04:41.170> do<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:41.620> a<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:41.830> good<00:04:41.980> tool

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
you can do that it's a really good tool

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.220 
you can do that it's a really good tool
this<00:04:42.310> is<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.460> gradient<00:04:42.700> tool<00:04:43.180> guy<00:04:43.840> sounds<00:04:44.050> great

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
this is a gradient tool guy sounds great

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.580 
this is a gradient tool guy sounds great
so<00:04:44.380> you<00:04:44.470> can<00:04:44.560> put<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:44.860> thing<00:04:45.100> over<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
so you can put this thing over the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.830 
so you can put this thing over the
over<00:04:47.590> there<00:04:47.980> I<00:04:48.220> guess<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:49.030> how<00:04:49.390> do<00:04:49.450> you<00:04:49.540> do<00:04:49.720> it

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
over there I guess it how do you do it

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.410 
over there I guess it how do you do it
okay<00:04:50.290> it's<00:04:50.950> your<00:04:51.160> new<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:51.400> liar<00:04:51.580> what<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.300> do

okay it's your new you liar what you do
is<00:04:52.540> you<00:04:52.630> click<00:04:52.720> layer<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:54.160> knew<00:04:54.580> in<00:04:54.910> layer<00:04:55.210> and

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
is you click layer you knew in layer and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.240 
is you click layer you knew in layer and
then<00:04:56.020> you<00:04:56.140> just<00:04:56.290> call<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:56.770> what<00:04:56.890> you<00:04:56.950> want<00:04:57.130> less

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.480 
then you just call it what you want less
they<00:04:57.430> call<00:04:57.700> it<00:04:57.850> let's<00:04:58.300> call<00:04:58.480> it<00:04:59.430> one<00:05:00.430> layer

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
they call it let's call it one layer

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.010 
they call it let's call it one layer
okay<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:03.760> it's<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.180> we're<00:05:04.330> on<00:05:04.420> one<00:05:04.600> line<00:05:04.780> now

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
okay and it's so we're on one line now

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.750 
okay and it's so we're on one line now
you<00:05:05.500> take<00:05:05.620> off<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.830> boat<00:05:05.980> named<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:06.580> let's

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
you take off the boat named it so let's

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.850 
you take off the boat named it so let's
do<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.910> gradient<00:05:07.330> thing<00:05:07.480> on<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:08.020> new<00:05:08.410> layer

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
do a gradient thing on the new layer

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.880 
do a gradient thing on the new layer
it's<00:05:09.550> okay<00:05:09.910> we<00:05:10.180> go<00:05:10.300> there<00:05:10.660> let<00:05:11.410> me<00:05:11.500> move<00:05:11.680> this

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
it's okay we go there let me move this

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.810 
it's okay we go there let me move this
leg<00:05:12.130> above<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:13.020> um<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:14.410> then<00:05:15.160> say<00:05:15.490> yes<00:05:15.610> gonna

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
leg above that um and then say yes gonna

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.660 
leg above that um and then say yes gonna
beautiful<00:05:16.560> little<00:05:17.560> thing<00:05:17.650> there<00:05:17.950> that's

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
beautiful little thing there that's

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.610 
beautiful little thing there that's
pretty<00:05:18.910> nice<00:05:19.150> isn't<00:05:19.420> it<00:05:19.600> so<00:05:20.230> then<00:05:20.350> you<00:05:20.440> get<00:05:20.560> the

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
pretty nice isn't it so then you get the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.010 
pretty nice isn't it so then you get the
blue<00:05:20.800> tilt<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.330> just<00:05:22.480> sort<00:05:22.630> of<00:05:22.690> bloat

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
blue tilt and you just sort of bloat

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.990 
blue tilt and you just sort of bloat
around<00:05:23.530> blow<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.490> around<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:25.060> little<00:05:25.180> bit<00:05:25.450> and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
around blow it around a little bit and

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.159 
around blow it around a little bit and
that's<00:05:28.000> getting<00:05:28.210> close<00:05:28.540> to<00:05:28.570> getting<00:05:28.900> finished

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
that's getting close to getting finished

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.770 
that's getting close to getting finished
up<00:05:29.320> no<00:05:31.050> mmm<00:05:32.760> it's<00:05:33.760> got<00:05:33.880> wait<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> bit<00:05:34.300> because<00:05:34.510> if

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
up no mmm it's got wait a bit because if

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.659 
up no mmm it's got wait a bit because if
you<00:05:34.990> have<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.140> real<00:05:35.320> fast<00:05:35.590> computer<00:05:36.190> as<00:05:36.550> I

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
you have a real fast computer as I

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.900 
you have a real fast computer as I
 do<00:05:37.600> with<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:37.840> piece<00:05:38.110> of
