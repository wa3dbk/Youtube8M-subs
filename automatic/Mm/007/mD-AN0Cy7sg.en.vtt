00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.280

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.750
 very well spent also we managed to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.030

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.250
 the organization was fine this is the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.660
 first line of this type of stroke I 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.030
