00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
never even hunted in this area but we

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.320 
never even hunted in this area but we
had<00:00:15.950> a<00:00:15.980> trail<00:00:16.250> cam<00:00:16.430> set<00:00:16.730> up<00:00:16.849> on<00:00:17.000> that<00:00:17.150> tree

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
had a trail cam set up on that tree

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.120 
had a trail cam set up on that tree
right<00:00:17.510> there<00:00:17.540> and<00:00:18.470> we<00:00:18.619> got<00:00:18.740> lots<00:00:18.860> of<00:00:19.010> good

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
videos of deer so we figured it'd be a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
most of this area cleared out but there

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.060 
most of this area cleared out but there
are<00:01:42.280> still<00:01:42.580> quite<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.390> few<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.720> these<00:01:44.070> little

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
are still quite a few of these little

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.840 
are still quite a few of these little
sapling<00:01:45.670> things<00:01:46.030> like<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:46.600> right<00:01:46.840> here<00:01:47.080> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
sapling things like this right here and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.330 
sapling things like this right here and
these<00:01:48.850> don't<00:01:49.150> just<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.900> know<00:01:50.130> come<00:01:51.130> out<00:01:51.160> you

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
these don't just you know come out you

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.640 
these don't just you know come out you
can't<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.610> write<00:01:51.700> them<00:01:51.880> up<00:01:52.000> so<00:01:52.180> I'm<00:01:52.330> gonna

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
can't just write them up so I'm gonna

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.620 
can't just write them up so I'm gonna
what<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:53.680> can<00:01:53.890> do<00:01:54.010> is<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:55.270> pull<00:01:55.540> them

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
what you can do is just pull them

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.880 
what you can do is just pull them
straight<00:01:55.750> out<00:01:55.870> of<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> ground<00:01:56.230> that<00:01:56.560> way<00:01:56.830> you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
straight out of the ground that way you

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.950 
straight out of the ground that way you
get<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.370> root<00:01:58.030> system<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.450> everything<00:01:58.630> and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
get the root system and everything and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.460 
get the root system and everything and
there's<00:01:59.080> quite<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.950> few<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.310> them<00:02:00.400> but<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:02.320> you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
there's quite a few of them but as you

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.810 
there's quite a few of them but as you
can<00:02:02.530> see<00:02:02.710> they're<00:02:02.860> fairly<00:02:03.130> easy<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:03.460> pull<00:02:03.670> out

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
can see they're fairly easy to pull out

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.200 
can see they're fairly easy to pull out
of<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.970> ground<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:05.700> see<00:02:06.700> there<00:02:06.850> for<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.120> right

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
of the ground so see there for you right

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.169 
of the ground so see there for you right
there<00:02:07.440> so<00:02:08.440> that's<00:02:08.619> just<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:09.010> neat<00:02:09.729> little<00:02:09.820> trick

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
there so that's just a neat little trick

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.590 
there so that's just a neat little trick
just<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.200> make<00:02:11.590> sure<00:02:11.740> they<00:02:11.830> don't<00:02:11.950> grow<00:02:12.190> again

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
just to make sure they don't grow again

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.030 
just to make sure they don't grow again
instead<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.690> chopping<00:02:13.870> them<00:02:14.110> down<00:02:14.140> cuz<00:02:14.860> then

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
instead of chopping them down cuz then

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.800 
instead of chopping them down cuz then
these<00:02:15.160> things<00:02:15.400> even<00:02:16.300> if<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:16.480> chop<00:02:16.660> them<00:02:16.780> down

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
these things even if you chop them down

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.210 
these things even if you chop them down
they'll<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.200> grow<00:02:17.380> right<00:02:17.410> back<00:02:17.770> out<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.070> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
they'll just grow right back out of the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.060 
they'll just grow right back out of the
stump<00:02:18.490> so<00:02:19.320> if<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:20.620> I've<00:02:20.709> already<00:02:20.800> pulled

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
stump so if you see I've already pulled

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.790 
stump so if you see I've already pulled
out<00:02:21.160> quite<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> few<00:02:21.459> right<00:02:22.209> here<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.660> I'll<00:02:23.620> get

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
out quite a few right here so I'll get

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:34.970 
out quite a few right here so I'll get
back<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.630> keep<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.750> posted

little footprints I'm going to rear a
Cove<00:07:11.300> earth<00:07:11.420> at<00:07:11.540> so<00:07:12.170> it's<00:07:12.590> better<00:07:12.770> soil<00:07:13.100> to<00:07:13.250> see

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
Cove earth at so it's better soil to see

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.870 
Cove earth at so it's better soil to see
contact<00:07:13.970> so<00:07:14.210> the<00:07:14.330> soils<00:07:14.690> not<00:07:14.720> pressed<00:07:15.110> in<00:07:15.880> also

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880

I'm going to be setting a trail camera
on<00:07:18.290> the<00:07:19.220> tree<00:07:19.550> that's<00:07:19.670> a<00:07:19.730> little<00:07:19.880> closer<00:07:20.060> to

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
on the tree that's a little closer to
