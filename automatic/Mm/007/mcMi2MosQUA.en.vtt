00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.430
 and this time with a trip back 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.170
 the p 8 the successor of ascend p 7 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.990
 the Chinese builder put this year 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.910
 on an aluminum unibody design a 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.740
 64-bit processor and a camera 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.580
 3 megapixel performance 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.289
 promising 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.820
 do you always see synonymous 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.560
 excellent value for money 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.740
 the answer right away with the most 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.630
 elements the huawei p8 benefits from a 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.010
 successful design if it is not more 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.990
 originals with elements that 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.510
 remind the iphone 5 or the sony xperia 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.859
 z2 country 8 shines by its finesse which 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.170
 is accompanied by a good grip 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.610
 and nice and small materials 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.200
 appreciable detail contrary to 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 other recent smartphones this 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.230
 finesse is not done at the expense of 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.820
 the camera that does not exceed 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.440
 the hull 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.250
 the 5.2-inch screen boasts a 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.930
 nice integration 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.430
 we are not quite 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.410
 '' I but the borders are still 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.000
 well mastered the screen is bright and 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.980
 beautiful colors and angles 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.600
 of vision are wide and no 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.870
 outbid in the pixel density 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.940
 huawei opts for a definition of 1080p 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.440
 far enough on this size 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.600
 like all huawei smartphone the p 8 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.789
 executes the overlay emotion watch in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.170
 its version 3 surface interface 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.909
 is approaching the latest versions of ios 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.310
 but huawei is also interested in 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.079
 power user with a multitude of small 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.310
 nice features like the 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.109
 default blocking of notifications 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.639
 for new applications 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.289
 installed or a saving tool 

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.999
 energy efficient enough to disable 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.770
 options or applications that 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.359
 consume too much battery is 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.789
 precisely because we talk about autonomy 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.770
 Huawei P8 pleasantly surprised us 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.329
 Huawei announces a day and a half of the tea 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.950
 standard and according to our tests is 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.939
 actually possible to exceed the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.560
 day of use 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.389
 if we do not ask too much 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.770
 components with heavy use one does not 

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.539
 not exceed ten hours but a 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.450
 energy saving mode can save you 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.679
 putting in extreme cases 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.359
 we expected a little more from the device 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.979
 photo produced images are good 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.840
 overall quality and sensor 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.499
 withstands situations of low 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.849
 brightness 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.859
 however in all conditions 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.840
 deplores a slight lack of finesse in 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.299
 the details and we are a step below 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.889
 for example from a galaxy ace 6 and that's 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.479
 shame because the photo layer and nice 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.130
 to use and offers modes 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.959
 originals as a light painting mode 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.669
 fun or the possibility of 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.830
 synchronize multiple smartphones into 

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:10.060
 wifi to create multi angles videos 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.530
 finally for the photo part 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.470
 luckily it's more than a little 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.300
 do better than a 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.100
 true less performance side this 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.140
 times this the huawei p8 is globally 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.240
 fluid and reagent will not have to hope 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.970
 expect too much at the level of 3d games 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.210
 the kirin 930 processor includes a gpu 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.680
 a bit just the mali t604 that offers some 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.360
 correct results on most 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.130
 games but shows signs of weakness 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.590
 on the levels of detail a little bit more 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.150
 elevated finally if the design is neat in 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.710
 all we regret that small 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.330
 details did not benefit from the same 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.560
 attention our test copy 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.450
 suffered from some defects 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.370
 alignment and especially the back in 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.000
 aluminum seems quite sensitive to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.770
 scratches the web and 8 and a good smartphone 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.330
 but there is still a notch in 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.590
 competitors under the 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.680
 constructor during his presentation 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.970
 like the iphone 6 or the galaxy ace 6 the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.010
 performances are there the design is 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.150
 successful without being original and autonomy 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.860
 is a very good surprise 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.770
 but while its price exceeds that of 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.840
 his predecessor 200 euros to 499 euros 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.040
 in version 16 gigabytes at the moment he 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.360
 may not be the best deal 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.950
 that can be done in particular by 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.950
 report to the asus iphone 2
