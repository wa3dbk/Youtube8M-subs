00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.950 
actually water in this use this as my
cup<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:46.979> coffee<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.430> went<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.509> put<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> back

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
cup for coffee and went to put it back

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.200 
cup for coffee and went to put it back
on<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:52.399> basically<00:01:53.399> stripped<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
on and it basically stripped to the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.319 
on and it basically stripped to the
point<00:01:54.479> where<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.750> won't<00:01:55.280> lock<00:01:56.280> it'll<00:01:57.180> just

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
point where it won't lock it'll just

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.590 
point where it won't lock it'll just
keep<00:01:57.570> turning<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.549> will<00:01:59.759> slightly<00:02:00.119> leak

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
keep turning so it will slightly leak

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.200 
keep turning so it will slightly leak
and<00:02:00.810> dribble<00:02:01.140> now<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:02.219> what<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.579> suspect<00:02:03.060> this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and dribble now so what I suspect this

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.510 
and dribble now so what I suspect this
happened<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.990> over<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.829> many<00:02:05.009> times<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.430> me

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
happened is over the many times of me

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
happened is over the many times of me
freezing<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.990> you're<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
freezing it if you're going to do that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.330 
freezing it if you're going to do that
don't<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> lid<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.979> because<00:02:10.979> what

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
don't do it with the lid on because what

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.760 
don't do it with the lid on because what
it<00:02:11.430> will<00:02:11.580> do<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.790> when<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.239> goes<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.480> deform

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it will do is when it goes to deform

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.220 
it will do is when it goes to deform
it<00:02:14.280> pops<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.120> off<00:02:15.330> basically<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it pops this off basically in the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.320 
it pops this off basically in the
freezer<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.950> suspect<00:02:17.460> even<00:02:17.730> though

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
freezer and I suspect even though

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.900 
freezer and I suspect even though
nothing<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.660> cracked<00:02:18.990> or<00:02:19.170> broken<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.910> suspect

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
nothing is cracked or broken I suspect

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.100 
nothing is cracked or broken I suspect
these<00:02:21.030> things<00:02:21.270> have<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.480> been<00:02:21.660> worn<00:02:22.020> down

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
these things have just been worn down

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.890 
these things have just been worn down
just<00:02:22.710> enough<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.180> won't<00:02:24.360> do<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.720> don't

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
just enough so it won't do that I don't

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.350 
just enough so it won't do that I don't
think<00:02:25.320> it's<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:25.830> me<00:02:25.860> using<00:02:26.610> average<00:02:27.120> use

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
think it's just for me using average use

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.960 
think it's just for me using average use
because<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:28.230> did<00:02:28.800> close<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> freezer<00:02:29.610> with

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
because I did close in the freezer with

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.570 
because I did close in the freezer with
this<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.390> many<00:02:30.870> many<00:02:31.110> times<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.770> that's<00:02:32.370> kind

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
this on many many times so that's kind

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.400 
this on many many times so that's kind
of<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.240> only<00:02:33.420> thing<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.660> did<00:02:33.840> after<00:02:33.960> that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
of it the only thing I did after that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.620 
of it the only thing I did after that
once<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.160> stopped<00:02:35.430> holding<00:02:35.670> water<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.120> continue

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
once it stopped holding water I continue

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.390 
once it stopped holding water I continue
to<00:02:36.690> use<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.170> because<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.740> basically<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
to use it because I basically have a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.360 
to use it because I basically have a
coffee<00:02:38.730> cup<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:40.110> got<00:02:40.290> plenty<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.650> access<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
coffee cup and I got plenty of access to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.000 
coffee cup and I got plenty of access to
bottled<00:02:42.150> water<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:43.440> actually<00:02:43.620> worked<00:02:43.920> out

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
bottled water and it actually worked out

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.700 
bottled water and it actually worked out
better<00:02:44.280> because<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.720> way<00:02:45.900> i<00:02:45.930> could<00:02:46.350> put<00:02:46.560> out

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
better because that way i could put out

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.590 
better because that way i could put out
i<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.220> put<00:02:47.370> whatever<00:02:47.550> amount<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.270> water<00:02:48.480> i

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
i can put whatever amount of water i

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.150 
i can put whatever amount of water i
wanted<00:02:49.050> instead<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.530> what<00:02:49.680> i<00:02:49.710> was<00:02:49.890> carrying

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
wanted instead of what i was carrying

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.370 
wanted instead of what i was carrying
that<00:02:50.370> day<00:02:50.580> i<00:02:50.790> could<00:02:51.510> use<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.900> separately<00:02:52.290> or

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
that day i could use this separately or

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.690 
that day i could use this separately or
whatever<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:52.860> i<00:02:52.920> could<00:02:53.130> just<00:02:53.220> put<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.610> a
