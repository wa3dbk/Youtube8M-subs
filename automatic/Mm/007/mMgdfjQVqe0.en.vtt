00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
have asked me to try to figure out some

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.179 
have asked me to try to figure out some
things<00:00:17.850> about<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:19.039> previously<00:00:20.039> told

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
things about it and I previously told

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.859 
things about it and I previously told
you<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.210> probably<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
you that it was probably just a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.019 
you that it was probably just a
recording<00:00:22.320> setting<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.580> don't<00:00:23.760> know<00:00:23.880> if

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
recording setting and I don't know if

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.220 
recording setting and I don't know if
you<00:00:24.119> were<00:00:24.210> able<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> figure<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:25.080> not

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
you were able to figure that out or not

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.009 
you were able to figure that out or not
but<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:26.400> think<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.880> did<00:00:26.939> figure<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.420> how<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> get

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
but I think I did figure out how to get

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.240 
but I think I did figure out how to get
rid<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:29.179> black<00:00:30.179> bars<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.949> were<00:00:32.009> so

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
rid of the black bars as they were so

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
rid of the black bars as they were so
called<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> top<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.140> bottom<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
called in the top on the bottom of the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.670 
called in the top on the bottom of the
video<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.780> basically<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.559> were

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
video and basically I think we were

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.840 
video and basically I think we were
talking<00:00:37.950> about<00:00:39.110> if<00:00:40.110> you're<00:00:40.379> recording<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
talking about if you're recording in a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.080 
talking about if you're recording in a
like<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> widescreen<00:00:43.230> aspect<00:00:43.680> ratio<00:00:44.090> you're

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
like a widescreen aspect ratio you're

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.959 
like a widescreen aspect ratio you're
gonna<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.980> black<00:00:46.980> lines<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> top<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
gonna have the black lines at the top of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.720 
gonna have the black lines at the top of
the<00:00:48.090> top<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> bottom<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.710> video<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the top and the bottom of the video and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.459 
the top and the bottom of the video and
so<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.969> think<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.239> figured<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.600> where<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.079> go<00:00:52.230> for

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
so I think I figured out where to go for

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
so I think I figured out where to go for
the<00:00:52.530> settings<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.820> I'm<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.400 
the settings on there so I'm going to
show<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.050> also<00:00:55.230> show

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
I'm going to actually just delete this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.990 
I'm going to actually just delete this
out<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.810> way<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> video<00:01:56.000> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
out and that way it's for the video that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.160 
out and that way it's for the video that
I'm<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> show<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> after<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.869> put<00:01:58.079> these

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I'm going to show you after I put these

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.289 
I'm going to show you after I put these
transitions<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.759> guys<00:01:59.880> don't<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
transitions in so you guys don't have to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.240 
transitions in so you guys don't have to
watch<00:02:00.450> me<00:02:00.479> export<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.409> all<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> stuff<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
watch me export it and all that stuff so

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.249 
watch me export it and all that stuff so
we're<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> go<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.600> 10<00:02:03.810> seconds

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
we're just going to go to 10 seconds

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.540 
we're just going to go to 10 seconds
right<00:02:04.409> here<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.659> again<00:02:06.659> split<00:02:07.259> clip<00:02:07.590> into<00:02:08.520> two

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
right here and again split clip into two

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.229 
right here and again split clip into two
sections<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:10.649> go<00:02:10.770> right<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.849> set<00:02:12.120> your

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
sections and I go right here to set your

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.520 
sections and I go right here to set your
transition

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
transition

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.070 
transition
we're<00:02:13.980> going<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.340> shatter<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.900> now

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
we're going to go to shatter and now

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.270 
we're going to go to shatter and now
let's<00:02:16.320> set<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.740> up<00:02:16.800> for<00:02:17.190> two<00:02:17.700> seconds<00:02:19.280> got

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
let's set that up for two seconds got

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.640 
let's set that up for two seconds got
that<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.330> I'm<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.110> put<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> transition

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
that and I'm going to put a transition

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.160 
that and I'm going to put a transition
here<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> end<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.600> could<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.930> just

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
here on the end so that could be just

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.890 
here on the end so that could be just
like<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.320> little<00:02:25.410> outro<00:02:25.980> fade<00:02:26.510> there's<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.600> fade

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
like a little outro fade there's a fade

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.450 
like a little outro fade there's a fade
right<00:02:28.200> there<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.740> whatever<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.130> want<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.370> to

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
right there or whatever you want it to

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.870 
right there or whatever you want it to
be<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.820> personally<00:02:30.810> kind<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.260> dissolve

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
be I personally kind of like dissolve

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.150 
be I personally kind of like dissolve
and<00:02:32.880> we're<00:02:33.330> going<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.510> set<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.960> up<00:02:34.020> for<00:02:34.200> three

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
and we're going to set that up for three

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.500 
and we're going to set that up for three
seconds<00:02:38.240> right<00:02:39.240> there<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:42.150> basically

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
seconds right there and so basically

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.240 
seconds right there and so basically
once<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.050> split<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.860> going<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.100> be<00:02:44.220> a

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
once you split this it's going to be a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.699 
once you split this it's going to be a
real<00:02:44.460> smooth<00:02:44.730> transition<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.630> should<00:02:46.560> probably

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
real smooth transition I should probably

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.260 
real smooth transition I should probably
do<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.130> with<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.520> two<00:02:47.730> different<00:02:47.850> video

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
do this with like two different video

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.090 
do this with like two different video
clips<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.780> guys<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.110> see<00:02:49.290> how<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.680> but

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
clips so you guys can see how it is but

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.160 
clips so you guys can see how it is but
I<00:02:50.310> think<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.970> guys<00:02:51.120> will<00:02:51.270> get<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.540> gist<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.959> it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
I think you guys will get the gist of it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.280 
I think you guys will get the gist of it
so<00:02:53.070> wherever<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.670> place<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.660> cursor<00:02:55.110> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
so wherever you place this cursor and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.760 
so wherever you place this cursor and
click<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.920> split<00:02:56.160> into<00:02:56.690> two<00:02:57.690> clips<00:02:57.990> that's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
click the split into two clips that's

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.260 
click the split into two clips that's
where<00:02:59.040> your<00:02:59.160> transitions<00:02:59.730> going<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.150> it's

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
where your transitions going to be it's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.960 
where your transitions going to be it's
going<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.510> add<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.350> end<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.740> there

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
going to add it to the end of it there

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.370 
going to add it to the end of it there
so<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.030> show<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.330> guys<00:03:03.540> what<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.140> actually

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
so to show you guys what this actually

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.790 
so to show you guys what this actually
will<00:03:05.130> look<00:03:05.400> like<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:07.140> would<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
will look like that would go to the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.740 
will look like that would go to the
preview<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.550> whenever<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:09.030> preview<00:03:09.510> with

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
preview but whenever you preview with

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.750 
preview but whenever you preview with
the<00:03:09.840> video<00:03:10.140> pad<00:03:10.410> as<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.190> guys<00:03:11.340> know<00:03:11.550> if<00:03:11.640> you're

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
the video pad as you guys know if you're

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.000 
the video pad as you guys know if you're
already<00:03:11.910> using<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.420> program<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.440> preview

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
already using this program the preview

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.970 
already using this program the preview
is<00:03:14.160> pretty<00:03:14.430> shoddy<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:16.500> don't

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
is pretty shoddy on it and I don't

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.680 
is pretty shoddy on it and I don't
actually<00:03:17.220> think<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.640> shows<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.180> effects<00:03:18.540> in

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
actually think it shows the effects in

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.199 
actually think it shows the effects in
there<00:03:18.840> at<00:03:18.930> all<00:03:19.489> sometimes<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.820> does<00:03:20.970> sometimes

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
there at all sometimes it does sometimes

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.420 
there at all sometimes it does sometimes
it<00:03:21.540> doesn't<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:22.019> most<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.920> time<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.310> will

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
it doesn't but most of the time it will

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.699 
it doesn't but most of the time it will
not<00:03:23.670> show<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.959> we're<00:03:25.080> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.260> go<00:03:25.350> into<00:03:25.530> my<00:03:25.650> D

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
not show so we're going to go into my D

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.420 
not show so we're going to go into my D
Drive<00:03:26.269> right<00:03:27.269> here<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.989> it's<00:03:28.950> one<00:03:29.160> called

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
Drive right here and it's one called

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.750 
Drive right here and it's one called
transitions<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.890> how<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.459> going

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
transitions so this is how this is going

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:49.750 
transitions so this is how this is going
to<00:03:32.880> look<00:03:33.090> after<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.870> export<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.440> out<00:03:48.560> and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
to look after you export it out and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.670 
to look after you export it out and
there's<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.060> dissolve<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:52.200> you'll<00:03:52.350> end<00:03:52.590> up

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
there's the dissolve so you'll end up

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.360 
there's the dissolve so you'll end up
having<00:03:53.160> something<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.519> looks<00:03:53.640> like<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.180> so

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
having something that looks like that so

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.110 
having something that looks like that so
just<00:03:56.370> go<00:03:56.580> in<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:58.160> put<00:03:59.160> your<00:03:59.310> clips<00:03:59.640> in<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.060> if

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
just go in and put your clips in and if

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.620 
just go in and put your clips in and if
you've<00:04:00.239> got<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.450> bunch<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.959> smaller<00:04:01.290> Clips

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
you've got a bunch of smaller Clips
