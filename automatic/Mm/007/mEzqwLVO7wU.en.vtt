00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
lollipop all i can say though is it's a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130 
lollipop all i can say though is it's a
usable<00:01:17.460> device<00:01:17.729> again<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.840> you've<00:01:18.960> still

right<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.250> from<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.240> pictures<00:02:14.570> of<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:15.080> looks

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
right I from the pictures of it it looks

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.700 
right I from the pictures of it it looks
well<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.700> looks<00:02:16.730> kind<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.330> massive<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.410> we're

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
well it looks kind of massive so we're

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.810 
well it looks kind of massive so we're
going<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.040> see<00:02:19.160> how<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.430> turns<00:02:19.460> out

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
going to have to see how that turns out

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.760 
going to have to see how that turns out
they<00:02:20.510> are<00:02:20.660> supposed<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.110> have<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.350> device<00:02:21.590> on

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
they are supposed to have the device on

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.800 
they are supposed to have the device on
display<00:02:22.100> at<00:02:22.220> CES<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.700> year<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.300> hopefully<00:02:23.510> I

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
display at CES this year so hopefully I

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.720 
display at CES this year so hopefully I
can<00:02:23.930> get<00:02:24.140> my<00:02:24.290> hands<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.130> maybe<00:02:25.430> make<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
can get my hands on it and maybe make a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.400 
can get my hands on it and maybe make a
video<00:02:25.970> about<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.420> for<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.660> guys<00:02:26.900> if<00:02:27.230> you're

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
video about it for you guys if you're

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.140 
video about it for you guys if you're
interested<00:02:27.770> in<00:02:27.860> something<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.460> but

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
interested in something like that but

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.060 
interested in something like that but
from<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.600> post<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.260> almost<00:02:30.530> looks<00:02:30.770> like<00:02:30.920> it's

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
from the post it almost looks like it's

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.040 
from the post it almost looks like it's
going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.280> be<00:02:31.430> sort<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.030> heads-up<00:02:32.570> display

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
going to be sort of a heads-up display

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.840 
going to be sort of a heads-up display
giving<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.530> little<00:02:33.680> bits<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.040> information<00:02:34.280> as

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
giving you little bits of information as

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.460 
giving you little bits of information as
long<00:02:35.060> as<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.270> pricing<00:02:35.630> on<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.840> isn't<00:02:35.960> too<00:02:36.290> high

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
long as the pricing on it isn't too high

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.600 
long as the pricing on it isn't too high
I<00:02:36.500> think<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.040> could<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.280> an<00:02:37.370> interesting

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
I think it could be an interesting

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.160 
I think it could be an interesting
option<00:02:38.000> if<00:02:38.360> nothing<00:02:38.750> else<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.020> good

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
option if nothing else a good

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.050 
option if nothing else a good
