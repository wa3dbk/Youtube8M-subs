00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
was taken out Tom Chambers had sizzled

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.040 
was taken out Tom Chambers had sizzled
and<00:00:48.920> baked<00:00:49.100> for<00:00:49.339> a<00:00:49.399> Phoenix<00:00:49.820> Suns<00:00:50.030> record<00:00:50.420> 60

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
and baked for a Phoenix Suns record 60

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.569 
and baked for a Phoenix Suns record 60
points<00:00:51.469> when<00:00:51.739> he's<00:00:51.859> hitting<00:00:52.010> his<00:00:52.160> jump<00:00:52.370> shot

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
points when he's hitting his jump shot

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.069 
points when he's hitting his jump shot
from<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.969> perimeter<00:00:53.179> hitting<00:00:53.660> those<00:00:53.749> threes

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
from the perimeter hitting those threes

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.889 
from the perimeter hitting those threes
I<00:00:54.410> mean<00:00:54.589> it's<00:00:54.980> impossible<00:00:55.159> because<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.899> smaller

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
I mean it's impossible because a smaller

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.160 
I mean it's impossible because a smaller
Ford<00:00:57.289> he<00:00:57.829> can<00:00:57.980> post<00:00:58.190> up<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:59.089> bigger<00:00:59.300> Ford<00:00:59.629> he

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
Ford he can post up and a bigger Ford he

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.509 
Ford he can post up and a bigger Ford he
plays<00:01:00.409> out<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:00.739> perimeter<00:01:01.070> he<00:01:01.219> just<00:01:01.399> goes

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
plays out in the perimeter he just goes

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.340 
plays out in the perimeter he just goes
around<00:01:01.550> them<00:01:01.999> so<00:01:02.179> that<00:01:02.390> game<00:01:02.600> was<00:01:02.809> huge<00:01:03.109> just

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
around them so that game was huge just

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.600 
around them so that game was huge just
in<00:01:03.409> that<00:01:03.530> zone<00:01:03.710> we're<00:01:04.010> just<00:01:04.190> trying<00:01:04.370> to<00:01:04.400> get<00:01:04.519> in
