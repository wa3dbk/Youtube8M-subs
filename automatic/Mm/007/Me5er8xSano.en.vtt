another<00:00:18.660> video<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.199> how<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.380> kill<00:00:19.710> skolas<00:00:20.340> we

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
another video on how to kill skolas we

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.439 
another video on how to kill skolas we
think<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> easiest<00:00:22.260> way<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.890> it

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
think this is the easiest way to do it

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.240 
think this is the easiest way to do it
we've<00:00:24.449> been<00:00:24.720> at<00:00:24.930> about<00:00:25.140> three<00:00:25.439> times<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.099> it's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
we've been at about three times and it's

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910 
we've been at about three times and it's
extremely<00:00:26.699> easy<00:00:27.560> it's<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> little<00:00:28.830> bit

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
extremely easy it's a little bit

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.349 
extremely easy it's a little bit
different<00:00:29.220> from<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> other<00:00:29.580> videos<00:00:29.939> right

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
different from the other videos right

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.490 
different from the other videos right
off<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> get-go<00:00:30.779> you're<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> go<00:00:31.260> right

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
off the get-go you're going to go right

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.729 
off the get-go you're going to go right
instead<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.949> left<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.700> makes<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.090> lot<00:00:33.210> easier

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
instead of left it makes it a lot easier

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.080 
instead of left it makes it a lot easier
make<00:00:34.739> sure<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> Titan<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.910> three

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
make sure you have a Titan and three

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.420 
make sure you have a Titan and three
Gallo<00:00:36.300> horns<00:00:36.860> sorry<00:00:37.860> there's<00:00:38.070> no<00:00:38.160> other<00:00:38.250> way

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
Gallo horns sorry there's no other way

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.069 
Gallo horns sorry there's no other way
to<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.850> without<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.300> gala<00:00:39.480> horns<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.050> I

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
to do it without the gala horns so I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.080 
to do it without the gala horns so I
mean<00:00:40.290> it's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.280> possible<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
mean it's a lot it's possible but it's a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 
mean it's a lot it's possible but it's a
lot<00:00:42.210> easier<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.629> them<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.230> basically<00:00:43.649> just

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
lot easier with them so basically just

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.290 
lot easier with them so basically just
right<00:00:44.190> off<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> get-go<00:00:44.579> everybody<00:00:45.120> goes

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
right off the get-go everybody goes

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.869 
right off the get-go everybody goes
right<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:46.200> someone<00:00:46.649> killed<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.190> servitor<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
then have a Titan put a bubble up right

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.619 
then have a Titan put a bubble up right
in<00:00:49.980> between<00:00:50.219> these<00:00:50.579> two<00:00:50.760> barriers<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.539> on

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in between these two barriers up here on

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.500 
in between these two barriers up here on
the<00:00:51.719> platform<00:00:52.520> after<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.670> everybody's<00:00:54.420> just

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the platform after that everybody's just

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
the platform after that everybody's just
going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> start<00:00:54.899> jumping<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.440> shooting<00:00:55.620> at

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
going to start jumping and shooting at

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.479 
going to start jumping and shooting at
skol<00:00:56.280> loss<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.989> as<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:58.890> skol<00:00:59.340> loss

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
skol loss and as you can see skol loss

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.160 
skol loss and as you can see skol loss
doesn't<00:00:59.730> get<00:00:59.910> very<00:00:59.940> close<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
