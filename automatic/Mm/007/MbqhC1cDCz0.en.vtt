00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.600 
have things that to happen you put
whatever<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.590> turns<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.040> an

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
whatever you so it turns out that an

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.359 
whatever you so it turns out that an
enterprising<00:01:30.390> mater<00:01:30.720> has<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.860> found

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
enterprising mater has actually found

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.929 
enterprising mater has actually found
that<00:01:32.939> code<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.170> basically<00:01:34.860> unlocked<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that code and basically unlocked it so

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.609 
that code and basically unlocked it so
you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.210> turn<00:01:36.360> those<00:01:36.540> things<00:01:36.810> back<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.259> not

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you can turn those things back on not

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.999 
you can turn those things back on not
only<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.159> look<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:39.090> better<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.439> they

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
only do they look way better but they

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.450 
only do they look way better but they
also<00:01:41.340> don't<00:01:42.060> even<00:01:42.540> degrade<00:01:43.020> performance<00:01:43.460> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
also don't even degrade performance so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
also don't even degrade performance so
it's<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.970> oh<00:01:45.180> well<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.780> had<00:01:45.930> these

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it's not like oh well we had these

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
it's not like oh well we had these
options<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.829> turn<00:01:47.070> them<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.610> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
options and you can turn them on but it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.330 
options and you can turn them on but it
was<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.630> you're<00:01:48.930> BZ<00:01:49.170> will<00:01:49.439> melt<00:01:49.710> it
