full aware and when you're flying in the
NASA<00:02:12.490> t-38<00:02:13.120> Jets<00:02:13.750> they're<00:02:14.020> high-performance

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
NASA t-38 Jets they're high-performance

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.550 
NASA t-38 Jets they're high-performance
Jets<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.670> if<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.450> if<00:02:16.750> something<00:02:17.230> caught<00:02:17.410> on

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
Jets so if the if something caught on

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.670 
Jets so if the if something caught on
fire<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.400> does<00:02:18.610> not<00:02:18.730> burn

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
fire this does not burn

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.369 
fire this does not burn
has<00:02:19.829> something<00:02:20.010> called<00:02:20.129> nomaks<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.329> no<00:02:21.719> no

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
has something called nomaks in it no no

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.080 
has something called nomaks in it no no
man<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:22.980> keeps<00:02:23.129> it<00:02:23.340> from<00:02:23.489> burning<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.030> you

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
man so it keeps it from burning so you

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.550 
man so it keeps it from burning so you
don't<00:02:24.329> your<00:02:24.480> skin<00:02:24.719> will<00:02:24.930> burn<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.840> white<00:02:28.170> one

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560

don't your skin will burn the white one
those<00:02:29.040> are<00:02:29.370> when<00:02:29.609> you're<00:02:30.049> doing<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.140> spacewalk

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
those are when you're doing a spacewalk

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.720 
those are when you're doing a spacewalk
yeah<00:02:33.239> we<00:02:33.629> go<00:02:33.750> slowly<00:02:34.250> when<00:02:35.250> you're<00:02:35.370> floating

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
yeah we go slowly when you're floating

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.360 
yeah we go slowly when you're floating
in<00:02:36.060> space<00:02:36.590> you're<00:02:37.590> actually<00:02:37.889> outside<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
in space you're actually outside the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.699 
in space you're actually outside the
spaceship<00:02:38.969> and<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.780> suit<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.170> pressurized

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
spaceship and that suit is pressurized

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.429 
spaceship and that suit is pressurized
to<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:42.359> float<00:02:42.599> around<00:02:42.719> you<00:02:43.079> can<00:02:43.230> work

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
to and you can float around you can work

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.640 
to and you can float around you can work
in<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.250> elbows<00:02:44.879> are<00:02:45.239> hinged<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.379> you<00:02:46.469> can

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
in the the elbows are hinged so you can

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.970 
in the the elbows are hinged so you can
move<00:02:46.889> your<00:02:47.069> elbows<00:02:47.459> around
