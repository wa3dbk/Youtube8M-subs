get the IP but I realize it's better to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880 
get the IP but I realize it's better to
make<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> only<00:01:09.030> Ops<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.840> d<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> challenge

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
with and then we might get it's like a

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.380 
with and then we might get it's like a
hundred<00:01:33.000> person<00:01:33.329> limit<00:01:34.579> hopefully<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:36.119> time

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hundred person limit hopefully as time

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.510 
hundred person limit hopefully as time
goes<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.320> how<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.950> does<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
goes on and we see how it it does and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.880 
goes on and we see how it it does and
expand<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:40.049> might<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.409> some<00:01:40.560> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> like

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
expand and we might do some kind of like

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.179 
expand and we might do some kind of like
