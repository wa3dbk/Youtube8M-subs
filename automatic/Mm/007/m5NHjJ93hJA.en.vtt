00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 and worse that lesson only a penny or hair 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.470
 plastic is recycle arsk or use 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.970
 can be mystical with who was that is logo 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.400
 meticulous cycle 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.040
 toe tess the sony means it can be used a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.870
 quilt her because it and oh my soul means 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.870
 is we would be a figure out 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.680
 so 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.690
 turns out the cycle of plastics for the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.570
 complex 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.309
 it's the problem there basically this 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.259
 made of Thai plastic 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.549
 product smiley the seven points time can 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.880
 be different 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.479
 therefore total is creep but it was 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.659
 more 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.950
 is still nice so the 4 people that kind of aw 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.950
 fabrics that always measure me 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.450
 so whose branch plastic is not one hands 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.700
 percentec the guys that design the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.350
 plastic machines because and tbs efficient 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.659
 as possible 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 so the machine would be veryfast with all that 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.799
 complex and project manager 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.520
 defect is that you have sufficient machines 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.530
 allow you rent and by product manager 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.300
 recycled plastic 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.020
 the my damage may also be slow 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.020
 down production at just too much music 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.700
 michael was the set up a small workshop 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.440
 which runs on local plastic 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.840
 hs people to bring who there again 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.030
 Graphics and offered him I jumped 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.770
 into small pieces 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.629
 the tunnel is in production and is quite 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.910
 machines 

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:09.670
 so from designer at or machines that ales 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.230
 complex physical use enthusiasm series 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.230
 and started participating
