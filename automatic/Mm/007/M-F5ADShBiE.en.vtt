technology<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:36.230> what<00:00:36.380> that<00:00:36.559> means<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.190> that

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
technology so what that means is that

it's<00:00:37.969> rockered<00:00:38.719> between<00:00:39.320> here<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:39.800> then

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
it's rockered between here and then

it's rockered between here and then
cambered<00:00:41.059> between<00:00:41.540> here<00:00:41.870> all<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:42.350> way<00:00:42.440> back

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
cambered between here all the way back

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.229 
cambered between here all the way back
down<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.160> you<00:00:43.219> can<00:00:43.340> see<00:00:43.579> it<00:00:43.700> it<00:00:43.790> kind<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.059> goes

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
down and you can see it it kind of goes

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.550

like<00:00:44.360> this<00:00:44.690> okay<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:49.160> Flex<00:00:49.579> is<00:00:50.110> about<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.140> six

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
like this okay the Flex is about a six

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.340 
like this okay the Flex is about a six
and<00:00:51.740> a<00:00:51.800> half<00:00:51.829> out<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.310> ten<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:54.020> good<00:00:54.230> and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
and a half out of ten so it's good and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.370 
and a half out of ten so it's good and
stiff<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:56.120> twin<00:00:56.570> tip<00:00:57.530> snowboard<00:00:58.280> but<00:00:59.380> the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
stiff it is a twin tip snowboard but the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.560 
stiff it is a twin tip snowboard but the
side<00:01:00.680> cut<00:01:01.070> is<00:01:01.310> directional<00:01:01.790> so<00:01:02.090> what<00:01:02.390> that

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
side cut is directional so what that

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.600 
side cut is directional so what that
means<00:01:02.840> is<00:01:03.050> that<00:01:03.200> it's<00:01:03.380> set<00:01:03.649> back<00:01:03.950> a<00:01:03.980> little<00:01:04.339> bit

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
means is that it's set back a little bit

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.429 
means is that it's set back a little bit
for<00:01:04.939> you<00:01:06.040> like<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.220> said<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.450> Phoenix<00:01:08.960> series

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
is a big mountain rider snowboard it's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.450 
is a big mountain rider snowboard it's
got<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.360> magna<00:01:14.780> traction<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.500> if<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:15.890> gets<00:01:16.250> a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
got the magna traction so if it gets a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.130 
got the magna traction so if it gets a
little<00:01:16.640> bit<00:01:16.820> hairball<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.270> harden<00:01:17.780> icy

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
little bit hairball and harden icy

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.780 
little bit hairball and harden icy
