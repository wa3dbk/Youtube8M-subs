00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and then this is a little weird I found

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.990 
and then this is a little weird I found
this<00:01:16.200> idea<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> while<00:01:16.979> ago<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.790> weird

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
this idea a while ago like it's a weird

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490 
this idea a while ago like it's a weird
style<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.540> spawn<00:01:18.750> trap<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> I've<00:01:19.350> actually

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
style of spawn trap and I've actually

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
style of spawn trap and I've actually
found<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.310> few<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.000> already<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.479> it's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
found a few of them already and it's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.210 
found a few of them already and it's
just<00:01:22.170> kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> find<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> guy<00:01:23.070> actually

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
just kind of find that this guy actually

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
just kind of find that this guy actually
sent<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.420> before<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
sent this in right before I was what to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080 
sent this in right before I was what to
make<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.830> some<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> other<00:01:26.369> ones<00:01:26.580> which

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
make one on some of the other ones which

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.550 
make one on some of the other ones which
I<00:01:27.270> will<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> showing<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.110> guys<00:01:28.200> later

like<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.520> another<00:01:29.790> video<00:01:29.939> obviously<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:31.380> what

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
like on another video obviously but what

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.219 
like on another video obviously but what
you<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.240> basically<00:01:33.540> place<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you have to do is you basically place a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.890 
you have to do is you basically place a
bouncing<00:01:34.740> betty<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.479> one<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> spawn

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
bouncing betty on one of the spawn

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
bouncing betty on one of the spawn
points<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> then<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.040> sort<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.400> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
points and then you just sort of get a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.270 
points and then you just sort of get a
good<00:01:38.640> spot<00:01:38.939> where<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.979> still

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.780 
still not fully exposed to them and
they're<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.710> still<00:01:49.920> fully<00:01:50.159> exposed<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
they're not still fully exposed to you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.609 
they're not still fully exposed to you
so<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.750> doesn't<00:01:51.960> detect<00:01:52.350> that

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
so that way it doesn't detect that

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.190 
so that way it doesn't detect that
you're<00:01:52.799> basically<00:01:53.700> seeing<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.960> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
you're basically seeing them if that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.510 
you're basically seeing them if that
makes<00:01:55.350> any<00:01:55.470> sense<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.950> don't<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.490> does<00:01:57.079> um

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
makes any sense I don't know it does um

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.770 
makes any sense I don't know it does um
