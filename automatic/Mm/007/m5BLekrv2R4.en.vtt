00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.610
 to do 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.360
 in this project we have worked from the existing basketball and volleyball 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.780
 and the assignment of our students was to use the 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.769

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.419
 national teams 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.529
 With this students of a very nice assignments were also a number 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.409
 Students who were the fastest of it but later on Friday became very good 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:28.750
 he in the process 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.590
 Proceeding is a package to the group process after his wife 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.850
 compensated 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.140
 as an extra touch on the line 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.130
 refuse for this reason 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 normally they work hard for her 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.380
 7 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.139
 well a medicine 

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:49.480
 and it shows 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.410
 however, following an essential step does not fit 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.460
 very good that the students from landstede are deployed in this case from the front 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.010
 fashion show but we are already used to many more of our activities 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.760
 students around our team 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.390
 he did it nice to see and what to do about a free thought and the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.410
 creativity is and especially good for one that belongs well 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.620
 whoever is a thing of the past and that is being processed in whatever is in it 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.950
 future there must have been on the field but this was about clothing 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.060
 ashes that comes from old clothing and because of being turned into something 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.580
 news and i think that amer also fits in this time yes i am very proud of that 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.640
 soon chose to lead the way with my design of a tie they are renovating 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.060
 and there later the dancers will have in the design of clothes 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.520
 is the fourth quarter 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.760
 I can, of course, learn how to deal with customers and how to handle something 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.360
 can present to make it happen there 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.540
 and it is totally nice to see that I was also working a rise 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.010
 we are following about student development, it is really very well done and me 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.420
