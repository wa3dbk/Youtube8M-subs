anyhow<00:04:01.500> okay<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:03.280> pattern<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:04.150> you're

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
anyhow okay and the pattern is you're

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.350

other nose so your thumb is gonna keep
doing<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.940> entire<00:04:09.970> time<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:14.070> so<00:04:15.070> you'll

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
doing this the entire time and so you'll

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:29.990 
doing this the entire time and so you'll
get<00:04:15.640> this<00:04:15.910> effect

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.629 

as<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.240> can<00:04:31.330> see<00:04:31.569> my<00:04:32.020> thumb<00:04:32.289> is<00:04:33.009> every<00:04:33.400> other

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
as you can see my thumb is every other

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:53.189 
as you can see my thumb is every other
note<00:04:34.319> so<00:04:35.319> at<00:04:35.530> real<00:04:35.830> speed

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:05:01.020 

here<00:04:54.199> are<00:04:54.440> two<00:04:54.650> courtships

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.570 

so<00:05:02.030> that's<00:05:02.210> all<00:05:02.420> there<00:05:02.600> is<00:05:02.660> for<00:05:03.170> the<00:05:04.160> verse<00:05:04.340> and

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
so that's all there is for the verse and

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.500 
so that's all there is for the verse and
