00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.500
 hello how happy are you how are you 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.240
 spending the holidays I hope very well 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.520
 in today's video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.440
 make a very easy pick up so that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.260
 you may clothe you this New Year 's Eve 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.970
 I teach step by step how to do what 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.130
 first thing we're going to do is unravel 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.210
 very good hair and apply a serum to 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.480
 that gives a bit of brightness to the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:39.760
 finish of the collected 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:41.050
 and we extend it well with our hands 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.100
 We heat a little bit, we apply it on 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.100
 all in means and tips 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.290
 the first thing we are going to do starting 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.969
 of the crown is to divide the hair into 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.969
 two partitions and make two pigtails 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.960
 now with each one of these pigtails 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.820
 let's make a braid cÃ³rdoba colette 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.509
 we remember you remember how another was made 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.720
 I remember we split the pigtail in two and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.340
 we rotate each van made separately 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 towards the same side and then when we have 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.350
 finished we rotated between them in the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.890
 opposite direction and we would give for example 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.890
 is in 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.790
 this also inward 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.440
 and now we turn it between them towards 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.440
 outside 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.850
 when we get to the extreme what 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.800
 we assure a little water but we leave the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.090
 tips bent inwards from 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:04.470
 caught with the rubber band so that later 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:26.040
 it's easier to pick up all the braid like this 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:28.560
 ok we have the same thing with the other thing to 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.569
 Then we will take the braid 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.810
 cord on the right 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.810
 and we're going to move it up 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.030
 Y 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.989
 and we set it at the highest point with 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.989
 a hairpin or crochet 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:05.220
 and we also set it outside the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:09.260
 another light bulb from the queue now let's 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.260
 pass it under the other queue 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.660
 and we are going to take the tail of the 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.620
 left and continue the circle 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.660
 we leave this which is what we brought 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.660
 from above we leave it here hanging 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.150
 we ensure this also with forks 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.769
 and we're going to move it inside the 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.769
 circle 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:50.600
 and now if we set this part of the 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:52.760
 head once we have the circle 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.250
 outside closed let's roll the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.410
 two ends that we have left and fix them with 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:03.250
 forks in the center of the bun 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.250
 we go rolling 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.230
 and we repeat the operation with the other 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.230
 extreme 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.890
 we roll it 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:31.009
 and we fix it with hairpins and this is the 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.750
 result that seems good to you as you see 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.210
 It is a collected that can look very good 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.919
 if we have an elegant dinner or any 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.120
 special occasion in which we want 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.009
 wear a hairstyle a little bit more 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.770
 special 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.020
 if you have more short hair also 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.419
 you can do it the only thing that you have to 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.889
 keep in mind is that the shorter 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.089
 be the mane more together they have to 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.499
 be the two balls with which 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.569
 we started working to make the 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.460
 cord braids 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:56.899
 well I hope you cheer with this 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.759
 you have already seen that it is very 

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:00.439
 easy to do what you can do in 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.639
 your bathroom less than five 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.990
 minutes and so good you open the 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.830
 hairdresser if you want to party 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.990

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.270
