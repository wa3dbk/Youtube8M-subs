00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.969 
on the on the set very very exciting and
I<00:01:32.670> remember<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:34.110> kid<00:01:34.229> watching<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I remember when I was a kid watching the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
I remember when I was a kid watching the
very<00:01:35.159> first<00:01:35.490> Star<00:01:35.790> Wars<00:01:36.060> movie<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> was

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
very first Star Wars movie when I was

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.980 
very first Star Wars movie when I was
about<00:01:37.010> ten<00:01:38.010> years<00:01:38.040> old<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.510> scene<00:01:39.780> with

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
about ten years old and the scene with

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.500 
about ten years old and the scene with
the<00:01:40.170> band<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.100> their<00:01:41.250> alien<00:01:41.580> costumes<00:01:42.120> really

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
the band in their alien costumes really

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.700 
the band in their alien costumes really
sort<00:01:42.690> of<00:01:42.750> caught<00:01:42.900> my<00:01:43.080> attention<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.650> I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
sort of caught my attention and I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.240 
sort of caught my attention and I
thought<00:01:43.860> it'd<00:01:44.010> be<00:01:44.100> fantastic<00:01:44.310> punitive<00:01:45.120> just

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
thought it'd be fantastic punitive just

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
thought it'd be fantastic punitive just
do<00:01:47.250> something<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.760> that<00:01:47.940> in<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.150> significant

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
do something like that in a significant

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
do something like that in a significant
movie<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.560> Star<00:01:49.830> Wars<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.520> really

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
movie like Star Wars so it was really

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.560 
movie like Star Wars so it was really
something<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.659> actually<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:52.049> involved<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.650> a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
something to actually be involved in a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.230 
something to actually be involved in a
iconic<00:01:54.570> film<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.400> be<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.790> alien

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
iconic film like this and to be an alien

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.130 
iconic film like this and to be an alien
so<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.290> pretty<00:01:58.380> excited<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:58.950> that
