00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.749
 hit to understand 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:13.329
 more or less as operated hunter keith ornament 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.679
 we have prepared a graffiti where we are going to talk 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.679
 of how is the approval of waves 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.720
 depending on the frequency 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.470
 Between 20 gear 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.189
 and the province and go-karts 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.910
 is an auditory frequency human beings can decoded days 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.010
 are in that frequency range 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.260
 for example 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.420
 I'm not talking independently of the fact to the microphone once as a cutter 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.790
 gil when we talk 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.600
 we emit waves the idea is to return to our vocal cords 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.240
 that kindness spread in the middle that the air 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.200
 through 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.730
 with pressures and successive air expansions 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.010
 that valid votes be made to your ears 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.420
 they have a 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.110
 for quito namco 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 maybe martin pan omc decoding 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 this about the crisis 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.300
 If we were in a vacuum, today, A and B could not afford a power 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.090
 listen more 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.260
 this could talk but they can not listen to porn is so in the middle of 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.580
 propagation of the wave 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.570
 ultracavitation equipment 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.430
 works for half a percent and mechanical wave coupling 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.000
 produced by an internal component that are the head 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.830
 the macrista the electric floor 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.660
 this this physics of glass that is electric has the ability 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.570
 to interpret an electrical work 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 and translate it into a mechanical sling 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.510
 that wave has different characteristics that enhance frequency 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.410
 and what in the body 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.410
 that mechanical wave that emits the head of the equipment 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.800
 it is also going to propagate 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.010
 and a phenomenon was generated 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.299
 where they look like micro bubbles 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.619
 steam 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.619
 inside the adipose tissues 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.389
 as you can see in the graph 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.619
 sling that is up on an ultrasonic wave 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.500
 where we can see compressions and expansions 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.529
 coupled to the medium that we have recently commented that these microbubbles generate 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:33.859
 steam 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.879
 is going of year inflating can increase the one day told me 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.309
 and gaining energy 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:42.929
 as 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.479
 greater is the power transmitted will be coupled 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.899
 the bubble is gaining a diameter until it reached a point where it breaks 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.479
 when it breaks it releases energy all the energy that by cumulating 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.389
 this phenomenon is called cavitation associated with an ultrasonic wave 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.079
 we have a pointer that they inhabit 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.689
 in graphics efe obviously are 1 microscopic photos of what juno 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:09.669
 device 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.679
 we have the mayor 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:16.459
 that inside these microbubbles has proof because they are going 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.419
 inflating 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:18.750
 in great via metro 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.770
 as the microbubble energy is increased by refloating 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.770
 when oliver energy breaks at the disposal 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.089
 hilary pósito goes 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:34.379
 tiger giving in different particular fat of smaller diameter 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.679
 that process keep sending music Picasso 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:43.949
 where practically the the pósito spent oil moments of state pge his 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:49.610
 very much smaller diameter and we can stop or eliminate politics 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.819
 in our team comes all associated with the characteristic as we speak 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.739
 in the wave 'mechanical cacophys 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.029
 we are talking about high power and low frequency bands 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.480
 we talk about high power when we talk about 150 watts rms real watts 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.819
 petro coupling the body 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.619
 in low frequency 40 kilos carlos 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.619
 the head is very important 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.840
 because it is easy to generate power but it is very difficult to transmit 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:21.379
 the question is what 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.499
 park this power was relayed 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:27.840
 I need it from a noble head 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.550
 that meets the specifications with which the duo circuit design of 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.889
 picador of the device and can transmit the power of the patient 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.309
 in another head 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:45.819
 besides stopping two crystals in series so when they release in 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.449
 concordance add their powers 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.449
 They have been frozen to a stainless steel lid 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.949
 Stainless steel is very important because we use stainless steel that has 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.949
 to be more expensive and much harder to imagine 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.580
 because aluminum 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.930
 over time 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.120
 cp gc 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.120
 they know that opaque icons are opaque small team appear small 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.379
 micropores 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.849
 that as the above after unused 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:21.699
 under a canopy reithofer and the rest nigel vicky fifth patient with whom 12 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.080
 have been had working 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.320
 these are contaminated from patient to patient or generated as 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.729
 an insulating layer becomes opaque and when that happens 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.900
 every time they emit less mechanical intention 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.009
 what redounds 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.969
 the detriment of ethics is about whether or not the results lead 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.360
 luckily he entered the team 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.419
 he has been the exile speak in that sense Spain always 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.840
 it is not opaque could not be it happens absolutely nothing and again I can 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.210
 give you a tool that will serve you and that you will not have to 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.669
 to send the republic never or to prevent them from going around contaminating the 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.460
 patient in patients a solid tool 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.369
 how is our concept 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:09.479
 it's a very interesting question in this team the work method 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.300
 as usual 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.110
 we need a correct configuration of the equipment to be able to obtain results 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.270
 the working method of this equipment by measuring cutaneous pib 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.720
 panicle adipose the idea this agreement as seen on the screen that it consumes 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.430
 the screen the team asks for the diameter of the fold 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.370
 coli that we are working in fact the team is provided with a 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.710
 peak meters 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.229
 deal does not work this gadget to measure the diameter of the foot 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.219
 and depending on the diameter of the pri and that we enter in the equipment 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:45.519
 the microcontroller of the team goes to interpret that data and will configure 

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:50.169
 automatically power and frequencies frequency of pulsation the frequency 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.240
 of the metal band daughter of 40 kilos carlos 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.640
 what we are talking about here in him accusation oct so how two 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.800
 can guarantee that the equipment is removed is correctly configured 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.990
 it would seem perfect and thus be able to produce a phenomenon 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:11.309
 not bad music and casiano cdr pepper discursive localized 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:14.049
 with a correct configuration of the year
