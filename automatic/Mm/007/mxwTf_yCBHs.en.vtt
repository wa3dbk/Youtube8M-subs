00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 I have trouble breathing 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.549
 nose then I suggest you watch 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.290
 in this video 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.019
 I'm a doctor, the doctor. 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.870
 ENT and I will talk to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.080
 you on a certain site because the deviation 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.779
 septum is important 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.699
 It is indeed an important cause. 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.900
 Nasal obstruction was not stamped 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.750
 besides several other problems he is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.810
 a very common change in the population 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 most people have some degree of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.010
 deviated septum some studies estimate 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.840
 that 80% of the population has this problem 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.230
 but only a small part of these 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.289
 People need to treat the deviation which is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.070
 I'll decide, I'll start by talking. 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.309
 first of which is the nasal cavity septum 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.949
 nasal is divided into two right halves 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.059
 and left structure that should be 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.620
 cavity is the nasal nasal septum 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.040
 it's like a tunnel to the passage 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.229
 the air and the right is like this 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.490
 wall dividing the two sides of the tunnel 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.580
 sure is a structure formed 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.009
 mainly for oscar lagen she 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.270
 is also coated by a skin that is 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.950
 called nasal mucosa septum deviation 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.439
 speaking in a very simplified way 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.530
 It's when the brain is crooked and like me 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.689
 said the Celtic with the wall and said 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 this wall has pie this can generate 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.020
 a series of problems 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.570
 deviating septum becomes a problem 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 when he is big when he is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.259
 very crooked 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.470
 if it is small it usually does not 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.880
 cause a lot of repercussion because it occurs 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.460
 of which are the main causes 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.920
 Who says it is always traumatic that occurred 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.130
 a trauma to the nose may have had a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.860
 broken nose and a fractured septum 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.130
 caused the brain to become crooked 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.640
 some diseases can also cause 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.110
 certainly some diseases mainly 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.020
 during childhood and adolescence when 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.230
 if it is in the growth phase can 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.060
 to make the brain grow crooked 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.890
 and some people simply have a 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.420
 genetic predisposition 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.930
 she has a tendency to have a nose 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.930
 crooked 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.620
 what are the main problems that 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.080
 said works out can cause 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.280
 it can make it difficult to pass air 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.920
 by the nose 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.599
 rotating nasal obstruction beyond 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.739
 favor the occurrence of other 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.019
 problems 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.629
 certainly be associated with several 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.560
 diseases such as sinusitis 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.590
 and recurrent infections such as 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 throat infections sinusitis repetition 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.519
 the tite obstructive apnea 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.370
 sleep and what symptoms may be 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.940
 related to these problems and pain 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:05.629
 throat headaches pains 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:09.299
 ear snoring snoring tiredness 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.970
 drowsiness to do if you have 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.650
 symptoms if you suspect that the 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.150
 prisoners and certain 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.609
 It's important that you look for a 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.130
 otorhinolaryngologist as is the 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.480
 diagnosis of the deviation from a certain point is 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.900
 important to do the physical exam 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.030
 make us copy put a device to 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.859
 look inside the nose and some exams 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.200
 are also very important. 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:34.169
 depending on the case you have 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.810
 video nasofibroscopy I tomography 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.599
 computerized face that video 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.609
 nasofibroscopy was to place the 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.109
 device inside the nose 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.959
 this appliance will be occupied a 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.480
 video camera will be able to see the nose 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.760
 inside with much more details 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.370
 will be able to assess better deviation of 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.889
 septum and will also be able to see if there 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.319
 problems other than septum deviation 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.739
 another exam that can be very useful is 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.870
 tomography scan similar to 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.769
 x-ray but he's much better 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.900
 it uses neither radiation nor pain and it is used 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.000
 in selected cases 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.799
 it is very important that the doctor 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.609
 problems that may exist in the nose as 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.419
 for example people allergic to sinusitis 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.570
 and others 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.030
 he must find all the problems for 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.780
 to be able to make the most appropriate treatment 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.930
 and what is the treatment of 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.780
 certain treatment is surgery name of the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.700
 septoplasty surgery is the problem 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.600
 deviation is that the brain is 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.570
 crooked 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.490
 the solution is to mislead the right and how 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.250
 You do it the only way you 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.460
 You can import right is operating is 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.830
 make the plastic and if necessary the 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.960
 physician may associate with others 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.730
 procedures together with correct plasty 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.610
 depends on each case 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.230
 Do you want to know more about surgery? 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.540
 I'm going to prepare a special video about 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.580
 this subject will soon continue 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.520
 accompanying our publications 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.950
 this material is merely informative and 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.210
 not replace a medical appointment 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.320
 any problem the doctor should be 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.650
 consulted 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.980
