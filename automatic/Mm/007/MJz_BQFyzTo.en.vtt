like<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.899> gonna<00:01:43.110> win<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> due<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
like I'm not gonna win this due to a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
like I'm not gonna win this due to a
misclick<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.000> went<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
misclick because if I went for a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.260 
misclick because if I went for a
substitute<00:01:46.470> first<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.009> an<00:01:47.100> encore<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.759> then

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
substitute first and an encore then then

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.090 
substitute first and an encore then then
I<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.600> been<00:01:48.750> locked<00:01:48.990> into<00:01:49.649> stealth
