00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.070
 cosmetic and therapeutic 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.450
 agent and prophylactic agent 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.900
 which with which can be very 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.680
 careful I want to turn first 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.560
 your attention on the essential manufacturers 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.770
 butter you've probably already read many times and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.659
 goods on various forms 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.049
 essential oil cannot be cheap and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.009
 even if you bought essential oil and 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.750
 doubt it is not worth it 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:55.710
 smear it on the heels of the essential oil 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.730
 its molecular structure is very volatile 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.760
 easily penetrates all skin layers 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.460
 and and the body that is at 1 Mazov on 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.260
 heels after a while we can 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.260
 feel this oil in exhalation 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.480
 and if it is of poor quality, harm 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.410
 your body 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:19.030
 also observe the dosage 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.740
 because it no longer means better 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.780
 cellulite will not pass faster you do not 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.010
 lose weight faster if you teach 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.140
 soda a few times this with one 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.210
 parties on the other hand I meet 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.610
 completely different attitude to ethereal 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:40.160
 butter something like 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.340
 stinkers some fragrant things for 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.390
 pampering 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.240
 totally disagree with such people 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.300
 as a quality essential oil can 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.700
 to be the strongest preventive 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.720
 remedy course cure ethereal 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.150
 oils can not only and they can 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.850
 use as auxiliary 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.070
 remedy but disease prevention 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.300
 it can be done with 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.840
 essential oils 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.330
 what I talked about first of all 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.260
 cold prevention and it is much better 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.040
 than prick vaccinations take some 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.040
 powders 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.370
 drugs 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:33.070
 if you know that in winter you often 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:36.410

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.890
 common and natural for 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:47.350
 Russian also 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.350

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.290
 conifer trees therefore essential data 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.750

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:17.120
