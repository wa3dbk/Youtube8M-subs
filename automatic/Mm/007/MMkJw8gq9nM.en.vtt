rotates around to std that could be set
for<00:03:06.890> daylight<00:03:07.890> savings<00:03:08.250> time<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.550> well<00:03:08.760> and

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
for daylight savings time as well and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.300 
for daylight savings time as well and
the<00:03:10.380> first<00:03:10.590> thing<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:10.800> we<00:03:11.040> want<00:03:11.220> to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the first thing that we want to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.020 
the first thing that we want to
determine<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.880> our<00:03:12.540> time<00:03:13.230> zone<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.850> way<00:03:14.970> you

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
determine is our time zone the way you

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.360 
determine is our time zone the way you
do<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.450> your<00:03:15.600> bottom<00:03:15.870> right<00:03:16.020> button

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
do that is your bottom right button

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.820 
do that is your bottom right button
you'll<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.300> big<00:03:18.780> second<00:03:19.560> hand<00:03:19.740> on

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
you'll see that the big second hand on

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.770 
you'll see that the big second hand on
the<00:03:19.920> main<00:03:20.070> pinion<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.910> rotating<00:03:21.510> around

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
the main pinion is rotating around

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.450 
the main pinion is rotating around
pointing<00:03:22.590> at<00:03:22.740> all<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.390> different<00:03:25.460> city

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
pointing at all of the different city

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.840 
pointing at all of the different city
codes<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.570> for<00:03:28.290> our<00:03:28.650> case<00:03:28.710> I'm<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.670> set

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
codes so for our case I'm going to set

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.650 
codes so for our case I'm going to set
it<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.470> LAX

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.580 

so<00:03:36.660> now<00:03:36.810> I've<00:03:36.900> got<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.200> handset<00:03:37.740> to<00:03:38.060> LAX<00:03:39.590> once

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
so now I've got the handset to LAX once

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.630 
so now I've got the handset to LAX once
they<00:03:40.800> stop<00:03:42.290> but<00:03:43.290> our<00:03:43.530> mode<00:03:43.860> hand<00:03:44.100> is<00:03:44.220> still<00:03:44.400> set

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
they stop but our mode hand is still set

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.000 
they stop but our mode hand is still set
for<00:03:44.670> STD<00:03:45.570> which<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.930> standard<00:03:46.290> time<00:03:46.470> but<00:03:46.800> right

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
for STD which is standard time but right

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.310 
for STD which is standard time but right
now<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.370> daylight<00:03:47.730> savings<00:03:48.180> time<00:03:48.240> so<00:03:49.020> I'm

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
now it's daylight savings time so I'm

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.400 
now it's daylight savings time so I'm
going<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.880> change<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.240> well<00:03:54.170> soon<00:03:55.170> as<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
going to change that as well soon as the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.560 
going to change that as well soon as the
hands<00:03:55.650> stop<00:03:57.710> it's<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.830> only<00:03:58.950> downside<00:03:59.490> to

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
hands stop it's the only downside to

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.920 
hands stop it's the only downside to
these<00:04:00.570> extremely<00:04:02.360> advanced<00:04:03.360> watches<00:04:03.720> you

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
going to set it to its 2010 plus two

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.320 
going to set it to its 2010 plus two
that's<00:06:09.950> why<00:06:10.130> it's<00:06:10.280> pointing<00:06:10.640> at<00:06:10.730> the<00:06:10.880> two<00:06:11.060> if

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
that's why it's pointing at the two if

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.870 
that's why it's pointing at the two if
it<00:06:11.540> was<00:06:11.710> 2013<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:14.000> would<00:06:14.090> be<00:06:14.180> their<00:06:14.590> 2014<00:06:15.880> 2015

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
it was 2013 it would be their 2014 2015

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:28.410 
it was 2013 it would be their 2014 2015

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.840 

press<00:06:29.020> the<00:06:29.170> mode<00:06:29.320> button<00:06:29.380> one<00:06:29.860> more<00:06:29.890> time<00:06:30.070> and

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
we can set our month we are in June so

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.520 
we can set our month we are in June so
that's<00:06:34.120> why<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.780> big<00:06:35.020> second<00:06:35.350> end<00:06:35.440> is

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
that's why the big second end is

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.010 
that's why the big second end is
pointing<00:06:35.770> at<00:06:35.860> the<00:06:35.980> six<00:06:36.280> because<00:06:36.910> the<00:06:37.690> sixth

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
pointing at the six because the sixth

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.600 
pointing at the six because the sixth
month<00:06:38.260> of<00:06:38.350> the<00:06:38.410> year<00:06:38.470> that<00:06:39.100> would<00:06:39.220> be<00:06:39.310> July
