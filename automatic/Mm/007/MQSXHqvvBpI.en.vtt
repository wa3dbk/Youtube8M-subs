00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.840
 I greet you on the channel media room 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.030
 My name is Konstantin Andrianov and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.790
 today i will tell you about usb connectors 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.640
 type-c and new features of the standard 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.250
 There is b31 immediately want to note that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.800
 punched pc is a connector type then what 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.390
 uzb 31 new standard to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.820
 better understand what the difference is let's 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.580
 back 14 years ago exactly 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.090
 we all use the standard yuzbi 20 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.700
 any cable yusb version 20 and below has 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.380
 inside 4 copper conductors along two of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.450
 they are fed by the other two 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.550
 data cable is strict 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.219
 standardized one end 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 equipped with a type connector namely it serves 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.460
 to connect to the system 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 most often it can be found on 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.809
 flash keyboards and mice 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.300
 the second part of the cable has a connector type 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.280
 b or his micro and mini version he 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 designed to connect suit in 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.890
 system 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 such a connector can be found on the cable 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 to connect smartphone printers 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.229
 cameras then 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.540
 from the above it becomes clear that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.549
 inside these connectors are 4 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.400
 pads that serve to 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.680
 power and connections but as time goes on and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.810
 progress does not stand still develop 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.540
 technology and old capacity is no longer 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.590
 enough to improve performance 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.830
 standard has been developed new 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.960
 specification lawyer 30 she includes herself 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.820
 five additional contacts 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.189
 four of which provide 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.189
 additional communication lines increase 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.350
 maximum throughput 480 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.600
 between no seconds to beijing candida 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.270
 second and increase the maximum current 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.270
 sleep 100 milliamps to 9 lemberg yourself 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.570
 and here in the autumn of 2013 appears 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.090
 updated standard beaten 31 which and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.909
 brought us connectors 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.100
 knocked down the transfer option get power and 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.520
 doubling data rate by 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.979
 compared to 30 what is interesting now 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.869
 usb type c connector is installed on 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.179
 both sides of the cable and has 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.969
 two-way connection so now 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.850
 no matter how cool you canâ€™t miss either 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.399
 yusbi 31 received another power standard 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.739
 delivery which according to specification 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.830
 provide current transfer up to 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.569
 100 watts and in both directions at a given 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.819
 moment this technology is involved 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.870
 only two laptops and macbook 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.940
 pixel chromebook 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.099
 still worth noting that some 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.590
 companies are going to trick put 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.680
 usb type c connector inside it 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.959
 turns and ride version 20 with all 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.360
 power and speed limits 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.360
 the data transfer did just that 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.910
 nokia company in its nokia n tablet 1 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.829
 Incidentally, one cannot bypass the recent 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.470
 story related to the release of the new 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.420
 macbook after company presentation 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.519
 apple on the internet collapsed squall 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.620
 shine users resented by 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.560
 about the fact that the new macbook received 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.079
 just one usb type-c port, say it 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.700
 impose restrictions on them protection 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.190
 I can say that it is partially 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.620
 the limitation is decided by the standard the floor is divided 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.630
 and so for example connect 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.670
 laptop monitor cable yusb 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.430
 the possibility of power supply 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.280
 the monitor at the same time is a five-hour display and 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.620
 I want to charge the laptop summing up 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.169
 to say that such a connector for me personally is not 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.510
 enough for ten years so I want 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.730
 believe that in the near future 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.340
 standard usb 1 will get the widest 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.680
 spread thereby facilitating our 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.620
 already 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.450
 With you was Konstantin Andrianov and project 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.099

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.290
 subscribe to the channel put likes and 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.069
