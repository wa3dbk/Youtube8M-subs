00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.180
 so hello to everyone in this video I wanted 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.719
 make a review of hours 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:14.150
 which proved 100 thousand shock on hand they 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:20.070
 sit very well well at first you 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:23.430
 a little getting used to be so here yourself 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.750
 watch them at first will be difficult 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.619
 then jump out if you look now 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:38.640
 Now if you look inside you can see it 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:44.180
 that light can be written here so start and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.850
 dirt from well, that is, light is the backlight 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.170
 at night it is at night in direct we use 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 at night the lights are very well lit 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:00.420
 so young i like to click on mole now 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.320
 I have a clock here 1606 can be seen so here 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 still here is such a small circle screen 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:14.030
 there is shorter here 24 shows there is a click 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:19.189
 here they are here right here on the drink and m goes 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.570
 so shorter click on the mod this one could 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.310
 Now I have an alarm clock sik I can 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 set alarm at any time 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:32.189
 for example on can and no cut press 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.259
 and less time for example changed 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.600
 Well, or I want to turn off for example 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:46.340
 alarm clock i click on the background fell behind 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 that's how I see the start here to change so 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:59.180
 You've seen it change so 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:03.110
 the next function is stopwatch stop 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.360
 here she is now push start and the time has gone 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.360
 not this time yesterday I whom their fish 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.670
 collected according to the idea 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.500
 Stopwatch very good here at 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.860
 time has gone by 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.400
 we click on stop or we can click on 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.680
 rice that zero and pour cancel 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.280
 that is what so what to say well 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 strap he even you good at first 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.310
 He certainly when the clock is new 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.950
 they also need to be worn by themselves so that they 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.890
 were perfect for you that is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.120
 fit your hand strap he 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.050
 good enough here double well shorter 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.110
 double piece of iron we are the enemy shorter so 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.640
 Well at hand wear a little complicated 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:05.459
 By the way, the watch is waterproof 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:09.840
 show you well well now they are exactly 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.940
 waterproof it i assure you here 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.630
 still with the help of this thing we can 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.420
 change mechanical time they still 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.420
 bit thick and and but it even 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.989
 invisible in practice 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:30.209
 well I already bathed in this watch I washed them 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:33.530
 soap and everything is shorter so that he is like 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.720
 as if they were not killed clock 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.820
 the key to many more seems that this 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.660
 glass on the glass itself 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.070
 In fact, this is a normal rubberized 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.170
 glass well or maybe even say 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.739
 plastic well it's probably made for 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.210
 so that the moisture does not get inside 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:04:02.200
 watches themselves so that nothing rusted there 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:03.350
 zaglyuchila behind we see the name of the clock 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.080
 bench 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:11.770
 This is a firm and then you are shorter. 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.580
 something japan movt is written like no one 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.340
 well, everything is shorter 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.760
