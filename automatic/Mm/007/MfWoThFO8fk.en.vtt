on one side of the greenhouse to the
other<00:02:31.310> just<00:02:31.610> walked<00:02:32.120> right<00:02:32.299> over<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.690> because

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
other just walked right over it because

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.170 
other just walked right over it because
it<00:02:33.019> was<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.260> much<00:02:33.379> snow<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:34.760> year<00:02:34.819> was<00:02:35.150> just

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
when I'd be in the operation one year

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.539 
when I'd be in the operation one year
after<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.470> other<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:39.859> never<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.310> same

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
after the other it's never the same

that's always a challenge I get a lot of

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.050 
that's always a challenge I get a lot of
satisfaction<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:45.079> seeing<00:02:45.500> things<00:02:46.160> grow<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.579> I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
satisfaction in seeing things grow I I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.120 
satisfaction in seeing things grow I I
like<00:02:47.750> starting<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.260> seeds<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.769> watching

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
like starting the seeds and watching

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.470 
like starting the seeds and watching
them<00:02:49.250> germinate<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:49.819> watching<00:02:50.120> them<00:02:50.239> come<00:02:50.450> on

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
them germinate and watching them come on

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.270 
them germinate and watching them come on
it's<00:02:50.870> always<00:02:51.109> fascinating<00:02:51.889> to<00:02:51.920> me<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.040> don't

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
it's always fascinating to me I don't

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.800 
it's always fascinating to me I don't
think<00:02:52.310> I'll<00:02:52.459> ever<00:02:52.609> lose<00:02:52.880> my<00:02:54.280> fascination<00:02:55.280> with

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
think I'll ever lose my fascination with

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:08.039 
think I'll ever lose my fascination with
growing<00:02:56.810> things

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049
