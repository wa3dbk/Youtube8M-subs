00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and I think we've made them at least I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.000 
and I think we've made them at least I
hope<00:00:20.789> you've<00:00:20.970> made<00:00:21.180> them<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.600> scary<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.740> sort

of<00:00:23.070> malevolent<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.210> brilliant<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:24.990> they

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
of malevolent and brilliant as they

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.620 
of malevolent and brilliant as they
should<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.250> there's<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.240> things<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
should be in and there's all things that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.970 
should be in and there's all things that
you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.900> improve<00:00:28.199> when<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.439> make<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.740> show

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you can improve when you make this show

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.179 
you can improve when you make this show
and<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.310> think<00:00:29.910> having<00:00:30.269> come<00:00:30.689> coming<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:32.130> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and I think having come coming out of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.100 
and I think having come coming out of
having<00:00:32.520> made<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> Dalek<00:00:33.059> episode<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.630> perhaps

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
having made a Dalek episode that perhaps

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.750 
having made a Dalek episode that perhaps
on<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.620> design<00:00:34.920> front<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.250> didn't<00:00:35.460> quite<00:00:35.579> get

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
on the design front we didn't quite get

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.459 
on the design front we didn't quite get
right<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.600> think<00:00:37.140> we've<00:00:37.290> really

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
right I think I think we've really

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.740 
right I think I think we've really
landed<00:00:37.860> these<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:39.000> thrilled<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
landed these and I'm thrilled with it I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.060 
landed these and I'm thrilled with it I
mean<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.050> haven't<00:00:40.200> seen<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.590> its<00:00:40.710> entirety

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070

cinematic kind of feel and quite dark as

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
cinematic kind of feel and quite dark as
well<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.480> something<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
well is that something but you and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.410 
well is that something but you and
Steven<00:00:53.129> Moffat<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.550> executive<00:00:53.969> producer<00:00:54.300> &amp;

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
Steven Moffat the executive producer &amp;

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
Steven Moffat the executive producer &amp;
head<00:00:54.449> writer<00:00:54.590> wanted<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:55.920> towards<00:00:56.340> with

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
head writer wanted to go towards with

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.029 
head writer wanted to go towards with
this<00:00:56.550> series<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.090> motor<00:00:57.390> wider<00:00:57.930> feel<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.559> think

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
this series a motor wider feel I think

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.889 
this series a motor wider feel I think
so<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.520> i<00:00:59.550> mean<00:00:59.640> it's<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.390> kind<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so you know i mean it's it's kind of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.110 
so you know i mean it's it's kind of
being<00:01:01.170> billed<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> movie<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
being billed as as as a movie of the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.750 
being billed as as as a movie of the
week<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.600> each<00:01:03.899> each<00:01:04.439> week<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.670> i

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
week if each each week you know and i

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.109 
week if each each week you know and i
think<00:01:05.869> certainly<00:01:06.979> in<00:01:07.979> terms<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.790> style

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
think certainly in terms of the style

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.330 
think certainly in terms of the style
that<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.510> approach<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.320> camera<00:01:10.830> wise<00:01:11.010> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that we approach it a camera wise and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.789 
that we approach it a camera wise and
the<00:01:11.580> way<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.939> shoot<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.680> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the way we shoot it and the way it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.149 
the way we shoot it and the way it's
written<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.729> where<00:01:15.720> i<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.200> i<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:17.070> on

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
written it it's where i but i think on

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
written it it's where i but i think on
it<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.880> broader<00:01:18.119> sense<00:01:18.210> most<00:01:18.720> TV<00:01:19.200> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it on in a broader sense most TV is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.370 
it on in a broader sense most TV is
moving<00:01:19.830> towards<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.340> more<00:01:20.630> cinematic<00:01:21.630> style

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
moving towards a more cinematic style

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.859 
moving towards a more cinematic style
anyway<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.220> um<00:01:23.369> absolutely<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:24.420> Doctor<00:01:24.720> Who

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
anyway but um absolutely with Doctor Who

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.359 
anyway but um absolutely with Doctor Who
I<00:01:25.049> think<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> elements<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
I think all the elements are there to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.840 
I think all the elements are there to
make<00:01:26.520> things<00:01:26.880> much<00:01:27.119> more<00:01:28.220> cinematic<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.640> um

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
make things much more cinematic so um

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.760 
make things much more cinematic so um
you<00:01:30.509> know<00:01:30.630> that's<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.259> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> where<00:01:31.740> our

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you know that's that's kind of where our

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770 
you know that's that's kind of where our
tastes<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
tastes like I think out there with the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.450 
tastes like I think out there with the
public<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> internet<00:01:34.770> doctor<00:01:35.340> who

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
public and on the internet doctor who

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.760 
public and on the internet doctor who
it's<00:01:35.880> probably<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.960> most<00:01:37.170> analyzed

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it's probably one of the most analyzed

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's probably one of the most analyzed
