aftermarket two microphones setups so

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:34.000 
aftermarket two microphones setups so
for<00:00:29.429> example<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.880> can<00:00:30.179> use<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:31.250> a50<00:00:32.250> Astro

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010

headsets with the xbox one but the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.170 
headsets with the xbox one but the
problem<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.680> cannot<00:00:40.950> use<00:00:41.280> your

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180

mic so in order to use your mic you need

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.100 
mic so in order to use your mic you need
a<00:00:48.030> special<00:00:48.920> adapter<00:00:50.180> inside<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.780> piece

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
because you have a mic and you can

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.720 
because you have a mic and you can
communicate<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.599> your<00:02:27.720> teammates<00:02:28.140> as

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
communicate with your teammates as

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.600 
communicate with your teammates as
before<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.750> xbox<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.530> none<00:02:32.459> of<00:02:32.489> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
before in the xbox one you none of the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.479 
before in the xbox one you none of the
mics<00:02:32.819> work<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.430> older<00:02:36.799> headsets<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
mics work with the older headsets and I

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.210 
mics work with the older headsets and I
think<00:02:38.730> most<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.180> his<00:02:39.420> female<00:02:40.200> inputs<00:02:40.709> work
