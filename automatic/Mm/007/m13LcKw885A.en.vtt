we're seeing it a lot in clothing right
now<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.570> think<00:02:38.140> there<00:02:38.290> was<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.440> few<00:02:38.769> dresses<00:02:39.070> at

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
now I think there was a few dresses at

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.940 
now I think there was a few dresses at
the<00:02:39.640> Oscars<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.510> were<00:02:40.660> kind<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.230> black

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
the Oscars that were kind of the black

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.759 
the Oscars that were kind of the black
and<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> blush<00:02:42.610> together<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:44.500> know<00:02:44.620> the

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
and the blush together and you know the

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.610 
and the blush together and you know the
vintage<00:02:45.100> pearls<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:46.150> kind<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.600> going<00:02:46.959> back<00:02:47.170> to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
vintage pearls and kind of going back to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.710 
vintage pearls and kind of going back to
the<00:02:47.739> classic<00:02:48.280> look

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.300 

so<00:02:56.720> something<00:02:57.050> that<00:02:57.200> we're<00:02:57.319> seeing<00:02:57.560> now<00:02:57.770> is

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
so something that we're seeing now is

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.570 
so something that we're seeing now is
less<00:02:59.120> chair<00:02:59.450> covers<00:02:59.840> bringing<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.709> different
