00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950

so Denver bar actually played really

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.320 
so Denver bar actually played really
well<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.500> me<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:16.799> first<00:01:17.100> four<00:01:17.909> games<00:01:18.150> i

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
well for me in my first four games i

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
well for me in my first four games i
think<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:18.869> ended<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.080> getting<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.470> goals

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
think it was he ended up getting a goals

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.590 
think it was he ended up getting a goals
he<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.040> averaging<00:01:20.159> two<00:01:20.670> again<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.240> did<00:01:21.420> slow

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
he was averaging two again that did slow

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.880 
he was averaging two again that did slow
down<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.170> i<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.320> i<00:01:22.619> ended<00:01:22.830> up

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
down a little bit i think i ended up

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.219 
down a little bit i think i ended up
with<00:01:23.070> ten<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.430> 60<00:01:23.939> still<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.390> very<00:01:24.810> very<00:01:25.049> good

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
struggle I was going through every time

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.010 
struggle I was going through every time
I<00:01:38.280> was<00:01:38.460> having<00:01:38.579> chances<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.780> wouldn't

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
I was having chances they just wouldn't

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.390 
I was having chances they just wouldn't
go<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.710> there<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> magnet

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
go in it was like there was a magnet

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.920 
go in it was like there was a magnet
stopping<00:01:41.880> me<00:01:41.970> from<00:01:42.000> scoring<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> was<00:01:42.689> so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
stopping me from scoring it was so

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.899 
stopping me from scoring it was so
ridiculous<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.920> getting<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.790> many

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
ridiculous I was just getting so many

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.520 
ridiculous I was just getting so many
chances<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.930> could<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.200> school<00:01:46.470> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
chances and I just could not school I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.870 
chances and I just could not school I
don't<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> went

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
don't know what was going on so I went

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.850 
don't know what was going on so I went
free<00:01:48.119> games<00:01:48.390> without<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> single<00:01:49.350> girlfriend

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
free games without a single girlfriend

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.410 
free games without a single girlfriend
and<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.399> ended<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.670> free<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.119> six

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and I think I ended up with free and six

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
and I think I ended up with free and six
so<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.630> got<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.320> each<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> free<00:01:53.220> games

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
so I got one in each of the free games

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
so I got one in each of the free games
after<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.560> really

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
after that so I was really really

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.289 
after that so I was really really
struggling<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.640> goals<00:01:56.850> room<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> as

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
struggling to get goals room and as

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.370 
struggling to get goals room and as
you'll<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:58.020> end<00:01:58.259> up

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you'll see here I actually end up

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780 
you'll see here I actually end up
including<00:01:58.829> I'm<00:01:59.009> not<00:01:59.130> sure<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.610> one

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
but just clips of me just some chances

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
but just clips of me just some chances
where<00:02:01.979> normally<00:02:02.310> you'd<00:02:02.430> kind<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.790> expect<00:02:03.240> him

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
where normally you'd kind of expect him

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.630 
where normally you'd kind of expect him
to<00:02:03.540> school<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.979> couldn't<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.369> like

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
wouldn't go in and I at first I thought

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.070 
wouldn't go in and I at first I thought
it<00:02:20.850> must<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.210> my<00:02:21.390> play<00:02:21.600> styles<00:02:21.960> not

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
it must just be my play styles not

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.930 
it must just be my play styles not
suited<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.770> Soldado<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.460> when<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.700> look<00:02:23.820> at

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.430 
the two players so I couldn't work out
what<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.390> difference<00:02:45.720> was<00:02:45.810> between<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.290> two

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
what the difference was between the two

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.380 
what the difference was between the two
players<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.040> everything<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.270> same

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
players and everything is just the same

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.510 
players and everything is just the same
about<00:02:48.720> them<00:02:49.020> both<00:02:49.530> got<00:02:49.740> medium<00:02:49.920> medium<00:02:50.370> were

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
about them both got medium medium were

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.040 
about them both got medium medium were

demo<00:02:55.050> bar<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> tad<00:02:55.710> taller<00:02:55.890> which<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.310> think

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
demo bar is a tad taller which I think

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.890 
demo bar is a tad taller which I think
actually<00:02:56.760> may<00:02:57.240> have<00:02:57.270> made<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> big<00:02:57.720> difference

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
actually may have made a big difference

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.690 
actually may have made a big difference
because<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.290> was<00:02:58.500> concentrating<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:59.280> going

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
because I was concentrating on going

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.160 
because I was concentrating on going
wide<00:02:59.940> quite<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> bit<00:03:00.480> they<00:03:00.690> didn't<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:01.050> too

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
wide quite a bit they didn't have too

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.480 
wide quite a bit they didn't have too
much<00:03:01.290> pace<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.800> could<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.130> been<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.310> but

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
much pace that could have been it but

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.850 
much pace that could have been it but
