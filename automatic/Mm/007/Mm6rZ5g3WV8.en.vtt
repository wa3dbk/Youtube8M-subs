I<00:00:14.100> have<00:00:14.400> no<00:00:14.760> in<00:00:15.090> the<00:00:15.240> foreseeable<00:00:15.570> future

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
I have no in the foreseeable future

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.460 
I have no in the foreseeable future
classes<00:00:16.949> projects<00:00:17.699> or<00:00:18.020> really<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.320> know

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
classes projects or really you know

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.130 
classes projects or really you know
other<00:00:19.770> than<00:00:19.950> work<00:00:20.250> things<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.990> do

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
other than work things that I have to do

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.120 
other than work things that I have to do
so<00:00:22.860> in<00:00:23.670> my<00:00:23.840> mind<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.289> means<00:00:25.530> YouTube<00:00:25.860> videos

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
so in my mind that means YouTube videos

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.410 
so in my mind that means YouTube videos
should<00:00:26.280> be<00:00:26.400> coming<00:00:26.670> out<00:00:26.760> pretty<00:00:27.000> regularly

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
should be coming out pretty regularly

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.170 
should be coming out pretty regularly
and<00:00:27.780> I'm<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.800> saying<00:00:29.070> when<00:00:29.310> or<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.610> and<00:00:30.090> all

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
and I'm not saying when or if and all

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.029 
and I'm not saying when or if and all
that<00:00:30.420> because<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.140> always<00:00:31.320> know<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.740> me<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039

they're<00:01:30.090> both<00:01:30.179> 16<00:01:30.509> gigabytes<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.499> I<00:01:31.709> thought

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
they're both 16 gigabytes and I thought

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.190 
they're both 16 gigabytes and I thought
I<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.429> do<00:01:32.609> the<00:01:32.759> unboxing<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:33.569> the<00:01:34.049> black

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.379 
me give you a few of my quick thoughts
on<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:56.780> iPhone<00:03:57.079> 4s<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:58.430> really<00:03:58.790> notice<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.239> in

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
on the iPhone 4s you really notice it in

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.879 
on the iPhone 4s you really notice it in
the<00:03:59.480> little<00:03:59.659> things<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.139> you<00:04:00.260> have<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.590> four

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
the little things if you have the four

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.460 
the little things if you have the four
and<00:04:01.129> you're<00:04:01.549> debating<00:04:01.700> upgrading<00:04:02.480> or<00:04:02.599> not<00:04:02.720> in

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
and you're debating upgrading or not in

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.149 
and you're debating upgrading or not in
my<00:04:03.709> opinion

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
my opinion

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.770 
my opinion
it's<00:04:04.340> definitely<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.730> worthy<00:04:04.970> upgrade<00:04:05.209> the

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
it's definitely a worthy upgrade the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.589 
it's definitely a worthy upgrade the
cameras<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:06.260> lot<00:04:06.500> better<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:07.069> you<00:04:08.000> notice<00:04:08.419> the

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
cameras a lot better and you notice the

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.420 
cameras a lot better and you notice the
speed<00:04:08.900> difference<00:04:09.230> in<00:04:09.409> the<00:04:09.500> little<00:04:09.769> things<00:04:09.980> if

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
speed difference in the little things if

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.670 
speed difference in the little things if
you<00:04:10.549> have<00:04:10.579> a<00:04:10.700> 3GS<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.389> highly<00:04:11.900> recommend<00:04:12.379> it<00:04:12.530> I

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
you have a 3GS I highly recommend it I

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.039 
you have a 3GS I highly recommend it I
mean<00:04:13.220> now<00:04:13.699> with<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.209> being<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.900> holiday

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
mean now with it being the holiday

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.750 
mean now with it being the holiday
season<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:15.709> getting<00:04:15.859> closer<00:04:16.159> to<00:04:16.489> taking<00:04:16.699> over

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
season and getting closer to taking over

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.569 
season and getting closer to taking over
the<00:04:17.239> recycle<00:04:17.780> it's<00:04:18.409> still<00:04:18.620> pretty<00:04:18.889> far<00:04:19.220> but<00:04:19.459> if

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
the recycle it's still pretty far but if

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.430 
the recycle it's still pretty far but if
you<00:04:19.669> think<00:04:19.849> about<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.659> think<00:04:21.049> it's<00:04:21.320> worth

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
you think about it so I think it's worth

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.810 
you think about it so I think it's worth
updating<00:04:23.260> but<00:04:24.260> yeah<00:04:24.409> this<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.520> iPhone

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820

you<00:04:28.909> guys<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.180> first<00:04:29.330> boot<00:04:29.599> I<00:04:29.840> got<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.800> Apple

you guys the first boot I got the Apple
logo<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.550> guess<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:31.880> works<00:04:32.060> that's<00:04:32.270> good<00:04:32.539> always

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
logo I guess it works that's good always

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.950 
logo I guess it works that's good always
a<00:04:33.500> plus<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.550> while<00:04:34.699> this<00:04:34.849> is<00:04:34.909> booting<00:04:35.330> up<00:04:35.419> I<00:04:35.690> can

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
a plus so while this is booting up I can

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.450 
a plus so while this is booting up I can
kind<00:04:36.349> of<00:04:36.409> keep<00:04:36.560> talking<00:04:36.979> about<00:04:37.190> it

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
kind of keep talking about it

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.990 
kind of keep talking about it
