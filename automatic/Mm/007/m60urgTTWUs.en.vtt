to the second part of this I get my
pattern<00:00:39.770> here<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:41.120> red<00:00:41.329> areas<00:00:41.690> are<00:00:41.870> where<00:00:42.020> I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
pattern here the red areas are where I

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.580 
pattern here the red areas are where I
would<00:00:42.320> saw<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.130> I<00:00:43.940> put<00:00:44.210> my<00:00:44.360> glue<00:00:45.110> stick<00:00:45.140> on<00:00:45.500> the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
would saw and I put my glue stick on the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.440 
would saw and I put my glue stick on the
back<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.340> all<00:00:46.850> over<00:00:46.970> my<00:00:47.210> fingers<00:00:49.030> back<00:00:50.030> off<00:00:50.210> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.040 
do this sometimes too I'm doing
production<00:00:52.489> stuff<00:00:52.790> just<00:00:53.390> slap<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:53.809> all

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
production stuff just slap it all

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.810 
production stuff just slap it all
together<00:00:54.200> in<00:00:54.530> one<00:00:54.559> package<00:00:54.980> like<00:00:55.430> that<00:00:57.579> okay

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
together in one package like that okay

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.030 
together in one package like that okay
so<00:00:59.300> put<00:00:59.690> this<00:00:59.840> back<00:01:00.110> together<00:01:00.290> again<00:01:00.649> I'm

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
so put this back together again I'm

so put this back together again I'm
gonna<00:01:01.190> go<00:01:01.399> with<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.969> sameness

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
gonna go with the sameness

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.090 
gonna go with the sameness
or<00:01:04.820> symmetry<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.600> way<00:01:06.079> all<00:01:06.740> right<00:01:06.920> so

saw I'm not sewing anything else just
these<00:01:32.630> red<00:01:32.899> areas<00:01:33.349> if<00:01:33.499> I<00:01:33.619> saw<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:34.009> whole

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
these red areas if I saw this whole

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:35.379 
these red areas if I saw this whole
thing<00:01:34.459> out<00:01:34.609> there<00:01:34.789> would<00:01:34.909> be<00:01:34.939> nothing<00:01:35.209> left

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:35.389 
thing out there would be nothing left

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:38.260 
thing out there would be nothing left
for<00:01:36.380> structural<00:01:37.039> integrity<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:37.969> when<00:01:38.149> you

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
for structural integrity so when you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.209 
for structural integrity so when you
choose<00:01:38.539> your<00:01:38.569> pattern<00:01:38.929> make<00:01:39.709> sure<00:01:39.950> that<00:01:40.069> you

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
choose your pattern make sure that you

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.489 
choose your pattern make sure that you

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
choose a not too busy a pattern because

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:43.870 
choose a not too busy a pattern because
the<00:01:42.529> metal<00:01:42.799> if<00:01:43.069> you<00:01:43.189> cut<00:01:43.399> all<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:43.670> out

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
the metal if you cut all this out

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.519 
the metal if you cut all this out
there's<00:01:44.509> no<00:01:44.689> metal<00:01:44.869> holding<00:01:45.319> anything

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:45.529 
there's no metal holding anything

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:47.529 
there's no metal holding anything
together<00:01:45.709> you're<00:01:46.009> gonna<00:01:46.069> have<00:01:46.249> a<00:01:46.279> hole<00:01:46.539> so

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
together you're gonna have a hole so

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.269 
together you're gonna have a hole so
choose<00:01:47.899> Rin<00:01:48.229> if<00:01:48.409> you're<00:01:48.529> going<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.709> use<00:01:48.919> some<00:01:49.130> a

there's a way to fix it I'm hoping I can

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.160 
there's a way to fix it I'm hoping I can
replicate<00:06:04.590> that<00:06:04.920> okay<00:06:05.520> here<00:06:05.790> we<00:06:05.880> go<00:06:05.910> so<00:06:06.870> what

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
replicate that okay here we go so what

replicate that okay here we go so what
you<00:06:07.290> do<00:06:07.410> is<00:06:07.620> you<00:06:07.740> pick<00:06:07.950> it<00:06:08.070> up<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.370> let<00:06:08.750> let<00:06:09.750> the

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
you do is you pick it up and let let the

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.930 
you do is you pick it up and let let the
blade<00:06:10.200> tell<00:06:10.860> you<00:06:11.040> where<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:11.460> supposed<00:06:11.700> to<00:06:11.790> be

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
blade tell you where it's supposed to be

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.400 
blade tell you where it's supposed to be
because<00:06:12.090> sometimes<00:06:12.480> it'll<00:06:12.720> be<00:06:12.840> twisted<00:06:13.260> like

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
because sometimes it'll be twisted like

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.980 
because sometimes it'll be twisted like
this<00:06:13.620> and<00:06:14.100> if<00:06:14.820> you<00:06:14.940> just<00:06:15.120> let<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.390> blade<00:06:15.570> find

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
this and if you just let the blade find

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.200 
this and if you just let the blade find
its<00:06:16.200> center<00:06:16.410> you<00:06:17.310> should<00:06:17.610> be<00:06:17.760> able<00:06:17.820> to<00:06:17.970> clean

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
its center you should be able to clean

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.130 
its center you should be able to clean
it<00:06:18.360> up<00:06:18.510> again

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
it up again

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.590 
it up again
get<00:06:19.470> it<00:06:19.590> straight<00:06:19.920> back<00:06:20.130> on<00:06:20.340> time<00:06:20.610> I<00:06:21.030> know<00:06:21.450> it

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
get it straight back on time I know it

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.740 
get it straight back on time I know it
sounds<00:06:22.050> goofy<00:06:22.320> but<00:06:22.820> you'll<00:06:23.820> ask<00:06:24.240> Ann<00:06:24.570> where

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
sounds goofy but you'll ask Ann where

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.600 
sounds goofy but you'll ask Ann where
you<00:06:24.840> saw<00:06:25.140> the<00:06:25.200> more<00:06:25.650> it'll<00:06:25.860> happen<00:06:26.070> to<00:06:26.250> you<00:06:26.400> and

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
you saw the more it'll happen to you and
