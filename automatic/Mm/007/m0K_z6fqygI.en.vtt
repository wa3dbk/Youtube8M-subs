00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.070 

this<00:00:01.500> question<00:00:01.949> has<00:00:02.100> two<00:00:02.520> fairly<00:00:03.149> fiddly<00:00:03.750> sir

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
this question has two fairly fiddly sir

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.099 
this question has two fairly fiddly sir
questions<00:00:04.640> but<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.730> first<00:00:05.970> part<00:00:06.270> asks<00:00:06.600> us<00:00:07.080> to

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
questions but the first part asks us to

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.030 
questions but the first part asks us to
simplify<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:08.099> fraction<00:00:08.510> involve<00:00:09.510> sets<00:00:10.040> now

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
simplify a fraction involve sets now

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.060 
simplify a fraction involve sets now
then<00:00:11.280> root<00:00:11.910> six<00:00:12.269> cubed<00:00:12.750> just<00:00:13.049> means<00:00:13.469> root<00:00:13.769> 6

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
then root six cubed just means root 6

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.220 
then root six cubed just means root 6
times<00:00:14.580> root<00:00:14.759> 6<00:00:15.179> times<00:00:15.570> root<00:00:15.780> 6

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
times root 6 times root 6

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.529 
times root 6 times root 6
now<00:00:17.039> root<00:00:17.520> 6<00:00:17.940> times<00:00:18.570> root<00:00:18.930> 6<00:00:19.439> times<00:00:19.770> root<00:00:20.039> 6<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
now root 6 times root 6 times root 6 the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.640 
now root 6 times root 6 times root 6 the
first<00:00:22.080> two<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:23.010> people<00:00:23.400> 6<00:00:23.779> that's<00:00:24.779> T<00:00:25.050> equals<00:00:25.289> 6

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
first two was people 6 that's T equals 6

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.290 
first two was people 6 that's T equals 6
root<00:00:26.250> 6

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
root 6

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.970 
root 6
now<00:00:28.230> root<00:00:28.500> 24<00:00:29.359> can<00:00:30.359> also<00:00:30.720> made<00:00:30.960> simpler<00:00:31.439> it's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
now root 24 can also made simpler it's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.240 
now root 24 can also made simpler it's
got<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> square<00:00:32.460> factor<00:00:33.469> in<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.590> case<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.190> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
got a square factor in this case it is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.299 
got a square factor in this case it is
root<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.180> 4<00:00:36.870> times<00:00:37.410> 6

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
root of 4 times 6

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
root of 4 times 6
now<00:00:39.149> root<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.480> 4<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> 2<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.280> 2<00:00:41.420> root<00:00:42.420> 6

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
now root of 4 is 2 so it's 2 root 6

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
now root of 4 is 2 so it's 2 root 6
so<00:00:43.890> therefore<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.820> moving<00:00:45.239> us<00:00:45.420> 10<00:00:46.410> lots<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.430> 6

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so therefore this moving us 10 lots of 6

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.209 
so therefore this moving us 10 lots of 6
u<00:00:49.020> 6<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:50.219> over<00:00:50.700> 2<00:00:51.770> root<00:00:52.770> 6<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:55.230> root<00:00:55.410> 6<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.890> Bo

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
u 6 all over 2 root 6 the root 6 is Bo

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.170 
u 6 all over 2 root 6 the root 6 is Bo
cancel<00:00:56.699> off<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.649> 10<00:00:58.890> times<00:00:59.219> 6<00:00:59.550> over<00:00:59.760> 2

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
cancel off so it's 10 times 6 over 2

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
cancel off so it's 10 times 6 over 2
which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.170> 16<00:01:01.559> over<00:01:02.370> 2<00:01:02.609> which<00:01:03.449> equals<00:01:03.710> 30<00:01:06.890> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
which is 16 over 2 which equals 30 so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.130 
which is 16 over 2 which equals 30 so
the<00:01:07.950> final<00:01:08.220> answer<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.880> an<00:01:09.180> integer<00:01:12.080> now<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the final answer is an integer now the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.399 
the final answer is an integer now the
second<00:01:13.560> part<00:01:13.740> asks<00:01:14.640> us<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:14.970> add<00:01:15.299> together<00:01:15.540> two

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
second part asks us to add together two

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.990 
second part asks us to add together two
fractions<00:01:16.890> involving<00:01:17.490> surd's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
fractions involving surd's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.359 
fractions involving surd's
now<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> method<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.439> always<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> put

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
now the method as always is to put

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.469 
now the method as always is to put
brackets<00:01:20.610> around<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:25.080> fractions<00:01:26.330> we<00:01:27.330> then

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
brackets around the fractions we then

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.569 
brackets around the fractions we then
welcome<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> share<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.710> denominator

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
welcome to share the same denominator

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.210 
welcome to share the same denominator
so<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.270> fraction<00:01:30.509> requires<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> 4<00:01:31.439> plus<00:01:31.979> root

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
so this fraction requires a 4 plus root

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.760 
so this fraction requires a 4 plus root
5<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.270> put<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> bottom<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.380> we'll<00:01:34.560> step

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
5 which I put the bottom and we'll step

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.670 
5 which I put the bottom and we'll step
we'll<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> same<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> top<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:37.470> one

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
we'll do the same on the top this one

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.749 
we'll do the same on the top this one
equals<00:01:38.159> 4<00:01:38.540> minus<00:01:39.540> root<00:01:40.110> 5<00:01:40.220> I'm<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.369> step<00:01:41.579> into

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
equals 4 minus root 5 I'm a step into

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.230 
equals 4 minus root 5 I'm a step into
the<00:01:41.850> same<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> top<00:01:43.670> they<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:44.850> share<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the same on the top they now share the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.749 
the same on the top they now share the
same<00:01:45.600> denominator

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
same denominator

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.490 
same denominator
now<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:47.939> 4<00:01:48.540> times<00:01:48.780> 4<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.110> 16<00:01:51.020> root<00:01:52.020> 5<00:01:52.290> times

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
now then 4 times 4 is 16 root 5 times

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.910 
now then 4 times 4 is 16 root 5 times
root<00:01:52.680> 5<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.070> 5<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.729> negative<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:55.710> other

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
root 5 is 5 with a negative the other

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.569 
root 5 is 5 with a negative the other
two<00:01:56.189> powers<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:57.270> cancel<00:01:57.780> off<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:59.100> bottoms

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
two powers will cancel off the bottoms

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.139 
two powers will cancel off the bottoms
becomes<00:01:59.909> 16<00:02:00.570> take<00:02:00.719> away<00:02:00.899> 5<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.640> then<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.969> top

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
becomes 16 take away 5 and then the top

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.980 
becomes 16 take away 5 and then the top
is<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.329> 4<00:02:03.810> plus<00:02:04.649> root<00:02:04.890> 5<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.600> similar<00:02:06.960> way

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
is just 4 plus root 5 in a similar way

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.130 
is just 4 plus root 5 in a similar way
the<00:02:07.439> second<00:02:08.190> fraction<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:08.849> become<00:02:09.179> 4<00:02:09.660> minus

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the second fraction would become 4 minus

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.190 
the second fraction would become 4 minus
root<00:02:10.319> 5

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
root 5

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.920 
root 5
all<00:02:12.200> over<00:02:12.560> again<00:02:13.310> 16<00:02:14.000> take<00:02:14.630> away<00:02:14.900> 5<00:02:16.180> now<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.360> 4

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
all over again 16 take away 5 now then 4

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.250 
all over again 16 take away 5 now then 4
plus<00:02:17.959> 4<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.500> 8<00:02:18.910> root<00:02:19.910> 5<00:02:20.239> take<00:02:20.720> we're<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.020> five

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
plus 4 is 8 root 5 take we're in five

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.850 
plus 4 is 8 root 5 take we're in five
capsules<00:02:21.770> off<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.250> then<00:02:23.209> 16<00:02:24.020> minus<00:02:24.260> 5<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.650> 11

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
capsules off and then 16 minus 5 is 11

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.670 
capsules off and then 16 minus 5 is 11
the<00:02:25.700> answer<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.060> therefore<00:02:26.480> 8<00:02:26.800> over<00:02:27.800> 11
