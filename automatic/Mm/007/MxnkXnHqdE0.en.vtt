the<00:02:04.829> top<00:02:04.860> five<00:02:05.490> tweaks<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.240> time<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.689> my

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the top five tweaks of all time in my

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.479 
the top five tweaks of all time in my
opinion<00:02:06.930> if<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.710> want<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> delete<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.369> of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
opinion if you want to delete all of

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.889 
opinion if you want to delete all of
them<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.729> hold<00:02:09.119> them<00:02:09.239> down<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.720> there

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
them you just hold them down and there

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.870 
them you just hold them down and there
you<00:02:09.989> go

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
you go

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.820 
you go
and<00:02:11.000> they're<00:02:11.660> all<00:02:11.780> gone<00:02:11.960> just<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.410> and

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
and they're all gone just like that and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.250 
and they're all gone just like that and
so<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.550> really<00:02:14.090> really<00:02:14.300> like<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.110> go

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
so I really really like it and if you go

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.920 
so I really really like it and if you go

into settings you can customize oxxo

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.650 
into settings you can customize oxxo
these<00:02:18.200> certain<00:02:18.620> toggles<00:02:19.130> where<00:02:20.060> they<00:02:20.210> go<00:02:20.420> as

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
these certain toggles where they go as

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.030 
these certain toggles where they go as

really think oxxo is a great week and it
really<00:02:32.240> looks<00:02:32.480> nice<00:02:32.660> on<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.020> taller<00:02:33.290> screen

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
really looks nice on the taller screen

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.920 
really looks nice on the taller screen
such<00:02:34.010> as<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.250> ipod<00:02:34.670> touch<00:02:34.700> 5th<00:02:35.210> generation<00:02:35.420> or

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
such as the ipod touch 5th generation or

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.530 
such as the ipod touch 5th generation or
the<00:02:36.350> iphone<00:02:36.680> 5<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.760> next<00:02:37.790> week<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.360> called

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the iphone 5 so the next week is called

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.690 
the iphone 5 so the next week is called
barrel<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.320> this<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.800> three<00:02:40.130> dollars<00:02:40.520> and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
barrel and this is three dollars and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.400 
barrel and this is three dollars and
it's<00:02:40.820> from<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.000> bigboss<00:02:41.360> repo<00:02:41.540> i'm<00:02:42.140> guessing

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
it's from the bigboss repo i'm guessing

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.540 
it's from the bigboss repo i'm guessing
pretty<00:02:42.770> much<00:02:42.890> all<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.130> you've<00:02:43.310> heard<00:02:43.460> about

to the jailbreak community this is what
it<00:02:46.850> does<00:02:47.060> here<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.660> got<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.900> settings<00:02:48.230> for

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
barrel and you got all these different

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.490 
barrel and you got all these different
effects<00:02:50.330> right<00:02:50.540> here<00:02:50.780> I'm<00:02:50.990> just<00:02:51.050> going<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.350> use

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
effects right here I'm just going to use

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.430 
effects right here I'm just going to use
cube<00:02:51.950> inside<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.940> basically<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.810> changes<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
cube inside and basically it changes the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.290 
cube inside and basically it changes the
transitions<00:02:55.070> when<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.370> move<00:02:55.700> between<00:02:55.970> the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
transitions when you move between the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.390 
transitions when you move between the
pages<00:02:56.480> on<00:02:56.870> your<00:02:56.930> home<00:02:57.560> screen<00:02:57.590> as<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.070> can<00:02:58.220> see

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
pages on your home screen as you can see

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.100 
pages on your home screen as you can see
that's<00:02:58.610> like<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> cube<00:02:59.210> and<00:02:59.360> its<00:02:59.480> really<00:02:59.870> really

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
that's like a cube and its really really

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.840 
that's like a cube and its really really
awesome<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.740> make<00:03:00.860> sure<00:03:00.980> our<00:03:01.010> device<00:03:01.580> look

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
awesome and make sure our device look

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.090 
awesome and make sure our device look
ten<00:03:02.150> times<00:03:02.180> better<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.050> if<00:03:03.710> we<00:03:03.800> head<00:03:03.950> into

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
ten times better and if we head into

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.440 
ten times better and if we head into
barrel<00:03:04.430> as<00:03:04.550> you<00:03:04.640> can<00:03:04.730> see<00:03:04.880> they<00:03:04.970> got<00:03:05.000> all<00:03:05.300> those

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
barrel as you can see they got all those

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.290 
barrel as you can see they got all those
other<00:03:05.660> transitions<00:03:06.320> there<00:03:06.560> we<00:03:07.460> also<00:03:07.610> got<00:03:07.880> cube

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
other transitions there we also got cube

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.170 
other transitions there we also got cube
outside<00:03:09.160> which<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.400> one<00:03:10.550> looks<00:03:10.730> really<00:03:11.030> nice

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
outside which that one looks really nice

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.020 
outside which that one looks really nice
too<00:03:11.480> as<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:11.780> can<00:03:11.900> see<00:03:12.110> when<00:03:12.740> you<00:03:12.770> change<00:03:13.130> pages

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
too as you can see when you change pages

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.120 
too as you can see when you change pages
it's<00:03:14.780> like<00:03:14.990> outside<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.620> cube<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.070> I'll

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
it's like outside of a cube and I'll

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.470 
it's like outside of a cube and I'll
just<00:03:16.280> show<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.460> one<00:03:16.730> more<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:17.150> one's<00:03:17.360> called

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
just show you one more this one's called

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.360 
just show you one more this one's called
page<00:03:17.870> zoom<00:03:18.440> this<00:03:18.770> is<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:18.980> one<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.280> I

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
page zoom this is the one that I

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.070 
page zoom this is the one that I
typically<00:03:19.790> like<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.120> show<00:03:20.420> people<00:03:20.750> at<00:03:20.870> school

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
can change the order that all the

actually<00:04:40.120> what<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.660> think<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.200> best<00:04:41.350> part

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
actually what I think is the best part

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.870 
actually what I think is the best part
of<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.710> tweak<00:04:41.950> is<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.280> fact<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.700> can

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
of the tweak is the fact that you can

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.360 
of the tweak is the fact that you can
put<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.120> on<00:04:43.210> your<00:04:43.270> lock<00:04:43.630> screen<00:04:43.710> yes<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:44.950> used<00:04:45.010> to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
do this for quite a long time I would

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.480 
do this for quite a long time I would
have<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:47.620> every<00:04:47.830> single<00:04:48.070> time<00:04:48.190> I<00:04:48.220> went<00:04:48.370> to

my<00:04:48.580> lock<00:04:48.790> screen<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:49.270> would<00:04:49.450> see<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.020> as<00:04:50.350> you

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470
