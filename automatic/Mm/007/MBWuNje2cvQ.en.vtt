you<00:02:33.430> there's<00:02:33.610> probably<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.120> scope<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.599> about<00:02:34.810> 10

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
you there's probably a scope of about 10

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.270 
you there's probably a scope of about 10
choices<00:02:35.290> they<00:02:35.590> could<00:02:35.799> have<00:02:35.890> made<00:02:36.040> where<00:02:36.250> I

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
choices they could have made where I

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.460
