00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.469 
into little subgroups it's a good habit
to<00:05:09.159> get<00:05:09.339> into<00:05:09.610> little<00:05:09.759> pieces<00:05:09.969> and<00:05:10.209> just

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
to get into little pieces and just

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.989 
to get into little pieces and just
repeat<00:05:10.779> it<00:05:10.809> like<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.050> loop<00:05:11.379> and<00:05:12.039> then<00:05:12.429> go<00:05:12.849> to<00:05:12.909> the

repeat it like a loop and then go to the
next<00:05:13.239> one<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.479> do<00:05:13.599> that<00:05:13.749> and<00:05:14.019> then<00:05:14.409> connect

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
next one and do that and then connect

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.769 
next one and do that and then connect
the<00:05:14.919> first<00:05:15.159> subgroup<00:05:15.729> with<00:05:16.059> the<00:05:16.179> second<00:05:16.599> and

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
the first subgroup with the second and

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.570 
the first subgroup with the second and
build<00:05:17.289> off<00:05:17.469> it<00:05:17.619> that<00:05:17.800> way<00:05:17.919> that<00:05:18.069> we<00:05:18.189> can<00:05:18.369> fine

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
build off it that way that we can fine

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.679 
build off it that way that we can fine
tune<00:05:18.610> everything<00:05:19.089> it<00:05:19.360> won't<00:05:19.479> seem
