just do something quick and easy show

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.959 
just do something quick and easy show
you<00:00:13.380> exactly<00:00:13.679> how<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.160> from<00:00:14.490> download

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
you exactly how to do it from download

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.800 
you exactly how to do it from download
to<00:00:15.240> playing<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.789> so<00:00:17.789> when<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.330> download<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
to playing it so when you download a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.929 
to playing it so when you download a
world<00:00:19.080> filed<00:00:19.380> whether<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.920> mine<00:00:20.220> or<00:00:20.250> someone

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
world filed whether it's mine or someone

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.349 
world filed whether it's mine or someone
else's<00:00:21.330> you'll<00:00:21.630> usually<00:00:21.990> be<00:00:22.289> in<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.519> archive

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
else's you'll usually be in a archive

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
else's you'll usually be in a archive
like<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.350> an<00:00:25.470> AR<00:00:25.650> AR<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.310> basically

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
like this this is an AR AR but basically

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.130 
like this this is an AR AR but basically
you<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.510> because<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.840> cannot

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
you have to do this because you cannot

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.169 
you have to do this because you cannot
upload<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.680> folder<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.910> upload

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
upload a folder you have to upload

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.470 
upload a folder you have to upload
something<00:00:31.170> compressed<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.700> usually<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.360> in

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
something compressed so usually be in

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.860 
something compressed so usually be in
this<00:00:33.570> format<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.590> an<00:00:34.680> example<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
this format this is just an example and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.900 
this format this is just an example and
we'll<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:37.020> right<00:00:37.140> into<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> step<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.700> would

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
we'll get right into it step one would

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.350 
we'll get right into it step one would
be<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.090> open<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.170> up<00:00:40.460> now<00:00:41.460> depending<00:00:42.030> who<00:00:42.149> made

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
be to open it up now depending who made

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
be to open it up now depending who made
it<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.809> might<00:00:43.079> see<00:00:43.320> some<00:00:43.500> text<00:00:43.829> files<00:00:43.860> or<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it you might see some text files or you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.639 
it you might see some text files or you
might<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.149> folder<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.660> folder<00:00:46.020> situations

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
might have folder and folder situations

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.100 
might have folder and folder situations
but<00:00:47.460> usually<00:00:48.329> you'll<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.629> see<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> world

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
but usually you'll just see the world

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.160 
but usually you'll just see the world
file<00:00:49.410> which<00:00:49.680> will<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> folder<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.170> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
file which will be a folder and this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.049 
file which will be a folder and this
one's<00:00:52.379> empty<00:00:52.590> ages<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.219> demonstrational

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
one's empty ages for demonstrational

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.400 
one's empty ages for demonstrational
purposes<00:00:54.410> but<00:00:55.520> you<00:00:56.520> will<00:00:56.730> find<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.660> level<00:00:58.020> dot

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
purposes but you will find the level dot

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130 
purposes but you will find the level dot
DAT<00:00:58.850> file<00:00:59.850> inside<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.600> different

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
DAT file inside and all the different

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
DAT file inside and all the different
folders<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.680> contains<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> world<00:01:02.520> that's

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
folders that contains the world that's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
folders that contains the world that's
when<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> world<00:01:04.379> file

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
when you know that it's the world file

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.130 
when you know that it's the world file
so<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.540> take<00:01:06.990> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
so what you do with that is you take it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.370 
so what you do with that is you take it
drag<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> archive<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.810> onto<00:01:10.260> your

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
drag it out of the archive and onto your

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
drag it out of the archive and onto your
desktop<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.490> want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.790> put<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
desktop you do not want to put this and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
desktop you do not want to put this and
you<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:12.869> install<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.409> file<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.189> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you don't install this file this is just

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
you don't install this file this is just
like<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> housing<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.750> move<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.110> off

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
like a housing so you just move that off

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.249 
like a housing so you just move that off
to<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.560> side<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:18.689> so

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
to the side this is what you want so

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
to the side this is what you want so
like<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.560> said<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.979> empty<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.270> will<00:01:21.450> still

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
like I said it's empty but it will still

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.410 
like I said it's empty but it will still
work<00:01:21.689> exactly<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.409> same<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> want

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
work exactly the same so what you want

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120 
work exactly the same so what you want
to<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.900> there's<00:01:25.170> two<00:01:25.380> ways<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> install<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to do is there's two ways to install it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
to do is there's two ways to install it
one's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.610> bit<00:01:26.850> harder<00:01:27.180> ones<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.540> little

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
one's a little bit harder ones a little

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.920 
one's a little bit harder ones a little
bit<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.829> easy<00:01:28.950> doesn't<00:01:29.820> matter<00:01:29.970> what

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
bit like really easy doesn't matter what

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.149 
bit like really easy doesn't matter what
you<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.470> open<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:31.860> run

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
you want to do is you open up your run

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.940 
you want to do is you open up your run
command<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.900> will<00:01:33.930> type<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.740> um

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
command and you will type this in um

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 
command and you will type this in um
it's<00:01:35.850> different<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.689> every<00:01:36.930> operating

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it's different for every operating

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.380 
it's different for every operating
system<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.009> simple<00:01:38.490> Google<00:01:38.790> search<00:01:38.820> will<00:01:39.210> tell

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
system a simple Google search will tell

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.380 
system a simple Google search will tell
you<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.110> Windows<00:01:40.439> 7<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:42.180> only

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you to do it this is Windows 7 the only

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.850 
you to do it this is Windows 7 the only
thing<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.840> different<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.590> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
thing that will be different is this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
thing that will be different is this
will<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.250> your<00:01:44.399> account<00:01:44.700> name<00:01:44.880> mine's<00:01:45.210> just

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
will be your account name mine's just
