00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
takes about two minutes which is about

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
takes about two minutes which is about
how<00:01:21.390> much<00:01:21.540> time<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> takes<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> fill<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> gas
