routine by doing the leak down test
number<00:00:19.199> one<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:19.710> checking<00:00:19.980> for<00:00:20.100> leaks

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
number one you're checking for leaks

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.570 
number one you're checking for leaks
number<00:00:21.390> two<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:22.220> ensuring<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
number two you're ensuring that the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.330 
number two you're ensuring that the
automatic<00:00:24.119> slack<00:00:24.570> adjusters<00:00:25.140> are<00:00:26.010> fully

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
automatic slack adjusters are fully

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.640 
automatic slack adjusters are fully
stroked<00:00:27.140> which<00:00:28.140> means<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:29.570> they<00:00:30.570> are

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
stroked which means that they are

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.530 
stroked which means that they are
properly<00:00:31.650> adjusted<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.030> don't<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
properly adjusted if you don't have a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.410 
properly adjusted if you don't have a
chance<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.410> fully<00:00:34.649> stroke<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.420> automatic

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
chance to fully stroke your automatic

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.750 
chance to fully stroke your automatic
slack<00:00:36.780> adjusters<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:38.040> may<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.670> an

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
slack adjusters they may not be an

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.150 
slack adjusters they may not be an
adjustment<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:40.320> could<00:00:40.530> result<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
adjustment and this could result in a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.030 
adjustment and this could result in a
ticket<00:00:41.660> also<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:43.170> could<00:00:43.379> result<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
ticket also this could result in a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.740 
ticket also this could result in a
condition<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.610> what's<00:00:44.789> called<00:00:45.000> unbalanced

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
condition of what's called unbalanced

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.799 
condition of what's called unbalanced
breaks<00:00:46.100> that's<00:00:47.100> where<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.520> break<00:00:47.820> may<00:00:48.510> grab

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
breaks that's where one break may grab

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.560 
breaks that's where one break may grab
before<00:00:48.989> another<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.210> possibly<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.420> could

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
before another and possibly that could

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840 
before another and possibly that could
be<00:00:51.690> due<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.930> an<00:00:52.289> unbalanced<00:00:52.829> condition<00:00:53.250> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
be due to an unbalanced condition so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.369 
be due to an unbalanced condition so
let's<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.270> inside<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> we're<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
let's go inside now and we're going to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.630 
let's go inside now and we're going to
go<00:00:55.469> check<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.890> automatic<00:00:56.430> slack<00:00:56.640> adjuster

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.300 

and<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> climb<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.980 

we're<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> first<00:01:08.670> check<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.360> brakes

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
we're going to first check the brakes

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.760 
we're going to first check the brakes
here<00:01:10.400> we<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> stroke<00:01:11.970> them<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.619> can

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
here we want to stroke them and you can

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.350 
here we want to stroke them and you can
see<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:15.680> here's<00:01:16.680> an<00:01:16.830> application<00:01:16.979> gauge<00:01:17.780> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
see here here's an application gauge and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
see here here's an application gauge and
I'm<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.570> fully<00:01:21.780> stroke<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.159> see

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
I'm going to fully stroke it you can see

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010 
I'm going to fully stroke it you can see
that<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.700> brakes<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.150> fully<00:01:24.330> stroked<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that the brakes are fully stroked and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.380 
that the brakes are fully stroked and
then<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> check<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.610> two

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
then now I'm going to check the the two

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.429 
then now I'm going to check the the two
needles<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:31.049> are<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.400> course<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
needles here are for of course the

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.780 
needles here are for of course the
primary<00:01:34.439> which<00:01:34.799> would<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> red<00:01:35.549> needle

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
primary which would be the red needle

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.399 
primary which would be the red needle
the<00:01:36.780> back<00:01:36.960> brakes<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.340> tractor<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> the

the back brakes of the tractor and the
front<00:01:40.409> brakes<00:01:40.790> would<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> secondary

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
front brakes would be the secondary

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.080 
front brakes would be the secondary
needle<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.770> would<00:01:43.890> watch<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.490> for

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
needle and I would watch those for

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.780 
needle and I would watch those for
approximately<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> minute<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.579> watching

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
approximately a minute and I'm watching

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.300 
approximately a minute and I'm watching
both<00:01:48.090> needles<00:01:48.509> making<00:01:48.869> sure<00:01:48.990> they<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.229> move

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.550 

also<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.840> d-o-t<00:01:55.100> they<00:01:56.100> allow<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.759> psi

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
also the d-o-t they allow you for psi

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.149 
also the d-o-t they allow you for psi
but<00:02:00.590> if<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:03.439> if<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.590> check<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.009> any

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
but if you if you check with any

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.359 
but if you if you check with any
mechanic<00:02:06.090> they'll<00:02:06.240> tell<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> eight<00:02:07.740> psi

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
mechanic they'll tell you that eight psi

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.809 
mechanic they'll tell you that eight psi
is<00:02:08.429> acceptable<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.590> an<00:02:11.340> acceptable

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
is acceptable that is an acceptable

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.730 
is acceptable that is an acceptable
range<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.540> safety

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
range of safety

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.620 
range of safety
four<00:02:13.890> psi<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.550> safety<00:02:14.970> factory<00:02:15.360> they've

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
four psi is a safety factory they've

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.560 
four psi is a safety factory they've
taken<00:02:15.810> 8<00:02:16.140> psi<00:02:16.620> cut<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.370> also<00:02:18.330> let<00:02:18.450> me

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
taken 8 psi cut that and to also let me

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.170 
taken 8 psi cut that and to also let me
give<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> another<00:02:19.320> tip<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.820> do<00:02:20.970> get

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
give you another tip here if you do get

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.310 
give you another tip here if you do get
if<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.810> are<00:02:21.990> stopped<00:02:22.260> by<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.470> d-o-t<00:02:24.320> stroke

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
if you are stopped by the d-o-t stroke

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.370 
if you are stopped by the d-o-t stroke
your<00:02:25.530> brakes<00:02:25.830> twice<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.820> by<00:02:27.690> doing<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.140> this

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
your brakes twice and by doing so this

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.300 
your brakes twice and by doing so this
should<00:02:28.560> also<00:02:28.820> fully<00:02:30.530> adjust<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.740> automatic

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
should also fully adjust the automatic

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.280 
should also fully adjust the automatic
slack<00:02:32.550> adjusters<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.900> I'm<00:02:33.960> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> check

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
slack adjusters and I'm going to check

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.340 
slack adjusters and I'm going to check
our<00:02:34.440> needles<00:02:34.740> again<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:39.360> they<00:02:39.990> may<00:02:40.200> have
