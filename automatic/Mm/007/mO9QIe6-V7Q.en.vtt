00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello at the same time at bio I 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.600
 will show you how to make 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.600
 salt dough 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:13.420
 it's really cool because you 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.780
 need the pads flour 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.770
 to mix and a little fight for 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:24.270
 measure you challenge you take the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.840
 flour and you your little containers and 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.840
 the inverted two sides 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.060
 it is 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.590
 then take your little container and 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.590
 you fill it once 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.000
 then you take some water and then 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.000
 you put us shower 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.250
 then you mix with your hands 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.900
 then if it's too liquid you can 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.900
 also buy flour 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.740
 then when everything is mixed that that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.039
 it's a bit complicated you can 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.509
 watch it's too soft, but me 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:42.960
 is it a little too soft does I 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:45.210
 add some flour as cool except 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.780
 so it becomes a few pieces 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.060
 and so then it's over and then you 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.750
 can is carved a lot of things then 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.069
 stuffing and at home in the era where she with 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.069
 she opens
