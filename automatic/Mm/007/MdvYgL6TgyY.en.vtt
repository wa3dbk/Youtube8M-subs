actually but go out and buy glad press

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.450 
actually but go out and buy glad press
and<00:01:43.860> seal<00:01:44.210> now<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.799> newer<00:01:47.040> version

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and seal now I this is the newer version

and seal now I this is the newer version
a<00:01:47.640> glad<00:01:48.329> press<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.689> seal<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.740> came<00:01:49.860> out

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
a glad press and seal that they came out

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.620 
a glad press and seal that they came out
with<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.399> would<00:01:50.670> definitely<00:01:51.060> suggest<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
with I would definitely suggest if you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.139 
with I would definitely suggest if you
can<00:01:51.750> find<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> older<00:01:52.320> version<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.820> actually

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
can find the older version it's actually

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420 
can find the older version it's actually
just<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.509> yellow<00:01:54.960> no<00:01:55.140> green<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.219> little

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
just all yellow no green it's a little

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.630 
just all yellow no green it's a little
bit<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> longer<00:01:57.030> tube<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.649> thicker<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
bit of a longer tube and it's thicker so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
bit of a longer tube and it's thicker so
it<00:01:59.939> ends<00:02:00.210> up<00:02:00.270> sticking<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> wheel<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.409> lot

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it ends up sticking to the wheel a lot

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.749 
it ends up sticking to the wheel a lot
easier<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:04.350> actually<00:02:05.250> easier<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
easier and I it's actually easier to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.499 
easier and I it's actually easier to
just<00:02:05.939> peel<00:02:06.119> off<00:02:06.180> too<00:02:07.020> without<00:02:07.439> making<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> mess

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
just peel off too without making a mess

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.900 
just peel off too without making a mess

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you roll out a sheet

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.280 
you roll out a sheet
and<00:02:14.040> all<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.020> wrap

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and all you have to do is you just wrap

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.610 
and all you have to do is you just wrap
it<00:02:16.319> around<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.670> entire<00:02:18.200> inside<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.380> wheel

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it around the entire inside of the wheel

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.540 
it around the entire inside of the wheel
and<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:21.390> fold<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.810> over<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.890> way<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.220> see

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
and you fold it over so that way you see

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.900 
and you fold it over so that way you see
it<00:02:23.819> folds<00:02:24.239> over<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.950> edge<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.459> wheel<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
it folds over the edge of the wheel and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.140 
it folds over the edge of the wheel and
comes<00:02:27.599> out<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.870> sticks<00:02:28.110> out<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:30.000> is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
comes out and sticks out this is

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.729 
comes out and sticks out this is
actually<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:31.310> lot<00:02:32.310> easier<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:33.120> clean<00:02:33.300> up<00:02:33.739> after

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739
