00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hey who eats me are welcome to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.089
 Another Tuesday of opening books on the day of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.460
 Today I am here as you could see in 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.469
 the title of the video because I come to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.990
 tell that 5 books I would like to have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.820
 made a movie or made series or what 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.470
 that is good, not whatever they are in 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.640
 the screen either short series or 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.470
 movie the first book that many 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.539
 have made film is the truth about 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.820
 the hard case that green me the ticker is 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.010
 a book that I liked a lot and I feel 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.349
 that history has a lot of potential is 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.269
 one of those books that has like that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.360
 certain aspects that when seeing in the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.890
 screen gives you already with I think it's a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.140
 story that is full of plot tweets to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.079
 what you created at the beginning of the book 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.969
 is what you end up believing in the end and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.320
 I feel that it will be very interesting 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.000
 see on the screen it will come back to you like 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.559
 Being crazy change all your 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.989
 theories I feel will be the movie 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.180
 ideal of suspense is a fat book like that 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.579
 that it will be a little complicated to put everything 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.649
 in a movie but anyway very 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.449
 to see it has certain points that I have 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.980
 seen in other movies and those 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.750
 I like movies a lot so 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.129
 I think a truth film about 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.930
 the harry case that I could see is a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.519
 very good movie another book that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.420
 show right movie is person 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.759
 normal should 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.880
 something scares me a little too 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.590
 because if the movie is not good you can 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.420
 destroy as that the whole concept that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.890
 you had the story itself but I think 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 that this movie made like that in the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.270
 lily collins style stock in love 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.250
 and logan lerman or cell have seen it would be 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.600
 very well this stock movie and it was 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.479
 directed I think that by the same director 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.799
 of techno stars so I think this 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.149
 director was very good work with this 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.820
 history maybe history is not like 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.390
 that the great thing but I feel that it has 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.130
 certain points that are transmitted better 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.899
 seeing the image of listening to the voices 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 of the characters is a book that I 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.860
 transmitted many things to read it but I 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.960
 I think when I saw them it was like 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.310
 that still a more shocking and there is a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.229
 trilogy that I would like to see this 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.270
 movie is the play trilogy here 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.860
 I have a live the third one because I have it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.929
 play but here is the third one too 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.490
 I like very much luster see all the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.649
 trilogy this movie because I feel that 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.899
 have many good things I feel that 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.360
 Javier Ruescas thought that the book 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.220
 in fact film because while I 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 I read I totally imagined the scene 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.030
 could be director completely this 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.829
 good movie no but I could try 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.450
 could be the assistant the director more 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.629
 well it's a love story 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.190
 of music from adventure friends and I think 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.160
 that all this brought to the screen 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.840
 great would be very entertaining indeed 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.569
 a chain bought the rights to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.920
 make this film trilogy but still not 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.810
 happen let's hope he does soon 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.910
 because that sounds to me that I would like to see 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.860
 in the cinema another book that I showed 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.930
 made film is aristu andante 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.390
 discover the secrets of the universe 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.459
 I'm also very scared because I feel 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.380
 that the movie could change some 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.970
 of the things that I felt in the book is 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.790
 a story of the characters grow 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.220
 they change a lot, they mature, I feel that 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.200
 visually it will be a very nice movie 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.030
 because while I was reading the book there was 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.489
 parts in which for example they were in 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.560
 a field in his red truck watching the 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.970
 stars and running in the rain and 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.799
 I feel that all of that will be very beautiful 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.420
 see on the screen is also a book 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.430
 that would scare me on the screen 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.810
 great because when you adapt a 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.970
 book to the movie you have to remove 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.560
 many things in the book I like that and 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.810
 how was this my favorite book of the year 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.030
 gone but I feel it will be worth it 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.459
 that some things are taken away from him 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.110
 see other things on the screen like that 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.510
 and see all these phrases that I have here 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.250
 marked said by him 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.500
 for the character will give you as more 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.030
 force and finally we have a book that 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.849
 I would like to have done series no 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.739
 movies but series and this is the name 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.560
 from patrick's wind 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.329
 I totally imagine it as the series 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.489
 of game of thrones like that of the same 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.989
 style is a very long story so 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.489
 which could not be made movie but 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.040
 I think a series can get you a lot 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.200
 profit because it has a lot of history and 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.239
 very very good these balances 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.400
 favorites and has that action that I 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.739
 he liked in the series but he also has 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.900
 love has adventures and they have magic what 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.250
 which I also like very much is a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.260
 epic fantasy story that 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.000
 I can easily imagine it as one of my 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.040
 favorite series so I hope that 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.599
 soon the name of the wind make it be 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.739
 and although I see very complicated me 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.329
 I would like you to tell me which 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.879
 are the books that they would like to see in 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.470
 screen TV movie or not 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.659
 will you tell me if you read 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.670
 these books and they imagine them made 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.650
 series or movies if you liked the video 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.720
 There are several ways to give you love can 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.910

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.010

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.919

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.409
 I also like very nice that someone 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.449

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.699
 I also know that I like someone when 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.340

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.240
 I do not know how to cross half the world was Madrid 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.240
 to see that person
