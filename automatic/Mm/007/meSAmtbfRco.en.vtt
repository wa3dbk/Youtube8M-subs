00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
but it's not really any benefit to it

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.370 
but it's not really any benefit to it
besides<00:00:25.480> just<00:00:25.810> make<00:00:25.930> them<00:00:26.020> that<00:00:26.109> Goodman

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
raise instead especially out there antes

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.599 
raise instead especially out there antes
in<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.240> tournament<00:00:28.570> blinds<00:00:28.750> did<00:00:28.930> just<00:00:29.109> go<00:00:29.199> up

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
in the tournament blinds did just go up

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.339 
in the tournament blinds did just go up
so<00:00:30.609> it<00:00:30.910> folds<00:00:31.090> to<00:00:31.359> D<00:00:31.510> Fischer<00:00:31.840> decides<00:00:32.109> to<00:00:32.229> call

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
Queen with two diamonds I think there's

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.599 
Queen with two diamonds I think there's
some<00:00:41.379> merit<00:00:41.499> to<00:00:41.829> leading<00:00:42.129> here<00:00:42.370> which

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
some merit to leading here which

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.529 
some merit to leading here which
something<00:00:42.789> that<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:42.999> don't<00:00:43.059> really<00:00:43.269> do<00:00:43.510> too

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
something that I don't really do too

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.680 
something that I don't really do too
often<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:45.399> I<00:00:45.609> don't<00:00:45.760> really<00:00:46.120> think<00:00:46.269> it's<00:00:46.629> the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
often but I don't really think it's the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.599 
often but I don't really think it's the
right<00:00:46.870> play<00:00:47.109> only<00:00:47.469> because<00:00:47.949> if<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.280> lead<00:00:48.460> here

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
right play only because if you lead here

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.189 
right play only because if you lead here
you're<00:00:48.940> gonna<00:00:49.030> get<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.299> flat<00:00:49.539> called<00:00:49.780> lot<00:00:49.989> by

ten<00:01:35.710> nine<00:01:35.890> stuff<00:01:36.340> like<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:36.670> sets<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:38.110> pair<00:01:38.350> if

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
ten nine stuff like that sets to pair if

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.020 
ten nine stuff like that sets to pair if
he<00:01:38.830> somehow<00:01:39.010> has<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.250> set<00:01:39.460> which<00:01:39.550> probably<00:01:39.910> only

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
he somehow has a set which probably only

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.390 
he somehow has a set which probably only
means<00:01:40.240> sixes<00:01:40.630> or<00:01:40.900> if<00:01:41.200> he<00:01:41.290> has<00:01:41.410> like<00:01:41.650> Queen<00:01:42.100> Jack

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
means sixes or if he has like Queen Jack

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.899 
means sixes or if he has like Queen Jack
so<00:01:43.390> that's<00:01:44.230> Bryn's<00:01:44.560> range<00:01:44.800> there's<00:01:45.370> not<00:01:45.550> too

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
so that's Bryn's range there's not too

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.640 
so that's Bryn's range there's not too
many<00:01:46.090> Bluffs<00:01:46.510> in<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:46.870> range<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.200> against

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
many Bluffs in that range and against

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.200 
many Bluffs in that range and against
that<00:01:47.800> range<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.190> hands<00:01:48.370> especially<00:01:48.580> being<00:01:49.120> out

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.160 
of position against a brynne alone I
have<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.670> pretty<00:01:51.940> tough<00:01:52.150> decision<00:01:52.360> on<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> lot<00:01:53.110> of

have a pretty tough decision on a lot of
turns<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.500> rivers<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.850> we<00:01:54.909> see<00:01:55.180> Dee<00:01:55.330> fish

the person that bets tends to have a
weaker<00:02:07.960> hand<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.379> person<00:02:08.499> that<00:02:08.829> calls

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
weaker hand and the person that calls

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.129 
weaker hand and the person that calls
strictly<00:02:09.999> because<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.450> person<00:02:10.749> that<00:02:10.780> bets

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
light can be bluffing I got looking in

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.110 
light can be bluffing I got looking in
this<00:02:15.230> spot<00:02:15.379> right<00:02:15.560> here<00:02:15.620> Brin<00:02:16.520> probably

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
this spot right here Brin probably

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.580 
this spot right here Brin probably
doesn't<00:02:17.360> have<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> hand<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.170> story<00:02:18.440> off

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
doesn't have a hand like a story off

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.100 
doesn't have a hand like a story off
sued<00:02:18.830> but<00:02:19.280> D<00:02:19.459> fish<00:02:19.640> never<00:02:20.209> has<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.599> hand<00:02:20.930> like<00:02:21.080> a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
sued but D fish never has a hand like a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.740 
sued but D fish never has a hand like a
stood<00:02:21.410> off<00:02:21.560> suit<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:22.220> know<00:02:22.310> Brin<00:02:23.239> can<00:02:23.510> decide

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
stood off suit you know Brin can decide

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.170 
stood off suit you know Brin can decide
to<00:02:23.900> Bluff<00:02:24.110> in<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> spot<00:02:24.500> but<00:02:24.860> D<00:02:25.040> fish<00:02:25.220> really

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
to Bluff in the spot but D fish really

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.540 
to Bluff in the spot but D fish really
probably<00:02:26.870> isn't<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.680> float<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.099> spot<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.459> a

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
probably isn't to float in the spot in a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.809 
probably isn't to float in the spot in a
5-way<00:02:28.849> pot<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.680> either<00:02:30.680> very<00:02:31.099> advanced<00:02:31.640> or

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
5-way pot is either very advanced or

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.070 
5-way pot is either very advanced or
very<00:02:32.209> bad<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:33.319> a<00:02:33.590> very<00:02:33.950> narrow<00:02:34.459> line<00:02:34.760> there

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
very bad it's a very narrow line there

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.720 
very bad it's a very narrow line there
so<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.349> really<00:02:36.620> don't<00:02:36.860> think<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.430> really<00:02:37.700> don't

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
so I really don't think I really don't

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.580 
so I really don't think I really don't
think<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.239> D<00:02:38.660> fish<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.019> calling<00:02:39.319> here<00:02:39.440> to

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
think that D fish is calling here to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.470 
think that D fish is calling here to
light<00:02:39.769> D<00:02:40.220> fish's<00:02:40.519> range<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.849> very<00:02:41.060> similar<00:02:41.330> to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
light D fish's range is very similar to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.330 
light D fish's range is very similar to
Bryn's<00:02:41.780> range<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.319> that<00:02:42.349> D<00:02:42.830> fish<00:02:43.010> could<00:02:43.190> have

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
Bryn's range and that D fish could have

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.699 
Bryn's range and that D fish could have
a<00:02:43.580> lot<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.150> his<00:02:44.269> Queens<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.810> lot<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.290> just<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.560> lot

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
a lot of his Queens a lot of just a lot

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.009 
a lot of his Queens a lot of just a lot
of<00:02:45.739> jacks<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.430> lot<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:46.940> straight<00:02:47.239> draws<00:02:47.510> flush

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
of jacks a lot of straight draws flush

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.860

raises<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.470> set<00:02:51.650> or<00:02:51.739> two<00:02:51.890> pair<00:02:52.069> just

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
raises with the set or two pair just

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.130 
raises with the set or two pair just
like<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.209> like<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.630> would<00:02:53.720> expect<00:02:53.810> them

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
like you know like you would expect them

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.680 
like you know like you would expect them
to<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:55.099> none<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.880> none<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.269> is<00:02:56.450> very

to but none of the none of that is very

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.220 
to but none of the none of that is very
weak<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.110> against<00:02:57.709> both<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.130> their<00:02:58.250> ranges<00:02:58.730> I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
weak and against both of their ranges I

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.319 
weak and against both of their ranges I
do<00:03:00.230> very<00:03:00.590> poorly<00:03:00.829> especially<00:03:01.760> being<00:03:01.880> first<00:03:02.209> to

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
do very poorly especially being first to

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.589 
do very poorly especially being first to
act<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.840> think<00:03:03.799> this<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.069> pretty<00:03:04.400> solid<00:03:05.209> fold

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
act I think this is a pretty solid fold

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.229 
act I think this is a pretty solid fold
against<00:03:05.989> two<00:03:06.110> good<00:03:06.380> players<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.459> do<00:03:07.519> decide

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
against two good players and I do decide

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.250 
against two good players and I do decide
to<00:03:08.299> fold<00:03:08.920> however<00:03:09.920> if<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:11.690> think<00:03:11.930> about<00:03:12.019> this

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
to fold however if we think about this

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.710 
to fold however if we think about this
in<00:03:12.440> another<00:03:12.560> light<00:03:13.180> looking<00:03:14.180> at<00:03:14.329> this<00:03:14.450> hand

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
in another light looking at this hand

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.150 
in another light looking at this hand
people<00:03:14.989> will<00:03:15.170> usually<00:03:15.349> will<00:03:15.650> just<00:03:15.680> think<00:03:16.040> it

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
people will usually will just think it

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.180

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
standard thing to do here is to just

however thinking about check-raise in
this<00:03:48.739> pot<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.040> actually<00:03:49.549> kind<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:49.819> interesting

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
this pot is actually kind of interesting

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.680 
this pot is actually kind of interesting
because<00:03:50.840> we<00:03:51.319> know<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.500> Bryn<00:03:51.920> has<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.690> strong

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
because we know that Bryn has a strong

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.660 
because we know that Bryn has a strong
range<00:03:53.989> but<00:03:54.230> doesn't<00:03:54.769> usually<00:03:54.889> ever<00:03:55.280> include

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670

Queens<00:03:56.000> or<00:03:56.180> jacks<00:03:56.389> not<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:56.870> we<00:03:57.019> do<00:03:57.170> either<00:03:57.410> if

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
Queens or jacks not like we do either if

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.710 
Queens or jacks not like we do either if
we<00:03:57.650> check<00:03:57.829> raise<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:59.120> know<00:03:59.209> we<00:03:59.420> know<00:03:59.540> D

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
we check raise but you know we know D

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.970 
we check raise but you know we know D
fish<00:03:59.930> probably<00:04:00.260> doesn't<00:04:00.470> have<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.590> hand<00:04:00.829> like

Queen<00:04:01.280> Jack<00:04:01.549> or<00:04:01.819> two<00:04:02.660> sixes<00:04:03.019> because<00:04:03.200> that

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
Queen Jack or two sixes because that

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.289 
Queen Jack or two sixes because that
would<00:04:03.650> probably<00:04:03.920> raise<00:04:04.130> so<00:04:04.639> the<00:04:04.760> best<00:04:04.940> hand<00:04:05.150> D

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
would probably raise so the best hand D

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.970 
would probably raise so the best hand D
fish<00:04:05.480> could<00:04:05.630> have<00:04:05.750> in<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.959> spot<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.560> probably

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
fish could have in the spot is probably

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.069 
fish could have in the spot is probably
a<00:04:07.069> hand<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.430> king<00:04:07.639> queen<00:04:07.819> maybe<00:04:08.630> even<00:04:08.930> king

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
a hand like king queen maybe even king

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.629 
a hand like king queen maybe even king
queen<00:04:09.200> would<00:04:09.349> raise<00:04:09.680> preflop<00:04:09.859> same<00:04:10.400> with<00:04:10.519> ace

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
queen would raise preflop same with ace

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.280 
queen would raise preflop same with ace
Queen<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.120> for<00:04:11.630> Britain<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:11.959> same<00:04:12.139> thing

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
Queen and for Britain the same thing

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.809 
Queen and for Britain the same thing
kind<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.500> holds<00:04:12.799> true<00:04:12.950> as<00:04:13.069> well<00:04:13.220> friend

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
kind of holds true as well friend

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.370 
kind of holds true as well friend
probably<00:04:14.060> raises<00:04:14.630> preflop<00:04:14.750> with<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.109> hand<00:04:15.260> as

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
probably raises preflop with the hand as

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.810 
probably raises preflop with the hand as
good<00:04:15.500> as<00:04:15.590> ace<00:04:15.709> queen<00:04:16.010> or<00:04:16.130> king.queen<00:04:16.310> versus

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
good as ace queen or king.queen versus

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.699 
good as ace queen or king.queen versus
the<00:04:16.910> limper<00:04:17.180> from<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.389> bed<00:04:17.599> or<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:18.079> potentially<00:04:18.650> a

the limper from a bed or a potentially a

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.550 
the limper from a bed or a potentially a
bad<00:04:18.859> player<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:20.090> thinking<00:04:20.959> about<00:04:21.049> all<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.409> that

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
bad player so thinking about all of that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.680 
bad player so thinking about all of that
we<00:04:22.250> can<00:04:22.550> certainly<00:04:22.880> have<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.090> hand<00:04:23.360> like<00:04:23.510> two

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
we can certainly have a hand like two

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.110 
we can certainly have a hand like two
sixes<00:04:24.110> or<00:04:24.320> queen<00:04:24.800> Jack<00:04:25.070> or<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.340> very<00:04:25.820> strong

set<00:04:45.750> either<00:04:45.960> or<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.410> hand<00:04:46.740> as<00:04:46.860> good<00:04:47.010> as<00:04:47.100> like

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
set either or a hand as good as like

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.320 
set either or a hand as good as like
king<00:04:47.400> queen<00:04:47.580> or<00:04:47.640> Ice<00:04:47.820> Queen

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
king queen or Ice Queen

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.210 
king queen or Ice Queen
so<00:04:48.840> if<00:04:48.960> we<00:04:49.080> check<00:04:49.290> raise<00:04:49.530> here<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.890> let's<00:04:50.070> say

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
so if we check raise here to let's say

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.720 
so if we check raise here to let's say
there's<00:04:51.000> there's<00:04:51.690> 1390<00:04:52.620> in<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.830> pot<00:04:53.010> if<00:04:53.520> we

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
there's there's 1390 in the pot if we

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.910 
there's there's 1390 in the pot if we
check<00:04:53.940> raised<00:04:54.150> here<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.480> let's<00:04:54.690> say<00:04:54.930> 1600

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
check raised here to let's say 1600

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.010 
check raised here to let's say 1600
we're<00:04:56.520> getting<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.850> pretty<00:04:57.240> good<00:04:57.480> price<00:04:57.720> on<00:04:57.900> our

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
we're getting a pretty good price on our

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.960 
we're getting a pretty good price on our
bluff<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:58.590> it's<00:04:58.920> kind<00:04:59.100> of<00:04:59.130> hard<00:04:59.400> for<00:04:59.460> Brin<00:04:59.820> or

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
bluff and it's kind of hard for Brin or

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.210 
bluff and it's kind of hard for Brin or
D<00:05:00.090> fish<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.390> continue<00:05:00.780> because<00:05:01.230> on<00:05:01.590> any<00:05:01.740> brick

D fish to continue because on any brick

D fish to continue because on any brick
turn<00:05:02.490> card<00:05:02.760> from<00:05:03.000> let's<00:05:03.210> say<00:05:03.330> 2<00:05:03.390> to<00:05:03.990> 7<00:05:04.740> we<00:05:05.280> can

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
turn card from let's say 2 to 7 we can

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.220 
turn card from let's say 2 to 7 we can
bet<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:05.970> they're<00:05:06.360> gonna<00:05:06.450> have<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.840> fold<00:05:07.050> if

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
bet and they're gonna have to fold if

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.630 
bet and they're gonna have to fold if
they<00:05:07.350> have<00:05:07.530> like<00:05:07.800> they're<00:05:08.340> gonna<00:05:08.460> have<00:05:08.610> a

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
they have like they're gonna have a

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.620 
they have like they're gonna have a
tough<00:05:08.790> decision<00:05:08.910> because<00:05:09.180> we're<00:05:09.360> gonna<00:05:09.450> bet

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
tough decision because we're gonna bet

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.390 
tough decision because we're gonna bet
every<00:05:09.930> time<00:05:10.080> for<00:05:10.380> sure<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.980> if<00:05:11.130> a<00:05:11.220> diamond

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
every time for sure and if a diamond

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.850 
every time for sure and if a diamond
hits<00:05:11.760> it's<00:05:12.090> it's<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.960> could<00:05:13.110> tell<00:05:13.380> us<00:05:13.500> as<00:05:13.650> well

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
hits it's it's it could tell us as well

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.720 
hits it's it's it could tell us as well
because<00:05:13.950> we<00:05:14.070> could<00:05:14.280> definitely<00:05:14.370> be<00:05:14.640> checking

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
because we could definitely be checking

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.850 
because we could definitely be checking
with<00:05:15.150> big<00:05:15.330> diamonds<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:16.230> puts<00:05:16.440> them<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:16.650> a<00:05:16.830> very

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
with big diamonds it puts them in a very

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.020 
with big diamonds it puts them in a very
weird<00:05:17.190> spot<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.580> if<00:05:17.640> they<00:05:17.730> just<00:05:17.850> have<00:05:18.000> a

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
weird spot and if they just have a

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.940 
weird spot and if they just have a
single<00:05:18.390> pair<00:05:18.600> in<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:18.900> spot<00:05:19.110> or<00:05:19.620> like<00:05:19.920> a

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
single pair in this spot or like a

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.770 
single pair in this spot or like a
weaker<00:05:20.280> draw<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.640> said<00:05:20.850> just<00:05:20.970> ten<00:05:21.210> nine<00:05:21.420> or

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
weaker draw it said just ten nine or

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.040 
weaker draw it said just ten nine or
like<00:05:21.960> ace<00:05:22.410> 10<00:05:22.800> or<00:05:23.130> King<00:05:23.400> 10<00:05:23.640> they<00:05:24.210> really<00:05:24.810> can't

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
like ace 10 or King 10 they really can't

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.620 
like ace 10 or King 10 they really can't
call<00:05:25.260> on<00:05:25.440> this<00:05:25.590> spot<00:05:25.830> but<00:05:26.550> we<00:05:27.120> could<00:05:27.360> win<00:05:27.510> the

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
call on this spot but we could win the

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.140 
call on this spot but we could win the
pot<00:05:27.780> with<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:27.960> check<00:05:28.200> raise<00:05:28.410> it's<00:05:29.340> it's<00:05:29.640> it's

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
pot with a check raise it's it's it's

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.000 
pot with a check raise it's it's it's
it's<00:05:30.780> an<00:05:30.870> interesting<00:05:31.290> play<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.710> not<00:05:31.890> one

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
it's an interesting play and not one

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.350 
it's an interesting play and not one
that<00:05:32.100> I<00:05:32.160> really<00:05:32.430> think<00:05:32.640> is<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.940> correct<00:05:33.060> play

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
that I really think is the correct play

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.060 
that I really think is the correct play
in<00:05:33.510> this<00:05:33.630> spot<00:05:33.870> but<00:05:34.380> thinking<00:05:34.710> about<00:05:34.950> the

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
in this spot but thinking about the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.860 
in this spot but thinking about the
potential<00:05:35.520> of<00:05:35.610> other<00:05:35.820> moves<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.420> not<00:05:36.630> just

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
potential of other moves and not just

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.960 
potential of other moves and not just
doing<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.200> standard<00:05:37.590> ABC<00:05:38.100> play<00:05:38.310> is<00:05:38.550> something

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
doing the standard ABC play is something

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.970 
doing the standard ABC play is something
that<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.270> should<00:05:39.420> probably<00:05:39.720> be<00:05:39.990> doing<00:05:40.740> more

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
that you should probably be doing more

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.230 
that you should probably be doing more
often<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.460> I<00:05:41.550> should<00:05:41.730> be<00:05:41.790> doing<00:05:41.910> more<00:05:42.090> often

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
often and I should be doing more often

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.060 
often and I should be doing more often
as<00:05:42.480> well<00:05:42.660> it's<00:05:43.230> definitely<00:05:43.590> out<00:05:43.680> of<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:43.830> box

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
as well it's definitely out of the box

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.240 
as well it's definitely out of the box
and<00:05:44.280> it's<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:44.900> complicated<00:05:45.900> thing<00:05:45.930> and<00:05:46.260> it's

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
and it's a complicated thing and it's

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.040 
and it's a complicated thing and it's
not<00:05:47.430> really<00:05:47.610> cut<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:48.030> dry<00:05:48.240> but<00:05:48.690> that's<00:05:48.810> become

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
not really cut and dry but that's become

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.270 
not really cut and dry but that's become
their<00:05:49.200> poker<00:05:49.440> player<00:05:49.680> by<00:05:49.890> thinking<00:05:50.160> about

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
their poker player by thinking about

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.020 
their poker player by thinking about
spots<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.540> are<00:05:52.220> deceptively<00:05:53.220> deceptively

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
spots that are deceptively deceptively

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.360 
spots that are deceptively deceptively
simple<00:05:54.510> and<00:05:54.810> in<00:05:55.530> this<00:05:55.590> pot<00:05:55.770> I<00:05:55.800> do<00:05:55.920> decide<00:05:56.310> to

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
simple and in this pot I do decide to

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.400 
simple and in this pot I do decide to
fold<00:05:56.640> as<00:05:56.760> I<00:05:56.850> had<00:05:57.000> said<00:05:57.210> but<00:05:57.690> I<00:05:57.870> think<00:05:58.230> it<00:05:58.290> check

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
fold as I had said but I think it check

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.480 
fold as I had said but I think it check
Raiders<00:05:58.650> would<00:05:58.710> have<00:05:58.830> been<00:05:58.920> interesting<00:05:59.370> and

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
Raiders would have been interesting and

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.300 
Raiders would have been interesting and
might<00:05:59.670> have<00:05:59.790> won<00:05:59.910> me<00:06:00.030> the<00:06:00.060> pot
