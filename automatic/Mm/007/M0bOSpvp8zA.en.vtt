00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.480
 ah 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.160
 hi to all measures to my channel in this 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.459
 video I want to give you some tips and 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.910
 tricks of how to move from slipped hair to 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.910
 natural hair 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.900
 because wearing the natural hair that has 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.480
 motivated to wear natural hair 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.750
 I invite you to take a paper or your 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.020
 mobile whatever and before because he wants 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.650
 bring opening because it's so important 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.210
 because it 's a big step that you're going to take and 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.930
 there will be many people who are going to 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.720
 surprise of this step 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 mentally prepared to give it a 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.690
 proposal to people is going to be 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.910
 very difficult 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.000
 it's great that he always has his motive 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.430
 Take a piece of paper and step on it because you're going 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.010
 to do and when they have to answer 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.379
 you can also tell the person that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.260
 I asked for keels natural hair 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.720
 so for me that is the first step 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.720
 to move from slipped to natural 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.330
 you have very clear why you're going to 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.720
 wear the natural hair then the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.780
 next step is to stop thinking that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.740
 as simple as that 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.740
 the tension 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 the direct before or transmission to 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.740
 Many already know what the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.650
 transport opinion and the transition others 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.630
 will not know the transport is means 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.490
 that you will find all the hair 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.399
 dedicated you're going to start 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.990
 you're going to start with a girl who does not have 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.990
 hair and you're going to leave the present 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.330
 you are the one who decides which redoubt 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.330
 contains the different visions 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.010
 formations per day 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.270
 if she informs you if she is looking for friends who have already 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.630
 gone through that step has incorporated to 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.750
 a page you are looking for information in a blog 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.090
 or I do not know what my life is wearing my hair 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.460
 natural and search all the information 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.250
 necessary then this path will be 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.260
 much easier but not always 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.130
 information in all the steps that we took 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.130
 in the life 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.890
 do not do with more unnecessary by 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.079
 own experience I tell you, girls, no, 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.890
 you have to invest a lot of money to 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.360
 take the pre natural what there is is that 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.220
 finding a product little by little not 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.290
 they become walking that I must here 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.290
 watching another video already in this 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.599
 I start sometimes the most economical thing 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.260
 those are the ones that turn out and work well for you 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:16.200
 in your care for me the main thing in this 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.019
 process you need will have both but 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.120
 you need water the water is the biggest 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.799
 ally for us to hydrate 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.840
 our hair stories and you do not have to spend 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.549
 much you just have to look 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.470
 information do not go buy a 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.099
 big product 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.099
 10 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.370
 clothed 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.850
 bombs 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.440
 but do not do fuels 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.440
 and after the sale 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.010
 the sessions 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.580
 the hair usually grows 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.610
 but to other girls of 13 more than atila 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.409
 but it's different and every person in the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.659
 English hair is different do not you 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.239
 Canchita obsessions is better than you 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.200
 it grows more hair does not help if 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.700
 do you believe in what happens but talk 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.910
 Y 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.040
 we have so we avoid it we know that the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.780
 hair is long but there are moments that 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.600
 depending on the model you wear 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.060
 depending on how it does not look you can not see the 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.520
 Real light but do not obsess 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.540
 What they are doing is how 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.540
 find a boyfriend 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 he sat down I travel with your hair spoils what 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.750
 loves caress and forgets to see how 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.580
 long you want to have but enjoy these 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.250
 so cute moments later you will 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.630
 be needed because it is to enjoy the hair 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.630
 that the most important thing 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.100
 I have a routine I do not always 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.800
 obsessions with carrying a routine that 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.980
 cost a lot of time looking for a routine 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.410
 easy to learn to give the hair learn 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.360
 disaggregate it learn to love your hair 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.330
 after the garment can hydrating 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.370
 make you hairstyle differently or if you can not 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.190

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.140
 short try to take it always a pique 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.090
 life because a rendering comes out 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.070

 wear in a bun worn as a cloth but 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.319
 try to make it something that is 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.540
 before it becomes stressful 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.510
 look for a routine 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.870
