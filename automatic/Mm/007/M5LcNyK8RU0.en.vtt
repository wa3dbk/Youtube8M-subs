the comparison to peach should be an

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.880 
the comparison to peach should be an
obvious<00:03:23.730> one<00:03:24.180> like<00:03:24.780> peach<00:03:25.050> she's<00:03:25.380> not<00:03:25.590> only<00:03:25.740> a

Mario princess but she also seems to

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
speed weight and float eNOS but it's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.610 
speed weight and float eNOS but it's
hard<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.210> tell<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.690> sure<00:03:33.750> without<00:03:34.200> playing

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
hard to tell for sure without playing

hard to tell for sure without playing
the<00:03:34.830> game<00:03:35.040> but<00:03:35.640> what<00:03:35.790> makes<00:03:36.000> her<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.390> different

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
the game but what makes her so different

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.260 
the game but what makes her so different
from<00:03:37.020> peach<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.560> luma<00:03:38.160> who<00:03:38.580> seems<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.000> be<00:03:39.120> the

seems to have a certain degree of
control<00:03:43.470> over<00:03:43.530> luma<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.730> llamar<00:03:45.150> does

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
control over luma like a llamar does

over his Pikmin but not full control

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.730

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
like players have with both Popo and

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.980 
like players have with both Popo and
Nana<00:03:50.100> but<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.970> same<00:03:51.150> time<00:03:51.450> luma<00:03:51.840> has

Nana but at the same time luma has

Nana but at the same time luma has
moments<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.620> which<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:53.010> acts<00:03:53.160> on<00:03:53.370> its<00:03:53.550> own<00:03:53.730> free

moments in which it acts on its own free

moments in which it acts on its own free
will<00:03:54.270> when<00:03:54.630> separated<00:03:55.230> from<00:03:55.350> its<00:03:55.560> partner

similar<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.580> Nana<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:57.660> Nana<00:03:57.930> luma<00:03:58.350> seems

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
similar to Nana and like Nana luma seems

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.290 
similar to Nana and like Nana luma seems
to<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.830> an<00:03:58.920> integral<00:03:59.430> part<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.850> this<00:04:00.000> duo

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300

character something else the trailer

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.520 
character something else the trailer
shows<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:02.850> similar<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.690> both<00:04:03.870> Nana<00:04:04.230> and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
shows is that similar to both Nana and

shows is that similar to both Nana and
the<00:04:04.770> pickman's<00:04:05.160> luma<00:04:05.820> can<00:04:06.000> be<00:04:06.120> neutralized<00:04:06.630> in

the<00:04:06.870> middle<00:04:07.140> of<00:04:07.230> battle<00:04:07.440> one<00:04:08.130> thing<00:04:08.280> that's

the middle of battle one thing that's

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.490 
the middle of battle one thing that's
unclear<00:04:08.760> though<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.390> whether<00:04:09.660> luma<00:04:10.110> remains

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
unclear though is whether luma remains

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.380 
unclear though is whether luma remains
out<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.769> play<00:04:10.920> permanently<00:04:11.640> until<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.239> main

character is knocked out and revived

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.870 
character is knocked out and revived
like<00:04:14.880> Nana<00:04:15.180> or<00:04:15.540> if<00:04:16.290> luma<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.680> reasonable<00:04:17.640> one

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
like Nana or if luma is reasonable one

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.330 
like Nana or if luma is reasonable one
skilled<00:04:18.330> like<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.959> Lamar's<00:04:19.290> pickman's<00:04:19.769> if<00:04:20.250> it

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
skilled like a Lamar's pickman's if it

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.860 
skilled like a Lamar's pickman's if it
turns<00:04:20.580> out<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.880> be<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.120> latter<00:04:21.269> maybe<00:04:21.660> that

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
turns out to be the latter maybe that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.659 
turns out to be the latter maybe that
explains<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.530> different<00:04:22.860> colors<00:04:23.160> which

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
explains the different colors which

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.550 
explains the different colors which
could<00:04:23.880> represent<00:04:24.030> how<00:04:24.570> long<00:04:24.810> luma<00:04:25.200> has<00:04:25.350> been

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
could represent how long luma has been

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.040 
could represent how long luma has been
in<00:04:25.680> play<00:04:25.919> maybe<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.120> Pikmin<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.660> longer

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
in play maybe like the Pikmin the longer

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.990 
in play maybe like the Pikmin the longer
and<00:04:28.169> play<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.620> stronger<00:04:29.040> it<00:04:29.070> gets<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.700> how

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and play the stronger it gets and how

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.850 
and play the stronger it gets and how
strong<00:04:30.390> luma<00:04:30.690> is<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:31.080> how<00:04:31.230> long<00:04:31.500> it's<00:04:31.710> been<00:04:31.770> in

conduct luma which actually looks pretty

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.510 
conduct luma which actually looks pretty
cool<00:04:51.210> then<00:04:51.960> what<00:04:51.990> we<00:04:52.440> see<00:04:52.650> here<00:04:52.979> is<00:04:53.040> likely<00:04:53.490> a

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
cool then what we see here is likely a

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.610 
cool then what we see here is likely a
combination<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:54.390> Rosalina's<00:04:55.020> forward<00:04:55.380> smash

and her standard a attack the same

and her standard a attack the same
forward<00:04:58.710> smash<00:04:59.010> attack<00:04:59.370> can<00:04:59.610> be<00:04:59.729> witnessed

forward smash attack can be witnessed

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.090 
forward smash attack can be witnessed
here<00:05:00.450> but<00:05:00.690> this<00:05:00.840> time<00:05:01.020> luma<00:05:01.380> is<00:05:01.500> glowing<00:05:01.740> red

here but this time luma is glowing red

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.980 
here but this time luma is glowing red
again<00:05:02.880> it's<00:05:03.090> hard<00:05:03.270> to<00:05:03.330> say<00:05:03.450> what<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:03.720> colors

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
again it's hard to say what the colors

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.540 
again it's hard to say what the colors
mean<00:05:04.169> at<00:05:04.320> this<00:05:04.440> point<00:05:04.500> but<00:05:05.220> there<00:05:05.370> doesn't

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
mean at this point but there doesn't

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.370 
mean at this point but there doesn't
seem<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.850> be<00:05:05.970> any<00:05:06.240> elemental<00:05:06.960> changes

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
seem to be any elemental changes

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.140 
seem to be any elemental changes
involved<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.040> my<00:05:08.220> assumption<00:05:08.550> is<00:05:08.790> that<00:05:08.820> as

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
involved so my assumption is that as

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.300 
involved so my assumption is that as
mentioned<00:05:09.570> before<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:10.440> colors<00:05:10.770> represent

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
mentioned before the colors represent

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.190 
mentioned before the colors represent
how<00:05:11.490> long<00:05:11.789> luma<00:05:12.150> has<00:05:12.270> been<00:05:12.450> in<00:05:12.539> play<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:13.050> how

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
how long luma has been in play and how

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.770 
how long luma has been in play and how
strong<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:13.860> we<00:05:14.550> are<00:05:14.640> then<00:05:14.820> shown<00:05:15.060> Loomis

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
strong it is we are then shown Loomis

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.379 
strong it is we are then shown Loomis
to<00:05:16.170> act<00:05:16.350> individually<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.340> in<00:05:17.670> sync<00:05:18.120> with

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
to act individually and in sync with

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.750 
to act individually and in sync with
rosalina<00:05:18.960> similar<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.070> ice<00:05:20.220> climbers

rosalina similar to the ice climbers

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.430 
rosalina similar to the ice climbers
seems<00:05:21.360> like<00:05:21.510> quite<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.780> useful<00:05:22.020> ability

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
seems like quite a useful ability

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.379 
seems like quite a useful ability
especially<00:05:22.950> when<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.639> comes<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:23.910> gettin<00:05:24.300> out

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389

can be attacked which also means it can
