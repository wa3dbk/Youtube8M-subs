that added risk so the difference

between op ex and quadruple witching is

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.969 
between op ex and quadruple witching is
that<00:01:51.720> quadruple<00:01:52.140> witching<00:01:52.229> occurs<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that quadruple witching occurs at the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
that quadruple witching occurs at the
end<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.280> each<00:01:53.430> quarter<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.570> are<00:01:54.689> four

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
end of each quarter and there are four

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.899 
end of each quarter and there are four
different<00:01:55.259> asset<00:01:55.560> classes<00:01:55.590> expiring<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
different asset classes expiring at that

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.539 
different asset classes expiring at that
time<00:01:57.270> which<00:01:57.990> leads<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> even<00:01:58.619> more<00:01:58.649> volatility

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
time which leads to even more volatility

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.219 
time which leads to even more volatility
during<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.880> third<00:02:00.090> week<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.509> every<00:02:00.810> three

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
during the third week of every three

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.080 
during the third week of every three
months<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.520> addition<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
months now in addition to that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.490 
months now in addition to that
volatility<00:02:03.509> there<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> self-fulfilling

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
volatility there is a self-fulfilling

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.249 
volatility there is a self-fulfilling
sort<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> prophecy<00:02:05.850> added<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.329> where<00:02:06.810> everyone

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
sort of prophecy added in where everyone

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.619 
sort of prophecy added in where everyone
knows<00:02:07.439> when<00:02:07.979> quadruple<00:02:08.550> witching<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:09.300> occur

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
knows when quadruple witching will occur

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.930 
knows when quadruple witching will occur
and<00:02:09.840> therefore<00:02:10.140> most<00:02:10.679> traders<00:02:10.950> avoid<00:02:11.340> trading

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
and therefore most traders avoid trading

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.650 
and therefore most traders avoid trading
which<00:02:12.390> makes<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.750> effective<00:02:13.140> quadruple

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
which makes the effective quadruple

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.390 
which makes the effective quadruple
even<00:02:14.110> more<00:02:14.320> dramatic<00:02:14.770> because<00:02:14.860> there's<00:02:15.160> less

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
even more dramatic because there's less

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.640 
even more dramatic because there's less

increase in volatility basically to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.750 
increase in volatility basically to
