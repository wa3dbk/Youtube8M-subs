experience you have to touch that's the

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.090 
experience you have to touch that's the
way<00:00:44.390> that's<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.109> main<00:00:45.289> rule<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.920> have<00:00:46.039> to

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
touch if it's the same color then it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.029 
touch if it's the same color then it
creates<00:00:47.840> a<00:00:47.929> match<00:00:48.109> if<00:00:48.469> there's<00:00:48.679> a<00:00:48.769> color

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
creates a match if there's a color

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.189 
creates a match if there's a color
that's<00:00:49.250> adjacent<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.179> same<00:00:50.359> color<00:00:50.600> game<00:00:50.929> gets

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
that's adjacent the same color game gets

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.959 
that's adjacent the same color game gets
incorporated<00:00:51.440> into<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:51.980> match<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:52.820> if<00:00:52.879> you

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
incorporated into the match so if you

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.060 
incorporated into the match so if you
make<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.149> black<00:00:53.390> match<00:00:53.570> its<00:00:53.929> water<00:00:54.530> if<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:54.920> make

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
make a black match its water if you make

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.950 
make a black match its water if you make
a<00:00:55.100> red<00:00:55.429> match<00:00:55.609> its<00:00:55.879> land<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:56.359> depending<00:00:56.750> on
