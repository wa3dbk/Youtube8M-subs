00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.070
 I finally this time range next 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.559
 Use yourself 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.160
 It was decided because the deck that uses Wis- Ur was settled down, so it is an introduction 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.360
 Ne 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.310
 Oh dear 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.400
 Usage is pasted in the explanation column It is as it is ur 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:30.250
 It is as the example play video 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.360
 It is the start of the part . I am absolutely stunned myself by the Got ability of the revival of the freezer 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.630
 not 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.630
 Present another effective cloth, but after a while 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.989
 I myself faint at all and then it is a cold sightseeing 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 Round one of the only over enemy of Energy is no longer up by combat force jerky 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.410
 Only in the teaching of the cyborg peach white white 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:59.390
 It will be twice as long as the fighting power is permanent, so the hit points are 2 games or less 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:05.880
 And up to round Tashi said three races power boats of the freezer revival 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:10.060
 If there is a Margott ball, it will automatically be invited to the machine . 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.439
 And if we enter round 2, this time 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:20.530
 The causes motor first hero type 2 years each ball that is life expectancy pride 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:22.610
 And with the other four being taken to the area of ​​the league match area and the Freezer revival battle force 3000 Ilia 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.440
 The issue 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:33.500
 Well as a guide is Hey rice if put out 15,000 thousand yen torque 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:37.280
 Well it 500 little less than we activate is now If you are is when the skills of Scouter enter the summer 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.220
 It is only round 2 but less than 500 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.220
 I will improve my team's fighting ability Yes 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:54.170
 In this same round 2 Hiro school is the deepest mountain version patch that is triggered 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:02:01.880
 It says that it is single trigger the enemy team battle force to 55% cut 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:04.320
 In both sounds good, even those that reduce 60% You're Well Potter thing called talking anymore 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.470
 It is good 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:14.640
 In in the selection process will ensure that captured 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:19.100
 I wonder if this is certain because it is ur in the example of Doctor Mu 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:25.310
 If it is used, it will be a little 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.170
 Well, if you win the battle 6 pattern, the swaying galactic rough guy activates and the enemy's 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.590
 Three energy 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.200
 Scrape 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:41.480
 And it is a cyborg peach white white with Jerky Tune at the time of the operation decision This will be activated 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:46.640
 If it falls into the area seen from here, this is a permanent day card 1500 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.659
 And it is said that the cells are much faster in charge impact than in peach white and white. 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.019
 It is a thing 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.019
 The computer and the interpersonal club are empty. 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.520
 Hey you 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:05.100
 If you carry over to round 3 then 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.850
 This is the ability of this time Regression of time 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.420
 Well at the end of the round 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.300
 I will return everyone to the record at the start of the round 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.640
 Power is good 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.530
 Well only one 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.910
 I have to be careful 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.660
 It is a battle force of the bottom It is using a computer 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.840
 Though it is something that we cut power to a glance 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:37.280
 I this 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:42.650
 It is that point at the time of the battle, and that activation timing will be the reverse of the sea ​​area this time 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.290
 Well that's the case in the play video when I did it, but time regression 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.890
 It is to have triggered earlier after the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.700
 So it coalesces red 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.330
 The battle force of instant death is activated and the record is one tick mark 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:01.180
 Of all the members of the team that was shaved 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:03.730
 And the reverse is also there, and the bottom battle force is activated first, and then accounting is activated for 2 hours 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.510
 There is also something to do 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.810
 I have been there several times now, I will use this chair. 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.670
 Even though it's different but I'm falling apart can 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.800
 It has been several times 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.620
 Because 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.750
 Because the fighting power in the city seems to be activated after return this time 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.850
 if there is 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.830
 Well I'm triggered 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:33.000
 It has just Well is that Do not combat forces not there after the time conference will fire Well 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.000
 Almost 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.390
 Well, if possible, it would be nice if the Deputy General Secretary's meeting would be activated after a naval battle force 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.240
 The still it almost sounds the opposite is often 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.450
 If it is based on it well, it is ur of this side young place Lian storage, so minus 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.310
 Key of energy 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:00.530
 You can change it to those who have it and as long as that 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.700
 Here the three of this ng scraping are reduced to two and changed to the bust 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.969
 I think I made the wind that'll 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.469
 Also because it is below Hirota 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.469
 Though we can cooperate 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:17.910
 Well, I wonder if I would like to make a difference 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:22.670
 In the head of ur and either of them 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:28.880
 If I'm still troubled I'm confused and round 3 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.630
 In carry got to activate it anymore This I same round It is sparking must stick 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.830
 Is it 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:39.620
 Well If you attacker Well but round 3 you know later 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:42.660
 Though certainly read to the order that I think the sparking of more of the above has been triggered 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.430
 Just forget about it and know 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.230
 More yes 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.889
 It is a super-sparking bonus of the direction of a fleeza or a guard Nep 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.719
 The 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:58.499
 I thing that'll shift find Energy is well towards the Sobawaka with those who say that'll shaved guard line 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.499
 Though 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:09.930
 You can also sound like you can park yourself 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:15.540
 Though Well I had forgotten little to say 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:20.310
 I think the subtitles It is energy charge cell button your hooters is on 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.920
 Land 3 in the read that the every round deathblow damage it a start Well have gone up the other day 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:27.139
 If you also 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.889
 Fixed up to 3000 Yes 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:37.910
