patting around sorry been working
extremely<00:00:15.150> hard<00:00:15.360> making<00:00:16.080> my<00:00:16.290> samples<00:00:16.620> for<00:00:16.740> CH

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
extremely hard making my samples for CH

extremely hard making my samples for CH
a<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.730> ghosting<00:00:18.180> technique<00:00:18.600> see<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
a this ghosting technique see this

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.660 
a this ghosting technique see this
ghosting<00:00:19.440> bleaching<00:00:20.220> effect<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.610> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
ghosting bleaching effect in the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.340 
ghosting bleaching effect in the
background<00:00:20.790> bit<00:00:21.360> like<00:00:21.540> this<00:00:21.689> Oh<00:00:21.779> bleach<00:00:22.050> but

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
background bit like this Oh bleach but

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.730 
background bit like this Oh bleach but
it<00:00:22.439> actually<00:00:22.610> brings<00:00:23.610> up<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.270> pattern<00:00:24.540> I<00:00:25.080> just

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it actually brings up a pattern I just

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.120 
it actually brings up a pattern I just
love<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.810> love<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.650> gonna<00:00:28.860> show

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
took a piece of card took some of my ink

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
took a piece of card took some of my ink
my<00:00:34.680> delusions<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.280> sprayed<00:00:36.270> them<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
my delusions and sprayed them on you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
my delusions and sprayed them on you
want<00:00:36.870> them<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.140> be<00:00:37.260> quite<00:00:37.500> dark<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:38.340> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
want them to be quite dark because you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.180 
want them to be quite dark because you
want<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:39.000> able<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.720> contrast<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
want to be able to see the contrast so

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
want to be able to see the contrast so
just<00:00:41.460> spray<00:00:42.590> here<00:00:43.590> then<00:00:43.829> every<00:00:44.129> row<00:00:44.280> don't

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
just spray here then every row don't

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860 
just spray here then every row don't
have<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> precise<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.649> see<00:00:46.859> not<00:00:47.870> think

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
have a precise as you can see not think

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.840 
have a precise as you can see not think
if<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.620> looking<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.129> dark<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:50.640> worry

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
if it's looking really dark don't worry

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.099 
if it's looking really dark don't worry
about<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.239> cuz<00:00:51.329> we're<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> lighten<00:00:52.019> it

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
about it cuz we're going to lighten it

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.799 
about it cuz we're going to lighten it
up<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.289> bit<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.620> some<00:00:53.309> water

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:19.310 

so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.870> always<00:00:58.079> take<00:00:59.179> some<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.600> build<00:01:19.049> up

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so I always take some and just build up

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
so I always take some and just build up
the<00:01:19.500> layers<00:01:19.850> with<00:01:20.850> some<00:01:21.000> dry<00:01:21.270> summers<00:01:21.630> well

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the layers with some dry summers well

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.560 
the layers with some dry summers well
the<00:01:21.900> dark<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.409> want<00:01:22.560> eight<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.460> less<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the dark you want eight the less you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.770 
the dark you want eight the less you
would<00:01:24.689> blot<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.500> kitchen<00:01:25.920> wrong<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
would blot the kitchen wrong so this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.550 
would blot the kitchen wrong so this
time<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.549> actually<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.350> see

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
time I'm going to actually can you see

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.130 
time I'm going to actually can you see
that<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> water<00:01:32.009> has<00:01:32.340> made<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.700> run

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
that the water has made that run

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
that the water has made that run
beautifully<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.009> time<00:01:35.280> I'm<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.610> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
beautifully so this time I'm going to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.320 
beautifully so this time I'm going to
dry

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.840 

just<00:01:42.930> get<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:43.290> much<00:01:43.440> of<00:01:43.650> it<00:01:43.740> dry<00:01:43.980> and<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.490> I'm

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
just get so much of it dry and then I'm

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.150 
just get so much of it dry and then I'm
going<00:01:45.000> tied<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> kitchen<00:01:45.870> now<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.950> dab

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
going tied to the kitchen now to dab

00:01:47.160 --> 00:02:11.140 
going tied to the kitchen now to dab
over<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> top

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.190 

then<00:02:12.150> what<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:13.050> we<00:02:13.710> take<00:02:15.020> stencil<00:02:16.020> this

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
then what we do is we take stencil this

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.860 
then what we do is we take stencil this
is<00:02:16.380> some<00:02:16.790> grunge<00:02:17.790> crunch<00:02:18.360> board<00:02:18.630> where<00:02:18.780> I've

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
is some grunge crunch board where I've

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.050 
is some grunge crunch board where I've
used<00:02:19.190> things<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.340> I've<00:02:20.430> pushed<00:02:20.640> out<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.000> I'm

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
used things that I've pushed out so I'm

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.610 
used things that I've pushed out so I'm
just<00:02:21.210> gonna<00:02:21.330> put<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.570> stencil<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:21.960> it<00:02:22.110> all<00:02:22.350> I'm

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
just gonna put the stencil on it all I'm

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:32.770 
just gonna put the stencil on it all I'm
going<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> take<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.340> water<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.660> I'm<00:02:24.840> just

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.170 

leave<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.260> activate<00:02:34.800> with<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> inks<00:02:36.060> you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
leave it to activate with the inks you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.510 
leave it to activate with the inks you
can<00:02:36.330> see<00:02:36.600> it's<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> same<00:02:37.290> position<00:02:38.280> as<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
can see it's in the same position as it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.310 
can see it's in the same position as it
was<00:02:38.640> through<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> stencil<00:02:41.000> leave<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.120> about

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
was through the stencil leave it about

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.930 
was through the stencil leave it about
10-15<00:02:43.320> seconds<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.310> longer<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.730> leave<00:02:44.880> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
10-15 seconds the longer you leave it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.020 
10-15 seconds the longer you leave it
the<00:02:45.300> more<00:02:45.330> contrast<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.440> will<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.520> then

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
the more contrast you will have and then

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.250 
the more contrast you will have and then
just<00:02:48.210> take<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> kitchen<00:02:48.600> roll

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
just take a kitchen roll

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.710 
just take a kitchen roll
just<00:02:49.860> dab<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.590> any<00:02:55.890> step<00:02:56.370> use<00:02:56.730> all<00:02:56.970> kinds<00:02:57.630> of

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
just dab so any step use all kinds of

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.830 
just dab so any step use all kinds of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
stencil stuff example I'll use the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:09.860
