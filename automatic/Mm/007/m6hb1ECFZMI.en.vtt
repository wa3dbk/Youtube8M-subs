00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
hello guys this is tushar from the time

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.980 
hello guys this is tushar from the time
revolution<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.449> today<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:21.930> to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
revolution is and today we are going to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.070 
revolution is and today we are going to
take<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> look<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.920> new<00:00:23.189> SSD<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:24.630> issues

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
take a look at the new SSD from issues

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:40.000 
take a look at the new SSD from issues
this<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.800> reader<00:00:26.010> express<00:00:26.519> pcie<00:00:26.810> SSD

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.690 

Oh

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.050 

so<00:00:46.330> it<00:00:46.480> comes<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:46.990> two<00:00:47.490> capacities<00:00:48.490> the<00:00:48.730> one<00:00:48.910> we

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
so it comes in two capacities the one we

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.140 
so it comes in two capacities the one we
have<00:00:49.240> here<00:00:49.270> is<00:00:49.660> 240<00:00:50.530> gigabytes<00:00:51.520> version

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
have here is 240 gigabytes version

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.550 
have here is 240 gigabytes version
there's<00:00:52.360> also<00:00:52.510> added<00:00:52.900> to<00:00:52.990> the<00:00:53.080> gigabytes

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
there's also added to the gigabytes

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.170 
there's also added to the gigabytes
polished<00:00:53.800> version<00:00:53.950> of<00:00:54.250> course<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:55.000> first

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
polished version of course the first

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.880 
polished version of course the first
thing<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.420> realize<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.900> distinct<00:00:56.800> the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
thing you realize that distinct the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.740 
thing you realize that distinct the
first<00:00:57.160> from<00:00:57.310> the<00:00:57.430> rest<00:00:57.610> is<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:57.940> it<00:00:58.210> comes<00:00:58.480> in

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
first from the rest is that it comes in

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.510 
first from the rest is that it comes in
a<00:00:58.840> PCI<00:00:59.080> Express<00:00:59.380> form<00:00:59.680> factor<00:01:00.010> instead<00:01:00.310> of<00:01:00.400> a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
a PCI Express form factor instead of a

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.850 
a PCI Express form factor instead of a
SATA<00:01:00.880> 6<00:01:01.450> feet<00:01:01.780> per<00:01:01.900> second<00:01:02.200> form<00:01:02.410> factor<00:01:02.680> so

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
SATA 6 feet per second form factor so

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.670 
SATA 6 feet per second form factor so
you<00:01:02.920> may<00:01:03.340> reduce<00:01:04.239> number<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.720> usage<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.350> your

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
you may reduce number of usage of your

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.130 
you may reduce number of usage of your
SATA<00:01:06.070> ports<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:07.030> stick<00:01:07.300> so<00:01:07.630> this<00:01:07.900> actually

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
SATA ports and stick so this actually

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.030 
SATA ports and stick so this actually
runs<00:01:08.620> on<00:01:09.060> pci<00:01:10.060> express<00:01:10.450> X<00:01:10.780> 2<00:01:11.080> slot<00:01:11.350> but<00:01:11.770> that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
runs on pci express X 2 slot but that

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.300 
runs on pci express X 2 slot but that
means<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.520> will<00:01:12.640> also<00:01:13.150> fit<00:01:13.510> in<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.500> X<00:01:14.680> 16<00:01:15.100> or

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
means it will also fit in the X 16 or

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.060 
means it will also fit in the X 16 or
even<00:01:15.520> x8<00:01:15.940> or<00:01:16.060> even<00:01:16.240> x4<00:01:16.810> slot<00:01:17.050> definitely<00:01:17.920> of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
even x8 or even x4 slot definitely of

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.050 
even x8 or even x4 slot definitely of
course<00:01:18.340> x2<00:01:18.910> but<00:01:19.090> not<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.600> x1<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.490> this<00:01:21.759> is<00:01:21.940> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
course x2 but not and x1 so this is the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.160 
course x2 but not and x1 so this is the
refer<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.450> is<00:01:22.600> actually<00:01:22.900> part<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.110> the

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
refer this is actually part of the

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.950 
refer this is actually part of the
republic<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.740> gamers<00:01:24.009> series<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.330> 10<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.750> 10

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
republic of gamers series so 10 of 10

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.570 
republic of gamers series so 10 of 10
also<00:01:26.110> means<00:01:26.410> that<00:01:26.470> it's<00:01:26.920> definitely<00:01:27.430> for

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
also means that it's definitely for

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580 
also means that it's definitely for
those<00:01:27.759> gamers<00:01:28.060> who<00:01:28.420> wants<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.900> extra<00:01:29.259> speed

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
those gamers who wants the extra speed

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.370 
those gamers who wants the extra speed
for<00:01:30.280> their<00:01:30.700> system<00:01:31.030> this<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.420> definitely<00:01:31.540> once

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
for their system this is definitely once

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.480 
for their system this is definitely once
that<00:01:32.619> has<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.130> death<00:01:33.310> of<00:01:33.520> extreme<00:01:34.390> speeds<00:01:34.720> so

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that has the death of extreme speeds so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.120 
that has the death of extreme speeds so
the<00:01:36.490> 240<00:01:37.119> but<00:01:37.420> funny<00:01:37.720> gigabyte<00:01:38.170> version<00:01:38.200> has<00:01:39.100> a

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
the 240 but funny gigabyte version has a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.609 
the 240 but funny gigabyte version has a
sequential<00:01:39.640> read<00:01:40.000> speed<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.450> 830<00:01:41.110> megabytes

actually true the roof crazy speaks that

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.880 
actually true the roof crazy speaks that
you<00:01:48.790> have<00:01:49.000> never<00:01:49.570> attained<00:01:49.990> from<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.440> standard

you have never attained from a standard

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.240 
you have never attained from a standard
I<00:01:51.039> would<00:01:51.819> say<00:01:52.000> your<00:01:52.569> standard<00:01:52.990> Sebaste<00:01:53.950> GOP

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
I would say your standard Sebaste GOP

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
this the one of the main things that

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.859 
this the one of the main things that
this<00:02:08.440> approach<00:02:08.709> is<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.660> compatibility<00:02:10.660> mode

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
this approach is the compatibility mode

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.750 
this approach is the compatibility mode
in<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.200> sense<00:02:11.440> there<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.610> actually

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
in that sense there you can actually

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.840 
in that sense there you can actually
switch<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> four-color<00:02:14.770> ufe<00:02:15.280> more<00:02:15.490> debt

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
switch to a four-color ufe more debt

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.210 
switch to a four-color ufe more debt
than<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.050> allow<00:02:17.380> windows

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
than so that you can allow windows

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.180 
than so that you can allow windows
installation<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.240> secure<00:02:20.020> boot<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.950> means

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
installation is a secure boot that means

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.520 
installation is a secure boot that means
you<00:02:21.790> can<00:02:22.270> be<00:02:22.360> very<00:02:22.569> very<00:02:22.660> secure<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.440> are

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
you can be very very secure if you are

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.990 
you can be very very secure if you are

driver<00:02:28.930> free<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.410> can<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.650> plug<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.130> in

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
driver free so you can just plug it in

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.730 
driver free so you can just plug it in
and<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:30.880> install<00:02:31.360> windows<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> directly<00:02:32.440> on

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
and then install windows it directly on

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.460 
and then install windows it directly on
the<00:02:33.250> SSD<00:02:33.730> oh<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:34.209> course<00:02:34.240> we'll<00:02:35.050> definitely<00:02:35.260> do

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the SSD oh of course we'll definitely do

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.520 
the SSD oh of course we'll definitely do
some<00:02:35.620> benchmarks<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.810> results

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
some benchmarks on this and the results

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.350 
some benchmarks on this and the results
will<00:02:38.590> be<00:02:38.650> shown<00:02:38.860> later

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
mega by the data transfers we are

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.860 
mega by the data transfers we are
looking<00:04:34.390> at<00:04:34.630> schools<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.500> each<00:04:36.360> 785<00:04:37.360> megawatt

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
looking at schools of each 785 megawatt

looking at schools of each 785 megawatt
occurs<00:04:38.110> again<00:04:38.470> which<00:04:39.100> is<00:04:39.130> still<00:04:39.550> quite<00:04:39.970> close

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
occurs again which is still quite close

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.290 
occurs again which is still quite close
to<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.780> stated<00:04:41.169> but<00:04:41.320> not<00:04:41.590> picking<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.300> speeds

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
to the stated but not picking the speeds

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.740 
to the stated but not picking the speeds
of<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.480> state<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:43.990> speaks<00:04:44.650> on<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.520> box<00:04:45.750> but

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
of the state that speaks on the box but

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.870 
of the state that speaks on the box but
of<00:04:46.930> course<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:47.320> can<00:04:47.560> realize<00:04:47.890> that<00:04:48.160> once<00:04:48.490> we

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
of course you can realize that once we

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.270 
of course you can realize that once we
are<00:04:48.910> having<00:04:49.330> from<00:04:49.660> one<00:04:49.900> megabyte<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.560> data

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
are having from one megabyte of data

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.600 
are having from one megabyte of data
size<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.180> above<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:53.350> speeds<00:04:53.680> are<00:04:53.800> kind<00:04:54.520> of

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
size and above the speeds are kind of

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.540 
size and above the speeds are kind of
the<00:04:54.669> same<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.510> for<00:04:56.080> me<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.230> is<00:04:56.410> where<00:04:56.830> it

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
the same so for me that is where it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.300 
the same so for me that is where it
reaches<00:04:58.180> its<00:04:58.360> maximum<00:04:58.540> maximum<00:04:59.470> performance

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
reaches its maximum maximum performance

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.100 
reaches its maximum maximum performance
at<00:05:01.180> around<00:05:03.060> 787<00:05:04.060> seven<00:05:04.479> or<00:05:04.630> eight<00:05:04.750> megabytes

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
at around 787 seven or eight megabytes

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.200 
at around 787 seven or eight megabytes
per<00:05:05.380> second<00:05:05.650> for<00:05:05.800> both<00:05:05.979> we<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.190> right<00:05:06.520> in<00:05:07.000> this

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
per second for both we and right in this

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.550 
per second for both we and right in this
rain<00:05:07.450> zero<00:05:07.720> configuration<00:05:07.900> for<00:05:08.560> the

rain zero configuration for the

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.490 
rain zero configuration for the

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
so that's it for the benchmarks we have

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:22.380 
so that's it for the benchmarks we have
