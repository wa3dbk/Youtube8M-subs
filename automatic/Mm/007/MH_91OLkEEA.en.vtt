00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
before so I gave it a go I am giving it

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.859 
before so I gave it a go I am giving it
a<00:00:22.529> go<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:24.000> seed<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.390> actually<00:00:24.630> just

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
a go and this is my seed I actually just

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
found the seed 10 minutes ago so I

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.670 
found the seed 10 minutes ago so I
thought<00:00:27.119> hey<00:00:27.390> let's<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> showcase<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
another island which is actually a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.330 
another island which is actually a
really<00:00:43.020> cool<00:00:43.170> shape<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.770> got<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> end<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
the jungle tree are some mushrooms and

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.459 
the jungle tree are some mushrooms and
it's<00:00:47.579> kind<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> huge<00:00:48.660> crescent<00:00:49.289> shape

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
it's kind of like a huge crescent shape

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010 
it's kind of like a huge crescent shape
it's<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:49.829> sand<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> bit<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.539> jungle

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
it's all sand but with a bit of jungle

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.689 
it's all sand but with a bit of jungle
on<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.170> as<00:00:52.289> well<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.100> actually<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
on it as well and I actually think it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.569 
on it as well and I actually think it
looks<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.420> really<00:00:54.750> cool<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
looks really really cool so if I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.279 
looks really really cool so if I
actually<00:00:56.730> fly<00:00:57.030> over<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> bit

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
actually fly over here there is a bit

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
actually fly over here there is a bit
more<00:00:58.440> round<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:58.980> oh<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> chunks<00:01:00.210> ever

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
more round here oh if the chunks ever

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.889 
more round here oh if the chunks ever
load<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.890> this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.520> huge<00:01:03.239> extreme

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
load and this is actually a huge extreme

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.050 
load and this is actually a huge extreme
Hills<00:01:04.199> by<00:01:04.409> him<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.710> next<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> us<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.939> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
Hills by him right next to us and as you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
Hills by him right next to us and as you
can<00:01:06.210> probably<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.740> actually

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
can probably see here there is actually

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.469 
can probably see here there is actually
a<00:01:08.420> village<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.619> mod<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
a village and this is actually a mod so

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.670 
a village and this is actually a mod so
this<00:01:12.479> probably<00:01:12.810> won't<00:01:12.960> appear<00:01:13.260> few<00:01:13.470> unless

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
this probably won't appear few unless

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
this probably won't appear few unless
you've<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> modern<00:01:14.220> stalled<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:14.670> this

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you've all the modern stalled but this

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
you've all the modern stalled but this
villager<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> actually<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.920> but

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
villager is actually here for me but

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.160 
villager is actually here for me but
that's<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> main<00:01:18.240> thing<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.990> this

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that's not the main thing is really this

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.830 
that's not the main thing is really this
like<00:01:19.350> huge<00:01:19.740> extreme<00:01:20.369> Hills<00:01:20.610> biome<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.060> I'm

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
like huge extreme Hills biome and I'm

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.030 
like huge extreme Hills biome and I'm
guessing<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.320> there's<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.799> lot

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
guessing that there's going to be a lot

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
guessing that there's going to be a lot
of<00:01:23.070> emeralds<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:25.350> back<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of emeralds here so if you go back to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.260 
of emeralds here so if you go back to
this<00:01:25.799> island<00:01:26.070> obviously<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.060> some

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this island obviously you could do some

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.630 
this island obviously you could do some
sort<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> epic<00:01:28.350> survival<00:01:28.560> island<00:01:29.040> thing<00:01:29.460> here

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
sort of epic survival island thing here

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
sort of epic survival island thing here
on<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.090> jungle<00:01:30.420> island<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.990> wouldn't

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
on this little jungle island I wouldn't

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.960 
on this little jungle island I wouldn't
be<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:31.890> hard<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.430> obviously<00:01:32.640> there's<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
be very hard because obviously there's a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
be very hard because obviously there's a
lot<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.150> wood<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.659> there's<00:01:34.380> quite<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
lot of wood and there's quite a lot of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
lot of wood and there's quite a lot of
space<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:36.060> fun<00:01:36.299> because

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
space but I think be really fun because

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.469 
space but I think be really fun because
obviously<00:01:37.549> it's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.610> lot<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.850> sand<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
obviously it's a lot of sand and you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.260 
obviously it's a lot of sand and you
could<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.110> sort<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.400> mice<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.790> monument

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
could do some sort of mice and monument

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
could do some sort of mice and monument
or<00:01:42.420> something<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
or something like that so this is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.639 
or something like that so this is
actually<00:01:44.610> my<00:01:44.880> first<00:01:44.909> seed<00:01:45.450> showcase<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.110> hope

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
actually my first seed showcase I hope

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
actually my first seed showcase I hope
you<00:01:46.770> found<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.100> interesting<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:48.060> seed<00:01:48.329> should

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you found it interesting the seed should

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.139 
you found it interesting the seed should
be<00:01:48.689> hopefully<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.579> description<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:50.820> maybe

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
be hopefully in the description or maybe

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.880 
be hopefully in the description or maybe
I<00:01:51.360> might<00:01:51.600> put<00:01:51.750> across<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> top<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.619> video

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I might put across the top of the video

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
I might put across the top of the video
and<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> prove<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.149> this

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and now to prove to you that this

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.959 
and now to prove to you that this
actually<00:01:54.630> works<00:01:54.990> um<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.790> go<00:01:56.880> ahead

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
actually works um I can just go ahead

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
actually works um I can just go ahead
and<00:01:57.090> type<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> seat<00:01:57.960> again<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.409> want

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and type in the seat again if you want

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:07.660 
and type in the seat again if you want
me<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.759> sow<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.790> seed<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.279 

and<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.269> is<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.390> seed<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:09.869> hoping<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and that is the seed and I'm hoping I

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.020 
and that is the seed and I'm hoping I
put<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:10.860> because<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.879> doesn't

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
put it in right because if it doesn't

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.250 
put it in right because if it doesn't
work<00:02:12.239> I'm<00:02:12.450> gonna<00:02:12.599> look<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.810> complete

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
