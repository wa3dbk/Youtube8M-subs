00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello to the cooks we always finish 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.540
 with a lot of appliances that 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.580
 We do not really need yogurt 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.410
 For example, it's a classic but there 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.920
 some that from time to time 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.169
 tools 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.390
 for example this bean peeler that is 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.400
 a very simple piece and that as you can see 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.489
 it works pretty well it's not really 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.650
 mine is from my aunt Marie tereza and it turns out 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.329
 useful if you have a garden with many 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.869
 beans but the truth is that you can 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.869
 do by hand 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.330
 well we go with the recipe the first thing that 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.330
 we do is chop the garlic 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.750
 and we put it on a high way with a 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.680
 trickle of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:02.720
 add the finely chopped onion 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.720
 salpimentamos stir and let pochar 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.850
 while we go the tomatoes 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.960
 and when the onion starts to 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.479
 make it transparent we add it 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.990
 we go back to salt and leave it or 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.990
 'Facebook' 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.920
 let's go now with the artichokes if the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.990
 are going to be immediately incorporated into the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.510
 pot it is not necessary but if you go to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.550
 take even a few seconds is better 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.530
 have a bowl of water and a splash of 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.810
 lemon to put it immediately and that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.230
 do not oxidize good as you see we clean it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230
 all right 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.290
 we remove the hairs that can come out in 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.060
 the interior especially if it is not very 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.060
 fresh and we incorporate it to the sofrito 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.350
 we also add the beans 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.720
 and we cover them well with water we remove and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.700
 here you should get salt in case it is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.710
 necessary to add a little more you can 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.300
 put a little parsley and in this 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.300
 case I put four mint leaves 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.080
 and this we cover and leave it about 20 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.080
 minutes 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.470
 while we're going to toast the bread what 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.480
 we put in a mortar or in the glass of the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.460
 blender and in the same pan we add 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.900
 a little more oil and toasted the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.900
 Paprika barely a few seconds 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.120
 we put it in the glass and to make it more 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.890
 easy to crush it let's add a little 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.579
 of the broth in which they are doing 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.579
 the beans 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.829
 do not 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.140
 and we crush it well 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.890
 do not 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:21.390
 and we re incorporate them into the stew so that 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.390
 so take more body 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.810
 and this in five more minutes is already 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.040
 ready good I hope you liked it 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.040
 a hug until then
