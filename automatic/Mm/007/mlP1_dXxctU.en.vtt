you can line it up and you free and you
can<00:02:17.760> predict<00:02:18.180> these<00:02:18.300> shots<00:02:18.860> because<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.010> takes

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
can predict these shots because it takes

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
can predict these shots because it takes
such<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.460> long<00:02:20.700> time<00:02:20.970> for<00:02:21.270> your<00:02:21.360> bullet<00:02:21.660> to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
reach where it's going to go half the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.820 
reach where it's going to go half the
time<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.660> enemy<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.050> going<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.290> stop<00:02:25.530> they're

time the enemy is going to stop they're

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.380 
time the enemy is going to stop they're
going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> deviate<00:02:26.250> from<00:02:26.550> where<00:02:26.880> you're<00:02:27.030> going

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.760

and<00:02:27.600> because<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.020> have<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.290> predict<00:02:28.680> like

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
and because you have to predict like

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.890 
and because you have to predict like
four<00:02:29.160> seconds<00:02:29.700> into<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> future<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.600> line<00:02:30.780> up

these headshots if they stop on the dime
and<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.420> guys<00:02:33.600> know<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:34.080> that's<00:02:34.350> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
not going to take you very long to go

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.890 
not going to take you very long to go
through<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.830> animation<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:06.209> simply

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
through that animation but simply

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.560 
through that animation but simply
because<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.980> slow<00:03:08.400> bolt<00:03:08.700> velocity<00:03:09.360> it

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
because of that slow bolt velocity it

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.990 
because of that slow bolt velocity it
completely<00:03:10.530> ruins<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.040> gun<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.459> me<00:03:11.550> like<00:03:11.790> I

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
completely ruins the gun for me like I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.670 
completely ruins the gun for me like I
had<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.420> many<00:03:12.570> moments<00:03:12.780> where<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.320> was

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
had so many moments where I was

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.380 
had so many moments where I was
physically<00:03:14.430> getting<00:03:14.700> upset<00:03:15.150> with

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
physically getting upset with

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.820 
physically getting upset with
battlefield<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.990> was<00:03:16.110> physically<00:03:16.590> getting

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
battlefield I was physically getting

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.800 
battlefield I was physically getting
upset<00:03:17.130> with<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> game<00:03:17.550> because<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.300> had<00:03:18.720> to

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
upset with the game because I had to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.810 
upset with the game because I had to
predict<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.440> far<00:03:19.769> into<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.130> future<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.640> line

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
predict so far into the future to line

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.670 
predict so far into the future to line
up<00:03:20.940> these<00:03:21.090> headshots<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.750> maybe<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:22.560> just

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
up these headshots and maybe it's just

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.990 
up these headshots and maybe it's just
because<00:03:22.920> I'm<00:03:23.040> bad<00:03:23.220> at<00:03:23.340> sniping<00:03:23.550> like<00:03:23.850> I've

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
because I'm bad at sniping like I've

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.340 
because I'm bad at sniping like I've
already<00:03:24.180> admitted<00:03:24.390> I'm<00:03:24.720> not<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.959> best<00:03:25.110> sniper

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
already admitted I'm not the best sniper

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.440 
already admitted I'm not the best sniper
in<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.560> game<00:03:25.830> but<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.400> pick<00:03:26.640> up<00:03:26.820> like<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> SRR

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
in the game but I pick up like the SRR

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.680 
in the game but I pick up like the SRR
61<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.560> pick<00:03:28.800> up<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.430> goal<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.940> do<00:03:30.239> far

61 I pick up the the goal I do far

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.750 
61 I pick up the the goal I do far
better<00:03:30.959> with<00:03:31.230> those<00:03:31.440> guns<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.070> while<00:03:32.370> yes

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
of my enemy if you can tell I was a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.460 
of my enemy if you can tell I was a
little<00:03:50.970> upset<00:03:51.480> when<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.690> started<00:03:52.049> checking<00:03:52.260> out

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
little upset when I started checking out

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.039 
little upset when I started checking out
the<00:03:52.650> CS<00:03:52.980> 5<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.360> thing<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.870> worth

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
the CS 5 the one thing that is worth

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.810 
the CS 5 the one thing that is worth
mentioning<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.160> suppressor<00:03:56.670> on

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
mentioning is that the suppressor on

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.610 
mentioning is that the suppressor on
this<00:03:57.030> isn't<00:03:57.750> as<00:03:57.870> large<00:03:58.080> of<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.350> hindrance

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
this isn't as large of a hindrance

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.680 
this isn't as large of a hindrance
compared<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.549> other<00:03:59.700> bolt-action<00:04:00.299> rifles

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
compared to the other bolt-action rifles

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.840 
compared to the other bolt-action rifles
like<00:04:00.840> once<00:04:01.049> again<00:04:01.200> this<00:04:01.470> has<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:02.040> normal<00:04:02.730> bullet

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
like once again this has a normal bullet

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.729 
like once again this has a normal bullet
velocity<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.450> 400<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.260> slap<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
velocity of 400 you slap on the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.860 
velocity of 400 you slap on the
suppressor<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:05.280> drops<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.640> 300<00:04:06.330> but<00:04:06.720> let's

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
suppressor it drops it to 300 but let's

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.610 
suppressor it drops it to 300 but let's
say<00:04:06.959> for<00:04:06.989> example<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.709> use<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.610> SRR<00:04:09.000> 61<00:04:09.690> it

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
say for example you use the SRR 61 it

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.250 
say for example you use the SRR 61 it
goes<00:04:10.799> from<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.360> 620<00:04:12.360> all<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.690> way<00:04:12.780> down<00:04:13.019> to

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
goes from like 620 all the way down to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.590 
goes from like 620 all the way down to
like<00:04:13.430> 320<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:14.580> it's<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.850> massive<00:04:15.450> difference

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
like 320 like it's a massive difference

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.090 
like 320 like it's a massive difference
when<00:04:15.930> you're<00:04:15.989> using<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.350> other<00:04:16.470> bolt-action

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
when you're using the other bolt-action

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.250 
when you're using the other bolt-action
rifles<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.150> guess<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.720> could<00:04:18.870> say<00:04:18.930> that

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
rifles and so I guess you could say that

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.260 
rifles and so I guess you could say that
is<00:04:19.440> one<00:04:19.709> redeeming<00:04:20.010> quality<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.729> using<00:04:21.120> this

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
is one redeeming quality of using this

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.380 
is one redeeming quality of using this
gun<00:04:21.479> but<00:04:22.260> personally<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:23.180> suppressor<00:04:24.180> on<00:04:24.210> a

sniper rifle

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.180 
sniper rifle
doesn't<00:04:26.229> make<00:04:26.289> any<00:04:26.349> sense<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:26.860> it's<00:04:27.009> almost

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
doesn't make any sense like it's almost

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.210 
doesn't make any sense like it's almost

that<00:04:34.780> stealthy<00:04:35.199> roll<00:04:35.410> then<00:04:35.860> absolutely<00:04:36.370> that

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
that stealthy roll then absolutely that

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.129 
that stealthy roll then absolutely that
is<00:04:36.759> that<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.270> best<00:04:37.300> way<00:04:37.599> to<00:04:37.630> go<00:04:37.870> about<00:04:37.990> it

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
is that is the best way to go about it

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.659 
is that is the best way to go about it
slap<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.650> on<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.830> suppressor<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.280> going<00:04:39.580> to

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
slap it on the suppressor is going to

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.640 
slap it on the suppressor is going to
fulfill<00:04:39.789> that<00:04:39.970> role<00:04:40.360> but<00:04:40.960> because<00:04:41.319> of<00:04:41.349> the<00:04:41.530> way

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
fulfill that role but because of the way

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.350 
fulfill that role but because of the way
that<00:04:41.830> dice<00:04:42.039> has<00:04:42.220> gone<00:04:42.400> about<00:04:42.610> balancing<00:04:43.180> out

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
that dice has gone about balancing out

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.450 
that dice has gone about balancing out
these<00:04:43.599> weapons<00:04:44.080> yeah<00:04:44.800> you're<00:04:45.099> off<00:04:45.250> the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
these weapons yeah you're off the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.550 
these weapons yeah you're off the
mini-map<00:04:45.849> but<00:04:46.120> there's<00:04:46.240> also<00:04:46.449> two<00:04:46.660> other<00:04:47.259> ways

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
mini-map but there's also two other ways

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.379 
mini-map but there's also two other ways
that<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> enemy<00:04:48.160> can<00:04:48.400> pinpoint<00:04:48.669> your<00:04:49.000> exact

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
that the enemy can pinpoint your exact

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.689 
that the enemy can pinpoint your exact
location<00:04:49.650> there<00:04:50.650> were<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:51.009> many<00:04:51.130> moments<00:04:51.370> when

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
location there were so many moments when

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.460 
location there were so many moments when
I<00:04:51.729> fired<00:04:52.000> off<00:04:52.210> on<00:04:52.389> an<00:04:52.509> enemy<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.930> they<00:04:53.080> saw<00:04:53.259> my

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
I fired off on an enemy and they saw my

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.100 
I fired off on an enemy and they saw my
vapor<00:04:53.650> trail<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.460> vapor<00:04:54.669> trail<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.389> yes<00:04:55.900> I

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
vapor trail the vapor trail is yes I

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.740 
vapor trail the vapor trail is yes I
guess<00:04:56.380> one<00:04:56.710> way<00:04:56.919> for<00:04:57.160> you<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.340> pinpoint<00:04:58.000> or<00:04:58.539> try

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
guess one way for you to pinpoint or try

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.089 
guess one way for you to pinpoint or try
to<00:04:58.780> track<00:04:59.139> where<00:04:59.349> your<00:04:59.440> bullet<00:04:59.710> is<00:04:59.800> heading

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
to track where your bullet is heading

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.219 
to track where your bullet is heading
but<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.639> also<00:05:00.759> lets<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.210> enemy<00:05:01.509> know<00:05:01.630> exactly

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
but it also lets the enemy know exactly

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.600 
but it also lets the enemy know exactly
where<00:05:02.500> your<00:05:02.620> bullet<00:05:02.860> is<00:05:02.949> heading<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.430> this

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
where your bullet is heading and this

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.730 
where your bullet is heading and this
was<00:05:03.849> a<00:05:03.880> mechanism<00:05:04.479> I'm<00:05:04.870> assuming<00:05:05.229> dice<00:05:05.380> put<00:05:05.590> in

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
was a mechanism I'm assuming dice put in

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.460 
was a mechanism I'm assuming dice put in
so<00:05:06.250> that's<00:05:06.789> if<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.240> sniper<00:05:07.750> was<00:05:07.990> on<00:05:08.110> top<00:05:08.259> of<00:05:08.289> a

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
so that's if a sniper was on top of a

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.170 
so that's if a sniper was on top of a
roof<00:05:08.620> top<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.099> you<00:05:09.159> got<00:05:09.280> shot<00:05:09.520> at<00:05:09.669> by<00:05:09.699> a<00:05:09.849> sniper

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
roof top and you got shot at by a sniper

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.969 
roof top and you got shot at by a sniper
you<00:05:10.449> at<00:05:10.840> least<00:05:11.050> would<00:05:11.259> have<00:05:11.289> some<00:05:11.620> idea<00:05:11.919> of

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
you at least would have some idea of

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.409 
you at least would have some idea of
where<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.400> bullet<00:05:12.580> was<00:05:12.699> coming<00:05:13.030> from<00:05:13.180> and

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
where that bullet was coming from and

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.610 
where that bullet was coming from and
then<00:05:13.479> you<00:05:13.599> could<00:05:13.750> either<00:05:13.840> duck<00:05:14.110> behind<00:05:14.409> cover

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
then you could either duck behind cover

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.350 
then you could either duck behind cover
or<00:05:14.919> try<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.159> close<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.580> gap<00:05:15.699> and<00:05:15.849> take<00:05:16.030> em<00:05:16.210> out

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
or try to close the gap and take em out

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.570 
or try to close the gap and take em out
so<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.960> vapor<00:05:17.169> trail<00:05:17.530> for<00:05:17.770> long<00:05:17.979> distance<00:05:18.400> IV

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
so the vapor trail for long distance IV

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.430 
so the vapor trail for long distance IV
sniping<00:05:19.060> makes<00:05:19.240> sense<00:05:19.509> but<00:05:19.990> if<00:05:20.110> you're<00:05:20.229> right

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
sniping makes sense but if you're right

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.350 
sniping makes sense but if you're right
next<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.860> someone<00:05:21.310> or<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.699> know<00:05:21.789> a<00:05:21.819> fair

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
next to someone or you know a fair

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.420 
next to someone or you know a fair
distance<00:05:22.630> medium<00:05:23.020> distance<00:05:23.289> away<00:05:23.560> having<00:05:24.310> the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
distance medium distance away having the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.700 
distance medium distance away having the
vapor<00:05:24.669> trail<00:05:25.090> pinpoint<00:05:25.870> pretty<00:05:26.169> much<00:05:26.349> exactly

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
vapor trail pinpoint pretty much exactly

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.680 
vapor trail pinpoint pretty much exactly
where<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:27.280> are<00:05:27.310> while<00:05:27.970> you're<00:05:28.210> using<00:05:28.449> a

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
where you are while you're using a

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.589 
where you are while you're using a
suppressor<00:05:29.289> is<00:05:29.610> pretty<00:05:30.610> much<00:05:30.789> just<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.449> big

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
suppressor is pretty much just a big

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.990 
suppressor is pretty much just a big
slap<00:05:31.960> in<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.139> face<00:05:32.340> not<00:05:33.340> only<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.729> but<00:05:33.880> if

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
slap in the face not only that but if

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.640 
slap in the face not only that but if
you're<00:05:34.120> using<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.599> higher<00:05:34.810> optic<00:05:35.320> like<00:05:35.530> the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
you're using a higher optic like the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.129 
you're using a higher optic like the
eight-time<00:05:36.130> scope<00:05:36.550> once<00:05:37.389> again<00:05:37.719> they're

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
eight-time scope once again they're

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.480 
eight-time scope once again they're
going<00:05:38.259> to<00:05:38.320> be<00:05:38.380> able<00:05:38.560> to<00:05:38.740> find<00:05:38.949> you<00:05:39.130> out<00:05:39.280> because

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
going to be able to find you out because

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.730 
going to be able to find you out because
of<00:05:39.940> the<00:05:40.270> sniper<00:05:40.570> glint<00:05:40.960> so<00:05:41.080> even<00:05:41.349> if<00:05:41.469> you<00:05:41.560> are

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
of the sniper glint so even if you are

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.320 
of the sniper glint so even if you are
playing<00:05:42.039> aggressively<00:05:42.610> you're<00:05:42.909> using<00:05:43.240> the

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
playing aggressively you're using the

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.939 
playing aggressively you're using the
bolt-action<00:05:43.900> rifle<00:05:44.259> and<00:05:44.469> you're<00:05:44.560> running<00:05:44.800> you

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
bolt-action rifle and you're running you

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.560 
bolt-action rifle and you're running you
know<00:05:45.159> running<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.490> gunning<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:46.180> I<00:05:46.240> guess<00:05:46.419> you

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
know running and gunning and I guess you

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.730 
know running and gunning and I guess you
could<00:05:46.719> say<00:05:46.900> that<00:05:47.169> you<00:05:47.289> shouldn't<00:05:47.500> be<00:05:47.620> running

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
could say that you shouldn't be running

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.439 
could say that you shouldn't be running
and<00:05:47.979> gunning<00:05:48.070> with<00:05:48.340> a<00:05:48.370> higher<00:05:48.580> optic<00:05:49.060> but

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
and gunning with a higher optic but

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.999 
and gunning with a higher optic but
still<00:05:49.719> just<00:05:50.050> because<00:05:50.259> of<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.650> way<00:05:50.770> that

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
still just because of the way that

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.709 
still just because of the way that
they've<00:05:51.159> gone<00:05:51.310> about<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.909> the<00:05:52.150> bolt-action

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:52.719 
they've gone about the the bolt-action

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.779 
they've gone about the the bolt-action
rifle<00:05:53.020> mechanics<00:05:53.469> is<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.860> while<00:05:54.159> yes<00:05:54.430> you're

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
rifle mechanics is that while yes you're

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.490 
rifle mechanics is that while yes you're
not<00:05:54.969> on<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.240> mini-map<00:05:55.479> but<00:05:55.930> there's<00:05:56.110> so<00:05:56.380> many

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
not on the mini-map but there's so many

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.350 
not on the mini-map but there's so many
other<00:05:56.710> ways<00:05:56.919> for<00:05:56.949> the<00:05:57.190> enemy<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.610> pinpoint

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
other ways for the enemy to pinpoint

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.540

you out and so the one place where I at

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:04.980 
you out and so the one place where I at

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
have some success with the cs5 on those

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.719 
have some success with the cs5 on those
game<00:06:34.719> modes<00:06:35.139> once<00:06:35.710> again<00:06:36.039> I<00:06:36.219> still<00:06:36.460> felt<00:06:36.699> like

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
game modes once again I still felt like

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.630 
game modes once again I still felt like
if<00:06:36.909> I<00:06:36.969> was<00:06:37.150> using<00:06:37.360> the<00:06:37.960> the<00:06:38.139> SRR<00:06:38.440> 61<00:06:39.070> or<00:06:39.310> the

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
if I was using the the SRR 61 or the

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.010 
if I was using the the SRR 61 or the
I<00:06:39.880> would<00:06:40.030> still<00:06:40.210> have<00:06:40.420> a<00:06:40.450> lot<00:06:40.660> more<00:06:40.690> success

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
I would still have a lot more success

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.330 
I would still have a lot more success
because<00:06:41.530> I<00:06:41.560> wouldn't<00:06:41.770> have<00:06:41.830> to<00:06:41.980> predict<00:06:42.250> the

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
because I wouldn't have to predict the

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.310 
because I wouldn't have to predict the
movement<00:06:42.640> of<00:06:42.760> my<00:06:42.850> enemy<00:06:43.180> as<00:06:43.330> often<00:06:43.660> but<00:06:44.140> it's

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
movement of my enemy as often but it's

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.890 
movement of my enemy as often but it's
still<00:06:44.590> it<00:06:44.890> seems<00:06:45.190> to<00:06:45.400> be<00:06:45.520> like<00:06:45.880> the<00:06:46.390> best<00:06:46.540> game

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
still it seems to be like the best game

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.290 
still it seems to be like the best game
mode<00:06:47.170> for<00:06:47.200> this<00:06:47.650> particular<00:06:48.130> weapon<00:06:48.340> and<00:06:48.850> so

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
mode for this particular weapon and so

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.020 
mode for this particular weapon and so
overall<00:06:49.570> I<00:06:49.960> just<00:06:50.530> can't<00:06:51.070> see<00:06:51.250> myself<00:06:51.280> using

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
overall I just can't see myself using

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.680 
overall I just can't see myself using
the<00:06:52.540> cs5<00:06:53.080> anymore<00:06:53.560> at<00:06:53.680> least<00:06:53.950> on<00:06:54.190> normal<00:06:54.610> mode

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
the cs5 anymore at least on normal mode

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.480 
the cs5 anymore at least on normal mode
yes<00:06:55.690> it's<00:06:55.900> got<00:06:56.020> some<00:06:56.230> amazing<00:06:56.440> stats<00:06:56.920> yes<00:06:57.310> if

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
yes it's got some amazing stats yes if

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.920 
yes it's got some amazing stats yes if
you<00:06:57.580> want<00:06:57.730> to<00:06:57.790> play<00:06:57.910> aggressively<00:06:58.390> and<00:06:58.600> use<00:06:58.780> it

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
you want to play aggressively and use it

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.750 
you want to play aggressively and use it
more<00:06:59.140> like<00:06:59.560> a<00:06:59.740> shotgun<00:07:00.070> you<00:07:00.280> can<00:07:00.520> have<00:07:00.640> these

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:00.760 
more like a shotgun you can have these

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.400 
more like a shotgun you can have these
amazing<00:07:01.030> kill<00:07:01.390> streaks<00:07:01.630> and<00:07:01.810> I've<00:07:02.020> seen<00:07:02.200> some

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
amazing kill streaks and I've seen some

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.170 
amazing kill streaks and I've seen some
people<00:07:02.560> do<00:07:02.950> incredibly<00:07:03.400> well<00:07:03.490> with<00:07:03.640> this<00:07:03.970> gun

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
people do incredibly well with this gun

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.490 
people do incredibly well with this gun
like<00:07:04.420> they've<00:07:04.570> got<00:07:04.780> it<00:07:04.900> down<00:07:04.930> that<00:07:05.380> they

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
like they've got it down that they

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.950 
like they've got it down that they
understand<00:07:06.100> the<00:07:06.250> weapons<00:07:06.580> to<00:07:06.700> a<00:07:06.730> tee<00:07:07.030> but<00:07:07.690> for

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
understand the weapons to a tee but for

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.780 
understand the weapons to a tee but for
me<00:07:08.140> because<00:07:08.710> I<00:07:09.010> just<00:07:09.280> don't<00:07:09.460> have<00:07:09.610> the

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790 
me because I just don't have the

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.490 
me because I just don't have the
patience<00:07:10.180> maybe<00:07:10.390> to<00:07:10.600> learn<00:07:10.840> that<00:07:11.170> bullet

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
patience maybe to learn that bullet

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.050 
patience maybe to learn that bullet
travel<00:07:11.830> speed<00:07:12.070> maybe<00:07:12.490> it's<00:07:12.640> just<00:07:12.700> because<00:07:13.030> I

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
travel speed maybe it's just because I

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.940 
travel speed maybe it's just because I
don't<00:07:13.270> have<00:07:13.570> divine<00:07:14.110> intervention<00:07:14.770> and<00:07:14.920> I

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
don't have divine intervention and I

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.590 
don't have divine intervention and I
can't<00:07:15.190> predict<00:07:15.550> their<00:07:15.700> movement<00:07:16.150> for<00:07:16.330> a<00:07:16.360> day

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
can't predict their movement for a day

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.810 
can't predict their movement for a day
and<00:07:16.750> a<00:07:16.780> half<00:07:16.990> in<00:07:17.110> advance<00:07:17.370> it's<00:07:18.370> just<00:07:18.580> not<00:07:18.790> a

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
and a half in advance it's just not a

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.820 
and a half in advance it's just not a
gun<00:07:19.090> for<00:07:19.270> my<00:07:19.390> type<00:07:19.600> of<00:07:19.720> play<00:07:19.870> style<00:07:20.170> but<00:07:20.770> I

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830 
gun for my type of play style but I

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.590 
gun for my type of play style but I
don't<00:07:20.980> know<00:07:21.130> what<00:07:21.520> you<00:07:21.700> guys<00:07:21.880> think<00:07:22.180> about<00:07:22.360> the

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:22.600 
don't know what you guys think about the

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.720 
don't know what you guys think about the
cs5<00:07:23.200> do<00:07:23.470> you<00:07:23.560> love<00:07:23.770> it<00:07:23.920> do<00:07:24.070> you<00:07:24.190> hate<00:07:24.460> it<00:07:24.610> I

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:24.730 
cs5 do you love it do you hate it I

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.100 
cs5 do you love it do you hate it I
guess<00:07:24.970> this<00:07:25.120> is<00:07:25.210> a<00:07:25.240> good<00:07:25.420> thing<00:07:25.450> that<00:07:25.810> it's

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
guess this is a good thing that it's

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.930 
guess this is a good thing that it's
it's<00:07:26.320> not<00:07:26.380> the<00:07:26.530> best<00:07:26.860> bolt-action<00:07:27.640> rifle<00:07:27.880> in

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:27.940 
it's not the best bolt-action rifle in
