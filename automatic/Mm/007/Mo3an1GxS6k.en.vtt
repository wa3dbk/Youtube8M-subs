although<00:04:49.340> this<00:04:49.490> made<00:04:49.730> is<00:04:49.940> really<00:04:50.420> pretty

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
although this made is really pretty

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.120 
although this made is really pretty
pointless<00:04:51.050> in<00:04:51.260> general<00:04:51.620> it<00:04:51.740> could<00:04:51.920> kill

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
pointless in general it could kill

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.770 
pointless in general it could kill
people<00:04:52.550> if<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.730> were<00:04:52.850> extremely<00:04:53.060> lucky<00:04:53.630> I

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
people if you were extremely lucky I

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.510 
people if you were extremely lucky I
just<00:04:54.260> think<00:04:54.410> it's<00:04:54.590> awesome<00:04:54.920> in<00:04:55.010> general<00:04:55.370> which

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
just think it's awesome in general which

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.520 
just think it's awesome in general which
is<00:04:55.640> why<00:04:55.790> I'm<00:04:56.000> showing<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.480> basically<00:04:57.170> you<00:04:57.350> line

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
is why I'm showing it basically you line

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.080 
is why I'm showing it basically you line
it<00:04:57.560> up<00:04:57.710> in<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:57.980> clouds<00:04:58.220> and<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.550> hits<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.880> car

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
it up in the clouds and it hits the car

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.670 
it up in the clouds and it hits the car
next<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.420> the<00:04:59.600> bomb<00:04:59.780> and<00:04:59.900> bounces<00:05:00.290> up<00:05:00.320> in<00:05:00.560> the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
next to the bomb and bounces up in the

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.340 
next to the bomb and bounces up in the
air<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:00.950> over<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.310> fence<00:05:01.930> it's<00:05:02.930> quite<00:05:03.170> hard

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
air and over the fence it's quite hard

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.110 
air and over the fence it's quite hard
for<00:05:03.500> me<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.740> show<00:05:03.980> how<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.400> exactly<00:05:04.820> works

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
for me to show how it exactly works

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.330 
for me to show how it exactly works
because<00:05:05.570> I'm<00:05:06.200> always<00:05:06.410> looking<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:06.980> air<00:05:07.100> so

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
because I'm always looking in the air so

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:17.950 
because I'm always looking in the air so
I'll<00:05:07.430> try<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:07.730> show<00:05:08.030> it<00:05:08.150> in<00:05:08.210> third<00:05:08.420> person

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.030 

apart<00:05:18.960> from<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.170> on<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.470> attack<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.830> really

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
apart from that on the attack I really

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.140 
apart from that on the attack I really
don't<00:05:20.250> know<00:05:20.340> what<00:05:20.520> else<00:05:20.610> you<00:05:20.790> could<00:05:20.820> line<00:05:21.120> up

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
don't know what else you could line up

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.520 
don't know what else you could line up
to<00:05:21.420> Nathan<00:05:21.750> there's<00:05:21.930> anything<00:05:22.110> else<00:05:22.380> you

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
to Nathan there's anything else you

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.990 
to Nathan there's anything else you
could<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:22.920> generally<00:05:23.430> throw<00:05:23.640> it<00:05:23.760> in<00:05:23.850> that

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
could just generally throw it in that

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.660 
could just generally throw it in that
direction<00:05:24.330> right<00:05:25.110> where<00:05:25.260> people<00:05:25.620> sit<00:05:25.890> I<00:05:26.100> mean

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
direction right where people sit I mean

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.160 
direction right where people sit I mean
people<00:05:26.790> always<00:05:27.120> sit<00:05:27.270> at<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.450> red<00:05:27.600> car<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:28.020> top

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
people always sit at the red car the top

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.480 
people always sit at the red car the top
of<00:05:28.290> the<00:05:28.350> street<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.800> just<00:05:29.070> gotta<00:05:29.220> throw<00:05:29.430> a

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
of the street so you just gotta throw a

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.120 
of the street so you just gotta throw a
nade<00:05:29.700> over<00:05:29.910> there<00:05:33.590> sipping<00:05:34.590> AIDS<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.950> don't

nade over there sipping AIDS I don't
really<00:05:35.280> have<00:05:35.400> much<00:05:35.700> else<00:05:35.880> because<00:05:36.210> I've

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
really have much else because I've

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.360 
really have much else because I've
always<00:05:36.450> been<00:05:36.660> an<00:05:36.810> SMG<00:05:37.140> on<00:05:37.560> c<00:05:37.770> street<00:05:37.950> so<00:05:38.310> I

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
always been an SMG on c street so I

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.340 
always been an SMG on c street so I

never knew living tank mates because I

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.170 
never knew living tank mates because I
basically<00:05:40.530> just<00:05:40.830> rush<00:05:41.160> everywhere<00:05:41.610> I'll

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
basically just rush everywhere I'll

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.730 
basically just rush everywhere I'll
quickly<00:05:42.420> go<00:05:42.570> over<00:05:42.720> some<00:05:43.050> bull<00:05:43.200> bangs<00:05:43.440> but<00:05:43.710> I

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
quickly go over some bull bangs but I

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.050 
quickly go over some bull bangs but I
don't<00:05:43.950> think<00:05:44.220> this<00:05:44.370> map<00:05:44.580> really<00:05:44.820> has<00:05:44.940> like

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
don't think this map really has like

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.400 
don't think this map really has like
many<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.390> their<00:05:45.510> meager<00:05:45.720> because<00:05:46.110> all<00:05:46.320> the

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
many of their meager because all the

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.790 
many of their meager because all the
buildings<00:05:46.770> are<00:05:46.920> so<00:05:47.040> huge<00:05:48.410> firstly<00:05:49.410> this<00:05:49.590> one

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
buildings are so huge firstly this one

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.830 
buildings are so huge firstly this one
is<00:05:49.950> always<00:05:50.190> always<00:05:50.670> even<00:05:51.300> it's<00:05:51.390> probably<00:05:51.720> the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
is always always even it's probably the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.990 
is always always even it's probably the
most<00:05:51.900> important<00:05:52.560> is<00:05:53.010> primarily<00:05:53.430> done<00:05:53.760> with

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
most important is primarily done with

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.340 
most important is primarily done with
the<00:05:54.090> scope<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.510> have<00:05:54.720> died<00:05:54.930> two<00:05:55.110> people

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
the scope I have died two people

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.990 
the scope I have died two people
spraying<00:05:55.680> at<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:55.860> vacay<00:05:56.190> as<00:05:56.340> well<00:05:56.520> it

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
spraying at the vacay as well it

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.610 
spraying at the vacay as well it
basically<00:05:57.180> starts<00:05:57.510> people<00:05:57.870> rushing<00:05:58.260> middle

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
basically starts people rushing middle

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.230 
basically starts people rushing middle
it<00:05:58.710> can<00:05:58.860> also<00:05:59.010> kill<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.460> scope<00:05:59.700> who's<00:05:59.970> trying

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
it can also kill the scope who's trying

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.550 
it can also kill the scope who's trying
to<00:06:00.390> spam<00:06:00.570> in<00:06:00.720> the<00:06:00.780> middle<00:06:01.020> building<00:06:01.350> from

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
just like spinning wolves I mean this

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.240 
just like spinning wolves I mean this
