00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
teamwork so I decided to leave him and
looking<00:01:30.240> around<00:01:30.329> checking<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.950> side<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
looking around checking that side of the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.190 
looking around checking that side of the
bridge<00:01:32.700> cuz<00:01:33.119> usually<00:01:33.329> they'll<00:01:33.659> pop<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.960> over

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
bridge cuz usually they'll pop up over

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.620 
bridge cuz usually they'll pop up over
there<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.820> Camden's<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:36.090> ham<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.450> think

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
there and Camden's going ham I think

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.520 
there and Camden's going ham I think
he's<00:01:36.750> getting<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.990> good<00:01:37.079> amount<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> kills

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
he's getting a good amount of kills

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.929 
he's getting a good amount of kills
there<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:37.950> he's<00:01:38.100> got<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> headshot<00:01:38.670> they're

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
there you go he's got a headshot they're

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.840 
there you go he's got a headshot they're
back<00:01:39.900> over<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> bridge<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.159> don't<00:01:41.610> see

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
back over to this bridge I don't see

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.249 
back over to this bridge I don't see
anyone<00:01:42.210> still<00:01:43.079> scanning<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> area<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:45.259> score

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
anyone still scanning the area and score

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.690 
anyone still scanning the area and score
right<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.710> 6<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.220> pretty<00:01:47.460> good

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
right now I got 6 so that's pretty good

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
right now I got 6 so that's pretty good
so<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> start<00:01:48.960> fast-forwarding<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> do

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
so I start fast-forwarding because I do

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.999 
so I start fast-forwarding because I do
this<00:01:50.490> pattern<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.420> very<00:01:52.020> long<00:01:52.320> time<00:01:52.590> pretty

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
this pattern for a very long time pretty

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.090 
this pattern for a very long time pretty
much<00:01:53.130> nothing<00:01:53.340> happening<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.829> this<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.890> where

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
much nothing happening and this is where

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.130 
much nothing happening and this is where
something<00:01:56.490> starts<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> happen<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.600> this

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
something starts to happen I see this

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.249 
something starts to happen I see this
guy<00:01:58.409> trip<00:01:59.250> -<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> jump<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.719> missed<00:02:01.020> but

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
guy trip - so I jump up I missed but

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.990 
guy trip - so I jump up I missed but
then<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.469> had<00:02:01.649> shot<00:02:01.890> him<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> he<00:02:02.460> wounded<00:02:02.880> me

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
then I had shot him and he wounded me

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
then I had shot him and he wounded me
but<00:02:03.210> he<00:02:03.420> did<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.630> give<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> head<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.320> trip

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
but he did not give me the head so trip

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.330 
but he did not give me the head so trip
-<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:04.979> gone

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
- it's gone

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.260 
- it's gone
fast-forwarding<00:02:06.180> fast-forwarding

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
fast-forwarding fast-forwarding

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.050 
fast-forwarding fast-forwarding
fast-forwarding<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.729> over

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
fast-forwarding and to look back over

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.190 
fast-forwarding and to look back over
here<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.599> there's<00:02:10.259> trip<00:02:10.440> -<00:02:10.619> again<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.819> jump

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
here and there's trip - again so I jump

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.190 
here and there's trip - again so I jump
and<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:14.190> headshot<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.209> he<00:02:15.510> wouldn't<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.900> yet

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and this headshot and he wouldn't be yet

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.180 
and this headshot and he wouldn't be yet
again<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.330> go<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.050> check<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.739> score<00:02:19.980> right

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
again so I go to check the score right

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.920 
again so I go to check the score right
here<00:02:20.400> I'm<00:02:20.489> at<00:02:20.580> 8<00:02:20.760> now<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.300> that's<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:21.569> too<00:02:21.720> bad

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
here I'm at 8 now so that's not too bad

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.120 
here I'm at 8 now so that's not too bad
at<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.230> point<00:02:22.440> I'm<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.560> kind<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.890> playing

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
at this point I'm just kind of playing

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.949 
at this point I'm just kind of playing
like<00:02:23.250> normal<00:02:23.610> I'm<00:02:23.700> not<00:02:23.849> really<00:02:23.940> caring<00:02:24.870> about

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
like normal I'm not really caring about

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.780 
like normal I'm not really caring about
dying<00:02:25.440> or<00:02:25.650> anything<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.130> making<00:02:26.459> sure<00:02:26.640> I'm

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
dying or anything just making sure I'm

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.490 
dying or anything just making sure I'm
you<00:02:27.330> know<00:02:27.450> we<00:02:27.660> win<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.959> game<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.290> at<00:02:28.440> this

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
he's probably trained on my position I

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.940 
he's probably trained on my position I
didn't<00:03:51.780> want<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.959> pop<00:03:52.079> out<00:03:52.230> get<00:03:52.410> headshot<00:03:52.769> at
