00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
it's quite hard to put in these

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.450 
it's quite hard to put in these
conditions<00:03:57.450> because<00:03:57.960> they'd<00:03:58.170> be<00:03:58.830> pretty<00:03:59.130> cost

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
conditions because they'd be pretty cost

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.250 
conditions because they'd be pretty cost
and<00:03:59.670> quite<00:03:59.820> low<00:03:59.940> at<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.150> bot<00:04:00.300> so<00:04:00.960> you've<00:04:01.080> got

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
and quite low at the bot so you've got

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.620 
and quite low at the bot so you've got
to<00:04:01.350> chase<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.590> ball<00:04:01.740> up<00:04:01.980> when<00:04:02.790> they're<00:04:03.000> using

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
to chase the ball up when they're using

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.260 
to chase the ball up when they're using
their<00:04:03.750> key<00:04:03.870> player<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.140> their<00:04:04.320> rolling<00:04:04.740> box<00:04:04.980> to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
their key player in their rolling box to

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:12.809 
their key player in their rolling box to
try<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.420> pass<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.720> about

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.759 

so<00:04:13.420> he'll<00:04:13.810> facilities<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.349> was<00:04:14.439> really<00:04:14.590> good

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769

so he'll facilities it was really good
there<00:04:15.040> I'm<00:04:15.280> sure<00:04:15.790> they'll<00:04:16.000> hold<00:04:16.239> him<00:04:16.359> one

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479
