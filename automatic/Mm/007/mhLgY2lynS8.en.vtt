00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.530
 for a second-hand used machine and 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.120
 you want to know how the machine is 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.219
 You can logically start it 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.350
 see how it starts to see how it is maintained 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.300
 at idle wait for it to warm up 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.220
 use it all are fine but if 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.060
 you really want to know if what is 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.490
 buying is not like that inside I'm going 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.470
 to teach how quickly you will be able to 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.910
 find out if a machine is ok or not 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.120
 and what we are going to do is very simple 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.870
 is to extract the exhaust pipe or 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.870
 silent 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.860
 of your position we are simply going to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.330
 remove 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.330
 these two allen screws 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.940
 first we remove the strength that they carry 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.940
 that are very tight 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.700
 they usually tighten up a lot with the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.890
 temperature is very careful we cut 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.090
 With the chain is more is convenient 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.920
 leave the protector on 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.990
 just in case you rotate you give with the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.760
 hand I normally what I do is that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.310
 when I do any work on a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 chainsaw what I do is that I remove 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.890
 directly the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.890
 in the sword and the chain 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.940
 once you have unscrewed the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.940
 exhaust pipe bolts 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.490
 you get it out you get the exhaust pipe 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.729
 wear a board 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.840
 for this is to protect the machine from 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.630
 the temperature and then you can see 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.590
 you can see here clearly 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.590
 the piston 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.260
 and what you can do 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.260
 is to pull the boot 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.640
 slowly and you can see the cylinder 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.659
 and the piston and analyze it in detail from 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.110
 so that you can be totally 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:25.470
 insurance of the state of conservation of 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 engine 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.160
 and in this way if you are going to buy a 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.450
 machine used then to check clearly 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.319
 and in this way if what you are 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.170
 buying is in good condition 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.540
 or did not lower the piston me what now this 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.189
 is a little trick is very fast of 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.989
 do because to notice that they are only 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.989
 a couple of screws 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.459
 and with a couple of screws that I remove 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.069
 I will automatically give account 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.450
 in what situation the machine is 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.680
 that I am going to buy or in what situation 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.630
 find a machine that I am 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.240
 repairing 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.240
 and this comes a little bit with what 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.140
 what has happened to the subject of what 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.360
 was explaining the damaged cylinder and 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.000
 the damaged piston as a result of fault 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:31.560
 of oil or poor quality oil 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.950
 this is how it is damaged 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.650
 and here I have so that you can see it 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.830
 a little better also out 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.400
 and a piston and a cylinder 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.910
 In good condition, it should not be 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.770
 scratched by nowhere so much the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.770
 inside of the cylinder body 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.970
 like what is the piston and this 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.350
 so you can be absolutely 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.490
 sure that what you are buying 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.890
 It is in poor condition 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.110
 it also serves us 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.240
 to know one thing all this has already been 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.520
 explained 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.800
 if you are trying to start a 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.260
 machine that you have done the cleaning 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.210
 of the carburetor or you have done everything 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.890
 that you think is convenient to be able to put 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.140
 running the machine and the machine continues 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.140
 without starting and I'll give you an advice 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.710
 which is very easy to do 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.720
 and it's very quick to practice 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.490
 through the intake intake that is to 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.660
 through where is the air filter 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:54.140
 of the carburetor you remove it and with a 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.450
 doser I have this what what 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.150
 I have inside is gasoline mixture if 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.480
 I squeeze a little trickle of gas 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.770
 good 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.200
 me to rule out that I have a failure of 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.870
 carburetor what I usually do is that 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.540
 made here a couple of drops look at you fix 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.310
 A) Yes 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.310
 click click a couple of droplets 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.900
 and once that's done 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.610
 threw him at the start 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.460
 to boot we go with the spark plug 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:31.030
 connected with everything connected if the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.310
 machine starts and stops me 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.640
 it is sure that we have a problem well 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.600
 of regulating the carburetor of the 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.580
 screws what h 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.270
 or else we have a problem of 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:47.390
 Because carburetor is dirty because 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.960
 the membranes are passed then a 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:54.560
 carburetor problem but 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:58.060
 it is convenient that if you are not safe 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:02.080
 how it is the machine costs nothing 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:05.229
 take out the exhaust pipe in a moment 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.080
 if you look at the engine through the exit 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.940
 of the exhaust pipe 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.700
 if you find that it is scratched 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.940
 then it is most likely that there is a 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.280
 engine problem and this does not work 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:24.210
 nor will it work for as long as 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.580
 clean the carburetor this will be a 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.480
 ruined machine and it will not work for 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.760
 nothing 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.570
 well up here with my advice 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.340
 today I hope this will help if 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.510
 you have any question or comment 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.330
 please leave it or put 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:44.090
 in the comments on youtube you can

 also enter through the website 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.620
 ours and there you have all our 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.990

 ask any question forgive me if 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.320

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.410
 a greeting from just machines
