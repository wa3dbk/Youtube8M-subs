00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.349
 event however they put the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.840
 hashtag playstation or xperia neon 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.969

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 15 minutes and the tweet was deleted if 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 You go there on twitter, Santa Monica already 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 It is no longer clear 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.600
 people as soon as they saw the tweet 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.480
 besides favorite and retuitar they catch 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 print that, then we already know that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.290
 a new four bar is in expensive production 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.299
 I was very excited for this, it was 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.750
 the day was one of the best of the year today 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.520
 day 6 was one of the best because besides 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.650
 have seen a gameplay saved from 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960
 amphitheater 4 and finally in videogame 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 playstation 4 agent a confirmation there 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 the new is now fantastic face that the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.140
 What remains to know now is how 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.600
 It's going to be that story as they go. 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 develop the character kratos in this 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.409
 new strength will now be the end of 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.290
 franchise will be the last game so 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 How are you going to find me? 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.520
 they will invent one more thing to 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.400
 have a new trilogy I do not know but I 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.860
 I believe that credit is equivalent to half 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.500
 to get revenge on athina net was alive 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.070
 For those who have not seen the cruise, they have now been 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.750
 three 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.659
 The cruise is not dead however 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.460
 will have a number out then to him on 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.100
 At the end of the game you see that he 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.780
 diesel sword threading baby well what 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.119
 happens is a murderer to blast there 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.860
 Why did he do this? The tub appears. 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.320
 screaming is not what you did or 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 retarded that was all this and then 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.000
 I predicted the credits after the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.129
 credits appears at the scene 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.140
 from heaven and when he shows you where the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.270
 body was he is no longer there right 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.940
 the he kind of dragging out because it has 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.190
 a ratio of 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.020
 blood the law then has to realize soon 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 that instant 5 00 each way to 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.830
 I would have a close one, nothing was 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.910
 spoken all these years by his sony 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.070
 size that has finally been confirmed 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.960
 that the new one out now is in production 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.820
 You're going to believe it's not accurate. 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.010
 experience can not imagine on 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.720
 now out because the twitter of sony 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.630
 Santa Monica was deleted right. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.070
 but I think it's there for 3 and up to 2015 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.720
 even before that, right? 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.270
 maybe sony does an event like she did 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.160
 this year last year in that one showed the 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.560
 Playstation 4 console so it can even 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.110
 make a separate event there and maybe come 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.570
 Then the guy is new, so it's 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.150
 shown or even only in e3 2015 to a 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.740
 bit far but I 'm already calm in 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.810
 know that a new airport in production 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.110
 and in e3 where you will get more information 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.060
 It's definitely from here to there or even 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.590
 tomorrow even if two days from now 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.120
 information is certainly bringing 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.250
 in the channel for you guys stay calm 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.690
 Beauty what I was basically expecting 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.070
 If you liked this video I was 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.260
 quite happy today was a very 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.940
 It was really cool, the video was fine. 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.930
