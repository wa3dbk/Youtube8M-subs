00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.980
 I believe that one of the important prerequisites 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.930
 The current situation in the country is 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.860
 the fact that for a long time a huge 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.050
 number of people 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.450
 did not develop themselves intellectually 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.490
 despite the fact that perhaps for the first time in history 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.230
 civilizations we actually have 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.369
 unlimited access to the world 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.349
 cultural heritage 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.079
 many continue to trumpet hard 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.630
 some kind of total fooling to that 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.399
 neither me nor my own languor 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.860
 indifference some kind of external forces 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.530
 for example decaying west then bam 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.120
 of course Jews when ignorance 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.410
 justified when excluded 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 own wine i own 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.640
 responsibility is such ignorance 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.290
 ceases to be shameful in this way 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.090
 without even having basic knowledge of 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.220
 stories people change themselves almost 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.050
 experts and absolutely do not care to 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.060
 information that they constantly 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.220
 reproduce themselves never 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.050
 tested and not analyzed when 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.000
 man begins to talk about what 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.250
 whatever historical issues 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.649
 with a single scientific work on 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.530
 This topic is not reading what they are 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.540
 such reasoning please tell me 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.190
 but today I will not talk about scientific 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.470
 literature i would like to talk about 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.000
 fiction literature because with 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.680
 my point of view, art mine 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.140
 literature best contributes 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.060
 formation of critical thinking 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 Recently, it is very fashionable to create 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.940
 all sorts of literary selections like 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.440
 100 books to read up to 30 30 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.450
 books about happy unlucky love and 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.049
 so on I decided to keep up with 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.780
 stream 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.090
 and created her literary selection she 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.520
 so called 10 books that need 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.340
 read to Russian oborotnymi fans 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.790
 Spring to sober up so the first 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.710
 book which will be less likely 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.990
 just needs comments because 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.420
 what is the archipelago gulag alexander 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.909
 Solzhenitsyn sure to read those who 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.670
 keeps repeating that with a friend 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.170
 Stalin's order was factories worked and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.770
 people are overwhelmed with confidence in tomorrow 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.619
 bottom 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.750
 laser system of existence which 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.850
 carefully hiding shown sale 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.950

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.360
 take learn already they finally 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.000
 and then I'll see if you will 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.739
 continue to take into account 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.750
 what kind of country is missing 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.670
 the next book is a book which 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.830
 they say quite a lot today 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.930
 comparing Putinâ€™s built system 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.440
 so much featured in the novel george 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.230
 orwell 1984 I want to focus 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.510
 on the amazing human phenomenon 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.819
 psyche is described in detail by them url them two 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.700
 if your thoughts are in your head 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.069
 people get along conflicting friend 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.870
 a friend of ideas with an obvious 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.160
 contradiction between these ideas chuck 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.380
 consciously or unknowingly 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.959
 Not paying attention when Muscovites 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.930
 say that Russia is not at war with 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.599
 Ukraine but Russia will win it yours 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.360
 thoughts when they go and vote for the DPR 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.579
 do selfi with militants ask Russia 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.560
 to lead troops and in doing so require 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.530
 Kiev authorities to pay in time 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.739
 pensions are two if book number three 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.440
 Tatyana fat Kys she say so about 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.530
 the true guise of Slavic magnificence of Moscow 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.660
 300 years after a nuclear explosion occurs 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.180
 return to the patriarchal community 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.850
 I put the slide to the banal superstition 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.280
 everything new and unknown is perceived with 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.989
 hate when we are familiar in Crimea 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.500
 simultaneously contrive 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.519
 zigovat promote 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.410
 Old Slavic pagan values 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.569
 remain convinced Orthodox and 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.459
 honors comrade stalin then this is first 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.709
 doublethink secondly arise 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.160
 explicit parallels with the novel Tatyana 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.410
 thick since we started talking about the Crimea then 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.739
 The next book is Vasily Aksyonov 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.019
 the island of Crimea Crimean modern 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.049
 unambiguous mast hev read in the morning and 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.220
 in the evening instead of the polite alphabet genre 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.380
 alternative history 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.250
 big to me managed to take the Crimea in 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.920
 resulting in it with time 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.209
 turned into an independent prosperous 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.069
 state and here in this very 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.650
 state of ripening sentiment about 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.859
 reunion with the great Russian people 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.860
 and the return of the Crimea in the composition of what 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.070
 it will lead read see 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.630
 Joseph Kuzei Waiting for Varna 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.480
 awesome thing to read for those who 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.760
 Every corner screams and creepy bandy bond 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.579
 bundle Bendera and crucify and lyakh 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.760
 babies from the right sector this job 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.980
 about fear of imaginary enemies and about 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.670
 what this fear can lead to 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.400
 society 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.710
 Gabriel Garcia Marquez Autumn Patriarch 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.460
 a novel about the most destructive nature 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.370
 dictatorships 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.350
 that at some point any 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.020
 the dictatorship is fixated on itself 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.570
 loses all connection with reality that in 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.720
 ultimately ruining it inevitably it 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.480
 a matter of time so what are we waiting for 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.970
 joseph heller amendment 22 satire about 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.720
 the absurdities of military bureaucracy and war 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.110
 as such 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.970
 noticed that the last time Russian 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.190
 people again needed an idea about 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.950
 little quick victorious war 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.240
 I hasten to upset local wars more in 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.700
 the world does not exist 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.710
 Little Wars no longer exists does not 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.550
 there are quick and short wars 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.440
 william golding the lord of the flies about how 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.150
 rapidly civilized people can 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.400
 turn into burnt cattle 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.310
 relevance unfortunately rolls over 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.470
 Sergey Dovlatov a brilliant writer and 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.660
 journalist of the rejected Soviet system 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.580
 in his novel the compromise will tell you 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.340
 about how to suck the news out 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.200
 because the sacred saw by 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.450
 TV means the way it is 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.030
 from my point of view this is the root of all evil 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.310
 and the curtain is another piece 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.710
 blatant fraud victor 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.150
 Pelevin Amon-Ra 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.220
 nonexistent feats of pretentious imaginary 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.960
 victory for the sake of which is needed very 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.990
 considerable considerable losses 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.540
 the situation is painfully familiar for us 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.550
 such a list ask yourself 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.630
 right now how many books from this 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.030
 I read the list 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.140
 and then either start filling in the blanks 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.390
 in knowledge 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.210
 either keep blaming your own 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.390
 the ignorance of the State Department and Cthulhu all peaceful 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.390
