00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
of all let's try to balance some of the

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.290 
of all let's try to balance some of the
weapons<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.739> feels<00:00:42.069> like<00:00:42.280> some<00:00:42.519> guns<00:00:42.760> are<00:00:43.269> a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
weapons it feels like some guns are a

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.079 
weapons it feels like some guns are a
little<00:00:43.629> more<00:00:43.809> powerful<00:00:44.050> than<00:00:44.649> others<00:00:44.859> and<00:00:45.219> I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
little more powerful than others and I

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.579 
little more powerful than others and I
think<00:00:46.300> is<00:00:46.420> that<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.629> lot<00:00:46.809> to<00:00:46.929> do<00:00:47.050> with<00:00:47.289> like<00:00:47.559> the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
think is that a lot to do with like the

think is that a lot to do with like the
lag<00:00:48.249> of<00:00:48.280> things<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:50.710> some<00:00:50.979> guns<00:00:51.190> only<00:00:51.399> have

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:51.639 
lag of things like some guns only have

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:54.090 
lag of things like some guns only have
three<00:00:51.940> bars<00:00:52.179> but<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:53.289> pistol<00:00:53.589> has<00:00:53.679> three<00:00:53.920> bars

instead<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.930> having<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.290> map<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:16.160> teams

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
instead of having this map on just teams

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.180 
instead of having this map on just teams
and<00:02:16.880> team<00:02:17.450> deathmatch<00:02:17.660> maybe<00:02:18.620> make<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
rifles maybe just pistols and so forth

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.010

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
on the potential news not for sure if it

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.390 
on the potential news not for sure if it
took<00:04:18.859> his<00:04:18.980> languages<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:20.209> update<00:04:20.480> I<00:04:20.570> got<00:04:20.750> him

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
took his languages the update I got him

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.710 
took his languages the update I got him
I've<00:04:22.400> been<00:04:22.580> resorting<00:04:23.090> more<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.570> the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
I've been resorting more to the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.960 
I've been resorting more to the
headhunter<00:04:24.200> currently<00:04:24.860> just<00:04:25.070> because<00:04:25.670> the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
headhunter currently just because the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.330 
headhunter currently just because the
prototype<00:04:26.480> leaves<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.200> ginormous<00:04:27.680> pink<00:04:27.980> trail

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
prototype leaves a ginormous pink trail

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.880 
prototype leaves a ginormous pink trail
behind<00:04:29.000> every<00:04:29.390> shot<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:29.960> kind<00:04:30.200> of<00:04:30.260> gives

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
behind every shot so it kind of gives

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.220 
behind every shot so it kind of gives
away<00:04:30.980> your<00:04:31.040> position<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:32.180> don't<00:04:33.020> like<00:04:33.140> to

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
away your position and I don't like to

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.380 
away your position and I don't like to
give<00:04:33.350> him<00:04:33.440> away<00:04:33.500> my<00:04:33.890> position<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.820> like<00:04:35.030> that

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
give him away my position I like that

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.450 
give him away my position I like that
tactical<00:04:36.100> advantage<00:04:37.100> for<00:04:37.370> me<00:04:37.490> oh<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:40.310> was

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
tactical advantage for me oh that was

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.670 
tactical advantage for me oh that was
you<00:04:40.760> see<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.060> was<00:04:41.180> lag<00:04:41.480> that<00:04:41.900> was<00:04:42.410> that

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
you see that was lag that was that

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.990 
you see that was lag that was that
should<00:04:42.860> not<00:04:43.040> have<00:04:43.310> happened<00:04:43.550> honestly

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
should not have happened honestly

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.720 
should not have happened honestly
another<00:04:44.810> thing<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.110> think<00:04:45.320> even<00:04:46.190> breaking<00:04:46.640> down

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
another thing I think even breaking down

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.760 
another thing I think even breaking down
the<00:04:46.820> server's<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:47.510> regions<00:04:48.169> of<00:04:48.440> just<00:04:48.620> having

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
the server's in regions of just having

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.360 
the server's in regions of just having
US<00:04:49.190> or<00:04:49.900> European<00:04:50.900> Asian<00:04:51.290> and<00:04:51.680> so<00:04:51.800> forth<00:04:52.160> and

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
US or European Asian and so forth and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.070 
US or European Asian and so forth and
you're<00:04:52.790> able<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.030> join<00:04:53.300> whatever<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.780> want

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
you're able to join whatever you want

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.680 
you're able to join whatever you want
but<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.919> individuals<00:04:55.550> who<00:04:55.730> don't<00:04:56.570> really

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
but the individuals who don't really

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.180 
but the individuals who don't really
want<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.230> lag<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:59.290> really<00:05:00.290> gets<00:05:00.830> a<00:05:00.919> really

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
want the lag and really gets a really

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.980 
want the lag and really gets a really
annoyed<00:05:01.430> by<00:05:01.730> it<00:05:01.790> with<00:05:02.180> when<00:05:02.540> someone<00:05:02.870> runs

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
annoyed by it with when someone runs

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.900 
annoyed by it with when someone runs
past<00:05:03.260> you<00:05:03.560> ten<00:05:03.800> feet<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.220> then<00:05:04.340> still<00:05:04.610> kills

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
past you ten feet and then still kills

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.450 
past you ten feet and then still kills
you<00:05:05.090> with<00:05:05.240> one<00:05:05.480> shot<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.260> prototype<00:05:06.710> it's

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
you with one shot of the prototype it's

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.010 
you with one shot of the prototype it's
kind<00:05:07.640> of<00:05:07.700> annoying<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.360> that's<00:05:08.480> that's<00:05:08.750> all

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
kind of annoying and that's that's all

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.830 
kind of annoying and that's that's all
due<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:10.010> latency<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:10.880> lag<00:05:11.120> that

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
due to the latency in the lag that

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.010 
due to the latency in the lag that
you'll<00:05:12.050> you'll<00:05:12.590> encounter<00:05:13.190> when<00:05:14.020> playing

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
you'll you'll encounter when playing

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.340 
you'll you'll encounter when playing
this<00:05:15.169> game<00:05:16.030> should've<00:05:17.030> got<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:17.330> guy<00:05:17.450> but<00:05:18.320> uh

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
this game should've got that guy but uh

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.670 
this game should've got that guy but uh
