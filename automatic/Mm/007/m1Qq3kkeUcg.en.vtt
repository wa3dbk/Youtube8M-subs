yet but I will soon so you can see the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.149 
yet but I will soon so you can see the
actual<00:03:07.750> mechanism<00:03:08.349> look<00:03:08.829> it<00:03:08.949> over

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
actual mechanism look it over

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.159 
actual mechanism look it over
big<00:03:09.760> blue<00:03:09.909> easier<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.480> see<00:03:10.719> that's<00:03:11.049> the

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169 
big blue easier you see that's the

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.649 
big blue easier you see that's the
mechanism<00:03:11.469> right<00:03:11.919> there<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:13.180> one<00:03:13.389> is<00:03:13.510> also

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
mechanism right there this one is also

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.360 
mechanism right there this one is also
adjustable<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.620> can<00:03:14.829> change<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.280> amount

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
adjustable so you can change the amount

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:27.830 
adjustable so you can change the amount
of<00:03:15.549> throw<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:17.260> there<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:18.010> is
