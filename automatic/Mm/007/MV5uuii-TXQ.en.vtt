building so an easy way to do this is to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.610 
building so an easy way to do this is to
add<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.010> shell<00:00:35.460> modifier<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> I'm<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> go

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
add a shell modifier so I'm going to go

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.389 
add a shell modifier so I'm going to go
to<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.950> modifiers<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.180> down<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> shell<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
to my modifiers and go down to shell and

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.310 
to my modifiers and go down to shell and
then<00:00:41.399> basically<00:00:41.790> set<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.540> outer<00:00:42.690> amount<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
then basically set your outer amount to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.830 
then basically set your outer amount to
zero<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.640> make<00:00:44.789> your<00:00:44.969> inner<00:00:45.239> amount

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
zero and just make your inner amount

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.330 
zero and just make your inner amount
something<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.469> zero<00:00:46.800> point<00:00:47.280> zero<00:00:47.760> point<00:00:48.719> one

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
something like zero point zero point one

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.340 
something like zero point zero point one
okay<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.149> collapse<00:00:51.600> all

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
okay and then you want to collapse all

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.549 
okay and then you want to collapse all
these<00:00:52.789> modifiers<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.079> click<00:00:55.110> here

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
these modifiers so just right click here

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.420 
these modifiers so just right click here
go<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.920> collapse<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.030> select<00:00:57.629> yes<00:00:58.430> right

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
go to collapse all and select yes right

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.189 
go to collapse all and select yes right
so<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> next<00:00:59.760> step<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.600> fracture<00:01:01.079> your

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.320 
them selected click on add and then go
to<00:02:25.140> fragments<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:25.890> let's<00:02:26.640> break<00:02:26.880> them<00:02:27.120> into

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
to fragments and let's break them into

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.570 
to fragments and let's break them into
let's<00:02:28.140> say<00:02:28.200> 20<00:02:28.620> parts<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.070> should<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.340> fine

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
let's say 20 parts that should be fine

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.260 
let's say 20 parts that should be fine
for<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.850> tutorial<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.540> click<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.260> fragment

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
for this tutorial and click on fragment

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.090 
for this tutorial and click on fragment
ok<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.330> once<00:02:33.600> you've<00:02:33.720> done<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:33.960> we've<00:02:34.380> got

ok so once you've done that we've got
all<00:02:35.310> our<00:02:35.640> pieces<00:02:36.680> fragmented<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.550> now<00:02:39.060> we're

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
all our pieces fragmented so now we're

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.120 
all our pieces fragmented so now we're
going<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.390> start<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.930> add<00:02:40.230> some<00:02:40.260> dynamic

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
going to start to add some dynamic

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.730 
going to start to add some dynamic
students<00:02:41.580> right<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.510> let's<00:02:42.690> close<00:02:42.960> or<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.470> fire

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.230 
static rigidbody and then right-click on
it<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.050> freeze<00:02:55.620> selection<00:02:56.520> that's<00:02:57.060> just

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
let's give that a selection set as well

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.400 
let's give that a selection set as well
so<00:04:02.250> let's<00:04:02.430> call<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:03.690> not<00:04:05.450> explode<00:04:06.450> right

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
so let's call that to not explode right

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.470 
so let's call that to not explode right
so<00:04:07.620> now<00:04:07.739> you've<00:04:07.890> got<00:04:08.100> these<00:04:08.310> two<00:04:08.580> selection

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
so now you've got these two selection

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.530 
so now you've got these two selection
sets<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.260> explode<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.250> also<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.120> not

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
sets so to explode and also to not

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.600 
sets so to explode and also to not
explode<00:04:13.080> ok<00:04:13.769> next<00:04:14.040> thing<00:04:14.190> we're<00:04:14.459> going<00:04:14.550> to

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
explode ok next thing we're going to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.599 
explode ok next thing we're going to
create<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:15.000> bomb<00:04:15.360> so<00:04:15.810> go<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.230> your<00:04:16.739> forces

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
create a bomb so go to your forces

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.360 
create a bomb so go to your forces
select<00:04:18.479> P<00:04:18.780> bomb<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.260> I'm<00:04:19.950> going<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.160> create

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
select P bomb and I'm going to create

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.560 
select P bomb and I'm going to create
the<00:04:20.609> P<00:04:20.789> bomb<00:04:21.000> here

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
the P bomb here

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.940 
the P bomb here
right<00:04:22.020> in<00:04:22.260> front<00:04:22.830> here<00:04:23.220> by<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.430> front

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
right in front here by the front

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.670 
right in front here by the front
go<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:24.940> let's<00:04:25.240> just<00:04:25.450> position<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.200> somewhere

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
go so let's just position it somewhere

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.930 
go so let's just position it somewhere
around<00:04:27.150> there<00:04:29.010> okay<00:04:30.010> go<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.460> properties

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
around there okay go to the properties

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.910 
around there okay go to the properties
of<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.210> bomb<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:31.690> let's<00:04:32.110> set<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.350> start<00:04:32.830> time

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
of the bomb and let's set the start time

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.420 
of the bomb and let's set the start time
to<00:04:33.310> be<00:04:33.510> at<00:04:34.510> around<00:04:34.660> 10<00:04:35.050> frames<00:04:35.380> all<00:04:36.100> right<00:04:36.250> so

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
to be at around 10 frames all right so

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.920 
to be at around 10 frames all right so
we're<00:04:36.550> almost<00:04:36.670> there<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:37.210> what<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.720> want<00:04:37.870> to

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
we're almost there so what you want to

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.180 
we're almost there so what you want to
do<00:04:38.020> next<00:04:38.260> is<00:04:38.560> you're<00:04:38.800> going<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.010> go<00:04:39.130> to

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.360 
tools and just dock this to the side
right<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:47.080> then<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.380> go<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.560> your<00:04:47.800> selection

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
right and then you go to your selection

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.050 
right and then you go to your selection
sets<00:04:48.760> and<00:04:49.350> select<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.980> explode<00:04:51.520> selection

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
sets and select the to explode selection

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.350 
sets and select the to explode selection
set<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.510> then<00:04:52.990> add<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:54.040> dynamic<00:04:54.370> rigid<00:04:55.180> body

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
set and then add the dynamic rigid body

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.320 
set and then add the dynamic rigid body
modifier<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.200> those<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.770> do<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.610> same<00:04:57.820> to

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
modifier to those and do the same to

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.080 
modifier to those and do the same to
your<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.380> not<00:04:59.650> explode<00:05:00.130> selection<00:05:00.610> set<00:05:00.820> so

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
your to not explode selection set so

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.750 
your to not explode selection set so
also<00:05:01.390> add<00:05:01.600> a<00:05:01.870> dynamic<00:05:02.410> rigid<00:05:03.100> body<00:05:03.310> modifier

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
also add a dynamic rigid body modifier

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.750 
also add a dynamic rigid body modifier
to<00:05:03.940> that<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.650> then<00:05:05.650> what<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:05.980> want<00:05:06.130> to<00:05:06.160> do<00:05:06.310> is

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
to that and then what you want to do is

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.390 
to that and then what you want to do is
go<00:05:07.390> back<00:05:07.600> to<00:05:07.780> your<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.260> explode<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.220> these

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
go back to your to explode so these

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.250 
go back to your to explode so these
parts<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:10.030> will<00:05:10.270> be<00:05:10.300> affected<00:05:10.810> by<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.020> bomb

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
parts that will be affected by the bomb

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260 
parts that will be affected by the bomb
and<00:05:11.500> then<00:05:12.130> on<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.370> third<00:05:12.610> tab<00:05:12.820> you're<00:05:13.090> on<00:05:13.150> the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
and then on the third tab you're on the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.930 
and then on the third tab you're on the
massfx<00:05:13.600> tools<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:15.190> want<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.430> go<00:05:15.520> down<00:05:15.700> to

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
massfx tools you want to go down to

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.500 
massfx tools you want to go down to
forces<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.870> then<00:05:17.230> add<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:18.100> bomb<00:05:18.400> in<00:05:18.670> there<00:05:18.880> so

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
forces and then add the bomb in there so

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.990 
forces and then add the bomb in there so
basically<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:20.560> bomb<00:05:20.860> will<00:05:21.070> only<00:05:21.340> affect

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
basically the bomb will only affect

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.970 
basically the bomb will only affect
these<00:05:22.540> pieces<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:23.320> not<00:05:23.530> all<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.950> other

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
these pieces and not all the other

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.040 
these pieces and not all the other
pieces<00:05:24.370> okay<00:05:25.090> another<00:05:25.450> thing<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:25.810> you<00:05:25.900> want

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
pieces okay another thing that you want

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.890 
pieces okay another thing that you want
to<00:05:26.110> do<00:05:26.260> is<00:05:26.500> you<00:05:26.950> want<00:05:27.130> to<00:05:27.190> start<00:05:27.580> in<00:05:27.970> sleep<00:05:28.570> mode

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
to do is you want to start in sleep mode

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.710 
to do is you want to start in sleep mode
and<00:05:29.200> let's<00:05:29.860> change<00:05:30.100> this<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.490> concrete<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.630> know

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
and let's change this to concrete I know

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.110 
and let's change this to concrete I know
this<00:05:32.020> is<00:05:32.170> actually<00:05:32.890> supposed<00:05:33.190> to<00:05:33.250> be<00:05:33.340> wood<00:05:33.580> but

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
this is actually supposed to be wood but

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.790 
this is actually supposed to be wood but
I<00:05:34.180> find<00:05:34.540> that<00:05:34.810> concrete<00:05:35.170> works<00:05:35.530> quite<00:05:35.770> well

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
I find that concrete works quite well

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.340 
I find that concrete works quite well
with<00:05:36.160> us<00:05:36.310> so<00:05:36.970> let's<00:05:37.150> do<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.420> same<00:05:37.630> worth<00:05:37.990> to

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
with us so let's do the same worth to

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.580 
with us so let's do the same worth to
not<00:05:38.650> explode<00:05:39.040> so<00:05:39.880> change<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.780> start<00:05:41.380> in

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
not explode so change that to start in

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.740 
not explode so change that to start in
sleep<00:05:41.920> mode<00:05:42.130> as<00:05:42.280> well<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:42.760> let's<00:05:43.510> set<00:05:43.720> the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
sleep mode as well and let's set the

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.010 
sleep mode as well and let's set the
physical<00:05:44.590> material<00:05:45.070> to<00:05:45.310> concrete<00:05:45.820> okay<00:05:46.750> let's

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
physical material to concrete okay let's

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.390 
physical material to concrete okay let's
start<00:05:47.290> the<00:05:47.440> simulation<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.100> see<00:05:48.250> what

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
start the simulation and see what

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.240 
start the simulation and see what
happens

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.850 

okay<00:05:54.820> so<00:05:54.880> I<00:05:55.030> think<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.720> bomb<00:05:56.050> strength<00:05:56.560> is<00:05:56.830> a

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
okay so I think the bomb strength is a

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.560 
okay so I think the bomb strength is a
little<00:05:57.160> bit<00:05:57.310> too<00:05:57.460> high<00:05:57.670> so<00:05:58.030> let's<00:05:58.210> select<00:05:58.360> the

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
little bit too high so let's select the

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.930 
little bit too high so let's select the
bomb<00:05:58.780> go<00:05:59.410> to<00:05:59.470> its<00:05:59.680> properties<00:05:59.740> and<00:06:00.610> let's<00:06:00.760> set

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
bomb go to its properties and let's set

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.510 
bomb go to its properties and let's set
the<00:06:01.090> strength<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:01.660> something<00:06:02.110> like<00:06:02.250> 0.2<00:06:03.250> maybe

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
the strength to something like 0.2 maybe

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:11.610 
the strength to something like 0.2 maybe
let's<00:06:03.910> try<00:06:04.000> that<00:06:04.270> again<00:06:10.140> okay<00:06:11.140> there<00:06:11.410> we<00:06:11.470> go

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
let's try that again okay there we go

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.550 
let's try that again okay there we go
let's<00:06:11.890> stop<00:06:12.220> that<00:06:12.400> go<00:06:12.820> back<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:13.330> one<00:06:14.320> last

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
let's stop that go back and one last

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.990 
let's stop that go back and one last
thing<00:06:14.680> that<00:06:14.740> you<00:06:14.920> can<00:06:15.100> do<00:06:15.340> to<00:06:15.580> make<00:06:15.790> it<00:06:15.940> a

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
thing that you can do to make it a

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.990 
thing that you can do to make it a
little<00:06:16.090> bit<00:06:16.300> more<00:06:16.510> realistic<00:06:16.660> is<00:06:17.640> just<00:06:18.640> select

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
little bit more realistic is just select

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.380 
little bit more realistic is just select
some<00:06:19.180> of<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.480> pieces<00:06:20.410> here<00:06:20.770> at<00:06:20.830> the<00:06:20.920> back

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
some of the pieces here at the back

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.140 
some of the pieces here at the back
let's<00:06:22.390> maybe<00:06:22.920> select<00:06:23.920> this<00:06:24.070> whole<00:06:24.130> kind<00:06:25.030> of

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
let's maybe select this whole kind of

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.660 
let's maybe select this whole kind of
wall<00:06:25.420> yeah<00:06:26.400> maybe<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:27.550> maybe<00:06:29.400> some<00:06:30.400> of<00:06:30.520> the

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
wall yeah maybe that maybe some of the

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.810 
wall yeah maybe that maybe some of the
roof<00:06:31.060> as<00:06:31.300> well<00:06:34.830> and<00:06:35.830> maybe<00:06:36.010> some<00:06:36.280> pieces<00:06:36.520> on

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
roof as well and maybe some pieces on

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.350 
roof as well and maybe some pieces on
this<00:06:37.000> side<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.960> then<00:06:38.230> set<00:06:38.500> them<00:06:38.770> as<00:06:38.980> static<00:06:39.940> so

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
this side and then set them as static so

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.680 
this side and then set them as static so
they<00:06:40.540> won't<00:06:40.870> be<00:06:41.110> affected<00:06:41.560> at<00:06:41.680> all<00:06:42.360> okay<00:06:43.360> so

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
they won't be affected at all okay so

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.409 
they won't be affected at all okay so
let's<00:06:43.870> try<00:06:44.020> that<00:06:44.200> again<00:06:44.910> so<00:06:45.910> let's<00:06:46.120> click

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
let's try that again so let's click

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:57.330 
let's try that again so let's click
