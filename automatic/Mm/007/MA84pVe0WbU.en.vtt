00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 meinsen and we come to one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.490
 interest disturbed video normally 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.410
 now another come it then 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.510
 Tomorrow and today we must be compulsory 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.670
 Talk about rice because yesterday we can 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.219
 at the cs noticed that her luggage was 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.109
 and that with a breathtaking success 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.810
 and this successfully on the mind 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.070
 5.10 was played apitzsch and riot 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.930
 probably has the disturbed categories 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.580
 even brought out if I too 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.160
 already a buffer only some time ago 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 put to ice and said yes the late 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.369
 there are very strong because his 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.719
 then we fit over full book grab 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.230
 the full six seconds 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.180
 red has changed the whole thing now 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.129
 From the beginning we take care of it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.550
 You asked six seconds that my 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.870
 Friends is just that, of course 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.399
 they also brought the cinema 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.350
 but with the early stronger 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.149
 biggest problem was the duration of the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.039
 length of its passive than that here too 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.170
 Start just three seconds that's nothing 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.399
 now it holds a full six seconds and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.140
 the only problem 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.000
 but it was enough that was illegal 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 has disappeared 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 The problem is as good as gone because he 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.229
 only one problem and that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.210
 is skinny and as long as he has Mahler 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 he tears the people inside of this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.260
 six seconds massive he hurls so 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 a lot of fur in your face and that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 already at a very low level that you 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.500
 the chance so it was yes 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 the rcs notice june and of course 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.710
 also how they organized chiquita 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.600
 it was we could not answer 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.729
 comment that was not because we 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.170
 exactly when he knew his passive 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 wait and see if you have collected enough six 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.290
 and once that neither on the box 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.729
 he is not the only weapon anymore 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.680
 against Riss was then really that three 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.000
 about one or four against 1 o'clock that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.070
 has worked well and well 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.689
 other points also a great 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.150
 but not so fast 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.490
 striking is the fact that now his 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.079
 his bonuses the whole coal still in 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.020
 thoughts and so on now a faster 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.460
 Success because it is not over at the end of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.100
 cast animation is so if that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.790
 really is out but offering the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.250
 cast animation that is ok comes falls 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.439
 not so much on straight normal 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.659
 Casual range works the absolute 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.100
 about pro is just an extreme 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.750
 notice improvement for everything 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.129
 birds from rice have a certain cast 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.989
 animation you can see it on this 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.730
 beautiful blue beam of then 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.090
 simply because tear down certain time 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.709
 long 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.510
 take to this style to speak at 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.220
 travel to the alps and so if that 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.750
 bar full of orphan spell really 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.879
 Spoke was the floor because of me 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.739
 sweeps then he has this cooldown 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.280
 reduction of course get the presents 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.629
 and so on 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.060
 the whole nonsense the men through the 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.129
 passive holds so and the new ryse makes 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.230
 That's when you look at the banks 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.030
 that expresses the meaning of the coal and the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.980
 ability is already lowered before the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.299
 game was ever spoken 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.730
 which of course leads to you 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.410
 easy again and 01 02 seconds of sport 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.540
 depending on how long for consumption 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.980
 and that's easy in bed because of it 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.930
 are you even faster in the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.420
 situation of your productions 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.579
 and the enemy is especially at rice 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.890
 permanently held that was but the 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.230
 disturbed and at the cs that he did not do that 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.910
 kiju maximizes what he was made of 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.190
 he does not mean that he maximizes something very much 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.349
 much harm makes accepts that he w 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.030
 take the torches high cage that is 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.970
 quasi the mildest variant what the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.640
 harm to go but probably the coolest 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.560
 Anyway that's just stupid 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.090
 I can now easily on the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.040
 hammering and I'm already on the move 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.739
 on level 4 of the camp over the rapper 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.120
 destroying four complexes as traveling 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.680
 usually you have everyone there 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.959
 if you are not a second 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.220
 but here that was not a problem easily 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.299
 have on it and now imagine 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.859
 you are a problem 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.290
 you still have a clue about that 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.190
 mother or you have the kings with it 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.349
 Zero chance people if you want 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.090
 now builds tear him orders and 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.239
 catalyst for your only obstacle 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.660
 That's what you do and that's about you 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.500
 your stacks you get your passive 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.599
 superfast brought the passive 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.730
 were through this by this change 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.079
 that it's at the beginning of the cast animation 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.209
 it is the hammer 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.859
 and as I said six seconds there 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.049
 Almost found if the ultimate too 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.930
 leveling ok clicks kula editorial 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:01.680
 spams shelf is more interested in cool and if 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.940
 that happens at zero so that's it 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.799
 funny but it's tactical I expect 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.769
 a hotfix because today on today 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:15.930
 tuesday we will not be rising 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:18.030
 impossible in principle that is already 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.500
 drove it was quiet 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.450
 But even if you were today 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.490
 rcs want to turn then like 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.650
 An 18 clock is almost 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.389
 Let's go in the description 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.250
 is clear and I hope that we can now 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.319
 quite simply all rice is playing or him 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.699
 in the best case band because he is straight 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.410
 really strong 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.039
 the only weakness we had it 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:43.099
 bad early suppose he is awesome 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.099
 start and have fun at Rheingau
