00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
scene so let's grab a cylinder and let's

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.160 
scene so let's grab a cylinder and let's
draw<00:00:10.019> out<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.559> cylinder<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:14.450> looks<00:00:15.450> pretty

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170

bring it down here okay now when I go to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.660 
bring it down here okay now when I go to
duplicate<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.920> demiclone<00:01:34.400> these<00:01:36.400> about<00:01:37.400> four

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
duplicate a demiclone these about four

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.150 
duplicate a demiclone these about four
clones<00:01:37.940> will<00:01:38.240> be<00:01:38.330> fine<00:01:41.830> actually<00:01:42.830> let's<00:01:43.010> do<00:01:43.130> a

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
clones will be fine actually let's do a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.260 
clones will be fine actually let's do a
little<00:01:43.340> more<00:01:43.490> than<00:01:43.640> four<00:01:46.180> let's<00:01:47.180> do<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.360> mini

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
little more than four let's do that mini

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.740 
little more than four let's do that mini
there<00:01:50.270> we<00:01:50.420> go<00:01:50.570> now<00:01:51.340> let's<00:01:52.340> go<00:01:52.520> ahead<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.940> make

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
there we go now let's go ahead and make

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.680 
there we go now let's go ahead and make
a<00:01:53.780> sphere<00:01:54.730> our<00:01:55.730> basic<00:01:56.060> tab<00:01:56.270> let's<00:01:56.480> grab<00:01:56.660> a

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
a sphere our basic tab let's grab a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.740 
a sphere our basic tab let's grab a
sphere<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:58.280> let's<00:01:58.850> go<00:01:59.030> ahead<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.270> drag<00:01:59.540> out<00:01:59.720> a

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
sphere and let's go ahead and drag out a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.030 
sphere and let's go ahead and drag out a
sphere<00:02:00.140> here<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:02.420> can<00:02:02.570> sit<00:02:02.810> on<00:02:02.840> top

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:16.610 

I'm<00:02:08.040> just<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.490> as<00:02:08.580> even<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:11.450> so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.380 

make<00:02:17.159> it<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.310> little<00:02:17.430> bigger<00:02:17.670> i<00:02:17.790> guess<00:02:18.090> like

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
make it a little bigger i guess like

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.589 
make it a little bigger i guess like
that<00:02:19.080> looks<00:02:19.260> pretty<00:02:19.440> good<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.920> now<00:02:20.909> let's<00:02:21.390> just

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
that looks pretty good so now let's just

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:30.860 
that looks pretty good so now let's just
grab<00:02:22.379> some<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.890> these<00:02:23.310> front<00:02:23.670> faces<00:02:24.330> here

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.130 

look<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.069> let's<00:02:32.819> bevel<00:02:33.209> them<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.080> I'm

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
look so and let's bevel them and I'm

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:43.080 
look so and let's bevel them and I'm
going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.319> bevel<00:02:34.650> them<00:02:34.739> back<00:02:34.890> in

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.699 

like<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:43.989> just<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.129> give<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.910> different<00:02:46.480> look

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
like so just to give it a different look

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.229 
like so just to give it a different look

now we got that in there let's go ahead
and<00:02:49.360> grab<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.660> cylinder<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:52.269> let's<00:02:52.690> draw<00:02:52.930> out<00:02:53.110> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
and grab a cylinder and let's draw out a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.280 
and grab a cylinder and let's draw out a
cylinder

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.670 

this<00:02:59.920> that's<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.730> little<00:03:00.969> bit<00:03:01.120> big<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.719> let<00:03:02.439> some

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.119 
this that's a little bit big so let some
time<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.430> righties<00:03:03.579> down<00:03:03.909> on<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.329> little<00:03:04.540> bit

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
time to righties down on it a little bit

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.280 
time to righties down on it a little bit
looks<00:03:06.129> good

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:22.870 

this<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:11.010> rotate<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:12.019> into<00:03:13.019> place

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:35.570 

and<00:03:23.420> will<00:03:23.870> position<00:03:24.260> it

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.460 

just<00:03:36.240> the<00:03:36.360> best<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.780> can

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.860 

okay<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.580> looks<00:03:42.610> pretty<00:03:43.150> good<00:03:43.270> right<00:03:43.480> there

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
okay that looks pretty good right there

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.630 
okay that looks pretty good right there
yes

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.110 

yeah<00:03:50.210> it<00:03:50.360> looks<00:03:50.510> pretty<00:03:50.690> good<00:03:51.819> let's<00:03:52.819> go<00:03:53.000> ahead

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
yeah it looks pretty good let's go ahead

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:03.000 
yeah it looks pretty good let's go ahead
and<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:55.030> duplicate<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.180> over

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.550 

like<00:04:03.610> that<00:04:03.849> I<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:04.330> use<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.659> mirror<00:04:04.900> function

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
like that I just use the mirror function

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.059 
like that I just use the mirror function
and<00:04:05.769> I'm<00:04:05.890> heared<00:04:06.129> that<00:04:06.189> over<00:04:07.799> ok<00:04:08.799> now<00:04:09.040> let's

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
and I'm heared that over ok now let's

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.550 
and I'm heared that over ok now let's
select<00:04:09.700> our<00:04:10.060> top<00:04:10.420> polygons<00:04:11.019> on<00:04:11.319> these<00:04:11.530> and

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
select our top polygons on these and

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.649 
select our top polygons on these and
just<00:04:11.920> just<00:04:12.040> give<00:04:12.250> them<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.430> little<00:04:12.459> tip<00:04:12.879> this

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
just just give them a little tip this

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.560 
just just give them a little tip this
bevel<00:04:13.989> them<00:04:14.200> like<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:15.909> pull<00:04:16.120> out<00:04:16.299> on<00:04:16.479> the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
bevel them like this and pull out on the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.550 
bevel them like this and pull out on the
red<00:04:16.780> or<00:04:17.139> pull<00:04:17.799> out<00:04:17.889> in<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.100> X<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:20.320> I'm<00:04:20.410> going

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
red or pull out in the X and I'm going

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.650 
red or pull out in the X and I'm going
to<00:04:20.620> shift<00:04:20.799> click<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:22.150> we're<00:04:22.270> going<00:04:22.389> to<00:04:22.419> pull

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
to shift click and we're going to pull

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.129 
to shift click and we're going to pull
it<00:04:22.750> up<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.360> give<00:04:25.479> it<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.600> little<00:04:25.720> top

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
it up just to give it that little top

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.129 
it up just to give it that little top
there<00:04:26.440> like<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:29.669> ok<00:04:30.669> now<00:04:31.600> we<00:04:31.780> got<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:32.110> in

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
there like that ok now we got that in

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.270 
there like that ok now we got that in
there<00:04:34.289> now<00:04:35.289> let's<00:04:35.380> go<00:04:35.560> ahead<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.860> make<00:04:36.250> our

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
there now let's go ahead and make our

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.100 
there now let's go ahead and make our
little<00:04:36.669> wires<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:37.240> go<00:04:37.300> from<00:04:37.570> there<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.960> there

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
little wires that go from there to there

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.140 
little wires that go from there to there
so<00:04:38.830> let's<00:04:39.070> just<00:04:39.250> try<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.580> something

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
so let's just try the something

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.490 
so let's just try the something
different<00:04:40.449> this<00:04:40.510> time<00:04:40.570> we'll<00:04:40.990> try<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.199> tube

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
different this time we'll try the tube

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.909 
different this time we'll try the tube
tool<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.639> I<00:04:43.090> want<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.360> get<00:04:43.510> right<00:04:43.660> in<00:04:43.840> here<00:04:44.350> and

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
tool and I want to get right in here and

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.240 
tool and I want to get right in here and
I'm<00:04:45.010> going<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:49.440> stick<00:04:50.440> it<00:04:50.590> right<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:50.800> there<00:04:51.070> you

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
I'm going to stick it right in there you

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.090 
I'm going to stick it right in there you
can<00:04:51.400> see<00:04:51.430> that<00:04:51.820> is<00:04:51.970> way<00:04:52.210> off<00:04:52.680> we<00:04:53.680> don't<00:04:53.800> want<00:04:54.039> to

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
can see that is way off we don't want to

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.070 
can see that is way off we don't want to
be<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.220> far<00:04:54.669> off<00:04:54.699> so<00:04:55.389> let's<00:04:55.570> bring<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:55.870> over

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
be that far off so let's bring it over

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.220 
be that far off so let's bring it over
here

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.350 

and<00:05:02.800> I'm<00:05:02.860> going<00:05:03.070> to<00:05:03.100> put<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.430> right<00:05:03.640> inside<00:05:03.880> my

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
and I'm going to put it right inside my

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.780 
and I'm going to put it right inside my
little<00:05:05.250> doodad<00:05:06.250> there<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:09.430> let's<00:05:09.580> go<00:05:09.670> to<00:05:09.730> our

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
little doodad there so let's go to our

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.910 
little doodad there so let's go to our
model<00:05:10.150> quad<00:05:10.390> view<00:05:10.780> so<00:05:11.170> we<00:05:11.200> can<00:05:11.410> see<00:05:11.620> what<00:05:11.770> we're

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
model quad view so we can see what we're

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.640 
model quad view so we can see what we're
doing<00:05:12.690> now<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:13.750> can<00:05:13.930> see<00:05:14.080> our<00:05:14.230> little<00:05:16.650> yellow

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
doing now you can see our little yellow

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.880 
doing now you can see our little yellow
dot<00:05:17.950> here<00:05:18.460> here<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.030> here<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:19.990> let's<00:05:20.710> go<00:05:20.860> ahead

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
dot here here and here so let's go ahead

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:28.710 
dot here here and here so let's go ahead
and<00:05:21.540> bring<00:05:22.540> out<00:05:22.720> our<00:05:22.750> tube<00:05:23.110> tool<00:05:27.210> then<00:05:28.210> we<00:05:28.540> need

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
and bring out our tube tool then we need

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:38.959 
and bring out our tube tool then we need
to<00:05:28.840> make<00:05:28.990> it<00:05:29.110> come<00:05:29.350> up<00:05:31.980> look<00:05:32.980> so

then<00:05:39.539> let's<00:05:39.779> continue<00:05:40.110> on<00:05:40.439> with<00:05:40.829> our<00:05:40.949> pattern

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:41.459 
then let's continue on with our pattern

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:52.600 
then let's continue on with our pattern
here<00:05:41.789> we'll<00:05:42.149> make<00:05:42.269> it<00:05:42.329> a<00:05:42.569> little<00:05:43.639> crooked

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610

I was going up here and let's select mmm
this<00:07:32.360> polygon<00:07:33.310> so<00:07:34.310> i<00:07:34.370> can<00:07:34.550> adjust<00:07:34.639> it<00:07:35.000> over

00:07:36.809 --> 00:07:36.819 
this polygon so i can adjust it over

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:44.570 
this polygon so i can adjust it over
like<00:07:37.819> so
