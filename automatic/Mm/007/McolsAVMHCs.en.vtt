00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.570
 welcome to blums tv yes 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.550
 we still have winter and dull weather 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.020
 weather in the grip there we try 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.029
 again through some colorful 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.949
 Decoration ideas spring into the house too 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.860
 pick and which flowers will be for this 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.360
 better suited than tulips exactly the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.700
 namely, there is already from december to 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.270
 buy and in many many colorful 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.129
 to dye 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.170
 In any case, I am looking forward to each one 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.480
 times on the first bunch press that me 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.059
 buy in my favorite flower shop 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.920
 yes and then nothing like off in the vase 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.629
 so as here in our studio 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.120
 really a really big ostrich 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.010
 I think flowers are florists 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.600
 claudia dress the bluhms design team 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.640
 Working is this form of design 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.620
 but too simplistic 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.420
 she therefore has some ideas for her 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.550
 developed look like how 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.859
 just kill by a skilled one 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.749
 Arrangement look even more impressive 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.199
 can and the living ambience too 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.199
 to adjust 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.040
 8th 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.720
 really really great decoration ideas 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.190
 which we just saw in the movie 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.930
 then you would like to do so 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.370
 rush in immediately and the whole in 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.870

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.130
 yes and all the ideas come from 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.780
 this person here we are 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.520

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.449

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.669
 Nice that you're here 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.620
 There are many others 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.270
 types and varieties of turks the man 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.470
 certainly also beautiful in scene 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.360
 can what you have there still offer 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.000
 exactly there are many different ones 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.930
 pressing sorts on is stuffed tulip it 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.139
 which ones have a jagged 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.479
 edge so-called parrot tulips or 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.030
 French debts are all too 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.070
 long and have a lily-like 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.229
 flower form so see us partly completely 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.180
 ball from just right and the whole 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.590
 many different colors this 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.570
 Then spring gives easy 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.919
 really the agony of choice is that you 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.030
 almost can not decide 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.830
 Now I have with me always 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.030
 feel that no matter what kind of thurk 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.979
 I want to put myself in the vase 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.200
 go in super fast what am I doing 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.880
 so you should go after the purchase 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.320
 always cut the tulips fresh and 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.490
 you can owe the freshness of the 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.260
 Check if you give me one 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.620
 tour travels through I show let's set 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:36.090
 directly in the test here you that platter 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:39.570
 tool takes and that in and out 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.120
 squeak then creates a fresh 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.500
 Idea now I always have that 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.970
 Feeling that dead are super thirsty 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.680
 because every time I is to cook the 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.539
 water again I'll do away 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.320
 Something wrong is it right or what 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.360
 you have to do there 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.970
 Cuts are generally true 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.620
 drunk and need a lot of water 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.840
 but you should actually drink too 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.669
 make very little water and like us 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.010
 add a little water every two days 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.229
 and so loses some not even then 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.780
 mold or vase tools 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.460
 super very sensible and advisable 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.620
