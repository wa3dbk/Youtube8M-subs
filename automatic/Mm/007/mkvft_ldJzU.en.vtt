00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.660
 practical in the sense that briefly 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.740
 roam the menu to find something you can 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.200

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.630
 yourself as soon as possible not very 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.030

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.510

 speed modes and so on but it 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:31.139
 it was just awful it was unbearable 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.120
 until I figured something turns on 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.349
 just navigating through the setup process 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.349
 and so found nothing 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.470
 here 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.640

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.350
 I did this a little bother me not 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.390
 understand how to enter routes for them not 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.700

 Yes, I do not even know what more you can 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.940
 to tell you about this radio because 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.890
 reviews probably considered the high end 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.250
 series 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.590
 Naturally the same requirements for it 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:19.050
