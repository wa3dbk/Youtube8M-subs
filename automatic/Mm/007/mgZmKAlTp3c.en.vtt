00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello to all cuberos today is a day a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.620
 little cloudy but nothing happens because 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:16.049
 we have a package just arrived from 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:18.270
 club sys.com.ar the authorities with efe 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.900
 2 cl academy you know we're with 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.029
 efe 2 l advanced then let's open this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.870
 package but before opening what 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.170
 we have on the table 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.720
 what operations are I in because we have 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.730
 here sanding 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.010
 to make a modification to four 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.790
 by four by four without the famous show 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.410
 Modification consists floriÃ¡n 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:52.910
 and summarizing much as Well 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.810
 consists basically in preparing the 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.510
 pieces 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.840
 for the cube to turn better this is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.260
 filing parts that stick out a little 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.580
 as you can see here in this piece already what 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.850
 I did have removed these good outgoing 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.910
 who is very interested in this topic 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.130
 you tell me in comments every one a video 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.620
 little more complete about this 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 modification anyway there are many 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.840
 tutorials on youtube but but good if 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.450
 you want me to explain it and that you 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.560
 show how the 4x4 is already modified 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.390
 I show you without any problem 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.390
 let's open this already here 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.350
 to see what we have 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:55.460
 To the package we have two cubes 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.460
 in the two demons at a glance you see 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.160
 worth one is the mode when the last 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.150
 three times three that has taken off like me 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.150
 it's very cheap 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.549
 crazy feeling let's open this first 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.260
 in this cube 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.629
 It calls quite a lot of attention 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.610
 it took time to see whether focus 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.630
 the camera and we are already a while ago 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.180
 that they put it on the market 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.640
 but good in the end you fell in the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.230
 temptation because he called me a lot a lot 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.269
 the attention this cube 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.599
 but mostly because of the videos I saw 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.220
 I was struck by how well it turns 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.040
 and here I am checking it tour 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.010
 very well you know that this cube 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.370
 the gillette is like the fisher cube but 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.319
 with the lines a little bit 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.260
 displaced what makes you have a 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.170
 look even more sinister no if you 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.780
 we reformed and well I think that it 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:13.629
 It solves just like a fisherman cube 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.400
 the spin is great the colors like 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.310
 always the demos 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.930
 that based on repeating them, they are going to 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.069
 like everyone pretty 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.310
 you know I am the geek of the stickers 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.310
 but good 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.110
 I will make a more in-depth video with 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:39.060
 this cube let's see if I can deal with it 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.599
 yes i know how to solve 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.060
 and I'll tell you but the feeling when turning 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.860
 it's fantastic let's see the other 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.860
 cube the very same no 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.600
 that is very cheap pamphlet and there we go 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.500
 there 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.040
 Well I'm glad you moya and put the 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.310
 stickers to your cubes with the shape of 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.010
 the pieces, let's see what happens today to 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.010
 this camera that does not focus hello 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.400
 Well I'm talking and I guess now 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.190
 will focus sorry for the problems 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.160
 now 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.280
 As I said, I'm glad that I put the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.160
 shape of the stickers the cube does not weigh 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.740
 nothing compared to others seems maybe 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.340
 a little bit smaller if you wait, I'm going to 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.090
 compare it with the mold 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.480
 I dance although I have here effectively it is 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.550
 maybe something imperceptible but already one 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.570
 He has experience and realizes when 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.570
 a hub is smaller 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.969
 a joyce 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:57.349
 these first turns is hard 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.349
 no doubt comes dry 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.270
 the boyle or I have not already worked 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.910
 and as you can see this costs me but it is not 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.110
 because the bucket is bad and I like the 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.770
 sensations well if then by the way 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.599
 novelty 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.720
 sticker in the same ones always 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.069
 colors and how do I say good 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.909
 sensations is also a little 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:28.370
 tight I think and without any lubricant 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.370
 that's why it's very 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:35.010
 well, it is very difficult not to 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.900
 It's hard for me to turn corners fast 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.900
 considering it is tight 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.330
 good 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.270
 it's not bad that this cube is worth three 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.400
 dollars or less or 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.710
 the unbroken corner is tight but 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.740
 but still it seems that good it costs 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.920
 but but they do rotate pieces to see how 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.920
 are 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.110
 it reminds me a little to the ground really 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.690
 but maybe the plastic is a bit 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.240
 better because I like the turn more than the 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.180
 I still do what I tell you 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.530
 missing when locating it then nothing up here 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.530
 this little unboxing 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.380
 I hope you liked these two 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.420
 cubes 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.200
 this I love the gillette I have many 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.570
 I want to put myself with him. 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.880
 so small stickers that come 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.590
 even crooked to see what I do for 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.260
 solve this I hope it does not cause me 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.020
 problems nothing else I hope that I have 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.460
 liked and very soon more videos in one 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.460
 minute opa until then cuberos
