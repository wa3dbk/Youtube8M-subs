00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.840
 of this channel is already game Friday and 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 if you do not want to miss a single one 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.250
 make sure you subscribe to the channel on 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.869
 today we will see a simple game 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.789
 that will remind us a little 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.189
 childhood some is a game with a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.439
 very geek style in these times and it's 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.660
 that this is the typical game of 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.480
 races that we played in tetris or in 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.610
 some other console mini console more 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.559
 well said videogame of the very 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.690
 old the dynamics of the game is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.969
 exactly the same as it was in that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.010
 then you have a cart that is 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.079
 formed by a few pixels and at 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.629
 start the game the speed goes very 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.039
 extremely slow is slow until 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.320
 you start to bore a bit at the beginning 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.090
 throughout the race you have to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.399
 carry other carts that will go 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.289
 running and blocks that are there 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.030
 clogging t so you have to go 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.489
 controlling the car simply to 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.100
 left or right as it goes by 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.379
 the time the game starts to go a little 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.420
 faster and it's obviously more 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.460
 difficult to control and ski 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.070
 to the objects the game interface 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.380
 try to imitate tetris a little or this 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.299
 kind of consoles very old and the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.250
 truth is very well achieved what is 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.470
 miss in this game is the sound 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.869
 since it does not have any kind of sound 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 more than the typical sound that you already have 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.229
 device at the push of a button 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.850
 that same sound will sound when 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.950
 press the left buttons or 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 right finally when you lose the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.180
 game and you crash with either a cart or 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.490
 with a block the screen starts to 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.289
 get black in terms of pixels and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 achieves an effect very similar to what 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.270
 it was in tetris after losing you 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.950
 request to log in to score loop if 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.990
 is that you want to upload your bookmark and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.149
 compare it with the rest of the world with 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 your friends here is another mistake because 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.009
 now that is google play game it would be 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.479
 much much better that they will implement this 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.179
 bookmark mode since it is 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.069
 graphically more friendly and it is also 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.869
 Easier to add to your friends but 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.759
 well that was all for this Friday 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.679
 of game they put the comments that you 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.520
 liked and that you did not like this game and 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.520
 see you next 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.060
 here 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.730
 ah
