a pill here the way it's like divided
and<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.570> shape<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.289> still<00:00:49.559> pretty

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and the shape of it but still pretty

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.439 
and the shape of it but still pretty
neat<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.000> interesting<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
neat one thing that's interesting is

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.760 
neat one thing that's interesting is
that<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.719> button<00:00:51.989> press<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.620> like

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that the button press for it is like

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
that the button press for it is like
this<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.129> flute<00:00:53.430> thingy<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.910> Regan's

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this little flute thingy like Regan's

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.330 
this little flute thingy like Regan's
even<00:00:55.140> though<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> bear<00:00:55.559> lock<00:00:55.800> seat<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
even though it's a bear lock seat but I

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
even though it's a bear lock seat but I
mean<00:00:56.579> they're<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.210> exclusively

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
mean they're not like exclusively

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.330 
mean they're not like exclusively
designed<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.980> thought<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.129> was

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
designed but I just thought that was

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.060 
designed but I just thought that was
worth<00:00:59.489> note<00:00:59.699> anyhow<00:01:00.590> pretty<00:01:01.590> neat<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:01.980> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
worth note anyhow pretty neat when you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
worth note anyhow pretty neat when you
open<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> little<00:01:03.780> slice

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
open it up here you get the little slice

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.560 
open it up here you get the little slice
version<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.489> his<00:01:05.700> hammer<00:01:06.030> down<00:01:06.270> here

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
version and then his hammer down here

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.469 
version and then his hammer down here
like<00:01:07.110> usual<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.729> don't<00:01:08.729> think<00:01:09.090> I've<00:01:09.210> pointed

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
like usual I don't think I've pointed

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.090 
like usual I don't think I've pointed
this<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.869> anything<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.320> lock<00:01:10.530> seed<00:01:10.740> reviews
