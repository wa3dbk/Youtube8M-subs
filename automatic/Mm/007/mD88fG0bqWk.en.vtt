00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:13.000
 the TV model is this ll 32 c 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.000
 550 j 1 f 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.490
 very well this television has the 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.830
 next fault he has nothing 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.590
 and they listened to the music descended and this 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.930
 it's like the way that the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.919
 television we realize that it has 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.919
 here an impact 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.150
 and have seen how the whole TV is 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.710
 the screen damaged this screen is not 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.400
 Can repair any of these screens 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.850
 you can repair the only thing that can be 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.780
 to do in this case is to change all the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.790
 screen that is a friend a kind of 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.760
 demi let's call it that way the thickness of 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:00.090
 television is all this in the rotor of the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.640
 lcd screen would be 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.100
 thinner than the artist I am 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.110
 using here as half more or 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 less then all that is what there is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.010
 to change because this can not be 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.930
 repair and if it is dictated into account when 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 I'm dragging the pencil on the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 screen that is reached to see is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.750
 because I'm supporting the liquid crystal 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.060
 which is on the mere screen of this is not 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.190
 should do with a web TV because 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.119
 We could definitely damage it if 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.740
 here does not take damage say the television 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.540
 in this of ander I am doing but not 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.080
 I care if they receive it or because they no longer 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.300
 if not then they are if they did not 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.310
 new TV for this and it does not 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.170
 spent anything because what good but if 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.479
 I do it and it stays with that stain 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.790
 then it will not be any good 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.750
 then note that this impact could 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.080
 have been 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.150
 charge that received this screen to be 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.330
 transported because according to the account 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.160
 owner who moved out of home then 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.229
 maybe they put something on the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.479
 screen or on the house where the 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.369
 screen and they did not notice and so what 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.830
 what to do is that it can be broken 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.740
 see it breaks the whole screen 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.350
 then this does not work anymore sometimes 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.860
 you can hear a bit the signal from 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.880
 channel that was tuned 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.880
 we'll see 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.470
 then listen 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.190
 as we correct as an internet not 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.190
 exactly 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:40.620
 and it's like a radius that can not be 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.329
 see the programming unlike the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.329
 old TVs here I have a 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.540
 but it can not be one so waiting for 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.670
 nothing happens to an LCD TV and 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.830
 of nominal plasma will be as desire of 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.710
 silver or what is called 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.050
 likewise an lcd screen but with 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.820
 another technology in the back that 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.790
 It is the one that makes all the 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.680
 screen then be careful not the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.730
 hit neither with the remote control nor with 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.290
 the hand or with your finger do so nothing 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.590
 because fracture will cost them the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.350
 repair is the change of the panel between 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.300
 50 and 70 percent of the total value of 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.680
 his television 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.500
 then this one has a lot of caution 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.900
 and if you have a television like 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.879
 these 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.739
 can you bring it here let's try 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:38.930
 repair any other fault that you have 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:41.239
 minus the panel fracture sometimes 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.629
 it may happen that the impact was not so 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.530
 severe that only that area was damaged 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.319
 little 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.659
 and you can still see the image in 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.400
 the whole screen in a normal way except 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:57.379
 that you will see a blot here if all the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.560
 programming but in this case it was so 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:03.349
 severe that the damage to much of the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.209
 screen if in fact the entire screen of 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.040
 fractures that come from here by 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:12.409
 example noten is the from here to the 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.039
 another end do not realize the same 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:18.680
 down here then with very serious the 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.639
 damage that he receives then I leave them for 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.249
 that you can 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.749
 and realize that they are delicate 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.749
 screens and be very careful
