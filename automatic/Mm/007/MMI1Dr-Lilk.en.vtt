everyone this is Sheldon I'm still
working<00:00:06.120> on<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.359> templates<00:00:06.839> for<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.350> hidden

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
working on the templates for this hidden

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.549 
working on the templates for this hidden
blade<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.460> still<00:00:08.730> need<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.090> drill<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.260> couple

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
blade and I still need to drill a couple

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.330 
blade and I still need to drill a couple
more<00:00:10.950> holes<00:00:11.660> basically<00:00:12.660> right<00:00:13.320> there<00:00:13.650> right

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
more holes basically right there right

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.310 
more holes basically right there right
there<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.639> right<00:00:14.940> there<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.839> takes<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.170> really

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
there and right there it takes a really

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.140 
there and right there it takes a really
long<00:00:16.410> time<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.890> drill<00:00:17.250> these<00:00:17.400> holes<00:00:17.460> because<00:00:18.119> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
long time to drill these holes because I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450 
long time to drill these holes because I
have<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.600> do<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.930> by<00:00:19.170> hand<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.039> pretty<00:00:20.220> much

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
have to do it by hand it's pretty much

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.150 
have to do it by hand it's pretty much
these<00:00:20.910> four<00:00:21.359> front<00:00:22.170> ones<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.859> are<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
these four front ones that are the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
these four front ones that are the
hardest<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.600> thick<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
hardest because this is so thick and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.009 
hardest because this is so thick and
it's<00:00:25.830> hard<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> keep<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.420> completely

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
it's hard to keep it all completely

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.200 
it's hard to keep it all completely
vertical<00:00:28.800> these<00:00:29.130> two<00:00:29.310> back<00:00:29.550> ones<00:00:29.820> should<00:00:30.060> be

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
vertical these two back ones should be

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.479 
vertical these two back ones should be
pretty<00:00:30.539> easy<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.410> also<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.920> here<00:00:32.250> this

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
pretty easy you can also see here this

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
pretty easy you can also see here this
is<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> little<00:00:33.090> bit<00:00:33.239> more<00:00:33.450> shiny<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.620> don't

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
is a little bit more shiny now I don't

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.830 
is a little bit more shiny now I don't
know<00:00:34.890> if<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.430> tell<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.570> I'm

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
know if you can really tell but I'm

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.410 
know if you can really tell but I'm
basically<00:00:37.020> polishing<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> top<00:00:38.309> cover<00:00:38.670> this

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
basically polishing the top cover this

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.350 
basically polishing the top cover this
back<00:00:39.719> part<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.230> almost<00:00:40.710> done<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.120> front

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
back part is almost done and the front

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.479 
back part is almost done and the front
part<00:00:42.629> needs<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.800> more<00:00:43.980> polishing

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
part needs you know some more polishing

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
part needs you know some more polishing
there<00:00:44.730> will<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.120> video<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:45.690> soon<00:00:45.780> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
there will be a video very soon that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.709 
there will be a video very soon that
explains<00:00:46.950> how<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.640> polish<00:00:47.850> paper<00:00:48.329> it's

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
explains how to polish paper it's

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.630 
explains how to polish paper it's
actually<00:00:49.530> quite<00:00:49.829> simple<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.460> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
actually quite simple as just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.850 
actually quite simple as just
time-consuming<00:00:51.570> these<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.170> what<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
time-consuming these are what I have so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.850 
time-consuming these are what I have so
far<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> main

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
far as you can see this is the main

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.459 
far as you can see this is the main
lower<00:00:55.860> frame<00:00:56.719> excluding<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> top<00:00:58.020> cover<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
lower frame excluding the top cover and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.619 
lower frame excluding the top cover and
the<00:00:58.710> wheel<00:00:58.859> housing<00:00:59.160> has<00:01:00.000> all<00:01:00.239> those<00:01:00.390> little

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the wheel housing has all those little

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.979 
the wheel housing has all those little
parts<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.800> need<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.660> that's<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
parts that you need and that's just

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.740 
parts that you need and that's just
another<00:01:04.260> sketch<00:01:04.850> those<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> parts<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
another sketch those are the parts that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
another sketch those are the parts that
you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.439> slide<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.130> two<00:01:08.280> sliding

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
you know slide the two sliding

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.410 
you know slide the two sliding
components<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.010> that's<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> top<00:01:11.430> cover<00:01:11.820> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
components and that's the top cover and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
components and that's the top cover and
the<00:01:13.110> lock<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.369> really

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the lock and I know this is really

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
the lock and I know this is really
really<00:01:14.850> small<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.840> I'm<00:01:15.990> probably<00:01:16.200> going

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
really small on here I'm probably going

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.940 
really small on here I'm probably going
to<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.490> further<00:01:17.820> apart<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.470> fit

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
to put them further apart so I can fit

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.789 
to put them further apart so I can fit
dimensions<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.820> there's<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.390> gear<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
dimensions on there's the gear and this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.340 
dimensions on there's the gear and this
is<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> slider<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.299> need<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.869> show<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
is the slider and I need to show a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.070 
is the slider and I need to show a
couple<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:25.950> views<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.750> slider

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
couple other views because the slider

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.920 
couple other views because the slider
for<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.070> hidden<00:01:29.400> blade<00:01:29.640> has<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.570> know<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
for this hidden blade has you know a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.340 
for this hidden blade has you know a
stabilization<00:01:31.710> piece<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.270> bottom<00:01:33.450> let<00:01:34.259> me

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
stabilization piece on the bottom let me

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
stabilization piece on the bottom let me
show<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:36.710> take<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.890> off<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.060> has

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
show you here take this off see it has

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.960 
show you here take this off see it has
this<00:01:39.560> piece<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.520> piece<00:01:41.729> right

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
this piece right here and a piece right

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
this piece right here and a piece right
here<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.020> keeps<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.409> all<00:01:43.560> stable<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
here and that keeps it all stable and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.090 
here and that keeps it all stable and
everything<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.450> probably<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.649> show

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
everything so I'm probably going to show

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.850 
everything so I'm probably going to show
a<00:01:47.130> couple<00:01:47.430> other<00:01:47.790> views<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.720> these<00:01:49.140> parts<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
a couple other views of these parts and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
a couple other views of these parts and
of<00:01:50.130> course<00:01:50.430> put<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.420> dimensions<00:01:52.079> on

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
of course put all of the dimensions on

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.469 
of course put all of the dimensions on
there<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.890> only<00:01:53.130> problem<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
there the only problem is with the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.859 
there the only problem is with the
bigger<00:01:54.720> parts<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.070> mainframe<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.329> if

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
bigger parts like this mainframe here if

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.709 
bigger parts like this mainframe here if
I<00:01:58.049> try<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.490> put<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> top<00:02:00.240> view<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
I try to you know put the top view and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.920 
I try to you know put the top view and
the<00:02:01.320> left<00:02:01.560> side<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:01.950> whichever<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> need

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
the left side or whichever one I need

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.840 
the left side or whichever one I need
dimensions<00:02:03.930> won't<00:02:04.200> entirely<00:02:04.710> fit<00:02:05.310> when<00:02:05.700> this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
dimensions won't entirely fit when this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.359 
dimensions won't entirely fit when this
is<00:02:06.030> printed<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> one-to-one<00:02:08.099> scale

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
is printed out to a one-to-one scale

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.660 
is printed out to a one-to-one scale
meaning<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> exact<00:02:10.560> size<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.039> you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
meaning this is the exact size that you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
meaning this is the exact size that you
would<00:02:11.790> need<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.180> glue<00:02:12.900> on

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
would need to glue on

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920 
would need to glue on
cut<00:02:14.010> out<00:02:14.189> to<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.970> right<00:02:15.120> shape<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.659> I

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
cut out to be the right shape and I

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.619 
cut out to be the right shape and I
can't<00:02:16.260> really<00:02:16.739> fit<00:02:17.189> all<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:18.060> these<00:02:18.239> on<00:02:18.480> an

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
can't really fit all of these on an

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.679 
can't really fit all of these on an
eight-and-a-half<00:02:19.140> by<00:02:19.650> 11<00:02:20.189> piece<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.819> paper<00:02:21.120> so

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
eight-and-a-half by 11 piece of paper so

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.330 
eight-and-a-half by 11 piece of paper so
basically<00:02:22.019> once<00:02:22.319> I'm<00:02:22.500> finished<00:02:22.890> with<00:02:22.980> all<00:02:23.189> of

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
basically once I'm finished with all of

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.220 
basically once I'm finished with all of
these<00:02:23.459> I'm<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.060> put<00:02:24.150> them<00:02:24.480> into<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.930> PDF

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
these I'm going to put them into a PDF

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.860 
these I'm going to put them into a PDF
file<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:26.220> I'm<00:02:26.760> pretty<00:02:27.090> sure<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:27.510> able<00:02:27.689> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
file and I'm pretty sure I'm able to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.410 
file and I'm pretty sure I'm able to
share<00:02:28.200> them<00:02:28.500> off<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.920> my<00:02:29.099> Google<00:02:29.370> Drive<00:02:29.939> I<00:02:30.269> will

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
share them off of my Google Drive I will

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.780 
share them off of my Google Drive I will
be<00:02:30.540> showing<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.930> guys<00:02:31.109> how<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.640> print<00:02:32.640> these

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
be showing you guys how to print these

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.720 
be showing you guys how to print these
out<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.450> perfect<00:02:34.079> one-to-one<00:02:34.829> scale<00:02:35.099> so<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
out to a perfect one-to-one scale so you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.539 
out to a perfect one-to-one scale so you
can<00:02:35.930> glue<00:02:36.930> them<00:02:37.109> onto<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.560> hardened<00:02:38.129> piece<00:02:38.400> of

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
can glue them onto a hardened piece of

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.660 
can glue them onto a hardened piece of
paper<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:40.040> cut<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.159> out<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.549> will

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
paper like this and cut it out it will

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.089 
paper like this and cut it out it will
be<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.030> perfect<00:02:42.480> size<00:02:42.689> it's<00:02:43.260> very<00:02:43.409> helpful<00:02:43.859> to

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
be the perfect size it's very helpful to

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.509 
be the perfect size it's very helpful to
already<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.690> correct<00:02:46.260> size<00:02:46.620> that

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
already have it the correct size that

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.160 
already have it the correct size that
way<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.760> don't<00:02:47.849> have<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> do<00:02:48.269> any<00:02:48.420> scaling<00:02:49.019> of

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
way you don't have to do any scaling of

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.229 
way you don't have to do any scaling of
your<00:02:49.319> own<00:02:49.470> basically<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> need<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.730> make<00:02:51.090> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
your own basically I need to make the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.559 
your own basically I need to make the
blueprint<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.139> and<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.700> rotating<00:02:54.150> pin

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
blueprint for this and the rotating pin

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.990 
blueprint for this and the rotating pin
and<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.109> wheel<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.010> lock<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.639> a<00:02:56.730> couple

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
and the wheel and the lock and a couple

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.789 
and the wheel and the lock and a couple
other<00:02:57.239> parts<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.870> can't<00:02:58.200> really<00:02:58.379> think<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.739> them

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
other parts I can't really think of them

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.949 
other parts I can't really think of them
all<00:02:58.920> right<00:02:58.950> now<00:02:59.129> and<00:02:59.549> I<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.329> blade<00:03:00.569> and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
templates and the tutorials so not too

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.530 
templates and the tutorials so not too
