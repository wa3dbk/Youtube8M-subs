 rock and roll and to grow 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.360
 the rock and roll tradition lived necessarily on 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.720
 the police or the police should do 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.250
 some kind of proclivities towards 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.890
 cold musicians not related 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.390
 lime so long as it is

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.019
 decades which wants 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.150
 Russian rapper said that even if you 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.800
 play the worst of all but your 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.260
 the group doesn't break up twenty or 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.000
 thirty years then you are guaranteed 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.000
 have a stadium after 20 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.129
 according to when we arrived with a concert 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.849
 lower tagil we saw a huge lineup 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.040
 to the cashier 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.349
 we thought how cool so many people 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.569
 camp came and wait it turned out that everything 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.760
 these people tried to monetize tickets 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.810
 on billy's band we paid for 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.810
 salary and combine 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.420
 killer 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.740
 but came 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.740
 but 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.300
 Do you understand the songs? 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:09.990
 photo and more so this is performed 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:14.400
 any original emotion and she's everything 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:18.290
 equals and turns into nothing 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.290
 another how cute with many song 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.589
 Well 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.509
 each team is a certain emotion 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.819
 to which people come and and get 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.180
 cast nose what is happening project one 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.900
 the film is so strange too 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.940
 emotions and which 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.919
 which in real life may even be 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.979
 hardly anyone can experience on coming to 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.580
 dance or get or think what 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.580
 gets 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.250
 every end you are still small 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.290
 performance in our case all the words 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.160
 which can be pronounced from the stage they 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:27.610
 encased in the soup of music and 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.590
 can only be there i think that 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.190
 any say or drop random 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.740
 word from the stage she can destroy such 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.090
 some theatricality of what is happening 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.090
 so we prefer 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:53.759
 and say this is something that everyone 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.759
 is that 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:05.240
 aa
