00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.160
 There is a journey seat of Hello After beat Music School Guitar School lecturer 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 I will 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:17.490
 In order to shoot a video of the drum of the 2013 version Christmas video this time too 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.370
 I am allowed to disturb you in Sagamihara of the belt loop studio's in Well of this time 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:27.610
 Overall the music that this White Christmas 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:32.620
 Because it is made up of beads called shuffle, this shuffle is properly done 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:39.100
 I think I'm very happy if you get nesting while I do not have shuffle 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:41.360
 It's a rhythm that feels like it bounces a little if you talk a little 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.110
 It's not shuffle rhythm 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.820
 But I say 8 beats with even even 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.430
 Please compare and play more 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.329
 How different 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.780
 This is not a good good 8 b 4 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.780
 Pan 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.420
 This kind of rhythm 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.310
 So I grew up thinking about what it feels like to be a shuffle bounce rhythm 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.960
 I will 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.960
 1 2 eo 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:31.520
 I think that you can understand very much by comparing it like this, but how is it? 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:34.789
 It's kind of like a dad, but it seems like it was after shuffle. 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.100
 To put rhythm to what or cheerful, such as to skip a little something in the feeling 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.650
 But I think that you understand 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.410
 While keeping this atmosphere from the beginning to the end 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:51.390
 I think if you can play 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:55.190
 In a ridge different from last year's jingle bell, basically it's always the same rhythm so much 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.190
 I think ok if repeated 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:15.940
 pou dou dou 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.410
 pane 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:37.400
 This kind of rhythm 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:44.959
 Bouburn and Panch 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:49.459
 It took a tip Tot turn without not you took Tanto. I feel the turn go in strange feeling 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:55.489
 This pretty please try to play with it in this heaven Feng 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:57.390
 It 's very difficult and hard to keep on stepping this while jumping on the right 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.160
 I even though I can not be too much 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.880
 I think I should be careful with that place and I think that I should be able to crash my right hand 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.130
 Going or 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.460
 Ok if you can go on a ride and write the location of the right hand in various places as you like 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:16.040
 Do you feel like 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:20.710
 But it's still enough at all, it 's easy to grow at all, so you can do more things like this 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:26.230
 For those who like to tell you something interesting 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:30.310

 To say this is head and face 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.700
