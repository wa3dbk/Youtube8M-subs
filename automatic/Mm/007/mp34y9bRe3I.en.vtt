00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
majority of the show being imprisoned or

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.420 
majority of the show being imprisoned or
actually<00:01:11.899> probably<00:01:12.500> half<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.860> show<00:01:13.220> he<00:01:13.399> was

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
actually probably half the show he was

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.240 
actually probably half the show he was
imprisoned<00:01:13.850> by<00:01:15.880> by<00:01:16.880> magna<00:01:17.509> Corps<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.250> the

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
idea is when the other two in humanoids

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.540 
idea is when the other two in humanoids
learned<00:01:22.280> of<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:22.700> they<00:01:23.950> their<00:01:24.950> plan<00:01:25.280> was<00:01:25.490> to

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
break him loose and and he was going to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.340 
break him loose and and he was going to
take<00:01:27.920> over<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.340> earth<00:01:28.520> again<00:01:29.020> if<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:30.200> have<00:01:30.320> a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
take over the earth again if we have a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.510 
take over the earth again if we have a
look<00:01:30.530> at<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.770> box<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.929> Box<00:01:33.229> actually<00:01:33.740> I<00:01:33.920> was

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.030 
box the same earth and an exposed Center
and<00:02:26.720> then<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.900> only<00:02:27.140> thing<00:02:27.230> they've<00:02:27.530> done<00:02:27.560> is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
and then the only thing they've done is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.890 
and then the only thing they've done is
which<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.670> actually<00:02:28.819> funny<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.750> only

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
which is actually funny that the only

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.390 
which is actually funny that the only
thing<00:02:30.050> they've<00:02:30.200> done<00:02:30.379> is<00:02:30.530> they've<00:02:30.709> put<00:02:31.069> in<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
thing they've done is they've put in the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.790 
thing they've done is they've put in the
different<00:02:32.239> characters<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.930> it's

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
different characters and it's

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.410 
different characters and it's
interesting<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.459> all<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.700> characters<00:02:35.239> have

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
interesting that all the characters have

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420 
interesting that all the characters have
white<00:02:35.720> around<00:02:36.020> them<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.560> it's<00:02:36.860> almost<00:02:37.190> like

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
white around them so it's almost like

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.920 
white around them so it's almost like
they<00:02:37.579> just<00:02:37.609> stuck<00:02:38.150> stickers<00:02:38.689> on<00:02:38.870> here<00:02:39.109> but

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
they just stuck stickers on here but

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.770 
they just stuck stickers on here but
it's<00:02:41.930> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
it's it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.020 
it's it
nice<00:02:42.959> box<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.800> course<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.640> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
nice box and then of course there is the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.210 
nice box and then of course there is the
file<00:02:45.450> card<00:02:45.810> format<00:02:46.200> lar<00:02:46.380> down<00:02:46.620> below<00:02:47.040> here<00:02:49.220> not

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
file card format lar down below here not

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.309 
file card format lar down below here not
much<00:02:50.430> really<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.850> say<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.569> way<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> box<00:02:52.080> that

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
much really to say in the way a box that

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.770 
much really to say in the way a box that
I<00:02:52.350> haven't<00:02:52.560> already<00:02:52.770> said<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.160> decompose<00:02:53.880> so

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
I haven't already said for decompose so

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.740 
I haven't already said for decompose so
maybe<00:02:55.500> what<00:02:55.709> I'll<00:02:55.830> do<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.190> I'll<00:02:56.510> stop<00:02:57.510> this

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
maybe what I'll do is I'll stop this

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.650 
maybe what I'll do is I'll stop this
here<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.350> I'll<00:02:58.440> open<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:59.040> guy<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.670> we'll

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
here and I'll open the guy up and we'll

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.440 
here and I'll open the guy up and we'll
get<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.900> closer<00:03:01.290> look<00:03:01.500> at<00:03:01.920> met<00:03:02.340> lar<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.790> here<00:03:03.330> we

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
get a closer look at met lar and here we

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.760 
get a closer look at met lar and here we
have<00:03:03.630> mat<00:03:03.900> lar<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:05.180> very<00:03:06.180> very<00:03:06.690> large<00:03:07.200> figure<00:03:07.620> I

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
have mat lar a very very large figure I

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.530 
have mat lar a very very large figure I
mean<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.250> shouldn't<00:03:08.910> say<00:03:09.060> really<00:03:09.330> large

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
mean I shouldn't say really large

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.120 
mean I shouldn't say really large
because<00:03:09.840> all<00:03:09.989> three<00:03:10.290> aaliyan<00:03:10.530> humanoids<00:03:11.040> are

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
because all three aaliyan humanoids are

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.790 
because all three aaliyan humanoids are
really<00:03:11.340> large<00:03:11.550> but<00:03:11.989> there's<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.290> lot<00:03:13.620> of

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
really large but there's a lot of

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.170 
really large but there's a lot of
substantial<00:03:14.930> mass<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.470> guy<00:03:16.820> if<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:18.000> just

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
substantial mass to this guy if I just

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.870 
substantial mass to this guy if I just
get<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.360> closer<00:03:18.660> look<00:03:18.959> at<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> figure<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.880> move

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
get a closer look at the figure and move

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.460 
get a closer look at the figure and move
the<00:03:21.000> camera<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.450> bit<00:03:21.660> here<00:03:22.019> just<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.350> get<00:03:22.440> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the camera in a bit here just and get a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.810 
the camera in a bit here just and get a
better<00:03:22.590> shot<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.970> figure<00:03:25.040> isn't<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.370> isn't

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
better shot the figure isn't it isn't

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.570 
better shot the figure isn't it isn't
very<00:03:26.850> deep<00:03:27.360> like<00:03:27.989> it's<00:03:28.380> nothing<00:03:28.890> like<00:03:28.920> tendril

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
very deep like it's nothing like tendril

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.990 
very deep like it's nothing like tendril

as<00:03:37.080> good<00:03:37.290> as<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.680> thought<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.100> was<00:03:38.280> but<00:03:38.580> I

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
as good as it I thought it was but I

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.820 
as good as it I thought it was but I
commented<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.370> decompose<00:03:41.370> was<00:03:41.700> very<00:03:42.030> hollow

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
commented that decompose was very hollow

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.509 
commented that decompose was very hollow
this<00:03:43.830> guy<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.550> just<00:03:44.640> as<00:03:45.420> hollow<00:03:45.870> even<00:03:46.530> possibly

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
this guy is just as hollow even possibly

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.380 
this guy is just as hollow even possibly
even<00:03:47.610> more<00:03:47.730> hollow<00:03:48.150> than<00:03:48.920> decomposed<00:03:49.920> and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
even more hollow than decomposed and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.699 
even more hollow than decomposed and
unfortunately<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.510> way<00:03:51.630> he's<00:03:51.780> posed<00:03:52.140> he

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
unfortunately the way he's posed he

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.740 
unfortunately the way he's posed he
doesn't<00:03:53.010> sit<00:03:53.310> well<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.880> his<00:03:54.360> on<00:03:54.570> his<00:03:54.750> legs<00:03:56.750> he

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
does have articulation in the head and

does have articulation in the head and
there<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.720> articulation<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.680> hands<00:04:02.160> but

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
there is articulation in the hands but

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.170 
there is articulation in the hands but
even<00:04:02.790> as<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:03.060> can<00:04:03.090> see<00:04:03.450> age<00:04:04.519> has<00:04:05.519> taken<00:04:06.030> its

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
even as you can see age has taken its

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.690 
even as you can see age has taken its
toll<00:04:06.269> on<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.720> figure<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.320> he<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:07.739> very<00:04:07.769> loose

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
as the the arms here he has the light

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.240 
as the the arms here he has the light
piping<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.049> bring<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:16.680> up<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.890> bit<00:04:16.919> here

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
piping and I just bring it up a bit here

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.340 
piping and I just bring it up a bit here
he<00:04:17.760> does<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.269> light<00:04:18.450> piping<00:04:18.900> at<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.109> top

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
he does have the light piping at the top

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.690 
he does have the light piping at the top
here<00:04:19.709> which<00:04:19.859> at<00:04:20.100> least<00:04:20.250> they've<00:04:20.489> actually

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
here which at least they've actually

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
here which at least they've actually
made<00:04:21.090> into<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.810> horn<00:04:22.169> whereas<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.130> other<00:04:23.250> ones

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
made into a horn whereas the other ones

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.390 
made into a horn whereas the other ones
especially<00:04:24.720> tendril<00:04:25.590> they<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.250> put<00:04:26.370> a

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
especially tendril they just put a

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.730 
especially tendril they just put a
square<00:04:27.090> at<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.330> top<00:04:27.510> here<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.380> idea<00:04:28.650> is

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
square at the top here and the idea is

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.200 
square at the top here and the idea is
the<00:04:28.919> light<00:04:29.100> piping<00:04:29.690> makes<00:04:30.690> his<00:04:30.900> veins<00:04:31.440> glow<00:04:32.210> as

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
the light piping makes his veins glow as

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.350 
the light piping makes his veins glow as
I<00:04:34.140> commented<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.830> my<00:04:35.100> other<00:04:36.590> other<00:04:37.590> review<00:04:38.430> are

enough<00:05:33.930> that's<00:05:34.289> for<00:05:34.439> sure<00:05:35.330> if<00:05:36.330> we<00:05:36.650> take<00:05:37.650> her

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
enough that's for sure if we take her

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.269 
enough that's for sure if we take her
arm<00:05:38.310> strong<00:05:38.639> here<00:05:38.909> the<00:05:39.090> idea<00:05:39.449> that<00:05:40.129> he<00:05:41.129> can

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
arm strong here the idea that he can

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.749

hold<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.960> can<00:05:42.990> hold<00:05:43.620> earth<00:05:43.919> core<00:05:44.310> in<00:05:44.550> his

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
hold you can hold earth core in his

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.679
