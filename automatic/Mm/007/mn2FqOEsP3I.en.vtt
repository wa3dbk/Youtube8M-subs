00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.959 
little box with a jar on it and then you
get<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.310> click<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.790> close<00:01:55.070> same<00:01:56.070> thing<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.729> all

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
get a click on close same thing like all

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.380 
get a click on close same thing like all
minecraft<00:01:57.180> versions<00:01:57.719> double<00:01:58.020> click<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.369> it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
minecraft versions double click on it it

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.069 
minecraft versions double click on it it
should<00:02:00.390> open<00:02:01.049> up<00:02:01.469> minecraft<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> let's<00:02:05.790> just

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
should open up minecraft so let's just

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.440 
should open up minecraft so let's just
get<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.229> open

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
get it open

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.430 
get it open
and<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.879> works<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.390> any<00:02:12.660> other<00:02:13.110> version

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and so this works like any other version

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 
and so this works like any other version
of<00:02:13.530> Minecraft<00:02:14.010> there's<00:02:14.970> no<00:02:15.209> nothing<00:02:15.750> removed

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
of Minecraft there's no nothing removed

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.110 
of Minecraft there's no nothing removed
it's<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.739> just<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.129> any<00:02:17.400> other<00:02:17.519> version

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
it's like just like any other version

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's like just like any other version
like<00:02:18.510> for<00:02:18.840> Windows<00:02:19.200> or<00:02:19.440> Mac<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.269> let's<00:02:21.269> load

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
like for Windows or Mac and let's load

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.110 
like for Windows or Mac and let's load
up<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.690> world<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.819> now<00:02:23.989> create<00:02:24.989> new<00:02:25.110> one

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
up a world like now create new one

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:35.650 
up a world like now create new one
nevermind<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:33.209> then<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:33.989> see<00:02:34.260> here

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
nevermind and then as you can see here

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.070 
nevermind and then as you can see here
there's<00:02:36.660> not<00:02:36.810> too<00:02:36.959> much<00:02:37.110> lag<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:39.180> just<00:02:39.420> in

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
there's not too much lag so just in

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.220 
there's not too much lag so just in
creative<00:02:40.440> mode<00:02:40.470> right<00:02:40.739> now<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:43.080> yeah

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
creative mode right now so yeah

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.750 
creative mode right now so yeah
basically<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.860> one's<00:02:44.130> mine<00:02:44.430> craft

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
basically this one's mine craft

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.300 
basically this one's mine craft
flawlessly<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:46.470> believe<00:02:46.920> there's<00:02:47.130> two

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
flawlessly I believe there's two

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.250 
flawlessly I believe there's two
gigabytes<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.910> RAM<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.540> crew<00:02:48.690> bun<00:02:48.870> too<00:02:49.019> so

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
gigabytes of RAM for the crew bun too so

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.460 
gigabytes of RAM for the crew bun too so
I<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.400> default<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.030> set<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.569> like<00:02:51.750> nine

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
I think the default is set to like nine

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.460 
I think the default is set to like nine
hundred<00:02:52.910> megabytes<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.269> RAM<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:55.049> Minecraft

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
hundred megabytes of RAM for Minecraft

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.830 
hundred megabytes of RAM for Minecraft
you<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.519> change<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.150> google<00:02:57.360> bite<00:02:57.690> if

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
you can change this to google bite if

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.830 
you can change this to google bite if
you<00:02:57.959> really<00:02:58.230> want<00:02:58.440> more<00:02:58.650> RAM<00:02:59.069> for<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.840> I've

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
you really want more RAM for it I've

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.020 
you really want more RAM for it I've
also<00:03:01.110> tried<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.590> with<00:03:01.739> mods<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.430> tech<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.880> it

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
also tried this with mods and tech it it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.020 
also tried this with mods and tech it it
works<00:03:03.329> great<00:03:03.630> there's<00:03:04.230> barely<00:03:04.530> any<00:03:04.829> lag<00:03:05.130> but

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
works great there's barely any lag but

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.059 
works great there's barely any lag but
if<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.329> does<00:03:06.510> lag<00:03:06.720> I'd<00:03:06.989> go<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.260> settings<00:03:07.680> click

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
if it does lag I'd go to settings click

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.490 
if it does lag I'd go to settings click
on<00:03:08.250> options<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:09.390> video<00:03:09.870> settings<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.470> then

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
on options in video settings and then

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.780 
on options in video settings and then
change<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.069> graphics<00:03:11.459> too<00:03:11.670> fast<00:03:13.400> but<00:03:14.400> anyways

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
change the graphics too fast but anyways

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.120 
change the graphics too fast but anyways
that's<00:03:15.720> pretty<00:03:15.900> much<00:03:16.019> all<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.739> this

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130
