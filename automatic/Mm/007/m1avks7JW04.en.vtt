00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.099 
how to find the ideal t-mobile SIM card
and<00:00:10.580> trim<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.700> down<00:00:11.760> to<00:00:12.210> use<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.139> iPhone<00:00:13.769> 5

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
and trim it down to use on the iPhone 5

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.439 
and trim it down to use on the iPhone 5
let's<00:00:16.109> take<00:00:16.259> a<00:00:16.289> look<00:00:16.499> at<00:00:16.679> the<00:00:17.069> iPhone<00:00:17.730> 5<00:00:18.029> sim

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
let's take a look at the iPhone 5 sim

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.950 
let's take a look at the iPhone 5 sim
card<00:00:18.810> which<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.079> this<00:00:19.319> one<00:00:19.499> right<00:00:19.529> here

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
card which is this one right here

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.290 
card which is this one right here
that's<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.140> nano<00:00:22.380> SIM<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.979> then<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.179> would

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
that's the nano SIM and then that would

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.599 
that's the nano SIM and then that would
be<00:00:24.329> a<00:00:24.659> micro<00:00:25.529> SIM<00:00:25.829> and<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.159> the<00:00:26.309> regular

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
be a micro SIM and that's the regular

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.450 
be a micro SIM and that's the regular
size<00:00:26.789> SIM<00:00:27.089> card<00:00:27.390> now<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.349> t-mobile<00:00:28.679> SIM<00:00:29.039> cards

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:32.609 
they have a old car in Devon new card

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.779 
they have a old car in Devon new card
this<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.179> actually<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.809> new<00:00:34.109> card<00:00:34.519> but<00:00:35.519> if<00:00:35.699> you

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
this is actually a new card but if you

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.110 
this is actually a new card but if you
look<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> new<00:00:36.329> card<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.920> metal<00:00:38.699> part<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
look at the new card the metal part is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.930 
look at the new card the metal part is
actually<00:00:39.539> longer<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.379> more<00:00:41.280> rectangular

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
actually longer and more rectangular

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
actually longer and more rectangular
they<00:00:42.929> have<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.350> older<00:00:43.620> version<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
they have the older version of the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
they have the older version of the
t-mobile<00:00:44.489> car<00:00:45.120> will<00:00:45.269> be<00:00:45.449> this<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.019> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
t-mobile car will be this one this is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.910 
t-mobile car will be this one this is
actually<00:00:46.589> a<00:00:46.850> it's<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:49.199> full-size<00:00:49.589> car

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
actually a it's a it's a full-size car

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.299 
actually a it's a it's a full-size car
and<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.160> trim<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:50.519> to<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:51.059> micro<00:00:51.960> SIM<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.890> if

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and I trim it down to a micro SIM but if

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.419 
and I trim it down to a micro SIM but if
you<00:00:53.460> flip<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.940> over<00:00:54.440> this<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
you flip this over this actually have a

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.410 
you flip this over this actually have a
more<00:00:57.530> basically<00:00:58.530> an<00:00:58.670> identical<00:00:59.670> size<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
more basically an identical size of the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.490 
more basically an identical size of the
metal<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.929> far<00:01:01.530> as<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:02.039> nano<00:01:03.030> SIM<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.259> don't

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
metal as far as the nano SIM so I don't

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.950 
metal as far as the nano SIM so I don't
think<00:01:04.619> app<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.270> patent<00:01:06.270> upgrade<00:01:06.780> they

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
think app with a patent upgrade they

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.399 
think app with a patent upgrade they
just<00:01:07.170> grab<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.220> SIM<00:01:08.520> card<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.540> blah<00:01:10.290> hey

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
just grab that SIM card and blah hey

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.719 
just grab that SIM card and blah hey
we're<00:01:10.560> gonna<00:01:10.649> trim<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.009> call<00:01:11.399> this<00:01:11.520> nano

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we're gonna trim it down call this nano

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
we're gonna trim it down call this nano
SIM<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.579> with<00:01:14.579> this<00:01:14.729> SIM<00:01:15.030> card<00:01:15.329> all<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
SIM so with this SIM card all you have

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.030 
SIM so with this SIM card all you have
to<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.649> is<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.100> trace<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.030> over<00:01:19.040> put

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to do is really just trace this over put

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.289 
to do is really just trace this over put
the<00:01:20.070> nano<00:01:20.340> SIM<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.790> top<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:23.090> cut<00:01:24.090> out

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the nano SIM on top of it and cut out

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.550 
the nano SIM on top of it and cut out
it's<00:01:24.740> it's<00:01:25.740> shaped<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.930> welcome<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it's it's shaped and welcome to do that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.130 
it's it's shaped and welcome to do that
right<00:01:29.250> now

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
right now

00:01:30.140 --> 00:02:00.510 
right now
I'm<00:01:31.140> gonna<00:01:31.259> put<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.649> down

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.940 

and<00:02:01.520> went<00:02:01.760> back<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.210> they<00:02:02.390> had<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.840> basically<00:02:03.740> I

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
and went back so they had it basically I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.620 
and went back so they had it basically I
just<00:02:04.370> put<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:06.070> put<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.100> nano<00:02:07.550> card<00:02:07.970> over<00:02:08.600> the

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
just put the put the nano card over the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.660 
just put the put the nano card over the
the<00:02:09.410> micro<00:02:09.710> carb<00:02:10.570> then<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.750> hold<00:02:12.050> really<00:02:12.410> tight

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
the micro carb then I hold really tight

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.050 
the micro carb then I hold really tight
and<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.070> use<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> scissor<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.820> just

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and with that I use a scissor and just

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.600 
and with that I use a scissor and just
trim<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.230> sides<00:02:18.460> so<00:02:19.460> now<00:02:19.730> we're<00:02:19.910> gonna<00:02:20.060> have

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
trim the sides so now we're gonna have

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.380 
trim the sides so now we're gonna have
two<00:02:22.610> nano<00:02:22.820> Sims

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
two nano Sims

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.960 
two nano Sims
that's<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.350> t-mobile<00:02:24.740> nano<00:02:25.070> SIM<00:02:25.430> that's<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.880> 8

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
that's a t-mobile nano SIM that's the 8

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.270 
that's a t-mobile nano SIM that's the 8
inch<00:02:26.270> standard<00:02:26.540> nano<00:02:26.840> SIM<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> SIM

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
inch standard nano SIM this is a SIM

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.400 
inch standard nano SIM this is a SIM
card<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.730> goes<00:02:28.910> SIM<00:02:29.600> card<00:02:29.780> tray<00:02:29.960> that<00:02:30.260> goes

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
card that goes SIM card tray that goes

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.220 
card that goes SIM card tray that goes
into<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.800> iPhone<00:02:31.130> 5<00:02:31.450> will<00:02:32.450> move<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.930> there

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
into the iPhone 5 will move this there

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.530 
into the iPhone 5 will move this there
we're<00:02:33.680> gonna<00:02:33.800> pop<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:36.310> top<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.540> pop

this in here my needs some trimming

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.780 
this in here my needs some trimming
because<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.530> did<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.800> pretty<00:02:43.540> bad<00:02:44.540> job<00:02:44.990> here<00:02:48.790> so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
because I did a pretty bad job here so

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
as you can see I do me a little bit of

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:20.290 
as you can see I do me a little bit of
