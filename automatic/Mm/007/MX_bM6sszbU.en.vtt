almost the same thing is I'll have them
when<00:03:25.910> they're<00:03:26.060> when<00:03:26.239> they're<00:03:26.269> stretching<00:03:26.660> for

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
when they're when they're stretching for

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.949 
when they're when they're stretching for
a<00:03:27.019> while<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:28.280> mean<00:03:28.549> as<00:03:28.760> an<00:03:28.940> alternative<00:03:29.480> is

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
a while is I mean as an alternative is

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.570 
a while is I mean as an alternative is
to<00:03:30.019> just<00:03:30.440> go<00:03:30.590> ahead<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.890> bend<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.160> knee<00:03:31.280> for<00:03:31.519> a

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
to just go ahead and bend the knee for a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.160 
to just go ahead and bend the knee for a
while<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:32.090> this<00:03:32.299> just<00:03:32.510> for<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.810> little<00:03:32.959> break

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
while like this just for a little break

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.319 
while like this just for a little break
and<00:03:33.230> then<00:03:33.440> go<00:03:33.530> back<00:03:33.799> into<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:35.090> can<00:03:35.239> do

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
and then go back into this so you can do

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.380 
and then go back into this so you can do
a<00:03:35.360> lot<00:03:35.570> altar<00:03:36.850> oscillation<00:03:37.850> with<00:03:38.000> your<00:03:38.120> body
