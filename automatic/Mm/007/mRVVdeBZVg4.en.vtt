00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and now i'm going to create a little

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.219 
and now i'm going to create a little
loop<00:01:44.010> in<00:01:44.369> between<00:01:44.790> each<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.660> two<00:01:45.869> studs

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and you I'm just doing this as an

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.900 
and you I'm just doing this as an
outline<00:01:49.290> first<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.160> then<00:01:50.430> once<00:01:50.729> it's

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
outline first and then once it's

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.390 
outline first and then once it's
satisfied<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.390> use<00:01:51.690> pliers<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.320> slip<00:01:53.190> off<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
satisfied I use pliers to slip off the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.630 
satisfied I use pliers to slip off the
excess<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:55.259> each<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.830> stud<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.400> are

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
excess and on each of the stud there are

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.540 
excess and on each of the stud there are
four<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.660> metal<00:01:58.170> hooks<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.830> back<00:01:59.220> um
