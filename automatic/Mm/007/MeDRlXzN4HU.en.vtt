that does is it indicates to the stylist
when<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.700> needs<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.149> cleaned<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
when this needs to be cleaned which is

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.470 
when this needs to be cleaned which is
really<00:00:37.260> important<00:00:37.920> how<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.270> is

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
really important how you see that is

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
really important how you see that is

this filter light starts to blink that

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.700 
this filter light starts to blink that
alerts<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.450> clean<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> filter<00:00:43.079> keeps<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.110 
dry working at its optimum best the
microchip<00:00:46.680> also<00:00:47.100> means<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.700> heat<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
microchip also means that the heat is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.569 
microchip also means that the heat is
even<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.840> instant<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.860> controls<00:00:50.370> are<00:00:50.550> very

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
even it's instant the controls are very

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.119 
even it's instant the controls are very
very<00:00:51.059> precise<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.020> what's<00:00:52.260> unique<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> new

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
very precise but what's unique and new

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
very precise but what's unique and new
about<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:54.090> dryer<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.690> first<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.379> it's

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
about this dryer is first of all it's

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
about this dryer is first of all it's
working<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> DC<00:00:56.550> motor<00:00:56.789> which<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.660> very

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
working with a DC motor which is very

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080 
working with a DC motor which is very
lightweight<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:58.980> 30%<00:00:59.789> lighter

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
lightweight this is about 30% lighter

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.510 
lightweight this is about 30% lighter
than<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> average<00:01:01.079> hair<00:01:01.289> dryer<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:02.190> also

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
than the average hair dryer it's also

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.359 
than the average hair dryer it's also
working<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.539> ionic<00:01:04.080> technology<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.040> it's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
working with ionic technology and it's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
working with ionic technology and it's
the<00:01:05.519> first<00:01:05.820> dryer<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.570> offer<00:01:06.780> motion

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the first dryer to offer motion

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.410 
the first dryer to offer motion
technology<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.520> let<00:01:08.700> me<00:01:08.820> share<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.270> how

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
technology so let me share with you how

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.020 
technology so let me share with you how
the<00:01:09.720> neuro<00:01:10.020> motion<00:01:10.439> works<00:01:10.680> first<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.549> all<00:01:11.670> when

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the neuro motion works first of all when

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730 
the neuro motion works first of all when
I<00:01:12.060> pick<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.720> notice<00:01:13.049> how<00:01:13.200> light<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.650> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
I pick it up I notice how light it is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
I pick it up I notice how light it is
that's<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> DC<00:01:15.210> motor<00:01:15.420> that

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that's because of the DC motor that

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
that's because of the DC motor that
we've<00:01:15.869> incorporated<00:01:16.400> even<00:01:17.400> though<00:01:17.490> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
we've incorporated even though it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
we've incorporated even though it's
lightweight<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.360> didn't<00:01:18.689> give<00:01:18.900> anything<00:01:19.470> else

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
lightweight we didn't give anything else

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.760 
lightweight we didn't give anything else
away<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.600> 1875<00:01:21.600> watts<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.080> power<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.619> it's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
away it's 1875 watts of power so it's

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
away it's 1875 watts of power so it's
strong<00:01:23.159> its<00:01:23.430> powerful<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> ties<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.330> head<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
strong its powerful it ties the head of

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020 
strong its powerful it ties the head of
faster<00:01:25.080> than<00:01:25.229> ever<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:26.009> also<00:01:26.220> still<00:01:26.670> working

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
faster than ever it's also still working

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
faster than ever it's also still working
with<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> smart<00:01:27.509> sensor<00:01:27.750> microchip<00:01:28.380> filter

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
with the smart sensor microchip filter

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.969 
with the smart sensor microchip filter
inside<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.880> sends<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.900> light<00:01:31.170> indicator<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
inside which sends a light indicator to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.590 
inside which sends a light indicator to
tell<00:01:32.220> me<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.640> clean<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> filter<00:01:33.299> which

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
tell me when to clean the filter which

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.179 
tell me when to clean the filter which
is<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:34.110> useful<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.619> keeping<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
is really useful and keeping the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.030 
is really useful and keeping the
longevity<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> dryer<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:37.049> powerful<00:01:37.500> its

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
longevity of the dryer it's powerful its

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
longevity of the dryer it's powerful its
ionic<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.909> what's<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> most<00:01:39.450> cool<00:01:39.750> thing

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
ionic but what's the most cool thing

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
ionic but what's the most cool thing
about<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.829> motion<00:01:41.100> zones<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:42.060> have

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
about this is the motion zones we have

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.300 
about this is the motion zones we have
two<00:01:42.479> different<00:01:42.930> motion<00:01:43.320> zones<00:01:43.590> first<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.130> all

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
two different motion zones first of all

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.030 
two different motion zones first of all
we<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> motion<00:01:45.360> zone<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.500> nozzle<00:01:46.860> so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
we have a motion zone on the nozzle so

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.560 
we have a motion zone on the nozzle so
if<00:01:47.130> you're<00:01:47.280> holding<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.090> drive<00:01:48.329> by<00:01:48.509> the
