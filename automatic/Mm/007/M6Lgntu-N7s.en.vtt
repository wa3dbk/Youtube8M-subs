00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:13.309
 hello people today would like to like this 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:16.260
 here to talk about syria tare sharpening 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.359
 a lot on youtube and video people meditate 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.590
 on how to sharpen and reiter 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:27.990
 so I basically thought about it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.640
 This is never as I pressed 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.700
 serreitor sharpening simply 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.760
 no, and then I went into the kitchen and looked 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.980
 I take a knife in my hands and try to cut it off 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 yourself a piece of sausage 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 roughly speaking and what do you think i'm looking 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.140
 on the knife on it let's say it can be done 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.860
 name the series 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.360
 Knife very ordinary in such a 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.899
 everyone and we think is our company 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.899
 tramontina 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.610
 Brazil as well as written 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.410
 it's true I don't know but that's not the point 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.290
 the essence of this knife is not dragged five years here 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.560
 how we bought it most ordinary 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.740
 a cheap kitchen knife with such a file 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.660
 Syria taram small let's say this with one 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.020
 the sides are smooth on the other side 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.820
 sawtooth cutout go and he's already so 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.510
 look 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.180
 you will not be seen that it is already on the same tooth 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.970
 were selected and and in principle he is no longer 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.700
 saws and cuts like an ordinary 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.520
 just a knife I decided to another like 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.160
 would try to sharpen his 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.890
 whet it basically 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.580
 just like I can smell it all the rest 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.869
 your knives 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:59.080
 but I think for the kitchen to get there and I will not 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.100
 pass for here this side tna 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:07.330
 let's see in principle here is a complete sharpening 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:12.930
 I will not show, and I will begin, and then the end 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:20.290
 show how therefore I see no reason 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:24.819
 engage in nonsense here is a regular pebble 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.930
 wet I wet it a little more 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.380
 I put some sprinkler water on it 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.430
 Well, let's see what will sharpen 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.430
 like this 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.010
 so here as an ordinary knife that's your 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.360
 already seen what to start shooting the essence of 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.390
 than I want to remove a little bit to nail file 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.620
 it was seen from the side not sawed and with 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.739
 sides smooth 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:06.200
 so that the file was even well what the people 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.380
 worked and on the pebble first su more 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.470
 rough side took a small layer but 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.610
 in sight it is unlikely to be then worked on 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.329
 shallower constantly painful water here 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.060
 what I want to say to him 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:26.810
 the teeth began to appear much better 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:32.239
 but not from the Syrian side tarot aso 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.980
 here is who else choza started more clearly 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.060
 drawing here was in one place with me 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:44.870
 clamp so visible fell on the blade bone 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:46.880
 Once and this ate for. now in 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.970
 principle, almost evenly 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.819
 sit still and be more cool that 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.880
 I want to say check of course on paper 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.660
 I can not but hope for the sound and for 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:05.450
 hook 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:08.150
 It can be seen that, in principle, it can be catchy 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.139
 clings accordingly medium a little 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.489
 dragged on here what i want to say by 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:19.720
 technical side 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:23.270
 what happened is what you need 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.520
 maintain the correct angle and change it 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.970
 not necessarily the corner that stood 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.340
 here on the knife he was not right not in 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.690
 the sense that he is technically there 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.129
 my understanding is wrong 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.639
 wrong he was in that only 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:43.339
 here is precisely because I started 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.860
 sharpen from the angle that was here and 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:48.589
 serial sharpening of this file began 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.379
 shoot shoot from this side and wear 

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:54.439
 went to zero as usual the knife I became 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.559
 the corner did a little more if here so 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:02.319
 so look here so here was the case 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:06.830
 did a little sharper and the serrator began 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:10.879
 manifest therefore so here of course would 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.860
 I would not risk a good life but 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.610
 principle always need something 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.349
 try to solve this problem like this 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.419
 so well, now I think the knife 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.419
 serve for 5 years and I will not touch him 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.689
 work get hit and in principle 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:39.379
 change hasn't started anymore just 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:43.879
 begins to shine as if I think that 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:47.509
 for kitchens and even more so for this one 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:51.399
 path, in principle, it is not necessary therefore 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:53.979
 so therefore it is necessary to try 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:58.689
 if you can try 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.689
 that's all happy bye
