00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
sucked balls and everyone fucking hate

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.290 
sucked balls and everyone fucking hate
sex<00:02:09.959> transient

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
sex transient

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.110 
sex transient
and<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.920> reason<00:02:13.100> mainly<00:02:13.520> behind<00:02:13.820> that<00:02:13.970> was

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
and the reason mainly behind that was

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.170 
and the reason mainly behind that was
because<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.600> was<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:14.990> like<00:02:15.110> five<00:02:15.380> areas<00:02:15.890> just

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
because it was just like five areas just

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.400 
because it was just like five areas just
separated<00:02:17.180> by<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> mass<00:02:17.630> amount<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.990> fog<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
separated by a mass amount of fog and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.080 
separated by a mass amount of fog and
the<00:02:18.470> fog<00:02:18.650> was<00:02:18.800> absolute<00:02:19.280> stupid<00:02:19.700> if<00:02:19.820> they<00:02:19.910> got

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
the fog was absolute stupid if they got

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.700 
the fog was absolute stupid if they got
rid<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.810> they<00:02:21.020> kind<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.470> had

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
rid of that and they kind of had

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.240 
rid of that and they kind of had
something<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.700> between<00:02:23.320> without<00:02:24.320> denizens

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
something in between without denizens

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.880 
something in between without denizens
all<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.550> kind<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.880> stuff<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.180> would<00:02:26.360> be<00:02:26.540> a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
all that kind of stuff it would be a

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.270 
all that kind of stuff it would be a
better<00:02:27.890> map<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:29.530> guess<00:02:30.530> because<00:02:30.830> if<00:02:31.070> it's<00:02:31.220> a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
better map but I guess because if it's a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.740 
better map but I guess because if it's a
bigger<00:02:31.520> map<00:02:31.820> then<00:02:32.030> they<00:02:32.150> have<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.360> harder<00:02:32.720> time

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
bigger map then they have a harder time

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.250 
bigger map then they have a harder time
making<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.530> closed<00:02:34.250> spaces<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.480> mean<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
making it closed spaces and I mean the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.870 
making it closed spaces and I mean the
closed<00:02:36.470> space<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.950> tight<00:02:37.130> corridors<00:02:37.460> kind<00:02:37.790> of

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
closed space is tight corridors kind of

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.850 
closed space is tight corridors kind of
thing<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.330> what<00:02:38.420> works<00:02:38.990> with<00:02:39.230> zombies<00:02:39.650> because

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
thing is what works with zombies because

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.890 
thing is what works with zombies because
you<00:02:40.100> can<00:02:40.220> turn<00:02:40.340> around<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.760> corner<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.300> then

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
you can turn around the corner and then

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.840 
you can turn around the corner and then
see<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.170> big<00:02:42.470> cluster<00:02:42.890> fuck<00:02:43.250> off<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.580> them<00:02:43.670> just

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
see a big cluster fuck off of them just

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.850 
see a big cluster fuck off of them just
charging<00:02:44.210> at<00:02:44.300> your<00:02:44.420> face<00:02:44.600> whereas<00:02:45.350> in<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.530> big

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
charging at your face whereas in a big

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.320 
charging at your face whereas in a big
wide<00:02:46.070> over<00:02:46.280> mount<00:02:46.580> like<00:02:46.730> all<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.030> dead<00:02:47.180> or

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
wide over mount like all the dead or

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.450 
wide over mount like all the dead or
transit<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.560> see<00:02:48.710> them<00:02:48.860> come<00:02:49.010> from<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.250> mile

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
transit you see them come from a mile

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.630 
transit you see them come from a mile
away<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:49.760> can<00:02:49.940> easily<00:02:50.240> avoid<00:02:50.480> them<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.640> it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
away you can easily avoid them and it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.490 
away you can easily avoid them and it
was<00:02:52.850> just<00:02:53.120> it's<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:53.480> not<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> great<00:02:54.020> idea<00:02:54.440> for

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
was just it's just not a great idea for

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.250 
was just it's just not a great idea for
a<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> big<00:02:55.220> map<00:02:55.490> however<00:02:56.050> mob<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.170> dead

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
a like a big map however mob of the dead

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.860 
a like a big map however mob of the dead
did<00:02:57.680> stretch<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.280> limits<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.750> what<00:02:59.750> was

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
did stretch the limits of what was

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.350 
did stretch the limits of what was
capable<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.380> DLC<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.250> engine<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.940> of

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
capable of a DLC of the engine and of

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.850 
capable of a DLC of the engine and of
maps<00:03:03.080> they<00:03:03.320> could<00:03:03.500> create<00:03:03.740> in<00:03:05.650> zombies<00:03:06.650> for<00:03:06.830> a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
maps they could create in zombies for a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.270 
maps they could create in zombies for a
DLC<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.410> mob<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.500> dead<00:03:09.560> was<00:03:09.830> very<00:03:10.010> good

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
DLC and mob of the dead was very good

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.910 
DLC and mob of the dead was very good
because<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:11.360> was<00:03:11.630> tight<00:03:12.230> corridors<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.800> it

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
because it was tight corridors and it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.270 
because it was tight corridors and it
was<00:03:13.070> yes<00:03:14.000> very<00:03:14.300> big<00:03:14.570> and<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.770> played<00:03:16.010> very

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
was yes very big and so that played very

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.710 
was yes very big and so that played very
well<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:16.700> that's<00:03:16.850> something<00:03:17.030> which<00:03:17.300> they<00:03:17.480> need

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
well so that's something which they need

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.830 
well so that's something which they need
to<00:03:18.020> stick<00:03:18.830> with<00:03:19.070> is<00:03:19.280> something<00:03:19.880> like<00:03:20.239> mobile

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
to stick with is something like mobile

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.140 
to stick with is something like mobile

the dead in terms of map design the next

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.640 
the dead in terms of map design the next
thing<00:03:23.420> which<00:03:23.540> was<00:03:23.660> mentioned<00:03:23.840> were<00:03:24.290> more

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
thing which was mentioned were more

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.040 
thing which was mentioned were more
down-to-earth<00:03:24.980> kind<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:26.090> residential<00:03:26.600> style

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
down-to-earth kind of residential style

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.710 
down-to-earth kind of residential style
maps<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.650> am<00:03:28.060> one<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.270> people<00:03:29.420> which

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
maps and I am one of the people which

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.140 
maps and I am one of the people which
did<00:03:29.930> say<00:03:30.340> something<00:03:31.340> left<00:03:31.640> for<00:03:31.700> dead<00:03:31.910> star

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
did say something left for dead star

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.820 
did say something left for dead star
like<00:03:32.330> schools<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.989> stuff<00:03:33.200> would<00:03:33.440> be<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.620> nice

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
like schools and stuff would be a nice

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.370 
like schools and stuff would be a nice
place<00:03:34.010> for<00:03:34.220> zombies<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.850> have<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.510> map<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:36.020> but

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
place for zombies to have a map in but

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.090 
place for zombies to have a map in but
it<00:03:37.250> seems<00:03:37.550> that<00:03:38.530> transient<00:03:39.530> Diaries<00:03:40.070> and

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
it seems that transient Diaries and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.490 
it seems that transient Diaries and
buried<00:03:40.880> seem<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.239> be<00:03:41.330> quite<00:03:41.480> generic<00:03:41.780> kind<00:03:42.320> of

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
buried seem to be quite generic kind of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.050 
buried seem to be quite generic kind of
places<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:43.280> they<00:03:43.459> weren't<00:03:43.610> really<00:03:43.880> too

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
places and so they weren't really too

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.110 
places and so they weren't really too
interesting<00:03:44.780> buried<00:03:45.500> being<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.160> most

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
interesting buried being the most

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.830 
interesting buried being the most
interesting<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.780> all<00:03:47.900> three<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.170> those<00:03:48.730> but

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
interesting of all three of those but

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.860 
interesting of all three of those but
regular<00:03:50.840> everyday<00:03:51.080> places<00:03:52.120> no<00:03:53.120> in<00:03:53.420> terms<00:03:53.660> of

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
regular everyday places no in terms of

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.360 
regular everyday places no in terms of
you<00:03:54.200> know<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.350> mean<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.709> best<00:03:54.890> maps<00:03:55.100> were

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
you know I mean the best maps were

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.449 
you know I mean the best maps were
things<00:03:55.880> like<00:03:56.000> varrock<00:03:56.360> which<00:03:56.660> was<00:03:57.459> asylum

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
things like varrock which was asylum
