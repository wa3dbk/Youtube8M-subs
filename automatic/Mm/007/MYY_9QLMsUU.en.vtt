00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360 
have liked to have seen and in some of
the<00:02:20.880> DUPLO<00:02:21.510> sets<00:02:21.540> or<00:02:22.050> maybe<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.440> an<00:02:22.590> accessory

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
the DUPLO sets or maybe as an accessory

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.310 
the DUPLO sets or maybe as an accessory
perhaps<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.300> motor<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.660> could<00:02:24.810> even<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
perhaps a motor it could even be the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.260 
perhaps a motor it could even be the
tinder<00:02:25.710> car<00:02:25.950> where<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.610> would<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.970> need<00:02:27.210> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
tinder car where it would just need to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.730 
tinder car where it would just need to
put<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.600> there<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.930> it'd<00:02:28.050> make<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.410> train

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
put it on there and it'd make the train

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.980 
put it on there and it'd make the train
go<00:02:28.770> forward<00:02:29.460> or<00:02:29.580> backwards<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.660> they<00:02:30.750> did<00:02:30.930> not

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
go forward or backwards but they did not

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.100 
go forward or backwards but they did not
have<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.680> there<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.980> see<00:02:32.190> his<00:02:32.400> face<00:02:33.110> but

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
have that and there you see his face but

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.580
