00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:19.619
Spiritu Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:26.129
Spiritu Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.251
Can you see me, are you near me?

00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:34.846
Can you hear me crying out for life?

00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:38.048
Can you tell me, where's the glory?

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:41.721
Ride the days and sail the nights

00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:44.936
When it's over you'll find the answer

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:48.551
Running in the whispering rain

00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:51.940
Anno Mundi? Can you wonder!

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.409
Truth or thunder, life or blame

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.715
Do you see a vision of a perfect place?

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:25.332
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?

00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:32.297
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:38.716
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?

00:01:38.993 --> 00:01:42.141
There are people laughing

00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.495
They're all laughing at you

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:50.648
If only they could see what you're saying is true

00:01:50.648 --> 00:01:58.734
Still generals fighting, making war on the world

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:00.834
Don't they know, don't they know?

00:02:01.372 --> 00:02:09.629
No, no, no

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.496
As the wind in the night blows cold

00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:22.897
Your eyes are burning

00:02:22.897 --> 00:02:29.202
As the sands of our time grow old

00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:36.566
Anno Mundi

00:02:39.683 --> 00:02:45.345
Do you follow the path that so many tread?

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:51.966
Are you among the blind so easily lead?

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:58.651
Do you join in the war, do you fight for the cause?

00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:08.812
Depend on another to fight it alone

00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:15.531
As the wind in the night blows cold

00:03:15.531 --> 00:03:22.871
Your eyes are burning

00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:28.481
As the sands of our time grow old

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.238
Spiritu Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi

00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:03.599
Spiritu Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:15.498
Can you see me now, can you hear me now?

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:21.768
Can you tell me where's the glory?

00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:25.523
Ride the days and sail the nights

00:04:25.523 --> 00:04:28.630
When it's over, you'll find the answer

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.961
Running in the rain

00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:39.615
Truth or thunder, life or blame

00:04:39.615 --> 00:04:46.576
There's a hope that's growing and a vision too

00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:53.148
All those angry hearts now reach out for you

00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:59.740
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:10.385
No longer the fool, the vision is done

00:05:10.385 --> 00:05:16.303
As the wind in the night blows cold

00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:24.114
Your eyes are burning

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:29.916
As the sands of our time grow old

00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:37.357
Your eyes are burning

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:43.259
As the wind in the night blows cold

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:50.630
Your eyes are burning

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.699
As the sands of our time grow old

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:04.382
Your eyes are burning
