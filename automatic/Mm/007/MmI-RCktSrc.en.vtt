00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.020
 you would eat a chicken bathed in energy 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.420
 I guess not among other things because 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.150
 that practice is totally prohibited 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.139
 in the European Union but that prohibition 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:21.210
 and many more have the days 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:24.300
 counted welcome to the reef 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.340
 since 1997 the producers 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.039
 North American chicken have tried 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.199
 introduce their meat in Europe but without 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.860
 success however they have followed 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.329
 insisting to such an extent that in 2008 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.750
 they were close to getting it since 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.519
 almost veto the European Union 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.500
 but once again it was the experts 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.770
 health who refused 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.910
 sharply 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.350
 the reason chlorinated chicken but that 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.420
 veto and many others will disappear 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.710
 comes the free trade agreement between 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.129
 europe and the united states and with it these 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.350
 seven wonders of feeding the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.930
 what will you have to get used to because 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.560
 you will soon have them on your table 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.210
 1 red chicken chicken is very 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.130
 prone to develop bacteria and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.610
 infections with what control 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.000
 phytosanitary should be very strict this 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.850
 means more cleaning more control more 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 staff more investment not doing it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.330
 it would mean a proliferation 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 bacterial that would put at risk the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.729
 health of consumers that's why 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 some North American producers for 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.390
 reduce costs they skip those steps and they 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.310
 simply give a final bath chlorine 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.640
 chicken meat two transgenic 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.910
 potatoes wheat popcorn tomatoes 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.200
 hundreds of transgenic products 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.229
 will enter massively in the markets 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.040
 Spanish since the European law that we 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.110
 protect against it will no longer have force and 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.149
 if you think you're going to have to read the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.819
 labeled one by one to know what 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.420
 foods carry transgenic products 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:17.310
 and which are not clear to you because you do not 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.489
 you can that is point 3 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.560
 point 3 elimination of the indication of 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.040
 transgenic products in the list of 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.140
 ingredients 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.349
 you will no longer know if a food carries 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.719
 genetically modified ingredients 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.310
 transgenic or similar you can not do it 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.439
 since according to the legislation 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.079
 American can not indicate that 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.450
 something is not transgenic because it can 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.209
 cause economic damage to the 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.790
 that transgenics are included in their 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.030
 products with which so that this does not 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.489
 be harmed is prohibited not 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.400
 you will have a way of knowing if what you 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.299
 are you eating this scenic or not 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.069
 4 hormone meat use hormones 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.939
 fast fattening for beef 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:09.890
 bovine and others is totally prohibited 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:12.769
 in Europe since 1981 but in the USA it's 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.109
 legal since the 50s so that 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.390
 get ready to give you a good helping of 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.049
 chuletÃ³n to the hormone but you do not 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.980
 worry you have several flavors to choose 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:29.390
 progesterone estrogen or testosterone 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.720
 5 pork with ractopamine this 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.849
 drug is used in the USA to increase 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.239
 the muscular mass of pig and beef 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:43.130
 to get more meat is prohibited 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:46.430
 in more than 160 countries 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.290
 6 hormone milk 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.079
 you will no longer have to drink meringue milk 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.810
 Now you will enjoy milk hormones 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.810
 gives certain hormones are administered 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.000
 to increase milk production 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.760
 hormones that will end up in your breakfast 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.769
 daily this practice is prohibited 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.200
 currently in the european union and 7 the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.079
 more serious end of security 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.639
 food any limitation or hindrance 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.340
 that a state puts against any 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.590
 multinational will be judged not in 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.009
 courts of law but in 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.960
 international arbitration courts 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.360
 formed by experts with salaries 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.510
 millionaires paid by the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.750
 multinationals 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.480
 this means that if you discover a 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.300
 dangerous or suspicious additive and a country 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.360
 decides to ban what the multinational 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.150
 affected may sue the state for 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.700
 damages and losses claim that 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.550
 will divide into those famous courts of 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.020
 arbitration and not in courts of justice 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.960
 ordinary 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.500
 you can guess in favor of whoever failed 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.070
 and all this is possible thanks to 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:06.540
 free trade agreement between europe and 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:09.030
 US treaty known as tete yp 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.920
 can tti p gesture do not sound like you do not 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.650
 you've never heard of him or 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.450
 even the media do not 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.140
 Do not worry, it's not that you're not up to date 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.910
 is that it's normal because this is 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.440
 agreeing in secret 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.390
 when we all enter the union 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.340
 European ' the media we 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.590
 they talked massively about the treaty of 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.960
 good of the bad of the advantages of the 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.690
 disadvantages even in some countries 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.960
 if I held a referendum but in what 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.610
 refers to the ttp they are hiding it not 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:46.159
 they divulge and they negotiate secretly 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.159
 now we understand why
