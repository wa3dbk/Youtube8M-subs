00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
this for a friend because I figured he

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
I wanted a flipper and I'm happy I got

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.089 
I wanted a flipper and I'm happy I got
the<00:02:57.700> flipper<00:02:57.940> as<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.049> can<00:02:59.200> see<00:02:59.440> from<00:02:59.680> my<00:02:59.889> last

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
the flipper as you can see from my last

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.789 
the flipper as you can see from my last
video<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.670> group<00:03:00.879> with<00:03:01.150> my<00:03:01.540> bad<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:02.049> mean<00:03:02.319> it's

video the group with my bad I mean it's

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.280 
video the group with my bad I mean it's
a<00:03:02.950> little<00:03:03.220> bit<00:03:03.400> shitty<00:03:03.639> but<00:03:03.930> I've<00:03:04.930> only<00:03:05.109> been

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
a little bit shitty but I've only been

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.170 
a little bit shitty but I've only been

riser it's the in my opinion I got
I<00:03:18.310> didn't<00:03:18.970> like<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.209> string<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.629> came<00:03:19.840> with

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
I didn't like the string that came with

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.140 
I didn't like the string that came with
it<00:03:20.139> because<00:03:20.439> it<00:03:20.590> was<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.739> Dacron<00:03:21.220> b-fifty

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
it because it was a Dacron b-fifty

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.240 
it because it was a Dacron b-fifty
string<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.319> didn't<00:03:23.560> like<00:03:23.680> how<00:03:23.829> thick<00:03:24.099> it

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
string and I didn't like how thick it

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.699 
string and I didn't like how thick it
was<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:24.819> what<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.000> did<00:03:25.090> was<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.780> basically

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
was so what I did was I basically

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.879 
was so what I did was I basically
switched<00:03:27.430> out<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:27.940> fast<00:03:28.810> flight<00:03:29.139> one<00:03:29.410> which

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
switched out to a fast flight one which

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.789 
switched out to a fast flight one which
has<00:03:30.099> more<00:03:30.370> strands<00:03:30.849> and<00:03:31.269> some<00:03:32.019> it's<00:03:32.530> thinner

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
has more strands and some it's thinner

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.330 
has more strands and some it's thinner
than<00:03:32.919> the<00:03:33.280> Dacron<00:03:33.699> one<00:03:33.970> has<00:03:34.209> less<00:03:34.480> strands<00:03:35.019> so

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
than the Dacron one has less strands so

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.650 
than the Dacron one has less strands so
that's<00:03:36.340> another<00:03:36.609> reason<00:03:36.819> why<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.090> went<00:03:37.299> with<00:03:37.389> it

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
that's another reason why I went with it

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.420 
that's another reason why I went with it
the<00:03:38.049> weight<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.530> string<00:03:38.829> is<00:03:38.980> even<00:03:39.220> less

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
the weight of the string is even less

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.659 
the weight of the string is even less
than<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.730> Dacron<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:41.069> basically<00:03:42.069> it<00:03:42.310> probably

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
than the Dacron so basically it probably

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.280 
than the Dacron so basically it probably
weighs<00:03:42.790> roughly<00:03:43.120> about<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.510> same<00:03:43.629> as<00:03:43.959> what<00:03:44.139> it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
weighs roughly about the same as what it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.170 
weighs roughly about the same as what it
would<00:03:44.500> if<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.739> had<00:03:44.889> the<00:03:44.980> Dacron<00:03:45.400> Stringfellow

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
would if I had the Dacron Stringfellow

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.780 
would if I had the Dacron Stringfellow
she<00:03:46.720> had<00:03:46.930> things<00:03:47.109> to<00:03:47.260> it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.930 

it's<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.879> recurve<00:03:52.329> style<00:03:52.720> bow<00:03:53.760> instead<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.879> a

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
it's a recurve style bow instead of a

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.250 
it's a recurve style bow instead of a
longbow<00:03:55.359> as<00:03:55.599> you<00:03:55.690> could<00:03:55.840> tell<00:03:56.019> from<00:03:56.049> the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
longbow as you could tell from the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.640 
longbow as you could tell from the
things<00:03:57.010> going<00:03:57.370> up<00:03:57.489> on<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.629> longbow<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.349> string

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
things going up on a longbow the string

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.789 
things going up on a longbow the string
does<00:03:59.799> not<00:03:59.979> touch<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.430> wood<00:04:01.030> at<00:04:01.180> all<00:04:01.329> as<00:04:01.739> with<00:04:02.739> a

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
does not touch the wood at all as with a

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.469 
does not touch the wood at all as with a
recurve<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.519> can<00:04:03.639> see<00:04:03.819> how<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.030> string

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:04.479 
recurve you can see how the string

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.349 
recurve you can see how the string
drapes<00:04:05.079> down<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.500> back<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:06.069> longbow<00:04:07.000> doesn't

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
drapes down the back a longbow doesn't

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.259 
drapes down the back a longbow doesn't
have<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.690> long<00:04:08.049> bow<00:04:08.260> looks<00:04:08.470> more<00:04:08.650> like<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.829> D

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
have that long bow looks more like a D

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.430 
have that long bow looks more like a D
whereas<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.299> recurve<00:04:10.750> as<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:10.989> could<00:04:11.169> tell<00:04:11.319> the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
whereas a recurve as you could tell the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.339 
whereas a recurve as you could tell the
tips<00:04:11.709> come<00:04:12.430> down<00:04:12.669> and<00:04:12.849> up<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.139> don't<00:04:17.199> know

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
tips come down and up I don't know

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.129 
tips come down and up I don't know
what<00:04:17.470> else<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.769> say<00:04:18.239> if<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.479> guys<00:04:19.659> can<00:04:19.930> think

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
what else to say if you guys can think

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.599 
what else to say if you guys can think
of<00:04:20.229> anything<00:04:20.470> let<00:04:21.099> me<00:04:21.130> know<00:04:21.250> alright<00:04:21.940> bye
