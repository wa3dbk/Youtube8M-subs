00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
since I only have one carpeted area left

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.810 
since I only have one carpeted area left

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
and without her tools we would not have

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.080 
and without her tools we would not have
gotten<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.480> clean<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.490> second<00:02:14.490> shout<00:02:14.940> out

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
gotten that clean and second shout out
