however in terms of diet does their diet

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.610 
however in terms of diet does their diet
change<00:00:02.610> as<00:00:03.030> they<00:00:03.179> get<00:00:03.360> older<00:00:03.419> yeah<00:00:04.319> something

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
change as they get older yeah something

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.039 
change as they get older yeah something
think<00:00:05.009> that<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:06.000> should<00:00:06.270> be<00:00:06.420> potentially

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
think that we should be potentially

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.270 
think that we should be potentially
getting<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.470> little<00:00:07.560> bit<00:00:07.770> less<00:00:07.950> protein

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
getting in a little bit less protein

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.940 
getting in a little bit less protein
they<00:00:08.970> get<00:00:09.450> older<00:00:09.750> we<00:00:10.469> are<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> little<00:00:10.800> bit

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
they get older we are a little bit

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.369 
they get older we are a little bit
limited<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.490> Australia<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.450> with<00:00:13.880> access

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
limited in Australia with it with access

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
limited in Australia with it with access
ready<00:00:16.379> access<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.310> lot<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.550> good<00:00:17.910> quality

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
ready access to a lot of good quality

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.929 
ready access to a lot of good quality
fair<00:00:18.840> foods<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.010> know<00:00:20.130> miss<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.580> on

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
fair foods like you know miss you see on

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
fair foods like you know miss you see on
what<00:00:21.630> they<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.930> our<00:00:22.170> belief<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.920> Europe<00:00:23.340> in

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
what they have our belief in Europe in

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.630 
what they have our belief in Europe in
the<00:00:23.519> US<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.619> there<00:00:25.800> are<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.130> life<00:00:26.340> stage

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the US so there are some life stage

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
the US so there are some life stage
diets<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.599> yeah<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.320> tend<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.680> so

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
diets out yeah but we tend to so

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400 
diets out yeah but we tend to so
consider<00:00:29.849> limiting<00:00:30.150> their<00:00:30.570> protein<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> little

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
consider limiting their protein a little

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.319 
consider limiting their protein a little
bit<00:00:31.560> when<00:00:31.679> they<00:00:31.710> get<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:31.980> because<00:00:32.790> ferret<00:00:33.149> food

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
bit when they get it because ferret food

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.270 
bit when they get it because ferret food
is<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.660> Nestle<00:00:34.020> heart<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.500> my<00:00:34.739> protein

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
is you know Nestle heart that my protein

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.010 
is you know Nestle heart that my protein
and<00:00:35.640> perhaps<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:37.020> always<00:00:37.530> appropriate

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
and perhaps it's not always appropriate

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
and perhaps it's not always appropriate
so<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.559> people<00:00:40.980> living<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.489> Australia<00:00:42.000> how

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so for people living in Australia how

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.869 
so for people living in Australia how
would<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> work<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.860> mean<00:00:44.129> protein<00:00:44.730> when

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
would that work is I mean protein when

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.660 
would that work is I mean protein when
you<00:00:44.940> save<00:00:45.149> protein<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:46.079> less<00:00:46.559> meat<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you save protein I think less meat is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.430 
you save protein I think less meat is
that<00:00:48.180> basically<00:00:48.570> we're<00:00:48.750> giving<00:00:49.079> them<00:00:49.170> because

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
that basically we're giving them because

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
that basically we're giving them because
we<00:00:49.559> argue<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.370> focus<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.879> giving<00:00:51.030> our

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
we argue we do focus on giving our

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020 
we argue we do focus on giving our
ferrets<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.780> lot<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.370> commercial<00:00:53.370> kind<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
ferrets a lot of commercial kind of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.740 
ferrets a lot of commercial kind of
foods<00:00:55.160> scoff<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.760> still<00:00:57.059> rely<00:00:57.480> on

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
foods scoff of that but we still rely on

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.340 
foods scoff of that but we still rely on
that<00:00:57.899> heavily<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.670> we<00:01:00.539> often<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:01.230> we

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that heavily and we often because we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
that heavily and we often because we
don't<00:01:01.500> always<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.859> access<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> fair

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
don't always have access to the fair

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
don't always have access to the fair
foods<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.149> off<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.600> recommend<00:01:04.170> use<00:01:04.350> for

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
foods we off we recommend use for

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
foods we off we recommend use for
example<00:01:05.220> feeding<00:01:05.549> very<00:01:06.420> good<00:01:06.659> quality<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
example feeding very good quality and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.580 
example feeding very good quality and
quality<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.680> important<00:01:08.280> very<00:01:08.880> good<00:01:09.060> quality

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
quality is important very good quality

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.500 
quality is important very good quality
kitten<00:01:10.590> driving<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.970> kept<00:01:12.119> keeping

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
kitten driving so we kept keeping

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.749 
kitten driving so we kept keeping
driving<00:01:12.780> yeah<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:15.049> when<00:01:16.049> when<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.159> are<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
driving yeah and when when they are a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.130 
driving yeah and when when they are a
little<00:01:17.939> older<00:01:18.330> sometimes<00:01:18.540> people<00:01:19.049> will

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
little older sometimes people will

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
little older sometimes people will
switch<00:01:19.500> their<00:01:19.770> ferrets<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.430> we'll<00:01:20.549> recommend

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
switch their ferrets and we'll recommend

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.109 
switch their ferrets and we'll recommend
this<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.619> good<00:01:22.860> quality<00:01:23.070> again<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
this to to a very good quality again and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
this to to a very good quality again and
old<00:01:24.360> cat<00:01:24.600> food<00:01:24.840> absolutely<00:01:25.680> less<00:01:25.920> high<00:01:26.189> neck

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
old cat food absolutely less high neck

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.819 
old cat food absolutely less high neck
so<00:01:27.180> less<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.600> protein<00:01:28.049> little<00:01:28.320> bit<00:01:28.409> lower<00:01:28.680> in

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so less in protein little bit lower in

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.090 
so less in protein little bit lower in
fat<00:01:29.130> yeah<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.900> okay<00:01:30.900> yeah<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.950> makes

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
fat yeah all right okay yeah that makes

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.980 
fat yeah all right okay yeah that makes
sense<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.850> certainly<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.689> recommend

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sense but certainly we do recommend

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.399 
sense but certainly we do recommend
feeding<00:01:34.820> mates<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.270> forth<00:01:36.570> yeah<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
feeding mates and so forth yeah and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.469 
feeding mates and so forth yeah and
while<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.250> feed<00:01:38.549> rodents<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.329> their

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
while also to feed rodents to their

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.679 
while also to feed rodents to their
parents<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.290> natural<00:01:40.470> diet<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:42.479> is

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
parents which is a natural diet it is

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
parents which is a natural diet it is
very<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.049> fycking<00:01:43.740> their<00:01:43.890> teeth<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.460> dental

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
very a fycking their teeth and dental

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.200 
very a fycking their teeth and dental
hygiene<00:01:45.829> appropriate<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.040> yeah<00:01:47.520> well<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
hygiene appropriate to yeah well and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
hygiene appropriate to yeah well and
just<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.259> diet<00:01:49.500> part<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.430> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
just on the diet part I know that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.950 
just on the diet part I know that
there's<00:01:51.060> still<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
there's still a little bit of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.620 
there's still a little bit of
controversy<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:53.130> around<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.270> whether

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
controversy going around as to whether

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.460 
controversy going around as to whether
we<00:01:54.810> should<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:55.200> feeding<00:01:55.619> commercial

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
we should be feeding commercial

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.090 
we should be feeding commercial
cables<00:01:57.370> or<00:01:57.700> not<00:01:58.090> um<00:01:58.510> and<00:01:58.900> some<00:01:59.770> people<00:02:00.070> are

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
cables or not um and some people are

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.830
