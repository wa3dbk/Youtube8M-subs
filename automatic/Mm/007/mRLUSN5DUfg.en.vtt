00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the same functionality that we use on

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
the same functionality that we use on
our<00:00:59.370> larger<00:00:59.910> tractors<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.539> included<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.140> as

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
our larger tractors is included here as

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.830 
our larger tractors is included here as
well<00:01:03.049> how<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.470> joystick<00:01:05.299> okay<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
well how about that joystick okay one of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.050 
well how about that joystick okay one of
the<00:01:07.020> biggest<00:01:07.320> questions<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.939> how

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the biggest questions right now is how

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.330 
the biggest questions right now is how
do<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.270> shift<00:01:09.330> between<00:01:09.960> 4<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.409> 5<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.650> 12<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
do you shift between 4 and 5 and 12 and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.090 
do you shift between 4 and 5 and 12 and
13<00:01:11.840> there's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> button<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> back<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
13 there's a button on the back of the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890 
13 there's a button on the back of the
controller<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.909> Dichter<00:01:15.330> back<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
controller it's a Dichter back of the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.530 
controller it's a Dichter back of the
joystick<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> D<00:01:16.830> clutch<00:01:17.360> hold<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
joystick it's a D clutch hold that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.270 
joystick it's a D clutch hold that
button<00:01:18.840> down<00:01:18.990> shift<00:01:19.939> there's<00:01:20.939> four<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> five

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
button down shift there's four to five

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
button down shift there's four to five
there's<00:01:23.280> 12<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.820> 13<00:01:24.259> okay<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.710> gives<00:01:25.950> us

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
there's 12 and 13 okay so that gives us

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.679 
there's 12 and 13 okay so that gives us
that<00:01:26.159> gives<00:01:26.610> us<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> functionality<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> shift

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that gives us the functionality to shift

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.740 
that gives us the functionality to shift
between<00:01:27.810> those<00:01:28.460> those<00:01:29.460> sets<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.850> gears<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.299> we

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
between those those sets of gears if we

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.450 
between those those sets of gears if we
need<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.079> between<00:01:31.470> eighth<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> ninth<00:01:32.189> gear

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
need to go between eighth and ninth gear

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.640 
need to go between eighth and ninth gear
we're<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> use<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> foot<00:01:33.960> clutch<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
we're going to use the foot clutch and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.530 
we're going to use the foot clutch and
then<00:01:35.460> we're<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> actually<00:01:35.880> shift<00:01:36.299> with

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
then we're going to actually shift with

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.960 
then we're going to actually shift with
our<00:01:36.659> lever<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.759> okay

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
our lever here okay

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
our lever here okay
now<00:01:39.869> let's<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:40.860> else<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.220> new<00:01:41.400> on

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
now let's go back up what else is new on

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.719 
now let's go back up what else is new on
this<00:01:41.700> tractor<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.740> post
