00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
envisioned it originally and I guess I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
envisioned it originally and I guess I
couldn't<00:01:23.219> really<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:24.210> younger

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
couldn't really get it out I was younger

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
couldn't really get it out I was younger

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
you do need that third perspective on
your<00:02:09.239> writing<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.989> sometimes<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.470> can't

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
your writing because sometimes you can't

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.510 
your writing because sometimes you can't
see<00:02:10.890> things<00:02:11.130> as<00:02:11.280> other<00:02:11.430> people<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.880> see

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.300 

I<00:02:16.780> can't<00:02:17.780> say<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.020> enough<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.560> sticks<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.130> keep

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
I can't say it enough it sticks to keep

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.580 
I can't say it enough it sticks to keep
writing<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.940> really<00:02:20.300> have<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> maker<00:02:21.200> make<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
writing you really have a maker make a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.980

goal<00:02:21.890> if<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.280> gonna<00:02:22.370> finish<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.970> at<00:02:23.390> this

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
goal if I'm gonna finish this at this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.570 
goal if I'm gonna finish this at this
time<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.470> don't<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.830> make<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.160> job<00:02:25.400> you

you don't really get that as frequently

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.740 
you don't really get that as frequently
as<00:03:37.829> you<00:03:38.010> would<00:03:38.280> get<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.639> a<00:03:38.730> face-to-face<00:03:39.389> in
