that<00:00:41.469> we're<00:00:41.649> taking<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:43.239> second<00:00:43.629> ones<00:00:43.780> the

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
coming out it's quite narrow so make

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.959 
coming out it's quite narrow so make
sure<00:00:49.269> you<00:00:49.660> go<00:00:49.809> really<00:00:50.199> slow<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:50.800> not<00:00:51.670> cutting

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
sure you go really slow and not cutting

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.220 
sure you go really slow and not cutting
the<00:00:52.059> corn<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.480> go<00:00:52.570> on<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:52.899> correct

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
the corn and go on to the correct

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.770 
the corn and go on to the correct
left-hand<00:00:54.039> side<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.429> the<00:00:54.489> road<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:58.390> slow

left-hand side of the road very slow
very<00:00:59.289> narrow<00:00:59.620> and<00:00:59.980> then<00:01:00.940> what<00:01:01.359> you'll<00:01:01.539> need<00:01:01.659> to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
very narrow and then what you'll need to

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.989 
very narrow and then what you'll need to
be<00:01:01.870> doing<00:01:02.140> is<00:01:02.260> driving<00:01:02.469> forward<00:01:03.249> into<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.730> bay

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:03.999 
be doing is driving forward into a bay

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
if you've got the bay part to do you can

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.310
