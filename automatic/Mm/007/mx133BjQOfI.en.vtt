doesn't it so take us over some of those

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.310 
doesn't it so take us over some of those
definitely<00:01:21.770> we<00:01:21.950> sip<00:01:22.570> look<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:23.690> suppose<00:01:23.990> just

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
definitely we sip look I suppose just

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.960 
definitely we sip look I suppose just
just<00:01:24.650> quickly<00:01:24.860> ons<00:01:25.130> if<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.549> bike<00:01:25.760> that's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
just quickly ons if it's a bike that's

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.010 
just quickly ons if it's a bike that's
been<00:01:26.150> around<00:01:26.270> for<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.570> long<00:01:26.720> time

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
been around for a long time

been around for a long time
yeah<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:28.159> it's<00:01:28.729> evolved<00:01:29.360> from<00:01:29.510> a<00:01:29.690> bike<00:01:29.900> that

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
yeah it's it's evolved from a bike that

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.730 
yeah it's it's evolved from a bike that
was<00:01:30.170> designed<00:01:30.620> you<00:01:31.549> know<00:01:31.580> over<00:01:31.970> ten<00:01:32.150> years<00:01:32.450> ago

was designed you know over ten years ago
it<00:01:33.740> has<00:01:35.260> pho<00:01:36.260> through<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.830> design<00:01:37.490> has<00:01:37.520> now

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
it has pho through that design has now

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.850 
it has pho through that design has now
got<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:39.049> know<00:01:39.140> they've<00:01:39.470> got<00:01:39.619> everything

yeah take it down and take it up three

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.760 
yeah take it down and take it up three
different<00:02:34.630> heights<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.260> know<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.620> one

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
different heights so you know it's one

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.430 
different heights so you know it's one
of<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.950> sort<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.280> advantages<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.000> bike

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
of the sort of advantages of the bike

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.010 
of the sort of advantages of the bike
you're<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.590> three<00:02:38.980> two<00:02:39.640> stroke<00:02:39.910> engine<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.600> you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
you're a three two stroke engine so you

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.199 
you're a three two stroke engine so you
know<00:02:41.140> it's<00:02:41.680> still<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> two-stroke<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.060> you've

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
know it's still a two-stroke so you've

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.850 
know it's still a two-stroke so you've
got<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.480> performance<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.080> acceleration

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
got that performance and acceleration

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.140 
got that performance and acceleration
but<00:02:45.310> you've<00:02:45.430> also<00:02:45.610> got<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
but you've also got the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.630 
but you've also got the
environmentally-friendly<00:02:46.930> nough<00:02:47.620> sub<00:02:47.860> are

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
environmentally-friendly nough sub are

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.880 
environmentally-friendly nough sub are
mentaly<00:02:48.940> friendliness<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.690> Euro<00:02:50.530> three

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
mentaly friendliness of the Euro three

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.680 
mentaly friendliness of the Euro three
emissions<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:51.610> now<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.120> think<00:02:52.209> that's<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.540> big

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
emissions so now I think that's a big

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.090 
emissions so now I think that's a big
thing<00:02:52.900> at<00:02:53.080> this<00:02:53.170> end<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.560> market<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:54.010> know

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
thing at this end of the market you know

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.040 
thing at this end of the market you know
people<00:02:54.459> are<00:02:54.550> more<00:02:54.730> conscious<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.810> know

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
people are more conscious of you know

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.570 
people are more conscious of you know
their<00:02:56.200> imprint<00:02:56.620> on<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.860> environment<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.550> that

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
their imprint on the environment so that

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.180 
their imprint on the environment so that
the<00:02:58.180> zip<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:59.020> know<00:02:59.110> covers<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.560> bases<00:02:59.950> there

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
the zip you know covers the bases there

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.480 
the zip you know covers the bases there
so<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.140> basic<00:03:02.500> commuter<00:03:02.890> bike<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.310> lot

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
so it's it's a basic commuter bike a lot

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.830 
so it's it's a basic commuter bike a lot
you<00:03:03.700> can<00:03:03.940> ride<00:03:04.120> on<00:03:04.150> your<00:03:04.360> license<00:03:04.720> in
