well with a AK and you know try to keep
him<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:15.869> sick<00:01:16.140> I'm<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.680> fence

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
him I'm sick I'm just a bit on the fence

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.670 
him I'm sick I'm just a bit on the fence
about<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:18.030> he<00:01:18.509> definitely<00:01:18.720> got<00:01:19.110> an<00:01:19.229> upgrade<00:01:19.350> I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.990 
about and he definitely got an upgrade I
think<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.920> ridiculous<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.640> he<00:01:20.790> plays

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
think it's ridiculous because he plays

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
think it's ridiculous because he plays
so<00:01:21.240> well<00:01:21.270> got<00:01:21.600> loaded<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.869> form<00:01:22.140> stuff<00:01:22.500> but

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
anyway I'm just like not sure because

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
anyway I'm just like not sure because
I'm<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.920> he<00:01:26.040> could<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.030> he

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
I'm like he could go up you know he

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.120 
I'm like he could go up you know he
could<00:01:27.299> easily<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.229> 7k<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:28.890> least

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
could easily go to about 7k at least

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.399 
could easily go to about 7k at least
maybe<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.360> basing<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.810> off<00:01:30.900> last<00:01:31.200> year

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
maybe I'm just basing that off last year

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.590 
maybe I'm just basing that off last year
like<00:01:31.619> how<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.939> his<00:01:33.060> card<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.329> like

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
but at the same time you know could just

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
but at the same time you know could just
stay<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> same<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.610> could<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.000> keeping
