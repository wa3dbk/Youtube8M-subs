00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.780
 i will show you how to cook very much 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.700
 quick royal salad 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.109
 he came up in England where in the spring and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 young potato season begins 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.609
 royal jersey actually from here 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.369
 is the sonorous name of the salad for this 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.470
 need 10 quail eggs 1 cup 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.779
 green peas 700 grams of young 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.380
 potatoes 1 large bunch of fresh leaves 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929
 basilica 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.090
 one small bunch of parsley leaves 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.660
 a handful of pine nuts 60 grams of cheese 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.149
 Parmesan 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 2 cloves garlic 1 cup olive 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.940
 oil floor tablespoon white wine 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 vinegar 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.469
 salt and pepper I took new potatoes 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.629
 I did not set it to cook now 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.600
 I will start preparing the sauce for 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.940
 this need to take two cloves of garlic 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.149
 add some salt and will disassemble 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.860
 garlic with salt when there is already honestly 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.710
 it turns out more or less so homogeneous 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.050
 gruel can add basil leaves 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 the place is a traditional Italian sauce 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.339
 which is cooked green cheese basil 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.600
 Parmesan and pine nuts them you do not 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.430
 hunt messing with a mortar 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.439
 how do i do that then you can quite 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.840
 make this sauce with a blender 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.180
 and you can already begin to add a little 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.939
 pine nuts they need to be ground 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 together with the leaves still we add 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.659
 a little parsley is already a departure from 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.119
 main recipe but actually us 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.579
 you need to cook just delicious sauce 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.000
 for potatoes now I will add a little 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.070
 Parmesan 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 grated and start adding a little 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.180
 olive oil olive oil should 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.479
 be enough to juice 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.760
 turned out so watery well here's the sun 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.950
 I'm ready to see what I have 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.600
 turned out beautiful and fragrant now 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.220
 the most difficult moment of cooking this 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.110
 Lettuce is to clean quail eggs 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.000
 because they are so small and clean 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.560
 quite difficult to take on the palm and 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.950
 just roll on the table so lightly 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.510
 pressing down after that already the whole shell 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.520
 he will crack and it will be easy 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.530
 shoot to quail eggs 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.910
 the yolk remained soft interfere they need 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.800
 put cold water bring to 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.540
 boil and cook literally 30 seconds and 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.370
 after that it is natural to cool in 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.080
 cold water potatoes I fell 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.910
 and now while it's hot and about may on 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.459
 halves and put in a bowl where i have 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.230
 there is a sauce we add here one 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.670
 tablespoons I also spread the peas 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.380
 the peas me was frozen and so i 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.390
 he was lowered into boiling water literally on 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.720
 30 seconds, that is enough 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.140
 believes in this salad do not need to regret and 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.150
 some salt 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.700
 because which we cooked without salt 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.500
 we mix it all up 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.790
 ready now I will lay out on a plate and 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.580
 I will decorate with quail eggs on top 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.170
 who also break the features 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.610
 this salad is that pesto is here 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.470
 served with potatoes 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.330
 they saved as is customary and only 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.970
 empirically you can make sure that it is 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.230
 combination and twins are tastier than traditional 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.230
 and in it all salt
