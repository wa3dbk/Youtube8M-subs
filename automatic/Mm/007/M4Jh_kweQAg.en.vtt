00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello friends and welcome to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.230
 a further reinforcement of this one 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.150
 oldtimer steam engine soy or tractor 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.090
 Be really watch today 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.300
 once more resembles an old one 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:21.750
 locomotive but optically mixture as 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.660
 it would be the child of one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.800
 Locomotive and a tractor looks funny 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.750
 but is more realistic has this flight 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.070
 with the bolt but the thing is on everyone 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 falling from the sound her very nice mush 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.000
 income and today's top speed 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.039
 of incredible 10 km h nice details 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.770
 like the horn this definitely cool 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:58.770
 behind the coal the needs mature and 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.059
 this tool gate on the tractor that then 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 really nice details 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.790
 So it's damn why it's saying it 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.640
 hard to really use it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:18.170
 brings in my opinion on the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.170
 Oldtimer HÃ¶fe west 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.210
 you have read it now but owner 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.740
 understood this first day stood 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.460
 It is very difficult with us through 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.820
 to work efficiently but find help 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.500
 extremely slow and extremely risen for 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.290
 Of course hardcore oldtimer fans 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.740
 actually a revelation though 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.080
 For the rest so always so I like it 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.310
 How does a real money makes the situation 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.460
 clean fun with the ama to drive 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.800
 but that was it for more there 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.780
 needs these oldtimer layers up to 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.950
 a certain limit of the oldtimer that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.580
 historic oldtimer this quasi it is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.380
 yes only older soultana but he 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.780
 does it work the flight 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.060
 it works, it works 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.040
 good tractor is can say elop error 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.510
 this is unfortunately not installed 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.320
 but that's not going to happen yet 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.260
 been electric electricity as 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.730
 not yet given at the time 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.190
 explained will make little sense why 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.209
 is supposed to be so cool has the different 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.060
 camera angles this very cool 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.780
 chosen my opinion still right there 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.250
 fun then but the flight of 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.350
 So does that make capricious optics 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.220
 thus provides a large field with the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.040
 to edit 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.020
 fischer right challenge before the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.980
 ago had so everyone decide for themselves 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.190
 Download the user above 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.020
 try in any case for more must 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.250
 to decide everyone this short thank you 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.640
 for so friends and see you 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.640
 next time
