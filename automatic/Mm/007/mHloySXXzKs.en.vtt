00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.729
 hello guys and girls we are doing a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.750
 new video with cat soul and today you 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:12.509
 I've been teaching how the soup law is 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 ending with all the downloads of 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 pirate games this was the last page 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 that was open for downloads of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.520
 playstation 3 games and you're already 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.330
 ordering we see here you can read 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.960
 quietly what is in little 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.469
 that will delete the page 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.260
 and they are eliminated due downloads 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:43.550
 to a complaint today 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.489
 we can only find on this page 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.239
 forums things that talk about 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.699
 playstation3 about games but nothing more 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.699
 and they will close the page shortly 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.290
 the page will be suspended soon 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.660
 so friends feeling it a lot 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:10.470
 we will be unable to download 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:14.580
 pirate games for playstation3 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.550
 so well let's see here other 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.270
 pages that have also closed as is 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.759
 low ps3 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.670
 and we're going to see that it only appears 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.490
 the facebook here this downloads but 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.430
 if we give it 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.490
 we see that not that it is not this would be the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.240
 page 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.800
 the download page but it does not work 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.940
 and if we give it here 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.760
 we wait 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.750
 and we get this, that is, it is not the 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.220
 download page 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.010
 so we are being 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.740
 removing all the pages in Spain 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.460
 I'm worth in Spain and now I'm going to another 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.549
 page 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.840
 which is cool room that supposedly 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.640
 they will also close it 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.160
 this page 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.840
 Really good 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.460
 in which there are games for a variety 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.890
 of consoles 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.360
 but apparently because he also wants it 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.030
 enclose 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.150
 so well we're running out of 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.150
 options 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.569
 and the only thing that remains is to stay 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.810
 with the games we already had 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.580
 downloaded or just do not hack the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.490
 play because if it's not pirate games 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.490
 obviously it's going to be stupid 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.480
 pirate 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.130
 but there are other options 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.200
 get the games good that already 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.010
 It depends on each one 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.260
 exchanging the gypsy 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.030
 and well this was one of the things that 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.049
 I wanted to tell you to keep them 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.269
 informed I will continue uploading videos 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.909
 of information comments on 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.970
 things like these and nothing guys and girls 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.180
 see you in the next video and up 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.180
 soon
