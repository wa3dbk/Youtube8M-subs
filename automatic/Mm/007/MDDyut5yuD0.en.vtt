00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.090
 hi guys welcome all the same 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.950
 networks are game blast wolf ed 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.960
 here we are at the second episode of non fami 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.430
 scream in the previous episode I had 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 started talking about creation 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.390
 of the multiplayer classes 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.460
 starting with the selection of weapons e 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.440
 of the accessories we will talk about instead 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.510
 why and some useful class for 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.699
 certain types of games such as 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.529
 the stealth or the incursion one but 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.580
 before leaving I wanted to thank 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.220
 all of you who have commented 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.570
 answering my question in fact in the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.010
 course of the video you will see i 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 comments that most are me 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.550
 liked 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.649
 here we are then run to or specialty 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.090
 what to say, black ops 2 respects 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.980
 I wish the teeth chapters of call of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.600
 duty offers us a limited number of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.370
 because it does not allow us anyway 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.899
 to perform at many of the actions you 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.820
 we used to use the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.469
 past the choice therefore falls on 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.180
 classic burke that allow us to 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.070
 run a little longer or move 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.480
 quickly to switch to those of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 survival as high cards or 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
 tactical mask or even those of 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.399
 usefulness as an inflexible jackal and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.399
 environmental perception 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.639
 in the previous video I said of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.959
 use a few accessories if you were 

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:12.359
 willing to have good 

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:14.069
 specialty as for black ops weapons 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.869
 two allows us to increase the slots 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.849
 gods because thanks to the three wild cards 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.920
 greed my advice is always that 

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:21.749
 to resort to wild cards only when 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.090
 you are really sure of yours 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.279
 choice because use accessories or 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.229
 because extra will require precisely 

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:29.579
 the use of the wild card plus the one 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.899
 of the desired object 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.700
 so you will find yourself with two points in 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.700
 less in class creation 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.240
 let's start with some advice for one 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.890
 good outdoor class 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.510
 first of all for Celta I don't mean the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.210
 camper but a kind of game a little more 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.560
 sure focused on the surprise factor 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.960
 in fact I recommend the use of bonuses 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.320
 phantom cold blood and silence of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.360
 tomb 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.220
 in this way you will be protected from radars 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.470
 by players who use skittles 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.450
 like that of locating the target 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.560
 or flight through the walls and at least in 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.110
 also starts from the players they use 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.610
 headphones or that are strong experts 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.070
 you will then have to play the games 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.390
 trying to cover a supporting area 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.410
 your team and aim for 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.970
 survival 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.700
 with this type of class you will be very 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.380
 benefited for the last few highs 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.750
 I remind you that to be invisible was 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.490
 used ghost will be necessary 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.620
 move otherwise these will not have 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.420
 effect for the type tell yourself with 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.740
 over minozzi a nice silencer 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.090
 and maybe naked videos of some 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.320
 accessory like the black cat 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.320
 now grenade sensor 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.900
 instead we pass the class by raid 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.610
 garage 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.020
 here the choices are multiple indeed 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.430
 could develop a class from 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.410
 raid which it presents anyway 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.420
 stealth elements that go well with 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.060
 this type of word game for 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.370
 dark ghost of the silencer also of the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.959
 already mentioned before the silence 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.270
 class race is different from that 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.830
 you are at least according to the fact that the 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.380
 center has all the power of attack 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.390
 in weapons and specialties in fact a 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.310
 I use equipment but I prefer 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.440
 develop a good weapon that works well 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.300
 with up to two accessories e 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.489
 to accompany it is not because it is light 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.010
 phantom engineer and beyond the limit 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.390
 with this type of hybrid class you will have 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.700
 the possibility of adapting yours 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.550
 style of play alternating it in phases of 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.140
 pure rush to those of coverage but 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.640
 you can also have a rush class 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.739
 made to confuse enemies 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.750
 this is a very useful teamwork 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.730
 mode of objectives in this case 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.050
 in fact you will not use stand elements 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.670
 but of survival 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.110
 in this way you will be able to help the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.100
 your team and to block at 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.300
 we beat the enemy 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.019
 of the classes mentioning the 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.420
 equipment 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.370
 these are very useful and this game 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.920
 that finally offers us the possibility 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.760
 of the select them instead make the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.410
 maximum help 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.940
 my opinion about that 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.610
 equipment can be great 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.989
 added although used and can 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.130
 offer various ideas for gameplay 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.130
 fun and varied 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.349
 that we also finish a little advice 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.120
 Bernese points in this game is a lot 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.069
 complicated to get the rewards for 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.379
 this is why I advise you to insert it 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.730
 some medium that offer a discreet 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.049
 support to the team but that there 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.370
 still allow to get a 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.079
 personal advantage 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.150
 I'm talking about wabi against 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.930
 places but also of air attacks and 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.549
 helicopters 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.930
 let's say you send a pinÃ¨ a 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.610
 receive support votes e 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.949
 a great addition which surely 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.320
 will and has made the happiness of the 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.850
 not very strong players i 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.350
 your players is not very strong 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.970
 however, the series should not be addressed 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.680
 scream with which I would like to give gods 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.940
 advice to players a little bit expert 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.160
 that maybe or make a point of 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.139
 reflection and comparison with those more 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.030
 capable in the previous video I had 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.400
 asked your favorite class is the 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.570
 way of playing that preferred you now 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.760
 instead I would like to know your opinion 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.740
 regarding the why which specialties 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.780
 prefer to have match with you while 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.889
 which you consider to be the most useless but 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.599
 I would also like to know yours 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.550
 preferred mode because in the next 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.260
 video I will talk about the modalities 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.160
 giving advice to get 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.380
 better results 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.599
 so guys not even these episodes 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.070
 let me scream ended thanks for 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.599
 having followed this video I recommend 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.250
 subscribe to network and if still 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.570
 you didn't do it and see you at 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.930
 next date don't make me

 hello and see you soon
