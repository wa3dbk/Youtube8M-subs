really<00:01:56.119> nifty<00:01:56.810> things<00:01:57.169> to<00:01:57.380> have<00:01:57.560> if<00:01:57.859> you're

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
really nifty things to have if you're

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:00.580 
really nifty things to have if you're
into<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.459> outdoors<00:01:58.789> lifestyle<00:01:59.329> I<00:01:59.509> use<00:01:59.749> my<00:02:00.409> one

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
into the outdoors lifestyle I use my one

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.929 
into the outdoors lifestyle I use my one
all<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.889> time<00:02:01.099> in<00:02:01.279> the<00:02:01.369> boat<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:01.759> when<00:02:01.849> I'm

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
all the time in the boat and when I'm

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.059 
all the time in the boat and when I'm
camping<00:02:02.209> it's<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.020> lot<00:02:03.229> more<00:02:03.439> efficient<00:02:04.009> than

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
camping it's a lot more efficient than

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.589 
camping it's a lot more efficient than
just<00:02:04.369> an<00:02:04.489> esky<00:02:04.789> with<00:02:04.939> ice<00:02:05.090> in<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.329> you<00:02:05.450> don't

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
just an esky with ice in it you don't

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.300 
just an esky with ice in it you don't
have<00:02:05.719> to<00:02:05.840> worry<00:02:06.020> about<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.439> ice<00:02:06.619> melting<00:02:07.159> and

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
have to worry about the ice melting and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.889 
have to worry about the ice melting and
having<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.880> get<00:02:08.030> new<00:02:08.060> ice<00:02:08.360> all<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.720> have<00:02:08.810> to

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
having to get new ice all you have to

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.030 
having to get new ice all you have to
worry<00:02:09.050> about<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.320> having<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.590> decent<00:02:09.740> power

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
worry about is having a decent power

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.030 
worry about is having a decent power
supply<00:02:10.430> a<00:02:10.930> 12-volt<00:02:11.930> deep-cycle<00:02:12.410> battery<00:02:12.890> like

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
supply a 12-volt deep-cycle battery like

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.540 
supply a 12-volt deep-cycle battery like
this<00:02:13.160> guy<00:02:13.310> here

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
this guy here

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.300 
this guy here
we'll<00:02:13.640> run<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:14.030> unit<00:02:14.390> for<00:02:14.540> about<00:02:14.660> 12<00:02:14.990> hours

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
we'll run this unit for about 12 hours

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.170 
we'll run this unit for about 12 hours
obviously<00:02:16.310> then<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.550> need<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.820> charge<00:02:17.000> a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
obviously then you need to charge a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.970 
obviously then you need to charge a
battery<00:02:17.450> again<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.020> you've<00:02:18.140> got<00:02:18.290> 12<00:02:18.590> hours<00:02:18.680> of

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
battery again but you've got 12 hours of

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.760 
battery again but you've got 12 hours of
you<00:02:19.310> know<00:02:19.400> basically<00:02:20.080> freezer<00:02:21.080> time<00:02:21.380> with

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
you know basically freezer time with

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.090 
you know basically freezer time with
that<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:23.150> maximize<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:24.140> thermal<00:02:24.620> efficiency

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
that to maximize the thermal efficiency

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.530 
that to maximize the thermal efficiency
of<00:02:25.130> these<00:02:25.280> four<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.550> units<00:02:25.850> -<00:02:26.120> really<00:02:26.450> good

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
of these four the units - really good

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.290 
of these four the units - really good
idea<00:02:26.870> -<00:02:27.050> up<00:02:28.010> one<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.460> these<00:02:28.550> accessories<00:02:29.120> which

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
idea - up one of these accessories which

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.140 
idea - up one of these accessories which
is<00:02:29.420> basically<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.960> it's<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.740> little<00:02:31.060> blanket<00:02:32.060> I

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
is basically a it's a little blanket I

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.000 
is basically a it's a little blanket I
guess<00:02:32.330> for<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.810> for<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.140> unit<00:02:33.470> what<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.830> does

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
guess for that for the unit what it does

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.640 
guess for that for the unit what it does
is<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:35.050> maximizes<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.230> thermal<00:02:36.560> efficiency

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
is it maximizes the thermal efficiency

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.490 
is it maximizes the thermal efficiency
by<00:02:37.550> keeping<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.510> cooling<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.350> heat

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
by keeping the the cooling and the heat

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.280 
by keeping the the cooling and the heat
out<00:02:39.680> if<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.190> was<00:02:40.340> traveling<00:02:40.790> up<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.330> north

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
out if I was traveling up in the north

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.510 
out if I was traveling up in the north
of<00:02:42.410> Australia<00:02:42.680> where<00:02:43.010> temperatures<00:02:43.400> are

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
of Australia where temperatures are

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.250 
of Australia where temperatures are
quite<00:02:43.670> extreme<00:02:44.150> one<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.750> these<00:02:44.870> things<00:02:45.110> would

quite extreme one of these things would
