 and 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.069
 Underwater robot with intelligence 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.929
 artificial the european trident project 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.049
 coordinated by the Balearic University 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.720
 jaume first a hit has submerged his 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.700
 wow underwater autonomous vehicle of 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.890
 intervention in the waters of the port 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 Mallorcan Sawyer and this has been 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 able to find and recover in a 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.280
 autonomous an object on a seafloor 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.280
 unknown before the conditions 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.970
 adverse effects of the open sea 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.600
 As reported by the institution 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.300
 academic in a statement 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.220
 unlike other methods based on 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.250
 mostly remote control systems 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.080
 or with a single purpose the project 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.580
 coordinated by pedrojota sanz 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.280
 professor of science of the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.220
 computing and artificial intelligence 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.560
 Universitat Jaume first proposes a 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.450
 new methodology that provides the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.450
 robot a multitasking ability of 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.950
 autonomous dexterity and manipulation for 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.500
 intervention operations in 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.050
 underwater spaces unknown to 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.450
 respect sanz has explained what trident 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.160
 demonstrates the feasibility to attack the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.600
 problem of intervention in the 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.390
 context of search and recovery 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.980
 of any object at an autonomous level 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.760
 regardless of what this is 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.840
 object the robot is based on a system 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.300
 multipurpose that incorporates a 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.610
 two-stage strategy in a first 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.320
 the system is launched into the water and this 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.210
 by sweeping the area of ​​interest 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.100
 where is the objective of the 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.160
 intervention build a visual map 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.590
 of the seabed done this the system 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.600
 the surface emerges and there is only 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.490
 what to tell you before launching the system 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.870
 back to the water what purpose is that of 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.239
 the intervention and what do you want 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.040
 do with them the teacher has pointed 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.800
 who has added that in the second 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.290
 stage the intervention is executed 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.450
 Trident emerges in March 2010 from 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.880
 of the good results that the 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.860
 national project raul and after contacting 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.570
 with Professor Giuseppe Casalino from the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.550
 maximum genoa university 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.250
 representative at European level of 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.320
 underwater robotics in this way the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.240
 project extends at European level with 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.790
 new partners from portugal the 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.980
 United Kingdom and Italy that join the 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.320
 already participants of the national project 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.210
 the university jaume first of castelló 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.299
 the University of Girona and the 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.650
 University of and variables exceed 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.480
 the expectations 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.940
 the new project expands and exceeds 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.910
 Raul's expectations and by integrating 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.740
 and improving the mechatronics of and even then 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.870
 the vehicle has a new arm 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.400
 much more powerful and the new hand 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.280
 right hand much more complex and 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.140
 multipurpose on the other hand 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.600
 much more robust control algorithms 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.430
 and efficient have shown that the out 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.060
 of trident is able to overcome so 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.130
 autonomous 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.350
 the adverse difficulties that you can 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.230
 present the seabed the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.550
 researcher of the uji pedrojota sanz ha 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.830
 explained that in one of the tests 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.820
 made in the port of Soller ante 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.260
 an unexpected problem 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.750
 loss of a degree of freedom in the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.180
 arm thanks to the visual geek float 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.890
 manipulation and making use of others 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.110
 degrees of freedom of the vehicle itself 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.300
 there was no problem in suffering the 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.800
 lack and successfully solve the 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.040
 recovery of the object that we had 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.140
 predicted according to sanz the evolution has gone 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.510
 much faster than we could 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.910
 imagine thanks to the previous existence 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.710
 of the national project whose core was in 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.530
 a similar address in regards 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.700
 Autonomous submarine robotics has in fact 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.590
 pointed out that in the first evaluation 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.140
 Annual review by the reviewers 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.000
 Europeans took place in May 2011 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.090
 at the robotic research center 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.400
 Submarine 6 is introduced girona 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.100
 Mechatronics available by project 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.990
 national raul in a pool I said and 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.970
 out was able to evolve to 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.420
 retrieve a model identical to that of 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.580
 black boxes of commercial aircraft 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.470
 later in October 2011 the 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.570
 project execution was carried out 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.670
 in a real aerial action submerging the 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.320
 robot in the sea of ​​the bay of roses and 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.630
 a validation was achieved 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.000
 experimental of the whole system in the 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.139
 final conditions of a seabed to 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.969
 from these trials 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.340
 the foundations are laid to finish 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.650
 integrate the rest of the mechatronics 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.360
 finally in October 2012 it 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.090
 they carried out the final experiments 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.370
 in the port of sun where the reviewer king 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.900
 of the European Union could verify that 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.499
 the objectives had been reached with 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.279
 that search and recovery the purpose 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.289
 of the project has been based 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:22.389
 originally in exploring ways of 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.370
 progress for the generic problem of 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.620
 search and recovery in the background 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.749
 marine in an autonomous way in particular 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.180
 the recovery of the black boxes of 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:32.590
 the aircraft motivated among other things 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.870
 for the news of the tragedy 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.250
 disappearance in the Atlantic Ocean and 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.250
 of the air france plane that made the 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.289
 route river-paris in June 2009 helped 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.360
 choose this context as a thread 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.099
 of the whole project in regards to 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.139
 the real scenarios of validation of 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:49.419
 but this intervention system 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.520
 autonomous opens up new possibilities and 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.710
 offers potential applications in the 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.870
 field of underwater archeology the 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.979
 zone or marine platforms 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.150
 for the extraction of gas and oil 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.150
 among others
