00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.410
 and 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.680
 it unifies so today it's a 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.180
 special hair 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.529
 so I will tell you about my color 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.660
 hair products I use 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.939
 how did I do to space but 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
 hair wash for at least a day and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.140
 products that I never liked 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.939
 a lot but so I can first 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.050
 it would not be noticed anymore I changed 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.970
 club but hair it may be 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.500
 two weeks that are made wheels so 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 during the summer it is blond now 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.680
 his taste is not the law I wanted 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.300
 initially but that's what it gives 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.160
 and then most people like this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.760
 so you have comments by 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.899
 compared to my hair 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.610
 I would appreciate because I did not 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.270
 really not certain result of more 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.520
 embarrassment comment and if not for 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 what is my hair wash 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.310
 how did I do to space but 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.020
 washing in fact I washed the horses 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.030
 two days and now I can 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.470
 read it three days ago there are some that make 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.690
 until the fourth day and I am 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.720
 not able so how did I do to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.800
 change from two to three days I think 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.829
 that the quality of the products we 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.990
 uses a big difference in the water 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.479
 full wash once a week so 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.920
 I changed my shampoo and now 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.009
 households use bone shampoo and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 matrix biolage and if the sheets therapy 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.799
 no do I do you time alex 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.789
 fashion beauty that he's worn out I got 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.920
 said good but I want to try it 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.270
 yes much more expensive than a shampoo 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.850
 of pharmacy but like it's really worth 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.319
 the trouble the hair is like them the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.499
 first use really a 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.389
 difference so this shampoo the game 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.460
 grants them and in addition it allows me to 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.960
 wash my hair - often so I 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.319
 use less so take a cup 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.789
 empty and so ultimately or so 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.079
 simply because it uses 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.039
 less so then also lyon several 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.869
 Several weeks 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.209
 products thiam of the cense plus one 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.039
 it's for hydration but you're 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.090
 sorry this type of product for choices 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.819
 different 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.249
 these champagne I use is this too 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.109
 that I do that I wash my hair 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.549
 at the three days and the third day I 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.649
 go on the subject of dry shampoo 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.600
 so me if my favorite I found 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.950
 to massage them that of Baptist for 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.270
 he is my angel my elder who was 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.069
 false white hair even surely bought 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.660
 a lot but it's not even 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.050
 comparable to other dry shampoo that 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.360
 I was trying in my life of five years 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.200
 these same not even comparable so 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.820
 I also had that one of May 13th then 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.670
 colleagues but the smell was like 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.110
 a way according to them he very good so this 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.760
 what I do is that I mix of 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.380
 the time I wash on the first day with 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.240
 this second day his beautiful third son 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.950
 day I use are here that makes it so 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.960
 that I wash my hair at the three 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.040
 days instead of 2 days it's really 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.540
 better for the hair and the life the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.240
 less often possible cracked - 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.740
 and piss off to keep color for them 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.910
 warmer hues longer so five 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.840
 years keeper wanted to wash whiter 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.280
 will happen that you invite lisa I 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.330

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.480

 my eye I do not know that it actually makes 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.840
 but as it is a natural product then 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.430

 amazing i love this product there is this 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.209
 what I do is that I switch between 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.760
 feasible then a treatment in this 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.739
 moment I use that of fruyt garnier 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.989
 fructis finally that no matter washing 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.390
 with afp elsa one with that one that that 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.580
 I had I alternate as it is my 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.840
 hair does not get used to singing at 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.400
 shampoo would have made them to what he 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.600
 have to do it like from time to time 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.400
 you were doing another field just points 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.970
 for you that your hair gets used so 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.380
 I was back from there and if not my 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.670
 shampoo there is good the junta is 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.260
 go to the other pharmacies shampoo 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.310
 who stays at home so that 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.170
 could harm important but just 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.700
 why your hair on top 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.800
 or produce the same thing for creams 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.970
 for the face or the soap the face such 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.410
 field once in a while that 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.870
 makes the skin not used to it 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.870
 not stung riga remakes its effectiveness 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.740
 so once I have life my 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.110
 lambert hair good things i released 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.690
 from the shower and I'm going to put words 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.980
 there because I have no why the most 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.200
 honor I really have the hair that gets 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.819
 beats her very easily so forward 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.950
 I used the garnier fructis 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.110
 snow did not remain to me anymore that I decided 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.720
 to try the one from them is acquired and 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.800
 he feels the pile of stories silky but 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.799
 I do not think it's the apple 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.790
 well he's fine but they're not here anymore 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.739
 I think I'll go back to 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.060
 pressure garnier fructis pure that the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.470
 pump is really hard is denied I 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.750
 do not know if it's me who's finger 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.580
 the but it's really difficult so I 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.710
 I am a drama if I do not think I 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.490
 will see buy continuously but he 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.880
 smells good and then I use the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.980
 total protection of 13 May last of 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.410
 noise it's my son playing with my 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.360
 products in which uses their 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.500
 protectors quite a lot of May 13th and then in 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.850
 Actually I find that my hair dries 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.410
 faster when I leave you no access 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.880
 like faster in my routine of 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:56.360
 morning gods so I use it 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:57.950
 it's their coming out of the shower and 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.960
 because it stays a little more damaged I'm going 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.380
 also applied to oil spikes in 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.380
 a larga oil or macadamia oil 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.830
 the gip the one I really want is 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.030
 what is my collection but I have not 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.860
 yet seen the chance of cowardice so in 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.270
 this moment I like little nonsense 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.460
 test tube that I find this warm heart 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.500
 it's really 18 macadamia and argue 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.910
 hanoi I'm sucking a little goal 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.260
 Mendois I loved on the tip of my 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.800
 hair that really does 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:28.000
 in fact, it protects their life to tidy up 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.000
 the points that can be filled 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.390
 I also found this new product from 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.830
 marc anthony is monoi oil and 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.910
 it's a dry hairstyle in what 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.620
 I do it once I'm done 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.970
 my hairdressers fake game like 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.830
 just in addition it's not going to be apart 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.600
 so that this exploit just came from 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.860
 spray or when I find that after 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.160
 the dry shampoo but I can get there 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.450
 less brilliant way I'm going to put a 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.520
 little bit of remich proof profit 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.500
 saffron except that his mind is a little 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.390
 brighter than for the day 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.320
 but like that I did not have all the 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.000
 days twenty six names but I take 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.350
 so much trend of niggas easily 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.120
 who like that is three times I put 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.300
 just one shot until your three days 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.560
 who made their own door and there I had 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.880
 also my brush in the hair for 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.190
 show you what types of brushes that 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.640
 I'm good I used bros like that 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.440
 who are dead apple for figures 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.760
 knows of the perfect because it 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.620
 attracts so much less hair 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.600
 that a traditional brush is more 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.100
 comfortable it defends itself better so that 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.630
 will create a little cc like super and 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.010
 rochette left with the bottle of 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.410

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.740
 the room hairs but that in France sacred 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.790
 damages 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.140
 so that's so if I said that is that 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.700
 I killed seven big letters for them 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.510
 it's fantastic that you're going 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.070
 but it's really less bad then I 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.360
 could not pay me that others 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.110
 kinds of brushes it just makes me 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.700
 roman py g

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.230

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.470

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.360
 so use them the one I buy pile 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.560
 also fit to a trip so when I 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.450
 go on a trip to bring you the 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.530
 best bottle against this lawsuit 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.560

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.820

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.720

 stuff are really two in a row 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.880
 logical but it can help you when 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.650
 even especially to know which products that 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.060
 I liked maybe trying them to your 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.360
 turn and have good products for your 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.700
 hair 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.290
