00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.730
 is natural food is made by 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.250
 components that are part of our 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.590
 diet be vegetables 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.730
 the carbohydrates we eat and the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.500
 porcine bovine proteins poultry 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 fresh in it we prepare in a way 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 special for them and when you compare 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.830
 with a ration 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.619
 Do you have to eat naturally? 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.530
 to make a cost-effective 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.960
 super premium quality in benefits 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.329
 that's how many are you 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.440
 the natural food so compared 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.260
 with reason 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.050
 it is richer in the nutrients that are 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.860
 fresh right it promotes the brother and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.940
 more turning both right palatability 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 with the dog that I do not like 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.160
 I can smell food from the kitchen 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.910
 They really like natural food. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 and there are even snacks that the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.710
 people have also been based on the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.610
 natural nutrition, then we have 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.580
 given some brown rice cracker 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.630
 dried fruit and we always the best 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.509
 animal animal does not get sick does not present 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.460
 no health or 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.850
 food insecurity and has been very 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.310
 satisfactory the process is totally 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 You 're not the same as you are. 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.259
 is is our rice our car 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.720
 our vegetables they are prepared 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.229
 target just a couple of components 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.630
 it's in a microwave not used 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.610
 we use any form that changes the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.610
 molecular structure of dessert 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.200
 the transition is very traditional 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.030
 most owners know the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.840
 people are mixing a type of food 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.380
 with the other 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.530
 the ration a first second second day 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.250
 we will go to the percentage of 50 and 75 per 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.590
 cent decreases with almost 150% 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.610
 than in the middle and increasing so that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.980
 the animal does not change 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.040
 as unpleasant physiological 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.840
 diarrhea vomiting that is usually common 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.370
 even when you change a ration one 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.220
 brand for another 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.459
 the transition was made a year ago with her 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 She is two years old today and a year ago. 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.769
 When danny opened the company I had 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.590
 curiosity mainly because some 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:44.160
 years I was already looking for a 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.170
 more natural for me and when I saw 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.350
 possibility of extending this to her 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.170
 so I thought that made the transition 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.769
 she adapted very quickly 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.019
 I have never been a fan of food and I was not a fan of 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.079
 for articles I had already read 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.760
 about the composition that was based 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.120
 in transgenics then there is a 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.329
 concern and a year ago I made the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.090
 transition to natural food 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.299
 two months ago her baby was born 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.579
 never had contact with food 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.859
 The ration basis was then 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.049
 beginning weaning went straight to 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.060
 natural food including people 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.299
 noted that a problem that is common 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.000
 race she grimi the tear aids 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.040
 she did not develop in him then she 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.709
 It was treated as a puppy with 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.299
 four months and he never had to be 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.040
 medicated with antibiotics, why not 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.440
 came to develop and this certainly 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.220
 is due to more natural and 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.220
 more organic 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.530
 the pan food that comes in many 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.440
 components that can not enter the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.400
 field feeding and especially the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.100
 onion 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.590
 grandson we use onion or a seasoning 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.930
 complete the dog can not ingest onion 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.360
 it is highly toxic to him that is already 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.700
 consecrated has scientific articles that 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.260
 is also well- publicized information in 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.050
 all the corners in all the literatures 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.920
 for the qualities of garlic also has 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.989
 to be carefully dosed floor 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.540
 It's good, it's an immunity and it's a 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.030
 natural vermifuge should not be afraid of 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.910
 use the garlic only the quantities our 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.140
 salt is very industrialized and has 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.420
 a sodium 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.460
 this does not do very well with dogs and 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.680
 people usually restrict restricts 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.020
 in patients with renal insufficiency and 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.760
 heart disease is a natural 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.250
 feeding towards them and 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.880
 balanced I tell all people 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.860
 that I know and some resort yes 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.460
 some seek and some still have a 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.460
 little bit of rejection
