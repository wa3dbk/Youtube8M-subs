corrosion on it nasty connectors so

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.930 
corrosion on it nasty connectors so
we're<00:00:14.219> let's<00:00:14.610> start<00:00:14.880> by<00:00:15.059> cleaning<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.660> up

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
we're let's start by cleaning it up

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.910 
we're let's start by cleaning it up

see<00:00:22.800> how<00:00:23.070> bad<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> corrosion<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> wanna

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
see how bad the corrosion is I wanna

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.130 
see how bad the corrosion is I wanna
give<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.140> PCB<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.920> wash<00:00:26.779> after<00:00:27.779> cleaning<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
give this PCB a wash after cleaning the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.679 
give this PCB a wash after cleaning the
PCB<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> corrosion<00:00:30.269> isn't

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
PCB I can see that the corrosion isn't

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.580 
PCB I can see that the corrosion isn't
actually<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:30.960> bad

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
actually very bad

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.729 
actually very bad
so<00:00:32.099> I've<00:00:32.489> sprayed<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.600> mild<00:00:34.260> acidic

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so I've sprayed it with a mild acidic

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.380 
so I've sprayed it with a mild acidic
solution<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.969> leave<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
solution I'm just going to leave that to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
solution I'm just going to leave that to
soak<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.200> few<00:00:37.350> minutes<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.890> tries

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
soak in for a few minutes and you tries

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.220 
soak in for a few minutes and you tries
any<00:00:38.579> alkaline<00:00:39.180> corrosion<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:39.989> leaked

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.839 
the Dead Pio fit turn pin socket and put
a<00:02:08.160> new<00:02:08.429> PIAA<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:10.140> we'll<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.500> test<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.700> one

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
a new PIAA in and we'll just test it one

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.320 
a new PIAA in and we'll just test it one
second

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.960 

there<00:02:16.330> we<00:02:16.390> go<00:02:17.400> it's<00:02:18.400> really<00:02:18.460> working<00:02:20.970> well

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
there we go it's really working well

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.550 
there we go it's really working well
here's<00:02:22.150> something<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.480> caught<00:02:22.660> me<00:02:22.810> out<00:02:22.960> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
here's something that caught me out I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.620 
here's something that caught me out I
couldn't<00:02:24.040> get<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.280> original<00:02:24.730> game<00:02:25.090> roms<00:02:25.390> to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
couldn't get the original game roms to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.230 
couldn't get the original game roms to
work<00:02:25.870> on<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> board<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.800> verified<00:02:27.790> them<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.090> my

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
work on the board I verified them in my

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.660 
work on the board I verified them in my
EEPROM<00:02:28.510> programmer<00:02:28.980> they<00:02:29.980> were<00:02:30.040> okay<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
EEPROM programmer they were okay and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.670 
EEPROM programmer they were okay and
what<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.540> found<00:02:31.750> was<00:02:31.960> that<00:02:32.020> Williams<00:02:32.560> have

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
what I found was that Williams have

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.170 
what I found was that Williams have
actually<00:02:32.950> put<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.190> wrong<00:02:33.430> labels<00:02:33.460> on<00:02:34.030> them

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
actually put the wrong labels on them

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.120 
actually put the wrong labels on them
from<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.360> factory<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.140> was<00:02:35.560> putting<00:02:35.830> them

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
from the factory so I was putting them

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.520 
from the factory so I was putting them
into<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.430> wrong<00:02:36.580> sockets<00:02:37.090> because<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:38.200> think

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
into the wrong sockets because I think

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.740 
into the wrong sockets because I think
this<00:02:38.800> one<00:02:38.980> for<00:02:39.250> example<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.700> was<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.880> see<00:02:40.090> 20<00:02:40.540> but

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
this one for example it was I see 20 but

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.170 
this one for example it was I see 20 but
it's<00:02:40.870> actually<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.200> see<00:02:41.500> 17<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:42.970> put<00:02:43.150> my

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
it's actually I see 17 so I just put my

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.610 
it's actually I see 17 so I just put my
own<00:02:43.390> labels<00:02:43.690> on<00:02:43.810> there<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.140> make<00:02:44.260> sure<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.470> don't

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
own labels on there to make sure I don't

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.640 
own labels on there to make sure I don't
get<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.980> mix-up<00:02:45.370> again
