 the usmm years she doubts a lot and this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.069
 for this reason all actions 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.309
 carried out until proven otherwise 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.260
 in email abuse that this team she is 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.540
 very fibrils at the level of the axis one has 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.370
 seen on the disk action position the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.470
 years old he was alone it looks like 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 the defenders sense there and are present 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.990
 physically simply there is a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.490
 hard blow for the very hard usma which is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.550
 as we say in this kind of 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.670
 competition and for that purpose situation 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.510
 to equalize and the ball centered the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.540
 goaltender went and the big equalizer 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.930
 not move with the second who was 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 well by a defender ogushi helped me 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.320
 by the goalkeeper has fed up the Belgian goalkeeper 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.539
 from departing for a week 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.640
 on the center his guards who emptied the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.520
 ball of friends to him 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.220
 this assumes so for these tests by 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.350
 woe for him there are positions of 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.350
 strikes and richly garnished the ball 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.930
 and that's auspicious evil of usma that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.350
 returns three minutes after the game in 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.050
 not worth the free kick deflected the goalkeeper 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.300
 which deflects the left - wing bat bat 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.760
 the defenders who we can the the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.470
 clear and well said the ball me I 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.860
 think it's a mistake the caretaker 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.140
 purpose badly because this rice not the output 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.180
 it's good but it says well the ball on 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.740
 the back of the opponent I already think they 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.479
 are here for example it's like that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.789
 they can destabilize what their 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.530
 is invincible donna beldjilali his 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.350
 benefits in one of the belgian he 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:40.390
 she who sings i think io the myth 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:45.100
 the peak of belinelli extraordinary boom 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.490
 is really in the skylight said the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.490
 lilac 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.409
 allows the alger usma to mark the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.409

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.840

 while they have little luck too 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.709

 and yb nice is when you have by 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.460
 tech logically it makes a beautiful 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.220
 part of a beautiful second half 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.640
 kemal because center recessed three 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:34.340
 players at the sporting reception and its 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.900
 following an error of the arfi always 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:42.880
 try to score that fifth goal that 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:47.249

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.439
 is more marked raymond good moment 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.239
 sir they deserve in a doubled 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.669
 to be doubled 

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:56.369
 imerys explained to me what showed us 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.889
 second time whenever he 

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:01.409
 made bathing shoots 30 meters in 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.929
 to try to bring this world 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:08.040
 and then and then and then this mail what we 

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:10.380
 is even seeing it looks like 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.310
 to listen to those Nazis and bad 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.350
 second half time 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.520
 he shows another face simply 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.200
 mims where the package 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.690
 he plays his partners etc 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.950
 present what does this boy say he was 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.610
 very happy and he has a lot of class 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.500
 and when here me aaa to the collective I 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.140
 think it's a boy who can 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.030
 they know and who took away 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.360
 selfishness because they had deterred 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.030
 given the basis in an intelligent way 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.960
 and then really as they say ball to 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.210
 feet gives him to balgau foot and martin 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.250
 and although weighing on this action me 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.550
 slipped theirs with the sonel like everything 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.550
 on time
