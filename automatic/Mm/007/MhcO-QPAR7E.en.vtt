00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.870 
that's the other part of this clinic
that's<00:01:44.120> important<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.950> takes<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.640> real

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
that's important is that it takes a real

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.850 
that's important is that it takes a real
world<00:01:47.150> approach<00:01:47.540> we're<00:01:48.230> certainly<00:01:48.530> going<00:01:48.740> to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
world approach we're certainly going to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.440 
world approach we're certainly going to
talk<00:01:49.010> about<00:01:49.190> what<00:01:49.490> happens<00:01:49.880> at<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.090> college

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
level but we're going to teach people

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.770 
level but we're going to teach people
how<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.520> implement<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.300> into<00:01:53.510> their

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
how to implement it into their

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.810 
how to implement it into their
environments<00:01:54.520> environment<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.610> maybe

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
environments environment that maybe

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.270 
environments environment that maybe
doesn't<00:01:56.060> have<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.690> coaches<00:01:57.350> maybe<00:01:57.890> just<00:01:58.070> has

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
doesn't have a coaches maybe just has

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.100 
doesn't have a coaches maybe just has
one<00:01:58.310> coach<00:01:58.880> an<00:01:59.090> environment<00:01:59.630> that's<00:01:59.690> a<00:01:59.900> very

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
one coach an environment that's a very

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.390 
one coach an environment that's a very
small<00:02:00.410> weight<00:02:00.680> room<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.010> we're<00:02:01.160> going<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.340> make

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
small weight room so we're going to make

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.610 
small weight room so we're going to make
it<00:02:01.580> as<00:02:01.720> practical<00:02:02.720> as<00:02:02.750> possible<00:02:03.260> so<00:02:03.410> these

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
it as practical as possible so these

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.320 
it as practical as possible so these
coaches<00:02:03.950> can<00:02:04.310> take<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.730> back<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:05.060> their<00:02:05.180> high
