00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello my name is marie I 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.200
 work geppetto and bike today 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.630
 I will show you how to adjust 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.240
 speeds of a bike derailleur for 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.900
 that you need 1.9 screwdrivers 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.390
 cruciform is an Allen key before you 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.609
 start the settings put you stumble 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.060
 at least there are two goals and wind 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.669
 and a stop at the back of the bike the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.670
 derailleur we will start with the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.329
 rear derailleur by clicking put the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.770
 speed to the minimum loosen the crews and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.340
 stretch the cable until it is well 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.219
 heard and tighten the groups 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.460
 afterwards you have two screws of 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.670
 setting the one from above it's for 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 block the chain so they go down 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.359
 no further than the sprocket fight and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.939
 the one from below is to block the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.210
 chain so they do not exceed the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.840
 largest pinion with each click of 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.390
 controller 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.600
 the derailleur must show a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.600
 opinion 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.650
 that's if the derails do not go up to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.979
 every time 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.259
 the next pinion means the cable 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.750
 a little bit we rule years with the stop 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.420
 for the ascent and descent of the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.520
 derailleur this not just in greece 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.619
 with a product by turning the chain 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.220
 the sprocket and the chain and say 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.680
 elsewhere for the derailleur before there is 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.259
 three things you need to know the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.270
 derailleur he 'll be going back to the right 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.729
 height 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.450
 he must be positioned in the right direction 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.640
 with the chain and after there are both 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.460
 settings davis there has to be at 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.040
 the space of a 2020 between the derailleur 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.740
 and the big plateau it is necessary that the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.979
 derailleur be well aligned in the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.830
 sense the chain backwards with the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.250
 vice who found themselves in good standing 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.950
 the small the small tray 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.360
 and we adjust the vice until the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.540
 derailleur does not touch the chain with 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.090
 the vice that is farther away from me you 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.280
 sets the derailleur in the big 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.470
 plateau so that they do not exceed and who 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.590
 do not mind however 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.560
 the attention of the cable is on the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.230
 second plateau that is in the middle 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.380
 the derailleur must not touch 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.360
 at the chain hears in the cable with the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 little hill is in front and that's it 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.980
 now you know how to adjust the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.390
 gear on a derailleur on a bike 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.390
 thank you and see you soon
