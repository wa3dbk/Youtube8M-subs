00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi girls in this video I love you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.370
 share these three super ideas 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.250
 practices that I loved to add 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.540
 a different accent to my space and I thought 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.730
 that you could also 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.519
 interest so let's start to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.220
 make this mirror vase what 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:23.070
 we need are four mirrors or five 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.800
 as you want and super glue 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.009
 tough I use this brand and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 also a flower pot plant 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.980
 artificially placed on a surface the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 glue so it can be more 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.740
 manageable and I with a toothpick I'll go 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.020
 adding the glue on the edges 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.810
 the mirrors and this is pretty much everything 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.360
 simply one in the mirrors one with 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.840
 others has formed a painting leaves it dry 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.840
 for a while and that's it, that's all 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.469
 now to make this your neighborhood of 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.289
 carnations what you're going to need is a 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.770
 base for candles a ball that is base 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.140
 for flowers and flowers of your preference 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.969
 super resistant glue again and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.460
 what you have to do is the glue 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.390
 place it at the edge of the base of the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.909
 candle to be able to place the ball 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.770
 delinquents it costs that this ball is 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.899
 I would hit if you have to leave it to a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.020
 good good good weather so I know that 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.569
 then the cut flowers and leave them a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.860
 bit like this to be able to bury 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.860
 inside the ball and that's practically 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 all 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.329
 super easy and true now this 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.700
 glass bottles you're going to need three 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.920
 bottles of different sizes and 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.039
 different ways you may have in 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.380
 house paint either a specific for 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.380
 glass or one for multi surface 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.600
 put the color inside the first container and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.840
 let dry bolt put it down and 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.930
 let it dry then add a little 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.300
 white to this same color for 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.240
 make it a lower tone and put it on the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.440
 next bottle then you do it again 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.630
 the same 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.990
 add a little more white and 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.459
 you come back shake and put it in the third 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.709
 can you make the bottles that 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.350
 you want to tell him adding more white like that 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.100
 to have some containers in colors 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100
 analogous 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.200
 precious and easy these projects 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.000
 I really hope you liked it 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.780
 forget to give like we see you is a 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.780
