00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 or the simple good here I come with a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.160
 new video today is going to be a must 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.720
 I'm going through a review so I hope the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.280
 Do well if you like how I do it or 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.410
 you want them to do the review of a 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.389
 specific thing later on I would 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.690
 you say I'll try to do the base review 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.730
 about this mini skateboard that I bought the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.650
 another day in the changed one if you are 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.820
 interested in learning and skateboarding or 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.590
 loan I would recommend this to you the truth 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.599
 especially if it is for displaced if it is 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.189
 instead of buying a skate it costs 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.840
 quite more money if only for 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.050
 move them and take out some tricks 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 easy the truth that this type are 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.910
 pretty good but I'm going to count the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.590
 characteristics that you have and all that and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.590
 later I will tell you my use 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.280
 good the features are the wheels 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.470
 they are of a hardness of 78 to 59 thousand 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.150
 the bearings are you do not know 5 a 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.340
 difference from the peni that comes with some 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.510
 birds 7 that are a little faster the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.280
 they may have sometimes put 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.930
 seven but good with the five of you 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.540
 wheels pretty well the axles are from 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.860
 three inches wide and the booking that 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.259
 are the rubber bands are 87 to remember 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.150
 mar the table is with a rock of 22 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.700
 inches more or less they are the same 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.860
 dimensions and the table is made of 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.720
 polycarbonate or what is very flexible and 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.640
 very sturdy it seems that the skis of 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.890
 plastics are very loose or they are going to 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.020
 easily break but not the truth are 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.690
 super resistant on the internet on youtube 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.250
 You can find a video that passes 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.289
 a wheel of cima above and it does not happen 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.450
 absolutely nothing this is a video of 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.160
 this skate and also the movie the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.220
 I really recommend it if 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.070
 you are going to start in all this or if you are already 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.320
 skaters and you want to try this on everything 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.420
 to move to move or if you do not 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.220
 he knows some simple tricks I 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.440
 now no tricks are taken 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.060
 well I will try to happen not some and 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 If I really like it, it has many 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.330
 wanting to buy world like that because I wanted to 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.310
 buy a fish market but as I did not have 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.230
 money for a long then this one that has 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.030
 cost 50 euros and that unlike 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.100
 a penny costs you a hundred and so 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.720
 the truth is that it is quite good and as 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.520
 I will start to do is that with a 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.440
 Sanchez ski that is like this but from 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.390
 wood what good thing my father had 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.940
 program is that you my father and that is that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.160
 He has as veintipico years 30 something 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.310
 years since I like this type of skates 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.240
 because to move and that to lower 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.459
 slopes are much more fun not 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.830
 you can rotate a lot more so get a 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.120
 speed and I do not know well I wanted like something 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.740
 where what I had as a child that still 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.630
 I still had that is that I think that 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.240
 restore because it spoiled me so 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.220
 When I have it fixed, I'll have two 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.050
 of these and nothing much the truth that 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.180
 you are thinking of buying them a rock and not 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.430
 you have money or you want to save or 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.110
 you want to buy something cheaper 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.060
 I recommend because the truth that to be 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.620
 of oxide this is quite good and is 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.750
 very accomplished well with the recommend in 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.840
 I hope I have served you and that 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.110
 you encourage to practice this sport what 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.580
 even if it's just for skating and that's very 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.129
 advisable you feel great and 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.540
 hook a lot so not much more 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.599
 you know if you want any video of 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.360

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.340

 tablet training with the friend who 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.720
