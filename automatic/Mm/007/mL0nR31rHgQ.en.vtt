this it's also water-based it has
moisturizing<00:05:09.020> alcohols<00:05:09.470> glycerin<00:05:10.010> is<00:05:10.130> high

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
moisturizing alcohols glycerin is high

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.130 
moisturizing alcohols glycerin is high
up<00:05:10.400> there<00:05:10.550> which<00:05:10.790> is<00:05:10.940> interesting<00:05:11.150> half

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
up there which is interesting half

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.190 
up there which is interesting half
hydrolyzed<00:05:12.770> wheat<00:05:13.070> protein<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:14.690> arginine

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
hydrolyzed wheat protein the arginine

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.790 
hydrolyzed wheat protein the arginine
also<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:17.740> then<00:05:18.740> some<00:05:19.460> other<00:05:20.110> ingredients<00:05:21.110> the

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
also and then some other ingredients the

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.340 
also and then some other ingredients the
same<00:05:22.210> Laurel<00:05:23.210> PG<00:05:23.870> modified<00:05:24.770> method<00:05:25.310> cone<00:05:26.350> so

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
same Laurel PG modified method cone so

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.290 
same Laurel PG modified method cone so
it<00:05:27.530> has<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.740> lot<00:05:28.130> of<00:05:28.160> similar<00:05:28.580> ingredients<00:05:29.180> and

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
it has a lot of similar ingredients and

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.930 
it has a lot of similar ingredients and
so<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.840> texture<00:05:30.169> of<00:05:30.260> this<00:05:30.560> is<00:05:30.770> thicker<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.760> it

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
so the texture of this is thicker and it

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.610 
so the texture of this is thicker and it
does<00:05:32.120> feel<00:05:32.419> a<00:05:32.450> little<00:05:32.660> bit<00:05:32.900> more<00:05:32.990> moisturizing

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
does feel a little bit more moisturizing

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.880 
does feel a little bit more moisturizing
but<00:05:33.919> not<00:05:34.100> overwhelmingly<00:05:34.960> so<00:05:35.960> so<00:05:36.350> I<00:05:36.380> think<00:05:36.560> I

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
but not overwhelmingly so so I think I

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.070 
but not overwhelmingly so so I think I
might<00:05:37.340> I<00:05:37.580> might<00:05:38.030> keep<00:05:38.300> this<00:05:38.450> on<00:05:38.630> hand<00:05:38.660> because

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
might I might keep this on hand because

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.930 
might I might keep this on hand because
I<00:05:39.110> do<00:05:39.230> love<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.710> texture<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.190> it<00:05:40.340> does<00:05:40.550> feel

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
I do love the texture and it does feel

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.000 
I do love the texture and it does feel
more<00:05:41.720> like<00:05:41.870> a<00:05:41.930> treatment<00:05:42.350> because<00:05:42.740> it's<00:05:42.919> a

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
more like a treatment because it's a

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.590 
more like a treatment because it's a
thicker<00:05:43.300> texture<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:45.500> completely<00:05:46.430> use<00:05:47.180> this<00:05:47.390> up

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
thicker texture I completely use this up

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.520 
thicker texture I completely use this up
but<00:05:48.250> it's<00:05:49.250> not<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.970> huge<00:05:50.630> difference<00:05:51.230> between

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
but it's not a huge difference between

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.260 
but it's not a huge difference between
the<00:05:51.830> conditioner<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.280> it's<00:05:52.790> a<00:05:52.940> little<00:05:53.180> bit

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
the conditioner and it's a little bit

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.909 
the conditioner and it's a little bit
pricier<00:05:53.780> and<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.080> ingredients<00:05:54.560> are<00:05:54.740> that

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
pricier and the ingredients are that

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.100 
pricier and the ingredients are that
much<00:05:55.070> greater<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:56.360> smell<00:05:56.570> of<00:05:56.600> this<00:05:56.810> one's<00:05:56.990> a

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
much greater the smell of this one's a

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.409 
much greater the smell of this one's a
little<00:05:57.380> more<00:05:57.560> perfumey<00:05:58.490> than<00:05:58.790> the

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
little more perfumey than the

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:00.940 
little more perfumey than the
conditioner<00:05:59.930> which<00:06:00.050> is<00:06:00.169> another<00:06:00.410> reason<00:06:00.650> I

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
conditioner which is another reason I

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.659

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
don't like it as much but yeah I'd say

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.670 
don't like it as much but yeah I'd say
this<00:06:04.820> is<00:06:04.880> a<00:06:05.030> good<00:06:05.360> treatment<00:06:05.720> and<00:06:06.050> if<00:06:06.140> you<00:06:06.290> this

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
this is a good treatment and if you this

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.120 
this is a good treatment and if you this
is<00:06:06.950> the<00:06:07.250> only<00:06:07.430> thing<00:06:08.090> in<00:06:09.050> this<00:06:09.230> L'Oreal<00:06:09.710> lvv

is the only thing in this L'Oreal lvv

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.559 
is the only thing in this L'Oreal lvv
total<00:06:10.610> repair<00:06:10.850> line<00:06:11.030> that<00:06:11.240> we

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
total repair line that we

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.749 
total repair line that we
-<00:06:11.719> I<00:06:11.749> would<00:06:12.080> definitely<00:06:12.439> try<00:06:12.559> it<00:06:12.649> out<00:06:12.830> the<00:06:13.429> slip

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
- I would definitely try it out the slip

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.059 
- I would definitely try it out the slip
is<00:06:13.999> pretty<00:06:14.599> good<00:06:14.839> but<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.199> tangling<00:06:15.710> power<00:06:15.889> is

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 
is pretty good but the tangling power is

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:17.739 
is pretty good but the tangling power is
not<00:06:16.249> quite<00:06:16.550> as<00:06:16.669> good<00:06:16.789> as<00:06:16.909> other<00:06:17.330> conditioner

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:17.749 
not quite as good as other conditioner

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:20.949 
not quite as good as other conditioner
just<00:06:18.199> because<00:06:18.439> it's<00:06:18.619> thicker<00:06:19.659> but<00:06:20.659> it<00:06:20.809> is

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:20.959 
just because it's thicker but it is

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.260 
just because it's thicker but it is
moisturizing<00:06:21.409> and<00:06:21.919> when<00:06:22.610> combined<00:06:23.119> with

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
moisturizing and when combined with

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.639 
moisturizing and when combined with
honey<00:06:23.629> again<00:06:24.199> I<00:06:24.469> think<00:06:24.529> it's<00:06:25.039> pretty<00:06:25.849> awesome

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:26.649 
honey again I think it's pretty awesome

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:29.469 
honey again I think it's pretty awesome
like<00:06:27.649> it's<00:06:27.889> a<00:06:28.009> great<00:06:28.219> base<00:06:28.429> for<00:06:28.490> making<00:06:28.939> a<00:06:29.240> deep

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
like it's a great base for making a deep

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.899 
like it's a great base for making a deep
treatment<00:06:29.719> by<00:06:30.439> itself<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:31.099> don't<00:06:31.369> think<00:06:31.610> it<00:06:31.729> has

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:31.909 
treatment by itself I don't think it has

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.419 
treatment by itself I don't think it has
the<00:06:32.539> most<00:06:32.779> amazing<00:06:33.199> moisture<00:06:33.860> but<00:06:34.099> it<00:06:34.219> is<00:06:34.399> a

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:34.429 
the most amazing moisture but it is a

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:37.299 
the most amazing moisture but it is a
lot<00:06:34.729> better<00:06:34.879> than<00:06:35.029> just<00:06:35.529> a<00:06:36.529> lot<00:06:36.949> of<00:06:36.979> other

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:37.309 
lot better than just a lot of other

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.480 
lot better than just a lot of other
conditioners<00:06:38.029> anyways

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
conditioners anyways

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.199 
conditioners anyways
so<00:06:40.490> and<00:06:40.789> if<00:06:41.449> you<00:06:42.039> the<00:06:43.039> L'Oreal<00:06:43.459> LV<00:06:43.879> vein<00:06:44.059> line

before I talked about these because I

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:00.639 
before I talked about these because I
use<00:06:58.279> them<00:06:58.490> when<00:06:58.520> I<00:06:58.639> lived<00:06:58.909> in<00:06:59.029> st.<00:06:59.270> but<00:07:00.229> if<00:07:00.469> some

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:00.649 
use them when I lived in st. but if some

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.350

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
of the other masks reach you definitely

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.749 
of the other masks reach you definitely
grab<00:07:03.019> them<00:07:03.319> and<00:07:03.589> read<00:07:03.800> the<00:07:03.919> ingredients<00:07:04.009> see

grab them and read the ingredients see

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.549 
grab them and read the ingredients see
if<00:07:04.879> they<00:07:04.969> would<00:07:05.089> work<00:07:05.240> for<00:07:05.449> your<00:07:05.599> hair<00:07:05.839> because

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:06.559 
if they would work for your hair because

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:10.269

I remember liking those as well so

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.639 
I remember liking those as well so
overall<00:07:11.240> I<00:07:11.689> think<00:07:11.749> I<00:07:12.019> would<00:07:12.169> give<00:07:12.289> this<00:07:12.439> one

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:12.649 
overall I think I would give this one

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:15.670 
overall I think I would give this one
seven<00:07:13.399> out<00:07:13.519> of<00:07:13.550> ten<00:07:13.849> for<00:07:14.569> a<00:07:14.629> reading<00:07:14.929> and<00:07:15.169> the

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
seven out of ten for a reading and the

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.279 
seven out of ten for a reading and the
conditioner<00:07:16.269> eight<00:07:17.269> out<00:07:17.479> of<00:07:17.509> ten<00:07:17.749> but<00:07:18.019> I<00:07:18.050> would

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289 
conditioner eight out of ten but I would

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:20.230 
conditioner eight out of ten but I would
definitely<00:07:18.379> we<00:07:19.159> will<00:07:19.610> probably<00:07:19.849> be

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
definitely we will probably be

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.629 
definitely we will probably be
repurchasing<00:07:20.869> both<00:07:21.619> of<00:07:21.800> these<00:07:21.919> maybe<00:07:22.399> this

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 
repurchasing both of these maybe this

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.409 
repurchasing both of these maybe this
one<00:07:22.789> it<00:07:23.029> depends<00:07:23.449> on<00:07:23.599> if<00:07:24.050> I<00:07:24.469> can<00:07:24.619> find<00:07:25.419> other

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419
