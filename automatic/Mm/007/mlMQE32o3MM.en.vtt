really<00:04:40.190> changed<00:04:40.220> pretty<00:04:41.120> much<00:04:41.330> identical<00:04:43.090> the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
really changed pretty much identical the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.450 
really changed pretty much identical the
3G<00:04:44.480> is<00:04:44.540> gonna<00:04:44.720> cost<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.140> an<00:04:45.230> extra<00:04:45.290> 50<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:46.100> 70

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
3G is gonna cost you an extra 50 to 70

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.890 
3G is gonna cost you an extra 50 to 70
dollars<00:04:46.610> depending<00:04:47.180> on<00:04:47.270> what<00:04:47.420> region<00:04:47.780> you're

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
dollars depending on what region you're

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.620 
dollars depending on what region you're
from<00:04:48.140> so<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:48.760> recommend<00:04:49.760> unless<00:04:49.880> you<00:04:50.090> truly

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
from so I recommend unless you truly

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.990 
from so I recommend unless you truly
need<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:50.930> just<00:04:51.200> stick<00:04:51.890> with<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.100> Wi-Fi<00:04:52.460> it'll

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
need it just stick with the Wi-Fi it'll

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.640 
need it just stick with the Wi-Fi it'll
get<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.210> where<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.390> need<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.570> go

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.600 

so<00:04:57.370> we're<00:04:57.610> in<00:04:58.650> first<00:04:59.650> ever<00:04:59.949> with<00:05:00.130> paperwhite

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
so we're in first ever with paperwhite

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.730 
so we're in first ever with paperwhite
display<00:05:01.030> well<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.510> guess<00:05:01.840> they're<00:05:02.139> second<00:05:02.560> gen

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
display well I guess they're second gen

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.360 
display well I guess they're second gen
of<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:02.979> though<00:05:03.160> so<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:05.800> looks<00:05:05.949> like<00:05:06.010> we<00:05:06.220> need<00:05:06.340> to

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
of it though so it looks like we need to

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.040 
of it though so it looks like we need to
connect<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:06.970> Wi-Fi<00:05:07.150> so<00:05:07.449> what<00:05:07.690> we're<00:05:07.780> gonna<00:05:07.870> do

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
connect to Wi-Fi so what we're gonna do

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.870 
connect to Wi-Fi so what we're gonna do
is<00:05:08.139> connect<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.410> Wi-Fi<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:09.070> then<00:05:09.310> we'll<00:05:09.580> come

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
is connect to Wi-Fi and then we'll come

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.150 
is connect to Wi-Fi and then we'll come
back<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.360> show<00:05:10.419> you<00:05:10.900> guys<00:05:11.260> just<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.949> quick

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
back and show you guys just a quick

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.010 
back and show you guys just a quick
preview<00:05:12.699> of<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.150> book<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.570> then<00:05:13.660> we'll<00:05:13.840> go

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
preview of the book and then we'll go

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.490 
preview of the book and then we'll go
from<00:05:14.050> there

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
from there

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.890 
from there
so<00:05:14.740> here's<00:05:14.919> a<00:05:14.979> book<00:05:15.250> looks<00:05:16.060> pretty<00:05:16.449> much<00:05:16.660> the

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
so here's a book looks pretty much the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.350 
so here's a book looks pretty much the
same<00:05:17.169> from<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.190> reading<00:05:18.370> perspective<00:05:19.060> I<00:05:19.300> think

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
same from a reading perspective I think

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.080 
same from a reading perspective I think
these<00:05:20.020> might<00:05:20.380> come<00:05:20.800> in<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.010> look<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.880> might

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
these might come in the look it might

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.170 
these might come in the look it might
really<00:05:22.270> show<00:05:22.600> it's<00:05:22.810> true<00:05:23.220> higher<00:05:24.220> contrast<00:05:24.880> as

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
really show it's true higher contrast as

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.850 
really show it's true higher contrast as
it<00:05:25.300> says<00:05:25.540> when<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:25.930> get<00:05:26.169> into<00:05:26.320> stuff<00:05:26.740> like

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
it says when you get into stuff like

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.939 
it says when you get into stuff like
PDFs<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.580> have<00:05:27.790> a<00:05:27.820> little<00:05:28.180> bit<00:05:28.330> more<00:05:28.949> you

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
PDFs that have a little bit more you

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.250 
PDFs that have a little bit more you
know<00:05:30.100> a<00:05:30.430> little<00:05:30.820> bit<00:05:30.910> more<00:05:31.210> substance<00:05:31.810> like

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
know a little bit more substance like

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.510 
know a little bit more substance like
pictures<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:32.680> all<00:05:32.979> that<00:05:33.130> kind<00:05:33.340> of<00:05:33.370> thing

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
pictures and all that kind of thing

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.159 
pictures and all that kind of thing
let's<00:05:33.699> just<00:05:33.760> increase<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.360> text<00:05:34.690> full<00:05:34.960> out

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
let's just increase the text full out

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.439 
let's just increase the text full out
here<00:05:35.440> to<00:05:35.740> really<00:05:36.669> see<00:05:36.880> what<00:05:37.090> we're<00:05:37.240> dealing

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
here to really see what we're dealing

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.730 
here to really see what we're dealing
with<00:05:38.280> um<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:39.820> know<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:40.180> suppose<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:41.050> very<00:05:41.530> well

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
with um you know I suppose it very well

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.960 
with um you know I suppose it very well
could<00:05:42.160> be<00:05:43.139> could<00:05:44.139> be<00:05:44.350> higher<00:05:44.650> contrast<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.699> know

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
could be could be higher contrast I know

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.500 
could be could be higher contrast I know
this<00:05:46.180> isn't<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.479> comparison<00:05:47.110> but<00:05:47.320> just<00:05:48.190> for

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
this isn't the comparison but just for

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.900 
this isn't the comparison but just for
the<00:05:49.510> sake<00:05:49.810> of<00:05:49.930> showing<00:05:50.289> you<00:05:50.380> guys<00:05:50.560> here<00:05:51.039> let's

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
the sake of showing you guys here let's

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
the sake of showing you guys here let's
max<00:05:52.210> out<00:05:52.449> the<00:05:52.979> size<00:05:53.979> here<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.780> we're<00:05:55.780> also

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
max out the size here and we're also

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.939 
max out the size here and we're also
gonna<00:05:56.289> try<00:05:56.650> to<00:05:56.710> match<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.340> brightness<00:05:57.940> level

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
gonna try to match the brightness level

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.770 
gonna try to match the brightness level
right<00:05:59.949> about<00:06:00.250> there<00:06:00.580> so<00:06:01.060> you<00:06:01.120> can<00:06:01.270> really<00:06:01.419> see

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
right about there so you can really see

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.690 
right about there so you can really see
oh<00:06:03.240> yeah<00:06:04.240> okay<00:06:04.840> yeah<00:06:05.349> okay<00:06:06.250> putting<00:06:06.639> this

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
oh yeah okay yeah okay putting this

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.580 
oh yeah okay yeah okay putting this
side-by-side<00:06:07.000> you<00:06:07.389> actually<00:06:07.840> can<00:06:08.080> see<00:06:08.349> that

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
side-by-side you actually can see that

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.529 
side-by-side you actually can see that
this<00:06:09.370> is<00:06:09.639> a<00:06:09.669> lot<00:06:09.970> more<00:06:10.180> black<00:06:10.539> than<00:06:11.020> this<00:06:12.539> look

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
this is a lot more black than this look

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.770 
this is a lot more black than this look
at<00:06:13.630> that<00:06:14.010> well<00:06:15.010> I<00:06:15.039> guess<00:06:15.250> they're<00:06:15.430> right<00:06:15.780> well

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
at that well I guess they're right well

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.680 
at that well I guess they're right well
they're<00:06:17.020> Amazon<00:06:17.470> so<00:06:17.800> I<00:06:18.460> can't<00:06:19.030> I<00:06:19.389> can't

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
they're Amazon so I can't I can't

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.900 
they're Amazon so I can't I can't
believe<00:06:19.900> they'd<00:06:20.080> lie<00:06:20.560> when<00:06:20.860> they're<00:06:21.039> selling

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
believe they'd lie when they're selling

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.180 
believe they'd lie when they're selling
you<00:06:22.360> know<00:06:22.450> well<00:06:22.750> I<00:06:22.780> guess<00:06:23.020> you<00:06:23.169> could<00:06:23.770> that<00:06:24.010> way

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
you know well I guess you could that way

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.469 
you know well I guess you could that way
you<00:06:24.250> could<00:06:24.430> sell<00:06:24.639> more<00:06:24.849> but<00:06:25.030> either<00:06:25.180> way<00:06:25.419> you

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
you could sell more but either way you

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.180 
you could sell more but either way you
can<00:06:25.780> see<00:06:25.900> that<00:06:26.050> these<00:06:26.199> are<00:06:26.349> super<00:06:26.680> black<00:06:26.919> and

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
can see that these are super black and

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.129 
can see that these are super black and
these<00:06:27.310> are<00:06:27.490> a<00:06:27.520> little<00:06:27.789> bit<00:06:28.060> grayed<00:06:28.419> out<00:06:28.449> also

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
these are a little bit grayed out also

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.890 
these are a little bit grayed out also
the<00:06:29.620> brightness<00:06:30.220> level<00:06:30.370> here<00:06:31.030> looks<00:06:31.630> a<00:06:31.750> lot

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
the brightness level here looks a lot

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.450 
the brightness level here looks a lot
more<00:06:32.080> crisp<00:06:32.470> and<00:06:32.770> let's<00:06:32.919> see<00:06:33.070> if<00:06:33.099> we're<00:06:33.280> on<00:06:33.310> the

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
more crisp and let's see if we're on the

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.140 
more crisp and let's see if we're on the
same<00:06:33.669> level<00:06:33.729> oh<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:36.400> actually<00:06:36.490> goes<00:06:36.849> up<00:06:37.000> a

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
same level oh that actually goes up a

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.270 
same level oh that actually goes up a
