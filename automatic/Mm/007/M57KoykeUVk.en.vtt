00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.519
 hello everyone I'm 37 and today I bring you 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.009
 a video that gives a lot of interest 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:09.980
 and it is the approximate minimum requirements 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.769
 of call of duty ghosts good 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.900
 I have this photo for the subscribers 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.780
 that they will be sending and sending me 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.260
 the page by inbox of the requirements 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.700
 approximate minimums that posted good 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.380
 here he will analyze them more or less 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.169
 quickly 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.090
 and here in this picture we talk about what call 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.989
 of duty that will be at least a 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.460
 dual-core processor of 1.61 in 1200 or 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.140
 a cron x2 of 3600 more 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.800
 the truth I would say is consistent 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 because if it's a game that to use the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.489
 Next generation engine is supposed to 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.260
 they have to be heavier than the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.590
 predecessor that was white 2 and the thing 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.000
 could work even with a single 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.320
 well we just ram memory 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.079
 the ram seems to me that too 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.690
 fits because the latest games 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.479
 they are dating in 2002 2012 sorry 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.229
 2013 are using a 2 gigs of ram 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:09.729
 minimum minimally here tells us about a 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.460
 giffords and 230 or a radeon hd 4650 a 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.860
 giga obviously if to use an engine 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.750
 next generation is at least a gig and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.780
 the address is consistent by this 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.300
 side what I do not share this image is 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.570
 where it says the space on the hard drive 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.460
 needed here to the 10 gigas when yes 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.520
 let's talk about 10 gigas we would be 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.020
 talking about a game very late for 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.960
 so to say it because from the modern 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.899
 warfare 2 15Gb were used at 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.120
 which means that in space in 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.510
 hard drive that part is inconsistent 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.100
 good in the operating system well 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.740
 minimum windows 7 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.530
 I would say it would work the same in 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.900
 windows 7 8 x I would ask would I dare 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.310
 say but here speaks in Windows 7 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.370
 they must be because the mind that you have 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.610
 information is people that reliable and is 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.630
 a reliable source according to meyer or 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.180
 internet internet connection good 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.130
 internal constant internet connection for 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.649
 the verification obviously if after 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.500
 come out cracks or patches and their 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.970
 apart if they understand me but yes if he 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.320
 want to buy the original game van 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.290
 internal there is an internet connection 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.430
 constant good that's all for now and 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.740
 until the next 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.050
 I will update the information to 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.490
 those who want to subscribe and I like that 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.490
 favorites and until next time
