geared toward military law enforcement

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.809 
geared toward military law enforcement
more<00:03:14.260> than<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.919> average<00:03:15.219> Joe<00:03:15.250> out<00:03:15.609> there

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
more than just the average Joe out there

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.099 
more than just the average Joe out there
but<00:03:16.060> certainly<00:03:16.359> you<00:03:16.480> can<00:03:16.629> pick<00:03:16.810> one<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.019> these

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
but certainly you can pick one of these

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.649 
but certainly you can pick one of these
up<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.979> can<00:03:18.129> see<00:03:18.400> some<00:03:19.329> of<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.479> options

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
up and you can see some of the options

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.249 
up and you can see some of the options
there<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.759> get<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:21.909> black<00:03:22.180> blade<00:03:22.689> option

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:23.259
