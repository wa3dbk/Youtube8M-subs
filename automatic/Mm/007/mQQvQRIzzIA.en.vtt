this<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.870> nice<00:00:13.049> climb<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> gradient

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
this is a nice climb here the gradient

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.120 
this is a nice climb here the gradient
is<00:00:14.309> just<00:00:14.870> not<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.049> steep<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.770> sent<00:00:16.949> into

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
is just not so steep that it's sent into

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.150 
is just not so steep that it's sent into
lactate<00:00:17.640> too<00:00:17.850> early<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:18.420> just<00:00:18.890> just<00:00:19.890> nice

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
lactate too early but just just nice

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.210 
lactate too early but just just nice
really<00:00:20.520> nice<00:00:20.820> road<00:00:21.119> surface<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.750> well<00:00:21.949> and<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
really nice road surface as well and the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
really nice road surface as well and the
Sun<00:00:23.430> shines<00:00:23.730> great<00:00:26.930> we<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.140> finished<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
Sun shines great we just finished in the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.320 
Sun shines great we just finished in the
first<00:00:28.800> section<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> climb<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:30.179> it's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
first section of the climb here it's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.990 
first section of the climb here it's
it's<00:00:31.320> quite<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.560> twisty<00:00:32.040> ascent<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.700> through

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's quite a twisty ascent up through

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360 
it's quite a twisty ascent up through
the<00:00:33.120> trees<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> hot<00:00:35.010> summer's<00:00:35.340> day

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the trees but on a hot summer's day

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.069 
the trees but on a hot summer's day
you'll<00:00:35.730> really<00:00:35.880> appreciate<00:00:36.390> some<00:00:36.420> shade<00:00:36.899> up

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you'll really appreciate some shade up

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.540 
you'll really appreciate some shade up
here<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:43.399> restoral<00:00:44.399> as

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
here so this is the first restoral as

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.160 
here so this is the first restoral as
they<00:00:44.910> call<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.270> Italian<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
they call it in Italian which is the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.060 
they call it in Italian which is the
first<00:00:46.379> food<00:00:46.559> stop

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
first food stop

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.330 
first food stop
so<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> recommend<00:00:47.940> taking<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.660> food<00:00:49.559> energy

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so I recommend taking on food energy

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.090 
so I recommend taking on food energy
drink<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.850> water<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.899> stop<00:00:52.199> because<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
drink and water at this stop because the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.040 
drink and water at this stop because the
more<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.579> early<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> race<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
more you do early on in the race the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
more you do early on in the race the
more<00:00:55.410> you'll<00:00:55.530> benefit<00:00:55.890> later<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.699> don't

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
more you'll benefit later on you don't

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.880 
more you'll benefit later on you don't
want<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.149> starting<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.960> load<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.559> fuel

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
want to be starting to load up with fuel

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.400 
want to be starting to load up with fuel
right<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> end<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> race

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.320 

before<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.370> know<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.640> we're<00:01:04.790> going<00:01:04.970> back<00:01:05.150> up

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
before you know it we're going back up

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.490 
before you know it we're going back up
hill<00:01:05.540> again<00:01:06.460> like<00:01:07.460> UK<00:01:07.820> downhill<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.630> nice

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
hill again like UK downhill a nice

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.820 
hill again like UK downhill a nice
smooth<00:01:10.010> descent<00:01:10.780> but<00:01:11.780> then<00:01:11.990> soon<00:01:12.290> enough<00:01:12.590> back

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
smooth descent but then soon enough back

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.060 
smooth descent but then soon enough back
up<00:01:13.040> hill<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:14.300> my<00:01:14.450> legs<00:01:14.720> are<00:01:15.020> hurting<00:01:15.050> already

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.670 

it's<00:01:19.070> quite<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.880> narrow<00:01:20.420> climb<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.350> start<00:01:21.590> off

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
it's quite a narrow climb to start off

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.710 
it's quite a narrow climb to start off
with<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.980> surface<00:01:22.430> is<00:01:22.550> very<00:01:22.610> rough<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.390> just

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
with the surface is very rough so just

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.870 
with the surface is very rough so just
be<00:01:23.870> aware<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:24.140> that

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
be aware of that

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.790 
be aware of that
don't<00:01:25.880> use<00:01:26.300> your<00:01:26.330> tires<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.470> are<00:01:27.560> probably

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
don't use your tires that are probably

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.930 
don't use your tires that are probably
the<00:01:27.920> sort<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.100> lightest<00:01:28.460> tyres<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.760> you've

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
the sort of lightest tyres that you've

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.300 
the sort of lightest tyres that you've
got<00:01:29.210> because<00:01:29.600> there<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:29.950> gravel<00:01:30.950> section

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
got because there is a gravel section

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.040 
got because there is a gravel section
right<00:01:31.490> at<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.640> top<00:01:31.850> as<00:01:32.030> well<00:01:32.060> about<00:01:32.390> 1

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
right at the top as well about 1

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.600 
right at the top as well about 1
kilometers<00:01:33.560> long<00:01:33.710> it's<00:01:34.190> probably<00:01:34.520> actually

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
kilometers long it's probably actually

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.460 
kilometers long it's probably actually
smoother<00:01:35.120> than<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.479> majority<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.290> climb

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
smoother than the majority of the climb

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.920 
smoother than the majority of the climb
which<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.860> quite<00:01:37.040> ironic<00:01:37.720> we're<00:01:38.720> going<00:01:38.869> to

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
which is quite ironic we're going to

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.810 
which is quite ironic we're going to
swing<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.290> left<00:01:39.500> here<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:39.979> tackle<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.460> final

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
swing a left here and tackle the final

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.910 
swing a left here and tackle the final
climb<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.300> race<00:01:41.600> which<00:01:42.350> here<00:01:42.590> in<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.770> nice

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
climb of the race which here in a nice

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.530 
climb of the race which here in a nice
little<00:01:43.070> gear<00:01:43.430> because<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.820> kicks<00:01:44.030> straight<00:01:44.360> up

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
little gear because it kicks straight up

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.570 
little gear because it kicks straight up
from<00:01:44.780> here<00:01:45.020> it's<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.800> pretty<00:01:45.950> similar<00:01:46.400> gradient

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
from here it's a pretty similar gradient

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.730 
from here it's a pretty similar gradient
to<00:01:46.970> this<00:01:47.119> all<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.479> way<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.840> top<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.110> you

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
to this all the way to the top so you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.890 
to this all the way to the top so you
just<00:01:49.460> got<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.700> settle<00:01:49.910> in<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:50.690> good<00:01:50.869> a

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
just got to settle in to it's good a

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.080 
just got to settle in to it's good a
rhythm<00:01:51.200> as<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.410> can<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:52.520> just<00:01:52.550> keep<00:01:52.910> those

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
rhythm as you can and just keep those

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.170 
rhythm as you can and just keep those
pedals<00:01:53.450> turning<00:01:57.520> well<00:01:58.520> luckily<00:01:58.729> here<00:01:59.060> it's

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
pedals turning well luckily here it's

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.640 
pedals turning well luckily here it's
flattened<00:01:59.660> out<00:01:59.780> about<00:02:00.080> giving<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.500> bit<00:02:00.619> of

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
flattened out about giving you a bit of

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.219 
flattened out about giving you a bit of
a<00:02:00.710> chance<00:02:00.950> for<00:02:01.220> recovery<00:02:01.340> but<00:02:02.050> don't<00:02:03.050> get<00:02:03.170> too

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
a chance for recovery but don't get too

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.180 
a chance for recovery but don't get too
optimistic<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:04.190> still<00:02:04.460> kicks<00:02:05.390> up<00:02:05.570> again<00:02:06.190> well

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
optimistic it still kicks up again well

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.499 
optimistic it still kicks up again well
