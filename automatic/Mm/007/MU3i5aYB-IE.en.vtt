disciples<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.720> Jesus<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> doesn't<00:01:19.710> make

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
disciples of Jesus and it doesn't make

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550

disciples<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.460> Jesus<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
disciples of Jesus that we have to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890 
disciples of Jesus that we have to
re-evaluate<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.670> we're<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> God<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.420> so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
re-evaluate what we're on of God and so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.120 
re-evaluate what we're on of God and so

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 
I began to think what is the most
effective<00:01:26.460> mechanism<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.689> discipleship<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
effective mechanism for discipleship in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.020 
effective mechanism for discipleship in
the<00:01:28.680> world<00:01:28.890> right<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> put

the world right now and I want to put

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030 
the world right now and I want to put
that<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.329> want<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> put<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.840> at<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.110> our

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that I want to put out at this our

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.880

generation into its image and so I began

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.370 
generation into its image and so I began
to<00:01:45.000> think<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.360> little<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.600> deeply<00:01:45.960> about<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to think a little more deeply about that

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
to think a little more deeply about that
I<00:01:46.439> began<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.399> some<00:01:47.610> sense<00:01:47.820> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
I began to see that in some sense this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300 
I began to see that in some sense this
is<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.780> our<00:01:48.810> culture<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.500> doing<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.920> terms<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
is what our culture is doing in terms of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.639 
is what our culture is doing in terms of
us<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> cycling<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.060> people<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:52.079> disciple

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
us the cycling of people it's disciple

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.310 
us the cycling of people it's disciple
people<00:01:52.829> from<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> context<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.670> faith<00:01:54.450> into

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
people from a context of faith into

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.109 
people from a context of faith into
doubt<00:01:55.799> when<00:01:56.070> nobody<00:01:56.460> knows<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> can

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
doubt when nobody knows if you can

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
doubt when nobody knows if you can
believe<00:01:57.270> anything<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:58.079> all<00:01:58.200> how<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.710> know

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
there is truth and certainly certainly

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.200 
there is truth and certainly certainly
not<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.170> trust<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.740> Jesus<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.640> only<00:02:02.670> way

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

not to trust that Jesus is the only way
to<00:02:03.270> God<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.810> live<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.170> culture<00:02:04.380> where

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
to God and so we live in a culture where

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.940 
to God and so we live in a culture where
cynicism<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.390> doubt<00:02:06.719> are<00:02:07.020> all<00:02:07.170> most<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.560> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
cynicism and doubt are all most of that

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.369 
cynicism and doubt are all most of that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
insecurity where people are always

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.820 
insecurity where people are always
trying<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.629> prop<00:02:12.840> themselves<00:02:13.349> up

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830

the country we don't know how to put
roots<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.620> our<00:02:43.740> primary<00:02:44.040> lens<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.550> that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
in some senses all of life is an

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.050 
in some senses all of life is an
opportunity<00:02:52.740> for<00:02:53.010> us<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.190> express<00:02:53.730> what's<00:02:53.940> in

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
opportunity for us to express what's in

our<00:02:54.210> house<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.900> our<00:02:55.020> hearts<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.500> culture

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
our house in our hearts the culture

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160 
our house in our hearts the culture

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
expression and so we go to the cities we

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.060 
expression and so we go to the cities we
go<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> places<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.200> our<00:03:01.290> employment<00:03:01.830> we<00:03:01.920> go

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
go to the places of our employment we go

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.500 
go to the places of our employment we go
to<00:03:02.130> our<00:03:02.220> culture<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.820> we<00:03:02.880> ask<00:03:03.030> one<00:03:03.270> question

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
to our culture and we ask one question

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.990 
to our culture and we ask one question
what<00:03:04.110> can<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> get<00:03:04.410> out<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.800> now<00:03:04.980> what's<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
what can I get out of it now what's the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.940 
what can I get out of it now what's the
softening<00:03:06.390> us<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:07.560> lastly

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
softening us in that and then lastly

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.810 
softening us in that and then lastly
from<00:03:08.490> rest<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.970> exhaustion<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.670> no

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
from rest to exhaustion is that we we no

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.570
