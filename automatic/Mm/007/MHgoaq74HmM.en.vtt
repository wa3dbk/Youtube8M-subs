 In this section, we will answer questions from everyone. 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.930
 But 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.630
 I'm going fast and fast 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.980
 Kagawa Prefecture

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.820
 It is said that 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.820
 This is not true 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.540
 First of all 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.230
 This oneself 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.870

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.480
 with this 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.480
 Tente and say from conclusion 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.730
 You do n't have to have your own car 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.320
 If what 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.880
 By train bus and taxi 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.810
 I wonder if it is a good means of transportation 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.600
 I'm going to 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:11.960
 Because not that what cheaper 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.960

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.270
 Well my own car is more like this 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.840
 Do not the child Te luggage Toka bar N' 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.620
 Though it may be said that you can do it with Yuppa 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.770
 But hey 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.909
 Information limitedly 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.909
 Oh 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.220
 I don't know why you should be a car for yourself 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.420
 Speaking more 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.970
 This next time the king's deadline 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.600
 I will talk a little bit by all means 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:51.770
 This is the beginning of the 20th century Really 1908 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.770
 Well, there is a concept of private cars from the age of many 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:02.909
 Another'm going on the market the amount of outright after the code class in Well at start not is by its America 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.780
 In that at the time that I 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.340
 There is no short at the time of the people 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.360
 A private car 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.510
 I don't know how to do it 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.349
 The point is that the pasha of that time 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.240
 Yayoi concept itself 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:24.270
 Of course people let me do more than that , but what 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.910
 Don't say how it works in play 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.760
 Come back cormorants playing was where there gone ride devil Tteyuu now our next serving sake is different 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.150
 It looks like 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.780
 It is not at the time of Tteyuu related say so 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.560
 I think that it was not originally 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.640
 In a 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.650
 Hence it is that 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.540
 At that time 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.060
 t type Ford 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:59.020
 Let's go What do picnic Nokka' advertising class of Kana key Ford speaking the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.160
 After all the Tteyuu Toka ad that says a positive meeting of something pleasing small family say so, 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:09.220
 I have a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:14.650
 Whether because it say so Then the Tteyuu always go car in that its 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.250
 When things Tteyuu private cars will be considered in the wind say've been stuck at a later time 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.940
 Inherently good 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.450
 Separately 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.450
 car 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.770
 I do not need something I do not need 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.940
 OK next time you said 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:35.430
 I think I gotta separately be eating next to buy the train good from the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:40.310
 I think it would be good to go buy a ne N bus 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.310
 Baan has is calling me people who wish little or 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:48.830
 I think the emperor in the sense that it may not be good 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.700
 So what kind of car is suitable for fishing 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.420
 That is the premise 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.420
 It is a train
