00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
 Situation where wheels are likely to fall 

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.300
 Scene of a car crossing a bridge 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.500
 You can see a sign saying no bike passage 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.820
 Even though, a man is crossing 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.880
 I do not want to notice the sign 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.020
 Is it the cause of traffic accidents? 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.820
 Why did the car stop suddenly? 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.980
 Even though there are restrictions that should not stop on the bridge 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.120
 Funny wheels 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.900
 A person gets out of the car 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 It seems to check the accident 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.440
 Check the lower wheel 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.280
 The reason why the car stopped isn't because of the bike? 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.620
 Why Do Men Make The Wheel Under The Car? 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.180
 Let's take a good look at the wheels under the car 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.340
 It was shaking 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 Let's compare with the front wheel 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080
 There is no problem with the previous wheel 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.560
 The lower wheel was about to fall 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.900
 Not only that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.760
 This man picks up the fallen screw 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.200
 If he did not notice, 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.960
 What happens 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 Wheel that seems to fall 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.580
 I saw a scene where a wheeled wheel car is crossing the bridge 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.420
 You should be surprised when you see the next accident 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.080
 Cars are circulating on the highway 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.080
 There is also a track 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.500
 Now there is an accident on the bus 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.140
 The lower wheel has come off while running at high speed 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.820
 Customers on the bus are in a very dangerous situation 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.740
 I often look at action films 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.600
 It is hard to believe what actually happens on the highway 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.480
 The customers on the bus were safe 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.220
 And the wheels that come off don't bother other vehicles 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.880
 A car whose wheels are likely to fall is running on the bridge 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.400
 The wheel of the bus running on the freeway has come off 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.000
 It was good that there was no traffic accident, but 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.620
 Vehicle regular check is necessary 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.780
 It was amazing. I could not believe it 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.120
 Is this because of people? Is it by accident? 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.240
 scared! 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.320
 This is our fault 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.780
 If you check the vehicle regularly, such an accident will not occur 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.580
 If there are other people in the accident due to the dislodged wheels, it is a coincidence. 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.120
 On the contrary, the off-wheel car driver is sloppy 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.040
 Drive without checking the car 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.440
 For example, Ngoc is driving, 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 What if the front car wheels seem to come off? 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.460
 Be surprised. Stop on the roadside 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.140
 It does not help the previous driver 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.940
 Yeah. Since I stopped. . . 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.820
 Chasing a grab and chasing? 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.180
 That's no good 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
 How about. . . 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.700
 Well, catch up and tell the driver 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.460
 It is dangerous 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.920
 But if you don't do this, many people will be in danger 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.460
 Yeah. 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.940
 Others get involved in the accident because of their wheels 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.260
 Measures are not to chase 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.460
 If you see this 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.260
 It is a measure to check your own car regularly 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.600
 Weekly, monthly 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.020
 I agree. Please be careful when driving
