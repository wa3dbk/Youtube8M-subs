about<00:00:12.540> my<00:00:12.719> trolling<00:00:13.200> motor<00:00:13.500> setup<00:00:14.509> I've<00:00:15.509> got<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
about my trolling motor setup I've got a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.859 
about my trolling motor setup I've got a
force<00:00:16.529> 125<00:00:17.690> 1986<00:00:18.690> outboard<00:00:19.439> engine<00:00:20.869> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
trolling motor I have is mounted on the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.109 
trolling motor I have is mounted on the
cavitation<00:00:24.539> plate<00:00:25.699> as<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.060> see<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:29.119> it

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
cavitation plate as you can see here it

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.400 
cavitation plate as you can see here it
was<00:00:30.240> designed<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.279> mounted<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.790> its<00:00:32.969> own

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
was designed to be mounted on its own

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.650 
was designed to be mounted on its own
plate<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:35.010> would<00:00:35.340> actually<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.480> setup

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
plate that would actually make it setup

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.530 
plate that would actually make it setup
about<00:00:36.960> about<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.739> high<00:00:37.920> about<00:00:38.329> six<00:00:39.329> inches

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
about about this high about six inches

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.209 
about about this high about six inches
higher<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.110> however<00:00:40.770> however

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
higher than it is now however however

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.240 
higher than it is now however however
because<00:00:41.790> my<00:00:41.940> boat<00:00:42.410> only<00:00:43.410> drafts<00:00:43.860> about<00:00:44.040> 8

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
because my boat only drafts about 8

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.470 
because my boat only drafts about 8
inches<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.670> water<00:00:45.500> that<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.129> prop<00:00:47.480> was

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
inches of water that the the prop was

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920 
inches of water that the the prop was
sitting<00:00:48.809> about<00:00:48.899> half<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:50.360> on<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.629> side<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
sitting about half up on the up side of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.760 
sitting about half up on the up side of
the<00:00:51.989> water<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> basically<00:00:52.739> had<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.510> expensive

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
the water so I basically had a expensive

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
the water so I basically had a expensive
bubble<00:00:55.770> maker<00:00:55.920> machine<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> had<00:00:57.750> this

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
bubble maker machine so I had this

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.650 
bubble maker machine so I had this
bracket<00:00:58.289> made<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:59.640> now<00:00:59.820> mounted<00:01:00.210> underneath

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
bracket made it's now mounted underneath

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.740 
bracket made it's now mounted underneath
the<00:01:00.840> cavitation<00:01:01.260> plate<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.800> most<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
the cavitation plate or most of it is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.399 
the cavitation plate or most of it is
and<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.619> works<00:01:04.830> great<00:01:05.810> when<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> go

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and it works great when I want to go

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.240 
and it works great when I want to go
fast<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:09.240> problem<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.170> since<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.189> was

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
fast the problem was that since this was

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.149 
fast the problem was that since this was
in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.510> water<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.020> time<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:14.040> was

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
in the water all the time it was

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.340 
in the water all the time it was
breaking<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> props<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.570> after<00:01:15.900> breaking<00:01:16.229> one

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
breaking the props so after breaking one

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.170 
breaking the props so after breaking one
prop<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.830> said<00:01:17.130> got<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.850> something

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
prop I said got to do something

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.980 
prop I said got to do something
different<00:01:18.619> so<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.210> talked<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.360> welder<00:01:21.689> buddy<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
different so I talked to welder buddy of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.030 
different so I talked to welder buddy of
mine<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.920> he<00:01:23.040> came<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.820> design

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
mine and he came up with this design

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
mine and he came up with this design
which<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:27.290> 1986<00:01:28.290> Nissan<00:01:30.049> emergency<00:01:31.049> brake

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
which is a 1986 Nissan emergency brake

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.940 
which is a 1986 Nissan emergency brake
system<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> let<00:01:34.320> me<00:01:34.380> show<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.829> works

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
system so let me show you how it works

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.310 
system so let me show you how it works
go<00:01:35.759> ahead<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.000> pull<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:38.640> pull<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.970> up

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
go ahead and pull it you pull that up

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.429 
go ahead and pull it you pull that up
lock<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.030> motor<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.420> comes<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.899> go<00:01:43.380> ahead

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
lock it the motor now comes up go ahead

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.609 
lock it the motor now comes up go ahead
and<00:01:43.530> take<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:43.920> down<00:01:45.110> do<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.140> again<00:01:47.149> up

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
and take it back down do it again up

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.899 
and take it back down do it again up
down<00:01:50.659> with<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.500> trolling<00:01:53.189> motor<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> up

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
down with the trolling motor in the up

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.870 
down with the trolling motor in the up
position<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:55.110> stays<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> water<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
position it stays up out of the water I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.539 
position it stays up out of the water I
can<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.719> as<00:01:57.840> fast<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.320> want<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:59.280> break

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
can go as fast as I want and not break

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.200 
can go as fast as I want and not break
any<00:01:59.729> props<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> how<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.700> how<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.090> use

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
any props so how do you how do you use

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.000 
any props so how do you how do you use
it

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
it

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.350 
it
well<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:05.880> come<00:02:06.030> over<00:02:06.680> come<00:02:07.680> over<00:02:07.800> here<00:02:08.360> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
well you come over come over here and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.320 
well you come over come over here and
you<00:02:09.600> can<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.820> control<00:02:12.180> module

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
you can see this is the control module

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.510 
you can see this is the control module
for<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.900> basically<00:02:13.320> has<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> forward<00:02:14.010> reverse

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
for it basically has a forward reverse

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.590 
for it basically has a forward reverse
and<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:16.410> dial<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.880> turn<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.150> dial<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
and a dial you turn the dial to the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.330 
and a dial you turn the dial to the
right<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.320> make<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.740> trolling<00:02:19.980> motor<00:02:20.070> go

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
right to make the trolling motor go

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.740 
right to make the trolling motor go
faster<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.870> use<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> steering<00:02:22.530> wheel

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
faster and you use a steering wheel

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.390 
faster and you use a steering wheel
which<00:02:24.750> obviously<00:02:25.350> steers<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.980> outboard

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
which obviously steers the outboard

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.760 
which obviously steers the outboard
motor<00:02:26.640> but<00:02:27.480> that's<00:02:28.170> how<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.410> steer<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
motor but that's how you steer the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.340
