one to ten really try and get numbers
down<00:00:12.910> because<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.570> structure<00:00:14.080> of<00:00:14.230> the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
down because the structure of the

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
any latin-based language so if you get

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.980
