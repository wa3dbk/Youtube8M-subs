 simply easy it is very easy to 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.159
 true bitching with this program because 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.469
 because it's from Microsoft and it gives us the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.039
 tools to flip from a dvd or 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.200

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.509
 program like you do not have to do 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.140
 downloads the image made either 32 or 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.500
 64 bits 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.200
 the downloads and you search here either in 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.299
 downloads or wherever it is already a 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.480
 once charged the and loneliness in next and it 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.540
 read and select what you're going to 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.680
 install either a dvd of the dvd has to 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.519
 be virgin or clean 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.310
 it has to be a usb already clean hotel 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.819
 abba format the program and once already 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:40.829
 loaded the iso to any file not 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:44.519
 anything either dvd or usb now if 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.709
 you start this your boot menu and 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.010
 Once started, you start to 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:54.510
 install windows 8.1 of I'll make another video 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.430
 so you can see how it is how 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.400
 is that you can install windows 7 and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.049
 windows 8.1 on the same pc as I what 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.730
 I have now but I can not show them 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.540
 Well, because I'm on Windows 7 and I'm 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.549
 recording clear then once already 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.700
 charged the iso water to install its 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.590
 windows 8.1 and they will install it here 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.599
 will be seeing the images of how more 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.689
 or less is the process to install 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.700
 windows 8.1 I know that this whole process is 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:22.980
 I would have to teach it but for 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.989
 issues of time and all that is not 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.359
 I can show them at this moment but 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.819
 if I would show you how it is installed and everything 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.440
 but then there are the images of how 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.200
 you're going to do the whole process 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.200
 for installing windows 8.1 only 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.900
 is to download the iso boot to start 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.480
 install windows 8.1 and it will be all 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.150
 ready and nothing else would be that you activate 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.030
 I was at 28.1 and ready you would have it 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.970
 totally full it would no longer occupy is my 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.800
 crack or anything like that and then I 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.420
 I say that that would be all not any 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.090
 doubt or 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.560
 or problem or error that they have so I 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.840
