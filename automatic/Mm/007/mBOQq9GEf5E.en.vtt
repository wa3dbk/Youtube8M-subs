with<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.110> bigger<00:02:10.349> city<00:02:10.739> came<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> change<00:02:11.459> in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
with that bigger city came a change in

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.699 
with that bigger city came a change in
the<00:02:11.879> game<00:02:12.030> structure<00:02:12.390> now<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.049> can<00:02:13.319> sort<00:02:13.650> of

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the game structure now you can sort of

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.500 
the game structure now you can sort of
pick<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.040> choose<00:02:14.280> where<00:02:14.579> to<00:02:14.730> go<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.090> what<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
pick and choose where to go and what to

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.660 
pick and choose where to go and what to
do<00:02:15.810> which<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.410> brilliant<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> mean<00:02:17.069> people

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
do which is brilliant I mean people

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.880 
do which is brilliant I mean people
loved<00:02:18.030> swinging<00:02:18.599> around<00:02:18.720> in<00:02:19.019> spider-man<00:02:19.440> so

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
loved swinging around in spider-man so

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.860 
loved swinging around in spider-man so
give<00:02:20.459> them<00:02:20.579> more<00:02:20.819> room<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.359> it<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.720> give

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
give them more room to do it and give

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.180 
give them more room to do it and give
them<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.109> freedom<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.560> go<00:02:22.709> wherever<00:02:22.920> they

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
them the freedom to go wherever they

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.539 
them the freedom to go wherever they
want

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
want

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.430 
want
so<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:23.940> mean<00:02:24.120> spider-man<00:02:24.720> 2<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.290> had<00:02:25.410> a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
so I mean spider-man 2 really had a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.020 
so I mean spider-man 2 really had a
smart<00:02:25.829> approach<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.370> terms<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.670> its<00:02:26.819> design

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
smart approach in terms of its design

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.839 
smart approach in terms of its design
and<00:02:27.420> actually<00:02:28.349> more<00:02:28.890> than<00:02:29.069> just<00:02:29.310> smart

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
and actually more than just smart

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.089 
and actually more than just smart
it<00:02:30.090> was<00:02:30.239> also<00:02:30.510> impressive<00:02:30.930> spider-man<00:02:31.859> 2<00:02:32.069> was

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
it was also impressive spider-man 2 was

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.550 
it was also impressive spider-man 2 was
kind<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.819> technical<00:02:33.359> feat<00:02:33.569> back<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.049> 10

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
kind of a technical feat back then 10

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.140 
kind of a technical feat back then 10
years<00:02:34.829> ago<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.099> have<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> game<00:02:35.609> world<00:02:35.849> this

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
years ago to have a game world this

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.300 
years ago to have a game world this
massive<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.930> seamless<00:02:37.470> with<00:02:37.859> no<00:02:37.980> loading

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
times or anything that was a big deal it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.440 
times or anything that was a big deal it
was<00:02:41.069> also<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.310> big<00:02:41.489> part<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.760> spider-man<00:02:42.120> 2<00:02:42.359> his

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
was also a big part of spider-man 2 his

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.199 
was also a big part of spider-man 2 his
appeal<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:44.069> thing<00:02:44.220> about<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.489> game<00:02:44.880> going

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
appeal but the thing about a game going

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.360 
appeal but the thing about a game going
for<00:02:45.389> technical<00:02:45.720> appeal<00:02:46.139> is<00:02:46.349> that<00:02:46.410> technical

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
for technical appeal is that technical

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.729 
for technical appeal is that technical
appeal<00:02:47.669> is<00:02:47.940> inherently<00:02:48.540> short-lived<00:02:49.139> and<00:02:49.620> to

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
appeal is inherently short-lived and to

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.430 
appeal is inherently short-lived and to
be<00:02:49.829> honest<00:02:50.130> playing<00:02:50.609> this<00:02:50.730> game<00:02:50.940> now<00:02:51.440> let's

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
be honest playing this game now let's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.860 
be honest playing this game now let's
just<00:02:52.590> say<00:02:52.739> we've<00:02:53.099> come<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.310> long<00:02:53.400> way<00:02:53.790> since

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
just say we've come a long way since

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.259 
just say we've come a long way since
2004<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.349> spider-man<00:02:55.859> 2<00:02:56.099> which<00:02:56.489> once<00:02:56.880> was<00:02:57.090> so

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
2004 and spider-man 2 which once was so

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:05.180 
2004 and spider-man 2 which once was so
impressive<00:02:57.660> now<00:02:58.500> feels<00:02:58.829> kind<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.340> dated

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.730 

have<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.310> got<00:03:06.490> nice<00:03:06.730> moves<00:03:07.230> for<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> dork<00:03:08.560> in

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
have you got nice moves for a dork in

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.100 
have you got nice moves for a dork in
tights<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.520> course<00:03:10.000> part<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.900> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
tights of course part of that is the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.560 
tights of course part of that is the
graphics<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.800> mean<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.310> city<00:03:12.550> may<00:03:12.850> be<00:03:12.910> huge<00:03:13.270> but

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
graphics I mean the city may be huge but

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.630 
graphics I mean the city may be huge but
doesn't<00:03:14.290> look<00:03:14.470> very<00:03:14.500> good<00:03:14.860> there's<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.400> lot<00:03:15.550> of

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
doesn't look very good there's a lot of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.120 
doesn't look very good there's a lot of
texture<00:03:16.060> pop-in<00:03:16.270> simple<00:03:17.230> shapes<00:03:17.560> things<00:03:17.920> like

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
texture pop-in simple shapes things like

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.880 
texture pop-in simple shapes things like
that<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.150> size<00:03:19.420> came<00:03:19.870> at<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.050> cost<00:03:20.110> for<00:03:20.680> sure

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
that so the size came at a cost for sure

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.250 
that so the size came at a cost for sure
but<00:03:21.430> more<00:03:21.670> importantly<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:22.450> what<00:03:23.080> really

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
but more importantly and what really

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.500 
but more importantly and what really
holds<00:03:23.470> Spiderman<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.250> back<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.700> retrospect<00:03:25.000> is

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
holds Spiderman to back in retrospect is

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.330 
holds Spiderman to back in retrospect is
the<00:03:25.990> gameplay<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.710> mean<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:26.980> may<00:03:27.100> be<00:03:27.130> an

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
the gameplay I mean it may be an

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.880 
the gameplay I mean it may be an
open-world<00:03:27.970> but<00:03:28.390> your<00:03:28.930> progression<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.680> still

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
open-world but your progression is still

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.380 
open-world but your progression is still
linear<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.520> have<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.730> complete<00:03:31.090> certain

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
linear you have to complete certain

linear you have to complete certain

actually<00:03:33.700> it's<00:03:34.120> less<00:03:34.300> of<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.510> problem<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:35.110> the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
actually it's less of a problem that the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.080 
actually it's less of a problem that the
missions<00:03:35.620> are<00:03:35.800> still<00:03:36.010> kind<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.220> linear<00:03:36.640> than

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
missions are still kind of linear than

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.660 
missions are still kind of linear than
it<00:03:37.270> is<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.870> missions<00:03:38.200> still<00:03:38.320> suck<00:03:38.740> see

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
it is that the missions still suck see

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.280

to the game's credit this is absolutely

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
massive there's no multiplayer anything

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.770 
massive there's no multiplayer anything
but<00:04:31.190> it's<00:04:31.640> such<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.820> big<00:04:32.090> game<00:04:32.300> you'll<00:04:32.630> have

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
but it's such a big game you'll have

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.570 
but it's such a big game you'll have
more<00:04:33.020> than<00:04:33.200> enough<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.590> do<00:04:33.710> on<00:04:33.830> your<00:04:33.980> own<00:04:34.130> but

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
more than enough to do on your own but

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.820 
more than enough to do on your own but
again<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.880> only<00:04:34.940> issue<00:04:35.210> is<00:04:35.360> that<00:04:35.690> stuff<00:04:36.650> you

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
again the only issue is that stuff you

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.770 
again the only issue is that stuff you
do<00:04:37.040> it's<00:04:37.460> basically<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.030> same<00:04:38.210> stuff<00:04:38.570> over

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
do it's basically the same stuff over

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.500 
do it's basically the same stuff over
and<00:04:39.080> over<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:40.340> presentations<00:04:41.090> sort<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.450> a

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
and over the presentations sort of a

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.360 
and over the presentations sort of a
mixed<00:04:41.840> bag<00:04:41.990> -<00:04:42.290> and<00:04:42.560> it's<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.860> technically

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
mixed bag - and it's a technically

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.100 
mixed bag - and it's a technically
stunning<00:04:43.940> game<00:04:44.150> for<00:04:44.390> its<00:04:44.510> time<00:04:44.750> in<00:04:44.930> some

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
stunning game for its time in some

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.500 
stunning game for its time in some
respects<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:46.010> it's<00:04:46.220> also<00:04:46.510> artistically

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510
