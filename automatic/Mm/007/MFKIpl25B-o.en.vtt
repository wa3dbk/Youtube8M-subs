00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
so here's my my solar panel I chose this

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.040 
so here's my my solar panel I chose this
50<00:00:07.830> watt<00:00:08.150> anticipating<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.420> since<00:00:09.809> it's

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
50 watt anticipating that since it's

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.220 
50 watt anticipating that since it's
flat<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.890> roof<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:12.090> my<00:00:12.150> camper<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.050> will

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.089 
flat on the roof of my camper and will
never<00:00:13.410> face<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.130> Sun<00:00:15.349> it's<00:00:16.349> only<00:00:16.739> gonna<00:00:16.890> give

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
never face the Sun it's only gonna give

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:24.519 
never face the Sun it's only gonna give
me<00:00:17.249> 45<00:00:17.640> watts<00:00:19.069> out<00:00:20.069> so<00:00:21.739> not<00:00:22.739> worried<00:00:23.099> about<00:00:23.189> my

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
me 45 watts out so not worried about my

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.909 
me 45 watts out so not worried about my
Harbor<00:00:25.529> Freight<00:00:25.859> 45<00:00:26.550> watt<00:00:26.970> controller<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> I

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
Harbor Freight 45 watt controller so I

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.790 
Harbor Freight 45 watt controller so I
drilled<00:00:29.249> this<00:00:29.399> hole<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:30.089> vent<00:00:30.739> for<00:00:31.739> the

next to the propane where I came in and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.289 
next to the propane where I came in and
here's<00:01:50.970> my<00:01:54.200> my<00:01:55.200> Harbor<00:01:55.920> Freight<00:01:56.340> 45<00:01:57.030> watt

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
here's my my Harbor Freight 45 watt

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.039 
here's my my Harbor Freight 45 watt
controller<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> had<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.420> lines<00:02:00.690> from<00:02:00.929> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
controller so I had the lines from the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.559 
controller so I had the lines from the
roof<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.440> I<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.799> showed<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> back

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
of it and I took this piece of wood out

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.640 
of it and I took this piece of wood out
of<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:08.549> inside<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.830> right<00:02:11.039> here

and that gave me a nice little shelf to
set<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.110> charge<00:02:19.500> controller<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.510> now<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> have

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019

have access to your wiring which I put
mine<00:02:53.280> right<00:02:53.700> here<00:02:54.180> here's<00:02:54.480> my<00:02:54.600> positive<00:02:56.120> to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
mine right here here's my positive to

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.590 
mine right here here's my positive to
the<00:02:57.299> controller<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:59.609> battery<00:03:00.030> side<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
the controller the battery side of the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.160 
the controller the battery side of the
controller<00:03:01.049> here's<00:03:01.500> my<00:03:01.739> negative<00:03:03.170> notice

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
controller here's my negative notice

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.699 
controller here's my negative notice
this<00:03:04.410> little<00:03:04.680> switch<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.250> put<00:03:05.519> last<00:03:05.819> year<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:07.620> I

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
this little switch I put last year so I

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:15.319 
this little switch I put last year so I
can<00:03:07.889> switch<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:08.579> my<00:03:08.910> detectors<00:03:10.880> on<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.760> that

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
can switch all my detectors on and that

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.259 
can switch all my detectors on and that
keeps<00:03:16.260> me<00:03:16.470> from<00:03:16.709> having<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:17.400> disconnect<00:03:17.850> my

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
keeps me from having to disconnect my

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.520 
keeps me from having to disconnect my
battery<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> anyway<00:03:20.760> here's<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.530> positive

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
battery so anyway here's the positive

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.680 
battery so anyway here's the positive
and<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.130> negative<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:24.000> go<00:03:24.150> right<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.569> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
and the negative that go right to the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.849 
and the negative that go right to the
