the<00:01:46.920> kind<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.310> tension<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.360> palpable<00:01:49.320> fear

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the kind of tension and palpable fear

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
the kind of tension and palpable fear
the<00:01:50.310> bat<00:01:50.610> scene<00:01:50.909> created<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.689> minute<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the bat scene created in a minute I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.460 
the bat scene created in a minute I

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
think you know it's it's not a guarantee

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.200 
think you know it's it's not a guarantee
you're<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:55.829> John<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.280> should<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.640> cagey

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you're right John you should be cagey

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.730 
you're right John you should be cagey
this<00:01:57.719> has<00:01:57.869> nothing<00:01:57.990> guaranteed<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.619> this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
this has nothing guaranteed in this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.980 
this has nothing guaranteed in this
world<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.880> strong<00:02:00.210> indicator<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
world but it's a strong indicator that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.020 
world but it's a strong indicator that
that<00:02:01.259> film<00:02:01.560> might<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:02.040> fuckin<00:02:02.399> okay

I<00:04:30.240> color<00:04:30.750> me<00:04:30.930> intrigued<00:04:31.410> yeah<00:04:31.620> but<00:04:32.130> what<00:04:32.400> I

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
I color me intrigued yeah but what I

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.430 
I color me intrigued yeah but what I
think<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.820> might<00:04:33.000> be<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.510> every<00:04:33.750> whenever

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
think it might be is that every whenever

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.780 
think it might be is that every whenever
he<00:04:34.650> has<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.770> choice<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.280> make<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.430> think<00:04:35.700> they

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
he has a choice to make and think they

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.890 
he has a choice to make and think they
were<00:04:35.850> trying<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.060> symbolize<00:04:36.510> this<00:04:36.690> and

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
were trying to symbolize this and

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.510 
were trying to symbolize this and
flipping<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.380> coin<00:04:37.560> whenever<00:04:38.250> there<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.430> a

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
flipping a coin whenever there is a

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.980 
flipping a coin whenever there is a
choice<00:04:38.790> in<00:04:39.030> his<00:04:39.150> life<00:04:39.360> yeah
