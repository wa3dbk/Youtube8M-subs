00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
first of all we're going to do is type

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.069 
first of all we're going to do is type
in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> server<00:01:27.900> name<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:29.159> cyber<00:01:30.090> crack<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
in the server name so cyber crack and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.649 
in the server name so cyber crack and
then<00:01:31.950> we're<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
then we're going to we can go to a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
then we're going to we can go to a
notepad<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.229> type<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.009> IP<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:36.030> copy

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
notepad and type in the IP then copy

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.280 
notepad and type in the IP then copy
paste<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.670> as<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.290> click

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
paste it in and as you can see click

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.770 
paste it in and as you can see click
done<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.549> doesn't<00:01:41.909> crash<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.450> we<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.720> just

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
done and it doesn't crash so we can just

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.340 
done and it doesn't crash so we can just
enter<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.850> we<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.000> enter<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> server<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
enter in we can enter the server and it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.249 
enter in we can enter the server and it
will<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.920> perfectly<00:01:47.280> fine<00:01:47.810> now<00:01:48.810> another<00:01:49.140> way

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
will be perfectly fine now another way

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.560 
will be perfectly fine now another way
to<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.729> into<00:01:54.060> single

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to do this is you can go into single

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.609 
to do this is you can go into single
player<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.219> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.399> go<00:01:56.549> into<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.850> world<00:01:57.619> for

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
player and you can go into a world for

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.859 
player and you can go into a world for
example<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.430> just<00:01:59.670> go<00:02:00.299> into<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
example if you just go into one of the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.620 
example if you just go into one of the
world's<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.320> you've<00:02:01.439> made<00:02:02.000> there<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> way

world also so I'm just going to show you
guys<00:02:13.830> how<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.010> do<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.600> once<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.750> loads<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
guys how to do that once it loads and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.970 
guys how to do that once it loads and
there<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.580> go<00:02:20.730> as<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:22.380> are<00:02:22.410> now<00:02:22.680> in

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
there we go as you can see we are now in

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.590 
there we go as you can see we are now in
a<00:02:23.400> world<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:25.040> actually<00:02:26.040> we're<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.790> volume

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
a world and actually we're in the volume

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.870 
a world and actually we're in the volume
with<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> huge<00:02:28.110> trees<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.310> green<00:02:29.580> swamp

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
with the huge trees the green swamp

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.540 
with the huge trees the green swamp
lands<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:31.350> anyway<00:02:31.680> basically<00:02:31.980> there's<00:02:32.490> a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
lands so anyway basically there's a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.890 
lands so anyway basically there's a
rubber<00:02:32.850> tree<00:02:33.030> over<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.240> too<00:02:33.420> anyway

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
rubber tree over there too anyway

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.020 
rubber tree over there too anyway
basically<00:02:34.140> what<00:02:34.620> we're<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.220> do<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:35.700> is

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
basically what we're going to do now is

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.480 
basically what we're going to do now is
just<00:02:36.870> go<00:02:37.830> into<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:39.240> game<00:02:39.780> menu<00:02:40.490> options

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
just go into the game menu options

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.010 
just go into the game menu options
controls<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:43.470> reason<00:02:43.860> why<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.130> um<00:02:45.020> the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
controls and the reason why this um the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.630 
controls and the reason why this um the
reason<00:02:46.110> why<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.320> causes<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.130> issue<00:02:47.280> is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
reason why this causes an issue is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.960 
reason why this causes an issue is
because<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:48.270> added<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:49.020> new<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:50.130> latest<00:02:50.670> update

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
because it added a new the latest update

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.360 
because it added a new the latest update
added<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.480> new<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:53.300> new<00:02:54.300> item<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.380> feature<00:02:55.710> called

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
added a new a new item or feature called

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.580 
added a new a new item or feature called
the<00:02:56.520> item<00:02:56.880> renderer<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.450> for<00:02:58.380> some<00:02:58.560> reason

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the item renderer and for some reason

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.130 
the item renderer and for some reason
they<00:02:59.040> decided<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.580> put<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.970> as<00:03:00.120> 0<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.810> don't

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
they decided to put that as 0 I don't

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.600 
they decided to put that as 0 I don't
think<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.410> was<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> very<00:03:01.650> good<00:03:01.890> idea<00:03:01.980> because<00:03:02.370> of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
think it was a very good idea because of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.720 
think it was a very good idea because of
servers<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.770> basically<00:03:05.280> what<00:03:05.700> it

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
servers but it's basically what it

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.780 
servers but it's basically what it
basically<00:03:05.880> does<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.860> press<00:03:08.070> 0<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.700> it

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
basically does is you press 0 and it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.100 
basically does is you press 0 and it
renders<00:03:08.970> an<00:03:09.270> item<00:03:09.510> as<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.840> see<00:03:09.990> I<00:03:10.020> don't

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
renders an item as you can see I don't

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.530 
renders an item as you can see I don't
have<00:03:10.290> an<00:03:10.500> item<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.460> example<00:03:11.550> if<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.030> break

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
have an item so for example if I break

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.290 
have an item so for example if I break
down<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:13.220> if<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.370> break<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.580> piece<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.790> wood<00:03:15.000> and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
down this if I break a piece of wood and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.570 
down this if I break a piece of wood and
get<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.920> wood<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.190> will<00:03:17.880> press<00:03:18.210> 0<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.800> just

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
get this wood I will press 0 and it just

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.820 
get this wood I will press 0 and it just
basically<00:03:20.760> pulls<00:03:21.150> up<00:03:21.270> of<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.570> it'll<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.650> that

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
basically pulls up of you it'll do that

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.220 
basically pulls up of you it'll do that
for<00:03:23.040> whatever<00:03:23.190> item<00:03:23.580> also<00:03:23.820> if<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.570> if<00:03:24.900> you

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
for whatever item also if you if you

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.600 
for whatever item also if you if you
have<00:03:25.350> an<00:03:25.440> item<00:03:25.650> with<00:03:25.680> durability<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.490> will

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
have an item with durability and will

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.520 
have an item with durability and will
show<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.120> there<00:03:27.240> but<00:03:27.870> for<00:03:28.020> some<00:03:28.170> reason

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
show that on there but for some reason

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.430 
show that on there but for some reason
they<00:03:28.950> decided<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.940> put<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.300> as<00:03:33.420> 0<00:03:33.450> some

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
they decided to to put it as 0 some

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.800 
they decided to to put it as 0 some
troll<00:03:34.830> grass<00:03:35.070> right<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.640> actually<00:03:36.480> think

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
troll grass right there I actually think

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.520 
troll grass right there I actually think
over<00:03:37.230> there<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.590> looks<00:03:37.830> freaking<00:03:38.430> awesome<00:03:39.060> I

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
over there that looks freaking awesome I

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.730 
over there that looks freaking awesome I
might<00:03:40.530> use<00:03:40.710> this<00:03:40.830> world<00:03:41.070> for<00:03:41.430> something<00:03:42.060> later

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
might use this world for something later

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.470 
might use this world for something later
anyway<00:03:43.740> so<00:03:43.800> as<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.550> can<00:03:44.640> see<00:03:44.820> we<00:03:45.000> can<00:03:45.120> go<00:03:45.300> into

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
anyway so as you can see we can go into

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.440 
anyway so as you can see we can go into
options<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:46.170> go<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> controls<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.450> scroll

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
down and go to item render and change it

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.870 
down and go to item render and change it
to<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.670> different<00:03:51.350> key<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.590> would<00:03:53.370> advise<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.700> to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
to a different key I would advise you to

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.720 
to a different key I would advise you to
change<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.390> one<00:03:54.510> that's<00:03:54.720> not<00:03:54.960> um<00:03:55.730> that's

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
change it to one that's not um that's

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.430 
change it to one that's not um that's
not<00:03:56.820> bound<00:03:57.120> anything<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:57.930> I'm<00:03:58.020> just<00:03:58.170> going<00:03:58.320> to

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
not bound anything so I'm just going to

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.970 
not bound anything so I'm just going to
set<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.890> number<00:03:59.130> pad<00:03:59.430> 9<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.890> as<00:04:01.890> you

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
set it to the number pad 9 and as you

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.720 
set it to the number pad 9 and as you
can<00:04:02.100> see<00:04:02.130> it's<00:04:02.550> at<00:04:03.300> numpad<00:04:03.810> 9<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.370> I'm<00:04:05.520> just

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
can see it's at numpad 9 so I'm just

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.900 
can see it's at numpad 9 so I'm just

server<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:12.320> will<00:04:13.320> put<00:04:13.710> in<00:04:13.830> cyber<00:04:14.070> crack<00:04:14.400> and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
server I will put in cyber crack and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.750 
server I will put in cyber crack and
then<00:04:16.590> for<00:04:16.770> the<00:04:16.859> IP<00:04:18.859> 78.1<00:04:20.030> 29.1<00:04:21.410> 28.2<00:04:22.410> 10<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.400> as

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
then for the IP 78.1 29.1 28.2 10 and as

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.180 
then for the IP 78.1 29.1 28.2 10 and as
you<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:24.030> see<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.780> did<00:04:24.960> not<00:04:25.110> crash

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
you can see it did not crash

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.540 
you can see it did not crash
so<00:04:27.060> basically<00:04:27.950> whenever<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.130> type<00:04:29.340> in<00:04:29.460> the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
so basically whenever you type in the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.150 
so basically whenever you type in the
zero<00:04:29.850> it's<00:04:30.180> trying<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.660> render<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.320> item<00:04:31.860> but

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
zero it's trying to render the item but

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.260 
zero it's trying to render the item but
you're<00:04:32.310> not<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.640> game<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.030> don't<00:04:33.180> have

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
you're not in the game so you don't have

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.450 
you're not in the game so you don't have
an<00:04:33.390> item<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:34.020> as<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.170> can<00:04:34.260> see<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.100> how

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
an item so as you can see that is how

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.750 
an item so as you can see that is how
you<00:04:35.490> basically<00:04:36.150> just<00:04:36.270> fix<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:37.190> issue<00:04:38.190> you

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
you basically just fix the issue you

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.490 
you basically just fix the issue you
have<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.000> either<00:04:39.120> copy<00:04:39.540> paste<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:39.960> in<00:04:40.080> or<00:04:40.290> go

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
have to either copy paste it in or go

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.520 
have to either copy paste it in or go
into<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.770> server<00:04:41.070> or<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.370> world<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:42.170> change<00:04:43.170> the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
into a server or a world and change the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
into a server or a world and change the
options<00:04:44.100> there<00:04:45.030> might<00:04:45.240> be<00:04:45.270> um<00:04:46.370> there<00:04:47.370> might<00:04:47.430> be

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
options there might be um there might be

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.370 
options there might be um there might be
a<00:04:47.700> different<00:04:48.000> way<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.270> do<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:48.810> the

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
a different way to do this and the

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.230 
a different way to do this and the
config<00:04:49.740> files<00:04:49.980> but<00:04:50.400> i'm<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:50.700> sure<00:04:50.880> about<00:04:51.060> that
