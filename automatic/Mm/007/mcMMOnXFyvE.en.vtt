00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:04.759
 Hello and welcome to this video of me this offers me on my 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.330
 Introduce game sinkers that have programmed what the Internet choice 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.069
 So that's what it's like 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.499
 we could his buddy 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:12.310
 over 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.910
 in his players, however, at EUR 14 everyone against each play anyway 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.579
 and already starts on 9 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.130
 First you have to ask the server 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.149
 so that everything is always well steered further diligently 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.820
 what you do to another 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.600
 that runs at around 8,000 he would have to have released Socialists momentum 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.570
 ten years 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.640
 So still in the engine 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.640
 then states by 1 6 percent 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.740
 here you have 1 or 2 1 rank 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.210
 Emmerich has as a player to register one or two in the game with that 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.780
 the Insight knows 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.810
 You will be asked if you want to use your external connections 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.180
 that means that teacher 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.630
 a more expensive external that uses percent to spoil 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.820
 usually 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.030
 does that only work as I said when you do 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.410
 the pot 8000 participants while the game calls also uses 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.380
 the one who started the server 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.640
 the oldest alpine security use it all to work properly 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.159
 and put an end to be formally example I started my XenServer 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.650
 Bernd Bosch year 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.270
 Of course, that was ours 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 I'm surprised Red 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 The best way to know the fire via chat or so will be server state and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.850
 so that ultimately gets 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.150
 because so Heinz Henn so programmable I'm not and prose by and 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.440
 fun character test on Thomas longer and data get it important 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.880
 that one finally 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.619
 I can now just in the case of both animals my own 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.600
 alpine individual Haiti 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.049
 or it will be easy to get away from the Bernese 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.990
 no matter I do it with the alpine 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.930
 here is also in the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.920
 Now you can start talking about chat windows then how many 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.149
 Want to make ships 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.369
 Klaus Ernst 8 speculate 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.649
 Ben 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.649
 again others need transmitter 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.709
 start there as times two washbasins one use show 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:31.889
 we have that too 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.430
 Bern Grafe the other has also deny who first attackers her that 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:37.349
 nothing yet 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.969
 to say carefully about the satire show in the selection of one 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.659
 can do well 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.859
 here "I had to be alone in the field a thousand times 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.079
 that is not a storm pulls SchultheiÃŸ Renault 1 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.919
 yes, no matter now 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.539
 since the last time 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:54.730
 Ripe his fat off 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.489
 a special depreciation of the 1 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.849
 the shape wobbles because we hit 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.409
 most of the troops and the other 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.289
 that Michelle was destroyed is no longer black but based 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.779
 or dark pants I would say 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.239
 around 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.010
 here in the mini-world is then stop remark Stoppel has met and when 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.839
 what the affected place 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.839
 after when not but what he has met and needs 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.409
 You can also do it yourself but we'll do it by ourselves that was over 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.409
 still from previous version that may still be removed 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.729
 here works synonymous instead of January 1 to affected synonymous 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.329
 he announces that her world is here 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.889
 Well, that's what it looks like if we do not hit save at the end 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.989
 attacked that I would stop because maybe still insert but as I said 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.619
 it should just work and not be mature, I know what 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.230
 and now with the Marchfeld tariffs many believe but nothing more 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.189
 written 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.889
 then also water shot said here 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.109
 here is transferred what she attacked 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.109
 as she said water conservation WWF 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.330
 m what else is there at times awake 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.130
 we can has the appeal works often presses and looks the klum show 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.289
 Waldnaab last sentence cleverly down 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.189
 If a customer makes you come to the party, the income is what 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:24.469
 hack into the system tray as far as we start the game then there is bad weather 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:25.909
 the in and out 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.909
 That should be this year 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.539
 and and then it comes up soon that checks 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.749
 To check and if that has also stood up to date 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.120
 then he says so too 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.120
 if not, the opportunity would be off so as to load 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.930
 so having played just want to win one game 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930
 can just push new then everything runs out of here again 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.889
 and we can do it a normal one for the other one in there 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.330
 Chatton Allofs 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.830
 No 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.539
 2004 actor from the player twice and now 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.690
 what could that be in which I do what we already did 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.360
 and of course also socially if you had done that in the game so how 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.889
 said it was different already stuntman you want to play reasonable then he plays 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.479
 and 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.449
 I just wanted to introduce it 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.879
 they are the download or written instructions 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.219
 come into the idea Jung describe Rheine 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.819
 Bischoff called for that to be fun, or yes, for her 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.819
 Usage 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.810
 Thanks for listening until next time
