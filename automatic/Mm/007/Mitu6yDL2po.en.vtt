that's<00:02:12.790> pretty<00:02:13.000> quick<00:02:13.269> now<00:02:14.260> let's<00:02:14.409> have<00:02:14.530> a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
that's pretty quick now let's have a

finger around it you'll notice if I get
it<00:04:45.760> right<00:04:45.940> because<00:04:46.240> it's<00:04:46.450> quite<00:04:46.690> hard<00:04:46.960> but<00:04:47.200> you

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
it right because it's quite hard but you

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.050 
it right because it's quite hard but you
can<00:04:47.440> actually<00:04:47.560> adjust<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.340> mode<00:04:48.550> you<00:04:48.730> can<00:04:48.880> see

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
can actually adjust the mode you can see

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.090 
can actually adjust the mode you can see
that<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.990> top<00:04:50.200> left<00:04:50.470> corner<00:04:50.530> of<00:04:50.950> the

screen and again if I turn it the other
way<00:04:54.130> whoops

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
way whoops

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.780 
way whoops
there's<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.630> panorama<00:04:56.050> mode<00:04:56.280> as<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.340> can<00:04:57.640> see

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
there's the panorama mode as you can see

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.550 
there's the panorama mode as you can see
it's<00:04:57.940> actually<00:04:58.360> quite<00:04:58.600> hard<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.080> get<00:04:59.320> this

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
it's actually quite hard to get this

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.560 
it's actually quite hard to get this
working<00:04:59.860> properly<00:05:00.310> I'm<00:05:01.090> going<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.300> put<00:05:01.450> this

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
working properly I'm going to put this

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.300 
working properly I'm going to put this
back<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.140> manual<00:05:02.500> mode<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:02.950> try<00:05:03.130> that

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
back to the manual mode and try that

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
back to the manual mode and try that
once<00:05:03.490> more<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:05.200> I'm<00:05:05.260> going<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.470> turn<00:05:05.620> this<00:05:05.800> dial

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
once more so I'm going to turn this dial

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.910 
once more so I'm going to turn this dial
and<00:05:07.330> as<00:05:07.420> you<00:05:07.510> can<00:05:07.630> see<00:05:07.690> now<00:05:08.200> there's<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.710> mode

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
and as you can see now there's the mode

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.560 
and as you can see now there's the mode
in<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.310> top<00:05:09.490> left<00:05:09.700> corner<00:05:09.790> and<00:05:11.070> now<00:05:12.070> going<00:05:12.340> the

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
in the top left corner and now going the

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.100 
in the top left corner and now going the
the<00:05:13.570> other<00:05:13.690> way<00:05:15.420> so<00:05:16.420> this<00:05:16.540> is<00:05:16.690> a<00:05:16.720> really<00:05:16.960> nice

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
the other way so this is a really nice

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.410 
the other way so this is a really nice
idea<00:05:17.320> in<00:05:17.650> practice<00:05:18.100> but<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:18.790> certainly<00:05:19.060> does

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
idea in practice but it certainly does

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.350 
idea in practice but it certainly does
take<00:05:19.690> a<00:05:19.720> bit<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:19.960> practice<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:20.590> get<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:20.890> right

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
take a bit of practice to get it right

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.280 
take a bit of practice to get it right
now<00:05:22.360> finally<00:05:22.720> I'm<00:05:22.810> going<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:22.990> show<00:05:23.140> you<00:05:23.200> the
