00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.180
 I always wanted to fly to a place where 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.400
 nobody could reach me in my soul and 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.500
 a pain that can not be cured in the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.780
 sky a storm that I can not temper 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.390
 in my mind a thought that costs me 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.760
 I'll get lost in time like everything 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 in passing but maybe I can pass the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.590
 things change is difficult because I do not speak 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.590
 Miramar or hate or anything that goes to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.109
 forget is difficult to explain it either 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.210
 I feel like nothing is what it seems 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.610
 and it saddens me and go into your head 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.949
 mine everything darkens like the day I 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.979
 it turned off and I hope that another one starts does not 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.440
 it may happen to me this infuriates me in the 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:45.930
 hard life makes me the pain of some 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.479
 things never come out but my little heart 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.760
 little by little it gets undone and at the same time it grows 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.589
 in the hand of music, I do not care 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.930
 that criticizes the one who repeats the one who comes 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.150
 with supplication my style is dosed 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.970
 letters are unique I want to clear the 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.500
 art in my public ideas and so I pass 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.269
 of the rest world 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.309
 I return better alone than with people who 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.740
 I detest I have a concern that is 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.940
 throw honest verses and although not all 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.940
 finish well that's why I put 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.289
 for this position 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.140
 you thought that this is not my life children of 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.480
 Whore I always wanted to fly to a place 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.970
 where nobody could reach me in my 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.740
 soul and a pain that can not be cured in 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.960
 the sky a storm that I can not 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.420
 temper in my mind a thought that 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.790
 I can not get enough in time I'll lose 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.130
 like everything happening but maybe you can 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.290
 in passing things change is difficult 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.260
 because I do not speak gives me more road noise or 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.120
 nothing that nobody will forget and nothing 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.420
 I lost because I won the forces 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.940
 enough to solve me prepared 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.030
 Only death can defeat me the rest 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.340
 is to get carried away by luck , I think 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.770
 that with everything has fun I do not look at the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.450
 past I do not want to see you I keep 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.450
 forward you know this is going to hurt 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.600
 I do not care how much you want to grow 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.820
 I surrender that I have it clear the way I chose it 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.399
 I found it I searched for it is not so 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.950
 easy when everything is finished but 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.110
 I can not pray and do not play on their side not 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.710
 speaking to me there is rancor in my pain and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.900
 hate 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.480
 when you always sign without stopping 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.520
 aware and I'm alive and while you can 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.240
 you will feel what I feel when listening to my 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.240
 advancement 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.939
 ah 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.459
 I always wanted to fly to a place where 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.740
 nobody could reach me in my soul and 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.780
 a pain that can not be cured in the 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.120
 sky a storm that I can not temper 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.450
 in my mind a thought that costs me 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.450
 take
