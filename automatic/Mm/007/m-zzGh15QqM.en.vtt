00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
or right click on things but this is a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.640 
or right click on things but this is a
limited<00:01:03.000> function<00:01:03.750> obviously<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
limited function obviously because you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.020 
limited function obviously because you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
can't write on the board and that's kind

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.250 
can't write on the board and that's kind
of<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> main<00:01:09.810> uses<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.140> out

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
of one of the main uses so to get it out

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.910 
of one of the main uses so to get it out
of<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.619> mode<00:01:14.450> we<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.840> try<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> couple<00:01:16.710> of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
of this mode we have to try a couple of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.950 
of this mode we have to try a couple of
things<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.909> first<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.869> to

about why this might happen the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.620 
about why this might happen the
connection<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:07.920> be<00:03:07.980> lost<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:09.180> several

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
different ways but the most common way

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.380 
different ways but the most common way
that<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.540> lost<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.500> from<00:03:13.920> your<00:03:14.730> computer

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390

won't be able to connect again and

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.930 
won't be able to connect again and
likely<00:04:31.680> will<00:04:31.830> solve<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.220> problem<00:04:32.699> in<00:04:32.820> most

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
likely will solve the problem in most

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.310 
likely will solve the problem in most
cases<00:04:33.860> if<00:04:34.860> not<00:04:35.660> if<00:04:36.660> you're<00:04:36.870> still<00:04:37.139> having

cases if not if you're still having

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.140 
cases if not if you're still having
problems<00:04:37.710> with<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.820> run<00:04:39.120> the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
problems with that and you run the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.249 
problems with that and you run the
connection<00:04:39.750> work<00:04:39.960> wizard<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:41.550> then<00:04:42.210> what<00:04:43.110> you

connection work wizard and then what you

connection work wizard and then what you
want<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:44.030> completely<00:04:45.030> shut<00:04:45.300> down

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
want to do is completely shut down

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.540 
want to do is completely shut down
restart<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.410> computer<00:04:46.560> again<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.250> run<00:04:47.430> the

reinstall<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.509> drivers<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:01.889> in<00:05:02.550> order<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.060> do

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
reinstall the drivers so in order to do

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:10.219 
reinstall the drivers so in order to do
that<00:05:04.729> you'll<00:05:05.729> need<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.150> CD<00:05:06.630> from<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:09.229> smart

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
that you'll need the CD from the smart

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.089 
that you'll need the CD from the smart
software<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:12.360> can<00:05:12.570> update<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:13.590> drivers

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
software and you can update the drivers

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.600 
software and you can update the drivers
that<00:05:14.340> way<00:05:15.139> by<00:05:16.139> just<00:05:16.410> putting<00:05:16.740> in<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:16.949> CD<00:05:17.310> it

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
that way by just putting in the CD it

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.839 
that way by just putting in the CD it
will<00:05:17.759> auto<00:05:17.970> run<00:05:18.270> on<00:05:18.570> your<00:05:19.020> computer<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:20.490> it

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
will auto run on your computer and it

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.550 
will auto run on your computer and it
will<00:05:21.090> go<00:05:21.270> through<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.810> updating<00:05:22.320> process

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
will go through the updating process

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.719 
will go through the updating process
when<00:05:23.220> that's<00:05:23.430> done<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:24.330> will<00:05:25.370> update<00:05:26.370> the

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
when that's done it will update the

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.909 
when that's done it will update the
drivers<00:05:27.210> update<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.139> firmware<00:05:28.320> in<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.680> board

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
drivers update the firmware in the board

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.219 
drivers update the firmware in the board
and<00:05:29.160> then<00:05:29.849> the<00:05:29.880> board<00:05:30.060> should<00:05:30.630> connect<00:05:31.020> just

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
and then the board should connect just

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.180 
and then the board should connect just
fine<00:05:31.940> that<00:05:32.940> would<00:05:33.210> work<00:05:33.389> as<00:05:33.659> well<00:05:34.010> if<00:05:35.010> you're

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
fine that would work as well if you're

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.500 
fine that would work as well if you're
doing<00:05:35.400> instead<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.849> doing<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.060> connection

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
doing instead of doing the connection

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.820 
doing instead of doing the connection
wizard<00:05:36.659> but<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.080> connection<00:05:37.500> wizards

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
wizard but the connection wizards

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.820 
wizard but the connection wizards
they'll<00:05:37.979> just<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.250> lot<00:05:38.460> faster<00:05:39.229> if<00:05:40.229> you<00:05:40.500> do<00:05:40.650> not

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
they'll just a lot faster if you do not

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.909 
they'll just a lot faster if you do not
have<00:05:41.220> your<00:05:41.490> CD<00:05:41.789> can't<00:05:42.539> find<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.080> let<00:05:43.560> me<00:05:43.620> know<00:05:43.740> I

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
have your CD can't find it let me know I

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.640 
have your CD can't find it let me know I
do<00:05:44.159> have<00:05:44.430> an<00:05:44.580> extra<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.120> then<00:05:45.210> I<00:05:45.270> can<00:05:45.510> bring<00:05:46.349> to

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
do have an extra and then I can bring to

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.870 
do have an extra and then I can bring to
you<00:05:47.060> but<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.210> should<00:05:48.570> solve<00:05:48.900> that<00:05:49.229> problem

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
you but that should solve that problem

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.689 
you but that should solve that problem
and<00:05:50.880> this<00:05:51.659> has<00:05:51.840> been<00:05:52.220> fixing<00:05:53.220> your<00:05:53.370> smart

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
and this has been fixing your smart

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.500 
and this has been fixing your smart
board<00:05:53.940> when<00:05:54.150> it<00:05:54.270> goes<00:05:54.449> into<00:05:54.690> hid<00:05:55.199> mode
