what I suggest you do is to actually put

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.200 
what I suggest you do is to actually put
whoever<00:00:49.710> sport<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.489> you're<00:00:50.579> lacing<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.090> up

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
whoever sport that you're lacing it up

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.090 
whoever sport that you're lacing it up
and<00:00:51.390> into<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> shoe<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.410> lace<00:00:52.680> them<00:00:52.920> while

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and into the shoe so lace them while

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.970 
and into the shoe so lace them while
they're<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.370> their<00:00:53.550> feet<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.820> other<00:00:54.120> words

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.410 

that<00:00:58.980> way<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.340> don't<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.699> too<00:00:59.910> tight<00:01:00.180> that's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
that way they don't get too tight that's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.540 
that way they don't get too tight that's
the<00:01:00.600> biggest<00:01:00.809> worry<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.829> bungee<00:01:02.190> laces

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the biggest worry with the bungee laces

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.690 
the biggest worry with the bungee laces
is<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.239> too<00:01:03.449> tight<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:05.280> don't<00:01:05.489> want

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
is that they get too tight we don't want

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.270 
is that they get too tight we don't want
that<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.840> you're<00:01:07.110> lacing<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.830> child

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that so if you're lacing up your child

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.210 
that so if you're lacing up your child
should<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:09.270> put<00:01:10.110> them<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.409> their<00:01:10.560> feet<00:01:10.770> lace

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
should just put them on their feet lace

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.310 
should just put them on their feet lace
them<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.820> fat<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.689> tell<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> how<00:01:13.049> it

feels otherwise like I'm doing here you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.880 
feels otherwise like I'm doing here you
can<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.650> quite<00:01:16.979> loosely<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.890> have

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
can do it quite loosely and then have

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.499 
can do it quite loosely and then have
them<00:01:20.070> try<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.270> sit

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
there and play with the tension if I'm

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.940 
there and play with the tension if I'm
not<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:24.780> paying<00:01:25.080> attention<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.740> aren't

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
not really paying attention these aren't

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.760 
not really paying attention these aren't
quite<00:01:26.250> even<00:01:27.170> but<00:01:28.170> they'll<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> good<00:01:28.590> enough

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
quite even but they'll be good enough

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.719 
quite even but they'll be good enough
for<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.600> okay

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
as you put them on twirl oh you can hide

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.190 
as you put them on twirl oh you can hide
the<00:03:03.100> oily<00:03:04.100> bits<00:03:04.340> inside<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.970> shoe<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.600> that

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
the oily bits inside the shoe like that

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.650 
the oily bits inside the shoe like that
it<00:03:06.920> takes<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.220> little<00:03:07.340> more<00:03:07.549> time<00:03:07.609> you<00:03:08.329> can<00:03:08.510> see

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
it takes a little more time you can see

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.490 
it takes a little more time you can see
that<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:09.350> one<00:03:09.590> has<00:03:09.739> been<00:03:10.160> unwound<00:03:10.640> as<00:03:10.850> well

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
that this one has been unwound as well

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.940 
that this one has been unwound as well
so<00:03:12.500> that's<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.400> basic<00:03:13.790> way<00:03:13.820> it's<00:03:14.329> very<00:03:14.569> easy

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
so that's the basic way it's very easy

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.160 
so that's the basic way it's very easy
the<00:03:15.950> main<00:03:16.160> thing<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.549> they're<00:03:16.880> too<00:03:17.120> tight<00:03:17.450> to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
the main thing is they're too tight to

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.990 
the main thing is they're too tight to
fiddle<00:03:18.530> around<00:03:18.709> with<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.160> tension<00:03:19.489> and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
fiddle around with that tension and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.750 
fiddle around with that tension and
they'll<00:03:20.900> be<00:03:21.019> fine<00:03:21.230> they'll<00:03:21.560> stay<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.920> same<00:03:22.160> if

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
they'll be fine they'll stay the same if

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.699 
they'll be fine they'll stay the same if
