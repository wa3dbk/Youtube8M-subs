you play better and more precise

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
you play better and more precise
basically<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.390> hard<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> play<00:00:46.710> this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
basically because it's hard to play this

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.670 
basically because it's hard to play this
pic<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.610> an<00:00:47.730> easy<00:00:47.850> pit<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.360> play<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.440> are

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
pic it's not an easy pit to play you are

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.430 
pic it's not an easy pit to play you are
if<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.219> put<00:00:50.430> too<00:00:50.460> much<00:00:50.879> pic<00:00:51.329> into<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> string

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
if you put too much pic into the string

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.920 
if you put too much pic into the string
meaning<00:00:53.070> push<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.149> through<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> strings

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
meaning push it in through the strings

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.470 
meaning push it in through the strings
too<00:00:55.320> far<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.340> will<00:00:56.460> either<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.820> stuck<00:00:56.879> or<00:00:57.180> make

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
too far it will either get stuck or make

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.680 
too far it will either get stuck or make
a<00:00:57.510> heck<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.020> noise<00:00:58.670> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.149> put<00:01:00.359> too<00:01:00.390> much

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
a heck of a noise if you put too much

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.680 
a heck of a noise if you put too much
angle<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.440> pic<00:01:02.120> if<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> lot<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
angle on the pic if you do a lot of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.320 
angle on the pic if you do a lot of
things<00:01:03.960> wrong<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:05.220> pick<00:01:05.430> sounds<00:01:05.820> terrible

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
things wrong just pick sounds terrible

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.170 
things wrong just pick sounds terrible
but<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.820> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
but if you do it right and I think it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:25.370 
but if you do it right and I think it
sounds<00:01:09.540> great

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.209

of<00:04:14.380> fun<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.920> mean<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.640> don't<00:04:15.820> think<00:04:15.970> it's

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
of fun and I mean I don't think it's

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.699 
of fun and I mean I don't think it's
something<00:04:16.299> you<00:04:16.540> want<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.810> whole<00:04:16.959> case<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:17.320> them

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.410 
something you want a whole case of them
but<00:04:17.920> I<00:04:18.190> think<00:04:18.850> it's<00:04:18.970> something<00:04:19.150> that

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
but I think it's something that

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.600 
but I think it's something that
everybody<00:04:19.810> should<00:04:19.900> have<00:04:20.049> one<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.770> check<00:04:21.489> it

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
everybody should have one and check it
