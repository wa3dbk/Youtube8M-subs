00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
slingshot target - it'll be easier to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.580

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.270 

I'm<00:01:50.110> using<00:01:50.880> 3/8<00:01:51.880> inch<00:01:52.210> steel<00:01:52.510> balls<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:53.280> don't

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
don't plan on really doing any hunting

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.670 
don't plan on really doing any hunting
so<00:02:00.150> Steel's<00:02:01.150> probably<00:02:01.900> just<00:02:02.080> fine<00:02:02.260> I'd<00:02:02.500> like

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
so Steel's probably just fine I'd like

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
to get 1/2 inch and see how that is I

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.550 
to get 1/2 inch and see how that is I
don't<00:02:07.150> know<00:02:07.270> how<00:02:07.420> people<00:02:07.960> shoot<00:02:08.170> anything

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
don't know how people shoot anything

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.630

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.260 

that<00:02:16.640> was<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.120> target

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.880 

it's<00:02:21.720> just<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.930> matter<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.230> getting<00:02:22.410> used<00:02:22.710> to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
it's just a matter of getting used to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.460 
it's just a matter of getting used to
the<00:02:23.360> characteristics<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.510> each<00:02:24.660> slingshot<00:02:25.290> as

that<00:02:51.959> was<00:02:52.079> way<00:02:52.230> low<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.189> really

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
that was way low this is a really

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.179 
that was way low this is a really
fantastic<00:02:56.870> slingshot<00:02:57.870> very<00:02:58.260> ergonomic<00:02:58.980> very

well-made<00:03:02.099> obviously<00:03:03.439> so<00:03:04.439> my<00:03:05.310> lack<00:03:05.489> of

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
well-made obviously so my lack of

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.449 
well-made obviously so my lack of
accuracy<00:03:06.030> right<00:03:06.299> now<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.659> simply<00:03:07.560> my<00:03:08.189> lack<00:03:08.430> of

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
accuracy right now is simply my lack of

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.259 
accuracy right now is simply my lack of

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.090 

of<00:04:19.230> course<00:04:19.470> Carrie<00:04:19.799> Atkinson<00:04:20.430> who<00:04:21.920> made<00:04:22.920> my

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
of course Carrie Atkinson who made my

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.670 
of course Carrie Atkinson who made my
first<00:04:23.340> hand<00:04:23.610> mates<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.780> one's<00:04:25.560> got

first hand mates and that one's got
single<00:04:26.100> thera-band<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.910> it's<00:04:27.090> easier<00:04:27.420> for

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
single thera-band so it's easier for

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.540 
single thera-band so it's easier for
target<00:04:27.990> linking<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.680> know

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
target linking you know

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.220
