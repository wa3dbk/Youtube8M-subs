00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.910 
year I've grew it over the years I've
grown<00:06:05.060> to<00:06:05.270> forget<00:06:05.570> exactly<00:06:05.690> what<00:06:06.110> leads<00:06:06.590> where

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
grown to forget exactly what leads where

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.860 
grown to forget exactly what leads where
and<00:06:07.250> I<00:06:07.310> actually<00:06:07.490> got<00:06:07.880> pretty<00:06:08.210> confused<00:06:08.660> while

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
and I actually got pretty confused while

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.420 
and I actually got pretty confused while
recording<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.410> footage<00:06:09.680> for<00:06:09.890> this<00:06:10.010> review<00:06:10.310> I

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
recording the footage for this review I

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.040 
recording the footage for this review I
guess<00:06:10.580> this<00:06:10.760> is<00:06:10.880> just<00:06:10.910> a<00:06:11.180> personal<00:06:11.360> preference

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
guess this is just a personal preference

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.270 
guess this is just a personal preference
but<00:06:12.110> I<00:06:12.260> don't<00:06:12.470> think<00:06:12.650> I've<00:06:12.770> actually<00:06:12.980> ever

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
but I don't think I've actually ever

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.040 
but I don't think I've actually ever
asked<00:06:13.640> anyone<00:06:13.850> else<00:06:14.120> about<00:06:14.360> it<00:06:14.420> it's<00:06:14.810> just

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
asked anyone else about it it's just

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.630 
asked anyone else about it it's just
something<00:06:15.380> that<00:06:15.410> bugged<00:06:15.740> me<00:06:15.890> even<00:06:16.220> as<00:06:16.340> a<00:06:16.370> kid

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
something that bugged me even as a kid

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.030 
something that bugged me even as a kid
it's<00:06:17.090> not<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.330> huge<00:06:17.690> deal<00:06:17.960> but<00:06:18.020> sometimes<00:06:18.650> I<00:06:18.830> get

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
it's not a huge deal but sometimes I get

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.560 
it's not a huge deal but sometimes I get
a<00:06:19.070> little<00:06:19.160> lost<00:06:19.580> when<00:06:19.760> I'm<00:06:19.910> trying<00:06:20.090> to<00:06:20.270> find<00:06:20.450> a

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
a little lost when I'm trying to find a

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.090 
a little lost when I'm trying to find a

swimming mechanic is completely

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.030 
swimming mechanic is completely
horrendous<00:06:23.900> and<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.140> controls<00:06:24.500> are<00:06:24.590> absolute

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
horrendous and the controls are absolute

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.380 
horrendous and the controls are absolute
horseshit<00:06:25.370> but<00:06:25.790> does<00:06:25.910> anyone<00:06:26.120> out<00:06:26.360> there

played this game or go

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.480 
played this game or go
you<00:06:30.960> expect<00:06:31.320> me<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.470> talk<00:06:31.710> about<00:06:31.919> stop<00:06:32.280> and

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
you expect me to talk about stop and

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.310 
you expect me to talk about stop and
swap<00:06:32.730> but<00:06:32.970> that<00:06:33.150> dead<00:06:33.330> horse<00:06:33.360> has<00:06:33.780> been<00:06:33.990> beaten

so<00:06:34.500> far<00:06:34.740> into<00:06:34.919> the<00:06:35.100> ground<00:06:35.220> that<00:06:35.610> I<00:06:35.639> think<00:06:35.940> it

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
so far into the ground that I think it

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
so far into the ground that I think it
would<00:06:36.120> be<00:06:36.240> kind<00:06:36.480> of<00:06:36.570> pointless

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
would be kind of pointless

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.659 
would be kind of pointless
google<00:06:37.530> it<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.830> game<00:06:37.980> is<00:06:38.010> pretty<00:06:38.310> long<00:06:38.639> but

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
google it the game is pretty long but

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.460 
google it the game is pretty long but
