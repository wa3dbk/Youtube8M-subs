in this video we are going to look at

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.090 
in this video we are going to look at
you<00:00:02.429> saturation<00:00:03.330> hue<00:00:03.990> saturation<00:00:04.230> can<00:00:04.980> be

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
you saturation hue saturation can be

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.000 
you saturation hue saturation can be
found<00:00:05.430> by<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.330> colors<00:00:06.859> clicking<00:00:07.859> on

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
found by going to colors clicking on

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.310 
found by going to colors clicking on
that<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.490> then<00:00:09.179> in<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.450> drop-down<00:00:09.780> choose

that and then in the drop-down choose
you<00:00:10.620> saturation<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.719> will<00:00:12.719> then<00:00:12.900> get<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.110> used

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
you saturation you will then get a used

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.430 
you saturation you will then get a used
saturation<00:00:13.980> screen<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.440> we

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
saturation screen just like this and we

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.920 
saturation screen just like this and we
are<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.010> use<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.640> pot<00:00:17.940> you'll

want to go for something or tea then yes
you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.269> play<00:00:30.480> around<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you can play around of this it's not a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.120 
you can play around of this it's not a
problem

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
problem

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.670 
problem
but<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.880> what<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.180> want<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.600> achieve<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:34.200> want

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
but for what we want to achieve we want

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
but for what we want to achieve we want
to<00:00:34.950> improve<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.640> color<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:37.050> work

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
to improve the color this will not work

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.290 
to improve the color this will not work
so<00:00:37.350> I'm<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> click<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.219> reset<00:00:38.670> color<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
so I'm going to click on reset color and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.049 
so I'm going to click on reset color and
then<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> look<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.430> two<00:00:41.579> options

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
then we are going to look at two options

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.990 
then we are going to look at two options
that<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.600> basically<00:00:43.460> tackle<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.610> image

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that we can basically tackle this image

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.420 
that we can basically tackle this image
the<00:00:45.719> first<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.620> go<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the first one is just go to the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.060 
the first one is just go to the
saturation<00:00:47.910> slider<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.890> can

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
saturation slider and then you can

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.400 
saturation slider and then you can
either<00:00:50.280> go<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> minor<00:00:51.180> side<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:52.230> you'll

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
either go to the minor side which you'll

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.049 
either go to the minor side which you'll
notice<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.010> image<00:00:53.219> will<00:00:53.399> start<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
notice the image will start to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.560 
notice the image will start to
desaturate<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.829> -100<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.180> image<00:00:57.449> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
desaturate if I go to -100 the image is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.750 
desaturate if I go to -100 the image is
completely<00:00:57.960> saturated<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.579> in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
completely saturated and you can see in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
completely saturated and you can see in
this<00:00:59.910> color<00:01:00.180> section<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this color section right here all the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.570 
this color section right here all the
colors<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.219> gone<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.920> if<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.189> take<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
colors are gone so if I take the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.730 
colors are gone so if I take the
saturation<00:01:06.240> slider<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.689> go<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> plus<00:01:07.439> side

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
saturation slider I go to the plus side

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.399 
saturation slider I go to the plus side
you'll<00:01:08.460> notice<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> colors<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.110> image

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you'll notice that the colors and image

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.940 
you'll notice that the colors and image
will<00:01:10.560> improve<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.520> click<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> preview

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
will improve if I click on the preview

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.370 
will improve if I click on the preview
there's<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> before<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.630> click<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:15.990> again

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
there's a before if I click on it again

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770 
there's a before if I click on it again
there<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> after<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.299> image<00:01:18.540> looks

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
there is the after and the image looks

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.100 
there is the after and the image looks
much<00:01:19.020> better<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.700> be<00:01:20.700> careful<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> over

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
much better now be careful not to over

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.560 
much better now be careful not to over
saturate<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.799> image<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.520> go<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> fall<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
saturate the image if you go to fall of

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
saturate the image if you go to fall of
this<00:01:24.720> slider<00:01:25.080> you'll<00:01:25.439> notice<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.130> zoom

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this slider you'll notice when you zoom

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
this slider you'll notice when you zoom
into<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> image<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> image<00:01:28.080> will<00:01:28.200> look

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
into the image that the image will look

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.800 
into the image that the image will look
damaged<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.400> be<00:01:29.549> pixelated<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.390> they

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
damaged it will be pixelated and they

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020 
damaged it will be pixelated and they
will<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.110> artifacts<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.820> look

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
will be artifacts so it will not look

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.590 
will be artifacts so it will not look
very<00:01:33.060> nice<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:34.850> we<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.030> either<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.420> this

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
very nice so we can either do it this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
very nice so we can either do it this
way<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.710> take<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> saturation

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
way and we can just take the saturation

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
way and we can just take the saturation
slider<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.329> exactly<00:01:39.750> where<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.049> want<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
slider to exactly where we want it to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.410 
slider to exactly where we want it to
get<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> colors<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> be

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
get the colors the way we want it to be

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.740 
get the colors the way we want it to be
oh<00:01:42.630> I'm<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> reset<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:45.600> can

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
oh I'm going to reset it now and we can

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
oh I'm going to reset it now and we can
start<00:01:46.049> from<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> beginning<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.890> use<00:01:47.250> this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
start from the beginning and use this

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.120 
start from the beginning and use this
basically<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:49.110> almost<00:01:49.500> say<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> color

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
basically or almost say like a color

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
basically or almost say like a color
wheel<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.549> we've<00:01:50.700> got<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:52.560> we

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
wheel that we've got here and then we

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.929 
wheel that we've got here and then we
can<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.060> tone<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.079> colors<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.130> we

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
can we can tone the colors in we can we

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.880 
can we can tone the colors in we can we
can<00:01:57.149> sit<00:01:57.420> exactly<00:01:57.960> how<00:01:58.140> much<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.469> each<00:01:58.590> color

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
can sit exactly how much of each color

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.490 
can sit exactly how much of each color
we<00:01:59.070> want<00:01:59.600> you'll<00:02:00.600> notice<00:02:00.899> we've<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.049> red

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
we want you'll notice we've got red

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.490 
we want you'll notice we've got red
we've<00:02:01.770> got<00:02:01.799> magenta<00:02:02.579> blue<00:02:03.000> cyan<00:02:03.600> green<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
we've got magenta blue cyan green and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.520 
we've got magenta blue cyan green and
yellow<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:05.909> gonna<00:02:06.030> start<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.540> blue<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:07.380> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
yellow so I'm gonna start the blue if I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.889 
yellow so I'm gonna start the blue if I
click<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.860> blue<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.879> thinking<00:02:09.479> most<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
click on blue I'm thinking most of the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.020 
click on blue I'm thinking most of the
blue<00:02:10.080> colors<00:02:10.440> will<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.739> around<00:02:10.950> here

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
blue colors will be around here

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.090 
blue colors will be around here
now<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.240> find<00:02:13.690> out<00:02:13.870> where<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.260> colors<00:02:14.620> are<00:02:14.650> you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
now to find out where the colors are you

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.800 
now to find out where the colors are you
just<00:02:15.340> take<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.640> saturation<00:02:16.120> slider<00:02:16.390> all<00:02:16.780> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
just take the saturation slider all the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.770 
just take the saturation slider all the
way<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.080> minus<00:02:17.620> 100<00:02:18.190> then<00:02:19.060> you'll<00:02:19.240> see<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.630> d

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
way to minus 100 then you'll see the d

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.540 
way to minus 100 then you'll see the d
saturated<00:02:20.350> ports<00:02:20.650> right<00:02:20.830> here<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.340> also

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
saturated ports right here and you also

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.920 
saturated ports right here and you also
notice<00:02:21.819> that<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.300> blue<00:02:22.480> color<00:02:22.750> has<00:02:22.900> been

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
notice that the blue color has been

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.290 
notice that the blue color has been
desaturated<00:02:23.530> right<00:02:24.130> there<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.120> all<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
desaturated right there so all the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.180 
desaturated right there so all the
colors<00:02:25.569> have<00:02:25.930> been<00:02:25.990> taken<00:02:26.530> out<00:02:26.680> now<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.980> know

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
colors have been taken out now you know

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.790 
colors have been taken out now you know
this<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.790> with<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> blue<00:02:28.209> color<00:02:28.480> zone<00:02:28.800> then

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
this is with the blue color zone then

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.830 
this is with the blue color zone then
you<00:02:29.830> take<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.220> saturation<00:02:30.430> slider<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.660> you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
you take the saturation slider and you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.410 
you take the saturation slider and you
go<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> plus<00:02:33.220> side<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.819> you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
go to the plus side and you you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.270 
go to the plus side and you you
basically<00:02:34.750> doll<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.590> blue<00:02:35.770> until<00:02:36.130> you're

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
basically doll in the blue until you're

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.360 
basically doll in the blue until you're
happy<00:02:36.550> now<00:02:37.020> I'm<00:02:38.020> thinking<00:02:38.440> most<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.130> will

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
happy now I'm thinking most of this will

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.370 
happy now I'm thinking most of this will
most<00:02:39.550> probably<00:02:39.610> be<00:02:40.030> cyan<00:02:40.569> so<00:02:40.900> let's<00:02:41.050> click<00:02:41.230> on

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
most probably be cyan so let's click on

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.850 
most probably be cyan so let's click on
the<00:02:41.500> cyan<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.390> then<00:02:43.390> go<00:02:43.630> with<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.840> -<00:02:44.290> slider

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
the cyan and then go with the - slider

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.430 
the cyan and then go with the - slider
and<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:46.420> we<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.780> see<00:02:46.989> we're<00:02:47.170> all<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.410> same

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
and here we can see we're all the same

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.670 
and here we can see we're all the same
colors<00:02:48.100> are<00:02:48.750> now<00:02:49.750> we<00:02:49.810> can<00:02:50.080> take<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.380> slider<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
colors are now we can take the slider to

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.610 
colors are now we can take the slider to
the<00:02:50.860> plus<00:02:51.100> again<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.900> then<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.290> see<00:02:53.590> how

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
the plus again and then we can see how

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.030 
the plus again and then we can see how
strong<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:54.459> want<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.730> color<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.180> be<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.890> I'm

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
strong we want a color to be I think I'm

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.780 
strong we want a color to be I think I'm
at<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:58.440> now<00:02:59.440> let's<00:02:59.769> look<00:02:59.980> at<00:03:00.250> I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
at with that and now let's look at I

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.520 
at with that and now let's look at I
think<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.180> will<00:03:01.300> be<00:03:01.420> yellow<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.230> looks<00:03:02.260> like

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
think this will be yellow it looks like

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.020 
think this will be yellow it looks like
lots<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.800> yellow<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.370> there's<00:03:03.550> some<00:03:03.730> red

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
lots of yellow and there's some red

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.660 
lots of yellow and there's some red
there<00:03:04.930> may<00:03:05.140> be<00:03:05.170> some<00:03:05.500> green<00:03:05.830> right<00:03:06.100> there<00:03:06.400> will

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
there may be some green right there will

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.290 
there may be some green right there will
ever<00:03:06.700> look<00:03:07.170> let's<00:03:08.170> first<00:03:08.350> go<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.830> yellow

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
ever look let's first go to the yellow

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.850 
ever look let's first go to the yellow
if<00:03:10.300> I<00:03:10.420> take<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.810> saturation<00:03:10.989> all<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.680> way<00:03:11.800> to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
if I take the saturation all the way to

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.699 
if I take the saturation all the way to
-<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:13.209> shows<00:03:13.600> me<00:03:13.900> where<00:03:14.050> all<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.410> yellow

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
- it shows me where all the yellow

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.949 
- it shows me where all the yellow
colors<00:03:15.069> are<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.300> can<00:03:16.480> take<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.780> saturation

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
colors are and I can take the saturation

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.949 
colors are and I can take the saturation
slider<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.100> plus<00:03:18.310> side<00:03:18.519> again<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.750> can

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
slider to the plus side again and I can

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.050 
slider to the plus side again and I can
doll<00:03:20.230> in<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.620> strength<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.610> yellow

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
doll in the strength of that yellow

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.289 
doll in the strength of that yellow
color<00:03:22.980> let's<00:03:23.980> go<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.459> red<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.000> we<00:03:25.180> can

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
color let's go to the red and we can

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.759 
color let's go to the red and we can
also<00:03:25.420> see<00:03:25.780> there<00:03:26.019> you<00:03:26.350> can<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.709> the

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
also see there you can see the

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.590 
also see there you can see the
separation<00:03:26.920> between<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.820> yellow<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
separation between the yellow and the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.220 
separation between the yellow and the
cyan<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.380> definitely<00:03:30.070> looks<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:30.459> green

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
cyan so that definitely looks like green

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.229 
cyan so that definitely looks like green
so<00:03:32.230> on<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.739> red<00:03:32.950> Channel<00:03:33.340> if<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.880> take<00:03:34.090> the

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
so on the red Channel if I take the

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.360 
so on the red Channel if I take the
slider<00:03:34.510> all<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.750> way<00:03:34.840> down<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.860> shows<00:03:36.130> me

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
slider all the way down it shows me
