00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
on the web and the only other solutions

practice<00:02:44.110> with<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:51.120> now<00:02:52.120> I'm<00:02:52.359> not<00:02:52.420> sure<00:02:52.630> and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
practice with it now I'm not sure and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.780 
practice with it now I'm not sure and
I'm<00:02:53.650> trying<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:53.920> remember<00:02:54.040> off<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.400> top<00:02:54.519> my

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
I'm trying to remember off the top my

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.870 
I'm trying to remember off the top my
head<00:02:54.820> but<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.660> think<00:02:55.989> these<00:02:56.170> threads<00:02:56.590> are<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
head but I think these threads are the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.920 
head but I think these threads are the
thread<00:02:58.209> size<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.660> gonna<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.200> quarter<00:03:00.070> inch

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
thread size is gonna be a quarter inch

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.800 
thread size is gonna be a quarter inch
screw<00:03:01.930> by<00:03:02.260> 20<00:03:02.850> I'm<00:03:03.850> gonna<00:03:04.030> double<00:03:04.480> check<00:03:04.510> this

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
screw by 20 I'm gonna double check this

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.720 
screw by 20 I'm gonna double check this
and<00:03:05.019> hopefully<00:03:05.140> toss<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.950> up<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.400> video

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
and hopefully toss that up in the video

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.410 
and hopefully toss that up in the video
info<00:03:07.060> for<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:08.380> here<00:03:08.890> we<00:03:09.010> have<00:03:09.160> that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420

info for you so here we have that
standard<00:03:10.420> GoPro<00:03:10.959> mount<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:13.500> crazy<00:03:14.500> fancy

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.440 

secure<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:33.420> sign<00:03:33.660> there<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.290> way<00:03:35.450> they

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
secure that sign there so that way they

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.250 
secure that sign there so that way they
can<00:03:36.480> get<00:03:36.780> an<00:03:36.900> idea<00:03:38.930> where<00:03:39.930> we're<00:03:40.080> going<00:03:40.170> to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
can get an idea where we're going to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:56.199 
can get an idea where we're going to
place<00:03:40.470> it

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.069 

go<00:03:56.989> ahead<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.319> mount<00:03:57.409> it<00:03:57.620> right<00:03:57.680> there<00:03:59.079> which

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
go ahead and mount it right there which

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.089 
go ahead and mount it right there which
I<00:04:00.500> can<00:04:01.280> see<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:02.140> cell<00:04:03.140> lines<00:04:03.439> and<00:04:03.860> that's

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
I can see the cell lines and that's

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.140 
I can see the cell lines and that's
right<00:04:04.310> between<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:05.620> one-two-three<00:04:07.150> between

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
right between the one-two-three between

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.270 
right between the one-two-three between
the<00:04:08.299> three<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:08.720> four<00:04:11.709> just<00:04:12.709> use<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.099> as

the three and the four just use that as

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:44.140 
the three and the four just use that as
my<00:04:13.400> centerline<00:04:19.959> for<00:04:42.370> I'm<00:04:43.370> gonna<00:04:43.520> go<00:04:43.760> back<00:04:43.940> in

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.860 

now<00:06:59.380> if<00:07:00.310> you<00:07:00.580> wanted<00:07:00.850> to<00:07:01.060> lock<00:07:01.480> it<00:07:01.660> in<00:07:01.780> a

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
now if you wanted to lock it in a

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.740 
now if you wanted to lock it in a
forward<00:07:02.080> position<00:07:02.470> I<00:07:02.980> would<00:07:03.910> consider<00:07:04.480> using

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
forward position I would consider using

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.790 
forward position I would consider using
like<00:07:05.110> a<00:07:05.140> star<00:07:05.500> washer<00:07:05.770> in<00:07:06.550> between<00:07:07.540> each<00:07:07.800> the

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
like a star washer in between each the

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.140 
like a star washer in between each the
tripod<00:07:09.610> mount<00:07:09.820> as<00:07:10.120> well<00:07:10.180> as<00:07:10.690> the<00:07:10.930> screw<00:07:11.230> and

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
tripod mount as well as the screw and
