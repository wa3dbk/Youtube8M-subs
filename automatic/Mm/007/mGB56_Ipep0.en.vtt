00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
charity shop and there was something

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.450 
charity shop and there was something

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
constructed and the way it felt that was

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
why it's irresponsible of magazines to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.700 
why it's irresponsible of magazines to
print<00:01:35.670> photographs<00:01:36.660> of<00:01:36.810> models<00:01:37.230> that<00:01:37.410> are

print photographs of models that are

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.830 
print photographs of models that are
stick-thin<00:01:38.010> because<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.940> encourages<00:01:39.240> girls

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
stick-thin because it encourages girls

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.070 
stick-thin because it encourages girls
to<00:01:40.260> want<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> try<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.490> emulate<00:01:41.730> that<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.870> of

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
to want to try and emulate that kind of

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.990 
to want to try and emulate that kind of
figure<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.370> should<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.850> be

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
figure and they should really be

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.180 
figure and they should really be
accepting<00:01:45.780> their<00:01:45.990> bodies<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
accepting their bodies as they are and

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.310 
accepting their bodies as they are and
finding<00:01:47.580> clothes<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.090> suit<00:01:48.300> them<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:48.960> think

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
finding clothes that suit them I think

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.930 
finding clothes that suit them I think
there<00:01:49.620> should<00:01:49.650> be<00:01:49.770> more<00:01:49.860> emphasis<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.640> clothes

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
there should be more emphasis on clothes

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.390 
there should be more emphasis on clothes
that<00:01:50.970> fit<00:01:51.600> well<00:01:51.810> rather<00:01:52.440> than<00:01:52.650> clothes<00:01:53.100> that

that fit well rather than clothes that

that fit well rather than clothes that
