00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the a D G B II that EKG gp8 okay now if

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.019 
the a D G B II that EKG gp8 okay now if
you<00:00:26.880> look<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.949> reason<00:00:29.400> well<00:00:29.789> let's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you look here the reason well let's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.910 
you look here the reason well let's
let's<00:00:30.449> talk<00:00:30.599> about<00:00:30.779> remembering<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> strings

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
let's talk about remembering the strings

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.680 
let's talk about remembering the strings
II<00:00:35.180> elephants<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.390> dogs<00:00:37.110> grow<00:00:37.530> big<00:00:37.890> ears<00:00:38.690> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
II elephants and dogs grow big ears so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.030 
II elephants and dogs grow big ears so
that's<00:00:39.870> from<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> thickest<00:00:40.440> string<00:00:40.500> he's

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that's from the thickest string he's

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
that's from the thickest string he's
sixth<00:00:41.399> drink<00:00:41.730> tea<00:00:41.910> first<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> other<00:00:43.350> way

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
sixth drink tea first and the other way

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.650 
sixth drink tea first and the other way
around<00:00:43.730> Easter<00:00:44.730> boner<00:00:45.530> gets<00:00:46.530> drunk<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.789> Easter

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
around Easter boner gets drunk at Easter

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.260 
around Easter boner gets drunk at Easter
okay<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:52.260> reason<00:00:52.590> why<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.309> named<00:00:55.579> EAD<00:00:56.579> GBE

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
okay so the reason why the named EAD GBE

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.990 
okay so the reason why the named EAD GBE
if<00:00:58.050> he<00:00:58.140> go<00:00:58.260> from<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> thickest<00:00:58.800> string<00:00:59.039> he's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
if he go from the thickest string he's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.689 
if he go from the thickest string he's
quite<00:01:00.570> basically<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.670> fact

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
quite basically because of the fact

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.939 
quite basically because of the fact
we've<00:01:02.969> only<00:01:03.120> got<00:01:03.359> four<00:01:03.570> fingers<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.920> thumb

we've only got four fingers the thumb

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.929 
we've only got four fingers the thumb
goes<00:01:05.400> behind<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.909> guitar<00:01:07.520> but<00:01:08.520> obviously<00:01:08.790> we

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
goes behind the guitar but obviously we

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.219 
goes behind the guitar but obviously we
use<00:01:09.119> these<00:01:09.299> four<00:01:09.510> fingers<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.140> ever

look<00:01:10.500> we're<00:01:11.100> talking<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.520> chromatic<00:01:12.330> scale

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
look we're talking about chromatic scale

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.390 
look we're talking about chromatic scale
here<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.110> well<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.409> really<00:01:13.770> scale<00:01:14.130> just

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
here as well it's not really scale just

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.010 
here as well it's not really scale just
talk<00:01:14.580> about<00:01:14.700> chromatic<00:01:15.330> where<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.600> using<00:01:15.869> all

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
got a B here okay and we've also got a B

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.060 
got a B here okay and we've also got a B
on<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.270> open<00:02:23.690> second<00:02:24.500> string<00:02:26.770> doesn't<00:02:27.770> sound

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
on the open second string doesn't sound

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.990 
on the open second string doesn't sound
exactly<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.550> same

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
exactly the same

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.140 
exactly the same
maybe<00:02:29.720> Mattoon<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.260> slightly<00:02:30.530> out<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
maybe Mattoon is slightly out so on the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.410 
maybe Mattoon is slightly out so on the
second<00:02:32.510> string<00:02:32.690> B<00:02:33.320> C<00:02:34.360> C<00:02:35.360> sharp<00:02:35.390> D<00:02:36.170> d<00:02:36.200> sharp<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
second string B C C sharp D d sharp the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.890 
second string B C C sharp D d sharp the
first<00:02:38.690> string<00:02:38.990> D<00:02:40.330> F<00:02:41.680> F<00:02:42.680> sharp<00:02:43.100> G<00:02:43.360> too<00:02:44.360> sharp<00:02:44.630> and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
first string D F F sharp G too sharp and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.770 
first string D F F sharp G too sharp and
that's<00:02:45.830> why<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.550> strings<00:02:46.880> are<00:02:47.270> named<00:02:47.480> as<00:02:47.660> they

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
that's why the strings are named as they

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.420 
that's why the strings are named as they
are<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:48.830> your<00:02:48.950> four<00:02:49.190> fingers

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
are because of your four fingers

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.990 
are because of your four fingers
stretching<00:02:49.970> across<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:55.070> I<00:02:55.400> hope<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.850> makes

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
stretching across so I hope that makes

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.780 
stretching across so I hope that makes
sense<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.450> clarifies<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.290> situation<00:02:57.790> thanks

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
sense and clarifies the situation thanks

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.500 
sense and clarifies the situation thanks
