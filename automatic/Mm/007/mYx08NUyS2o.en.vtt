00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.779
 good afternoon my good today i am 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.599
 showing the outfit in which you can go 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.660
 summer on men and the basis of this outfit 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.610
 Here is a long dress to the floor when I 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.059
 I say to the floor it means really to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 floor 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.560
 that is, it is not ankle-deep 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.150
 namely it covers the heel and it is made 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.390
 from viscose here is such a flowing fabric 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.989
 very pleasant to the touch here inside 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.800
 There is a lining that is still about 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.320
 and then this is the length 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.289
 a little translucent though very 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.820
 the long top is made like this 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:54.870
 Frames neckline v-shape further 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.230
 built-up folds and that's what's very 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.079
 interesting and I really like the backs 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 made of such a transparent 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.030
 milk chiffon that is, back to the neck 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:15.560
 back covered with a transparent fabric and back 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:18.780
 here's how it is seen on zipper so on 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.540
 Of course we have cool evenings and me 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.590
 to be honest and it â€™s cold in the afternoon 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.220
 throw something 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.400
 and the dress is firm if anyone is interested here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:37.790
 Lauren Conrad 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:44.700
 so therefore here is such a jacket Valera 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:47.280
 coral color from the firm target and he 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 it turns out openwork that is not warm 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.270
 not so warm but at the same time 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:58.560
 does not give a chill when the cool wind 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.579
 in the summer further first with large things 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.850
 let's figure it out 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.439
 These are my favorite shoes from 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.860
 jessica simpson on this pretty 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.860
 high heels 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.550
 what shoes and 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.220
 in quality since it's just dinner then 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.580
 we don't take no what kind of bag is it just 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.280
 here is such a purse beautician roll to 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.940
 anything from estee lauder 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.630
 which simply put a mirror and 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.620
 pomade 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.870
 to no longer burden your 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.290
 the image itself at dinner is nothing more 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.170
 do not need if lipstick eat a little then 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.010
 You can correct makeup 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.850
 so here's nothing more you do not need 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.830
 and then there is a little trick and 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.530
 decorations and so on 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.830
 gentle romantic dress and want it 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.800
 nothing much to weight him 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.710
 I love heavy and massive decorations but 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.620
 here I wanted here such pearl 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.230
 from natural pearls 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.730
 beads here on a beautiful fastener 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.800
 this is my mom's gift and there are more from them 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.440
 bracelet earrings but I thought it was 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.810
 will be too boring therefore 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.930
 beads will be added here so golden 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.540
 chain which combine 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.460
 pendants both from white and yellow 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.830
 gold that is for example a heart with 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.000
 the other side is yellow and here it is 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.720
 he also holds yellow gold and 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.620
 show closer 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.790
 and the pebble itself is framed in white gold 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.600
 as seen here is the same suspension itself 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.650
 white gold and yellow mount 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.340
 gold and in the same way we continue 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:01.540
 farther here are these earrings to 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.060
 to diversify this whole composition to 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.940
 there were no pearl earrings all pearl 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.220
 earrings like these with red pebbles 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.560
 which 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.100
 in general, this goes well with this red 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.140
 a little flower it's a fault yes so well i'm here 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.880
 can see here above these white 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:25.860
 pebbles they overlap with these 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:33.540
 white circles further to the right hand 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:39.390
 here comes the ring this peacock and he 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:40.380
 as seen with white metal such and 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.440
 him here here 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.220
 iridescent stones also echo the 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.330
 by some 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.820
 rainbow pebbles on earrings can 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.730
 notice 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.940
 further on the left hand here everything is much 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.340
 smarter on the little finger is this 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.310
 just an artificial quran on a wire 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.320
 and I made it so narrowed down so he 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.100
 it was for the little finger that is to 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.590
 pinky goes on here such reds 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.980
 the index finger goes like this 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.070
 funny mouse with red eyes 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:21.300
 rhinestones 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:25.830
 so on the wrist is this leather 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:29.280
 the bracelet is on well actually we are all 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:34.680

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:07.800

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:23.499
 wide which is very good because it 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:27.189
 beautifully sways when walking perhaps on 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:29.740
