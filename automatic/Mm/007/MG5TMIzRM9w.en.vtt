redstone torch right there and then you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.309 
redstone torch right there and then you
just<00:02:00.710> look<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.280> wiring<00:02:01.460> like<00:02:01.729> this

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319

the<00:02:54.879> button<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:56.349> opens<00:02:56.470> up<00:02:56.799> like<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:58.140> that's

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
the button it opens up like that that's

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.860 
the button it opens up like that that's
just<00:02:59.379> a<00:02:59.620> simple<00:03:00.280> tutorial<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.569> don't<00:03:04.810> know

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
just a simple tutorial and I don't know

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.080 
just a simple tutorial and I don't know
why<00:03:06.810> I'll<00:03:07.810> try<00:03:07.989> doing<00:03:08.260> this

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.319 

okay<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.360> make<00:03:14.540> sure<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:15.349> goes<00:03:15.500> up<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:15.950> step

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
okay so make sure it goes up a step

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.640 
okay so make sure it goes up a step
because<00:03:17.329> if<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.599> doesn't<00:03:17.840> go<00:03:18.049> up<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.260> step<00:03:18.470> with

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
because if it doesn't go up a step with

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.780 
because if it doesn't go up a step with
see<00:03:18.799> mr.<00:03:19.129> not<00:03:19.430> working<00:03:19.909> like<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:22.610> that's

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
see mr. not working like that so that's

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.630 
see mr. not working like that so that's
how<00:03:22.879> you<00:03:22.970> do<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:24.040> okay<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.099> now<00:03:25.340> i'm<00:03:25.430> going<00:03:25.489> to

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
how you do it okay so now i'm going to

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.960 
how you do it okay so now i'm going to
show<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:25.849> how<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.120> make<00:03:26.269> this<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.640> just<00:03:28.849> has

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
show you how to make this so it just has

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.759 
show you how to make this so it just has
the<00:03:29.120> pressure<00:03:29.360> plates<00:03:29.750> which<00:03:30.079> opens<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.590> door

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
the pressure plates which opens the door

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.360 
the pressure plates which opens the door
like<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:32.299> first<00:03:32.629> put<00:03:33.110> down<00:03:33.349> two<00:03:33.739> pistons

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
like this so first put down two pistons

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.119 
like this so first put down two pistons
like<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:34.909> and<00:03:35.180> make<00:03:35.810> one<00:03:36.019> two<00:03:36.260> three<00:03:36.709> four

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
like so and make one two three four

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.449 
like so and make one two three four
apart<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.739> i'll<00:03:39.739> just<00:03:39.920> do<00:03:40.780> bookshelf<00:03:41.780> again

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
apart and i'll just do bookshelf again

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:54.430 
apart and i'll just do bookshelf again
and<00:03:43.459> then<00:03:44.180> go<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:50.599> then<00:03:51.440> go<00:03:51.620> one<00:03:52.129> two<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:53.440> put

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
and then go and then go one two and put

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.990 
and then go and then go one two and put
a<00:03:56.379> repeater<00:03:57.379> and<00:03:57.560> then<00:03:57.799> I'll<00:03:58.069> redstone<00:03:58.790> wire

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
a repeater and then I'll redstone wire

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.420 
a repeater and then I'll redstone wire
then<00:03:59.900> underneath<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.560> redstone<00:04:00.980> wire<00:04:01.190> you

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
then underneath the redstone wire you

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.300 
then underneath the redstone wire you
put<00:04:01.609> down<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.940> torch<00:04:02.180> like<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.069> just

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
put down the torch like that so you just

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.210 
put down the torch like that so you just
do<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.609> exact<00:04:04.879> same<00:04:04.909> thing<00:04:05.269> on<00:04:05.389> the<00:04:05.480> same<00:04:05.720> and

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
do the exact same thing on the same and

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.390 
do the exact same thing on the same and
I<00:04:07.220> already<00:04:07.370> made<00:04:07.670> these<00:04:07.940> holes<00:04:08.900> or<00:04:09.349> to<00:04:09.920> put<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
I already made these holes or to put the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.629 
I already made these holes or to put the
redstone<00:04:10.909> just<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.299> save<00:04:11.480> some<00:04:11.659> time<00:04:12.609> so<00:04:13.609> you

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
redstone just to save some time so you

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.219 
redstone just to save some time so you
put<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.090> down<00:04:14.239> like<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:15.970> ok<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.030> here<00:04:17.479> then<00:04:17.900> go

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
put it down like that ok so here then go

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.060 
put it down like that ok so here then go
out<00:04:19.329> 12<00:04:20.329> and<00:04:21.340> then<00:04:22.340> go<00:04:22.460> across<00:04:22.580> like<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.060> and

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
out 12 and then go across like that and

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.450 
out 12 and then go across like that and
don't<00:04:25.070> put<00:04:25.220> it<00:04:25.340> on<00:04:25.430> this<00:04:25.610> row<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:28.570> ok<00:04:29.570> so<00:04:30.460> now

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
don't put it on this row that ok so now

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.230 
don't put it on this row that ok so now
after<00:04:31.669> you've<00:04:32.000> done<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:33.729> put<00:04:34.729> down<00:04:34.910> to

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
after you've done that put down to

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.330 
after you've done that put down to
pressure<00:04:35.840> plates<00:04:36.169> on<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.770> second<00:04:37.070> row<00:04:37.160> like

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
pressure plates on the second row like

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.560 
pressure plates on the second row like
that<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:38.690> opens<00:04:39.020> up<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:40.270> if<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.389> want

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
that and that opens up and if you want

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.200 
that and that opens up and if you want
to<00:04:41.660> get<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.139> pressure<00:04:42.740> plates<00:04:43.039> here<00:04:43.250> just<00:04:44.060> do

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
to get the pressure plates here just do

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.930 
to get the pressure plates here just do
the<00:04:44.449> exact<00:04:44.780> same<00:04:44.810> thing<00:04:45.349> with<00:04:46.099> this<00:04:46.220> wiring<00:04:46.580> on

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
the exact same thing with this wiring on

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.920 
the exact same thing with this wiring on
the<00:04:47.080> other<00:04:48.080> side<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.789> yeah<00:04:49.789> so<00:04:50.539> thanks<00:04:50.840> for
