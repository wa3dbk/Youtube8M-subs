it out and I have really really tangling
hair<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.430> world<00:02:05.509> tangling

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
hair like out of this world tangling

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
hair like out of this world tangling
hair<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.469> i<00:02:07.770> really<00:02:08.099> find<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.520> leaving<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> in

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
hair so i really find that leaving it in

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.610 
hair so i really find that leaving it in
as<00:02:09.330> long<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.660> possible<00:02:09.720> really<00:02:10.379> works

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
as long as possible really works

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.589 
as long as possible really works
you<00:02:11.799> know<00:02:11.950> sometimes<00:02:12.909> people<00:02:13.150> are<00:02:13.420> little

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
you know sometimes people are little

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.420 
you know sometimes people are little
skeptical<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.110> more<00:02:14.379> like<00:02:14.409> on<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:15.250> natural

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
skeptical of more like on the natural

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.280 
skeptical of more like on the natural
side<00:02:15.909> products<00:02:16.390> because<00:02:16.900> they<00:02:17.019> feel<00:02:17.260> like

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
side products because they feel like

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.380 
side products because they feel like
maybe<00:02:17.709> they're<00:02:17.980> not<00:02:18.010> going<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.430> work<00:02:18.909> as<00:02:19.150> well

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
maybe they're not going to work as well

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.660 
maybe they're not going to work as well
but<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.140> will<00:02:20.409> say<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.739> for<00:02:21.010> all<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.519> these

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
but I will say that for all of these

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.990 
but I will say that for all of these
claims<00:02:21.970> having<00:02:22.390> no<00:02:22.480> silicone<00:02:22.930> no<00:02:23.140> Perriman

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
claims having no silicone no Perriman

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.910 
claims having no silicone no Perriman
biodegradable<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:26.049> works<00:02:26.440> just<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:26.860> well

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
biodegradable and it works just as well

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.680 
biodegradable and it works just as well
as<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.280> other<00:02:27.310> products<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.360> think<00:02:28.599> it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
as the other products and I think it

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.180 
as the other products and I think it
smells<00:02:28.810> even<00:02:29.079> better<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:29.769> awesome<00:02:30.159> that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
smells even better and it's awesome that

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.369 
smells even better and it's awesome that
it's<00:02:30.400> good<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.209> environment<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:32.019> little

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
it's good for the environment a little

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.649 
it's good for the environment a little
bit<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.549> it's<00:02:33.819> kind<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.060> moving<00:02:34.299> towards

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
bit and that it's kind of moving towards

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.020 
bit and that it's kind of moving towards
more<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.829> know<00:02:36.269> natural<00:02:37.269> green<00:02:38.079> feel

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
more of that you know natural green feel

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.600 
more of that you know natural green feel
so<00:02:40.079> overall<00:02:41.079> i<00:02:41.290> would<00:02:41.319> give<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:41.709> product<00:02:42.310> a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
so overall i would give this product a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.119 
so overall i would give this product a
10<00:02:43.299> out<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:43.599> 10<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:44.260> really<00:02:44.650> really<00:02:44.829> liked<00:02:45.010> it

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
mention is that this specific line of

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.020 
mention is that this specific line of
pure<00:02:55.840> clean<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.349> made<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:56.890> normal<00:02:57.430> hair<00:02:57.459> and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
pure clean is made for normal hair and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.539 
pure clean is made for normal hair and
it<00:02:58.299> claims<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.200> make<00:02:59.500> your<00:02:59.650> hair<00:02:59.769> stronger<00:03:00.190> and

think the claim is that this
biodegradable<00:03:05.440> product<00:03:05.799> is<00:03:06.010> not<00:03:06.250> going<00:03:06.400> to
