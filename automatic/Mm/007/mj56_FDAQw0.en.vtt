00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 we have a very important visit a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.770
 Salvadoran television maybe 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.970
 with a lot of rating once again together with 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.540
 two 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.540
 is which 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.650
 they arrived with their instruments and tuned 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.820
 could the last details and is 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.940
 list the presentation for the next 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.940
 Saturday 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.330
 if it's like a set to discover the 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.550
 dignity and greatness of the human being and 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.770
 these marginal communities are 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.200
 high-risk public schools that 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.000
 Sometimes we doubt the components of the 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.830
 members of the students of these 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.830
 centers are extraordinary 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.950
 here suddenly there is no rivalry between 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.310
 schools nor between colonies are a single 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.710
 center if they realize and on the other hand 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.930
 The Salvadoran idiosyncrasy is recovered 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.490
 that with the migration he was losing 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 unity and identity 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 the project started in 2012 despite its 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.800
 Young talented young age 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.960
 they perform great musical works 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.240
 teachers in music calls it one of 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.150
 an incredible way remains in the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.280
 mind even when one dreams and I think that 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.920
 that 's the magic part where you do not 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.650
 can separate the need of the musician or 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.080
 of the artist story of performing his work 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.540
 the orchestra and the choir rehearse for 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.090
 separate was a surprise the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.009
 rapidity with which both groups 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.590
 they coupled the secret I think it's in the 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.300
 hard work in humility is in that 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.979
 the boys want to go out 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.979
 forward they want to learn more and more 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.170
 the program has changed the life of 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.780
 hundreds of students receiving 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.880
 integral education and developing their 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.620
 gifts once and meanwhile to me 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.380

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.620

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.550
