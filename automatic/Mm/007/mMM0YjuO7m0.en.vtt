00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.200
 a greeting to all friends of the jimbo web 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.700
 network is given bucks you know i am 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.609
 a great fan of magazines 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.859
 video game specialists in the course 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.810
 I bought several magazines over the years and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.490
 there is nothing to do with the part you give me 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.680
 more interested in the various magazines 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.900
 are the reviews 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.009
 I happened to attend several times 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.399
 while reading the mail to these 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.800
 magazines that different users criticized 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.129
 the choice of a specific grade 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 attributed to a certain game now the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.690
 speech is this never arrived 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.250
 melli criticized what was there 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.410
 written in the review then to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.289
 end was what he really did 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 faith that gives us an idea of the game there 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.160
 may like it or not but criticize it 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
 generally only the final grade 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.949
 now the talk is this is always 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.409
 asked but how do you measure a 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.150
 video game a little the same question as that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.369
 students are placed at school when 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.350
 they say how to measure mine 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.000
 preparation as you do professor a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.210
 measure my preparation 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 if they asked, it was a year he found 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.140
 this solution to school have 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.549
 invented the structured tests no then 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.650
 what happens there are also in his 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.150
 ten questions 15 questions each one yes 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.890
 finds a score depending on 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.049
 how many returns do yours come out 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.610
 score then a little 6 maker of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.070
 let's say progressive 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.570
 obviously then it can be said certainly is not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.170
 asked everything but these are others 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.450
 speeches 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.280
 as for video games like 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.680
 they did more or less well 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.540
 similar the structured test of the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.950
 We could say that video games are all 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.940
 those ladders when you give a vote 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.460
 to speed graphics 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.610
 a vote to the graphics to the gameplay to the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.770
 sound and visibility to the charism 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.110
 presentation and intelligence 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.510
 Artificial the design of various style 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.210
 Monster Design Levels Multiplayer 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.740
 and so on 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.010
 now the talk is this you will make 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.110
 I realize that all these judgments yes 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.570
 can give all these items go to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.320
 give go to outline a vote anyway 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.780
 a number can be given on the technical side 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.190
 of the video game 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.290
 we had already talked about it we talked 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.330
 my previous video theory 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.610
 colors if you had not looked at it vi 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.680
 I invite you to look at it as I was saying 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.870
 among other things he said at the beginning that 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.900
 The game is divided into two parts 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.280
 technical side the artistic side 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.600
 without going into this meeting will 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.560
 I said another video what is the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.420
 speech that graphics soundtrack 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.940
 all these features here 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.870
 outline the technical aspect ie the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.180
 software 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.050
 the program you can go a grade to 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.670
 program and therefore the question still 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.690
 persists regarding the side 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.120
 artistic how do you measure a 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.430
 video game 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.800
 the speech is complex and simple and 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.080
 at the same time with luca bianchin 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.880
 lenin bucks the power of miracles 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.340
 we had analyzed the importance 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.510
 of the game for people for growth 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.360
 not only for children but also for children 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.780
 boys and in all ages 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.930
 the video game is a game in the end the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.240
 game that characterizes our age is 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.670
 and it's an experience like any game is 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.090
 an obviously virtual experience at 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.250
 real but still an experience a 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.000
 this point the question may be 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:45.030
 then seen as how it is measured 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.890
 an experience you sometimes know the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.209
 answers we find in the most places 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.720
 unthinkable in this case I found it 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.610
 in a Ladin sentence 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.580
 an experience is not measured by the number 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.140
 of breaths we do but by the number of 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.140
 moments that take it away from us
