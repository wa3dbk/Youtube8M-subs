00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that I do a review of this set and I

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
that I do a review of this set and I
wasn't<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.310> at<00:00:23.460> first<00:00:23.490> because<00:00:24.060> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
wasn't going to at first because I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.429 
wasn't going to at first because I
wanted<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> get<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.660> new<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.380> could

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
wanted to get the new one so I could

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.939 
wanted to get the new one so I could
compare<00:00:25.680> them<00:00:26.570> but<00:00:27.570> enough<00:00:27.900> people<00:00:28.170> asked<00:00:28.560> so

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
compare them but enough people asked so

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.310

here<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:29.970> go<00:00:30.740> first<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.270> this<00:00:33.270> set<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.719> $10

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
here we go first of all this set is $10

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.700 
here we go first of all this set is $10
less<00:00:34.559> than<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> current<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
less than the current one and it is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.639 
less than the current one and it is
about<00:00:37.950> 100<00:00:38.520> pieces<00:00:38.640> less<00:00:39.079> q4<00:00:40.079> take<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.469> well

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
about 100 pieces less q4 take as well

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.420 
about 100 pieces less q4 take as well
and<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.879> one<00:00:42.059> minifigure<00:00:42.510> less<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.430> it's

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and it is one minifigure less so it's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.940 
and it is one minifigure less so it's
pretty<00:00:44.550> pretty<00:00:45.270> fair<00:00:45.480> deal<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.840> around

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
pretty pretty fair deal all around

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
pretty pretty fair deal all around
choosing<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> whatever<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.789> get<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.149> have

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
choosing the whatever one you get I have

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.350 
choosing the whatever one you get I have
seen<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> new<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.879> even<00:00:50.879> though<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.090> own

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
seen the new one even though I don't own

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.619 
seen the new one even though I don't own
it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.279 
it
and<00:00:52.670> appearance-wise<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.960> biggest

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and appearance-wise the biggest

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.340 
and appearance-wise the biggest
difference<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.370> shorter

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
difference is this one has shorter

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.040 
difference is this one has shorter
cannons<00:00:58.350> pretty<00:00:58.649> much<00:00:59.690> there<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.809> no

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
cannons pretty much there are no

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.179 
cannons pretty much there are no
missiles<00:01:01.500> under<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:02.329> under<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.449> flap<00:01:04.189> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
missiles under here under this flap and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.240 
missiles under here under this flap and
the<00:01:05.339> legs<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:05.939> bit<00:01:06.119> shorter<00:01:07.250> just

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the legs are a little bit shorter just

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.690 
the legs are a little bit shorter just
more<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> squaty<00:01:09.119> squaty<00:01:10.490> design<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.640> i

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
more of a squaty squaty design but i

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.380 
more of a squaty squaty design but i
think<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> length<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> same<00:01:14.390> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
think the length is about the same the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.749 
think the length is about the same the
biggest<00:01:15.689> thing<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.380> i<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:17.520> this

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
biggest thing that i like on this

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.880 
biggest thing that i like on this
version<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.299> opposed<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> new<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
version is opposed to the new one is the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.730 
version is opposed to the new one is the
armour<00:01:20.159> plating<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> side<00:01:21.450> there's<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.560> lot

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
armour plating on the side there's a lot

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.640 
armour plating on the side there's a lot
tighter<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.990> ship<00:01:25.229> than<00:01:25.439> any<00:01:25.530> one

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
tighter to the the ship than any one

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.840 
tighter to the the ship than any one
that<00:01:25.770> seems<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> little<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:26.220> more<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.759> little

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that seems a little bit more a little

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.859 
that seems a little bit more a little
more<00:01:27.810> spaced<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> frame<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.250> one

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
more spaced out to the frame this one

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.410 
more spaced out to the frame this one
you<00:01:30.869> can't<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.820> see<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> like

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you can't really see in there and I like

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.030 
you can't really see in there and I like
that<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.990> yeah<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.680> said<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> get

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that a lot so yeah like I said you get

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.330 
that a lot so yeah like I said you get
four<00:01:38.250> minifigures<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:38.909> are<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.240> clones

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
four minifigures there are all clones

first one here is they're all the same

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.060 
first one here is they're all the same
by<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> way<00:01:46.140> they're<00:01:46.409> all<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> same<00:01:46.590> kind<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
by the way they're all the same kind of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
by the way they're all the same kind of
clone<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> older<00:01:48.659> clone<00:01:48.930> design<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
clone but it's the older clone design I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.260 
clone but it's the older clone design I
actually<00:01:49.950> prefer<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.549> design<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> new

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
actually prefer this design to the new

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.940 
actually prefer this design to the new
one<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:53.070> camera<00:01:53.430> will<00:01:53.549> focus<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.299> I

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
one the camera will focus there we go I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.740 
one the camera will focus there we go I
kind<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> prefer<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.119> helmet<00:01:57.570> looks<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
kind of prefer it the helmet looks a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.850 
kind of prefer it the helmet looks a
little<00:01:57.810> better<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.079> think<00:01:58.200> when<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.619> notched

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
little better I think when it's notched

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.859 
little better I think when it's notched
out<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.380> all-black<00:02:01.860> heads

know little flap and you get another
speeder<00:04:27.860> bike<00:04:28.099> or<00:04:28.849> you<00:04:29.120> get<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.330> speeder<00:04:29.599> bike

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
speeder bike or you get a speeder bike

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.629 
speeder bike or you get a speeder bike
you<00:04:29.900> don't<00:04:30.020> get<00:04:30.080> another<00:04:30.259> one

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
you don't get another one

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.890 
you don't get another one
and<00:04:31.639> that's<00:04:31.849> kind<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.090> cool<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.330> like<00:04:32.509> that<00:04:32.539> I

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
and that's kind of cool I like that I

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.209 
and that's kind of cool I like that I
don't<00:04:33.050> know<00:04:33.110> if<00:04:33.199> the<00:04:33.319> new<00:04:33.439> one<00:04:33.590> has<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:34.009> I

00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:34.219 
don't know if the new one has this I

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.339 
don't know if the new one has this I
don't<00:04:34.370> think<00:04:34.550> it<00:04:34.639> does<00:04:34.900> but<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:35.960> kind<00:04:36.169> of<00:04:36.199> like

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
don't think it does but I kind of like

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.330 
don't think it does but I kind of like
having<00:04:36.530> another<00:04:36.710> vehicle<00:04:38.979> so<00:04:39.979> I<00:04:40.009> think<00:04:40.099> that's

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
having another vehicle so I think that's

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.709 
having another vehicle so I think that's
pretty<00:04:40.490> cool

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:41.719 
pretty cool

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.679 
pretty cool
overall<00:04:42.379> I've<00:04:42.740> had<00:04:42.949> this<00:04:43.069> set<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:43.639> six<00:04:44.479> years

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 
overall I've had this set for six years

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.010 
overall I've had this set for six years
now<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:45.169> really<00:04:46.009> loved<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.430> it's<00:04:46.699> very<00:04:47.270> sturdy<00:04:47.569> I

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
now I really loved it it's very sturdy I

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.050 
now I really loved it it's very sturdy I
think<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.099> only<00:04:49.219> thing<00:04:49.490> that<00:04:49.669> I<00:04:49.699> don't<00:04:49.819> like

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
think the only thing that I don't like

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.089 
think the only thing that I don't like
but<00:04:50.569> the<00:04:50.659> new<00:04:50.780> one<00:04:50.900> has<00:04:51.110> is<00:04:51.349> the<00:04:51.650> new<00:04:51.770> one<00:04:51.919> has

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
but the new one has is the new one has

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.490 
but the new one has is the new one has
that<00:04:52.250> handle<00:04:52.729> that<00:04:53.599> pops<00:04:53.900> right<00:04:54.110> out<00:04:54.169> of<00:04:54.259> here

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
that handle that pops right out of here

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.029 
that handle that pops right out of here
this<00:04:54.740> one<00:04:55.120> doesn't<00:04:56.500> it's<00:04:57.500> a<00:04:57.529> little<00:04:57.710> harder<00:04:57.949> to

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
this one doesn't it's a little harder to

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.269 
this one doesn't it's a little harder to
grab<00:04:58.219> on<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.729> can<00:04:58.879> have<00:04:59.029> to<00:04:59.979> grab<00:05:00.979> it<00:05:01.009> like

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
grab on to you can have to grab it like

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.559 
grab on to you can have to grab it like
that<00:05:01.569> but<00:05:02.569> I<00:05:03.219> really<00:05:04.219> like<00:05:04.550> it<00:05:04.729> it's<00:05:04.849> a<00:05:05.029> very

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:05.569 
that but I really like it it's a very

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.999 
that but I really like it it's a very
easy<00:05:05.779> to<00:05:05.960> build<00:05:07.330> very<00:05:08.330> strong<00:05:08.889> like<00:05:09.889> thing

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
easy to build very strong like thing

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.459 
easy to build very strong like thing
that<00:05:10.099> really<00:05:10.219> comes<00:05:10.490> off<00:05:10.669> for<00:05:10.849> these<00:05:10.939> little

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
that really comes off for these little

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.040 
that really comes off for these little
tip<00:05:12.469> cannons<00:05:13.060> like<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.210> said<00:05:14.419> this<00:05:14.539> is<00:05:14.719> six

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
tip cannons like I said this is six

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.800 
tip cannons like I said this is six
years<00:05:15.259> old<00:05:15.409> now<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:16.060> it's<00:05:17.060> going<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.270> be<00:05:17.389> it's

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
years old now so it's going to be it's

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.240 
years old now so it's going to be it's
probably<00:05:18.050> going<00:05:18.139> to<00:05:18.199> be<00:05:18.289> pretty<00:05:18.469> expensive<00:05:18.830> I

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
probably going to be pretty expensive I

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.070 
probably going to be pretty expensive I
can't<00:05:20.210> imagine<00:05:20.300> that<00:05:21.189> you'd<00:05:22.189> find<00:05:22.430> one<00:05:23.080> for

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
can't imagine that you'd find one for

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.629 
can't imagine that you'd find one for
the<00:05:24.229> retail<00:05:24.800> price<00:05:25.129> anymore<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:28.190> best<00:05:28.400> place

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
the retail price anymore the best place

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.059 
the retail price anymore the best place
I've<00:05:28.849> had<00:05:28.969> some<00:05:29.120> people<00:05:29.210> ask<00:05:29.419> me<00:05:29.719> where<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.440> get

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
I've had some people ask me where to get

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.790 
I've had some people ask me where to get
older<00:05:31.490> sets<00:05:31.789> the<00:05:32.599> best<00:05:32.810> place<00:05:33.050> that<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.319> find<00:05:33.650> if

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
older sets the best place that I find if

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.999 
older sets the best place that I find if
