animation<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> has<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
animation that it has right there it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
animation that it has right there it
swipes<00:01:32.729> through<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.420> desktops<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
swipes through all of your desktops and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.289 
swipes through all of your desktops and
I'll<00:01:34.560> show<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.340> second<00:01:35.759> but

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
I'll show you that in just a second but

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.060 
I'll show you that in just a second but
what<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.619> actually

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
what you can do right here is actually

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.219 
what you can do right here is actually
pull<00:01:38.670> down<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.000> menu<00:01:39.299> bar<00:01:39.479> by<00:01:39.689> swiping<00:01:40.020> down

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
pull down the menu bar by swiping down

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.899 
pull down the menu bar by swiping down
with<00:01:40.530> four<00:01:40.710> fingers<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> either<00:01:41.490> close

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
with four fingers you can either close

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
with four fingers you can either close
out<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> application<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.500> can

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
out of the application or you can

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.410 
out of the application or you can
minimize<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> application<00:01:44.369> right<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.030> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
minimize the application right here so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.730 
minimize the application right here so
we're<00:01:45.509> gonna<00:01:45.630> minimize<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> application

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
we're gonna minimize the application

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.679 
we're gonna minimize the application
just<00:01:46.860> by<00:01:47.009> tapping<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
just by tapping that right there and you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.210 
just by tapping that right there and you
can<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.380> goes<00:01:49.799> into<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
can see that it actually goes into a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
can see that it actually goes into a
window<00:01:50.850> format<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.439> saying

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
window format so like I was saying

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.319 
window format so like I was saying
before<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.399> an<00:01:53.520> application<00:01:53.640> open

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
before if you have an application open

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.999 
before if you have an application open
this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.840> where<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
this is where it's going to be so if I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.950 
this is where it's going to be so if I
five<00:01:56.219> finger<00:01:56.549> pinch<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.540> then

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
five finger pinch just like that then

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
five finger pinch just like that then
you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.590> where<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> springboard

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
you can see that's where the springboard

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
you can see that's where the springboard
is<00:01:59.460> another<00:01:59.850> five<00:02:00.060> finger<00:02:00.390> pinch<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:01.380> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
is another five finger pinch here is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740 
is another five finger pinch here is
your<00:02:01.710> application<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.030> there's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> few<00:02:03.540> things

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
your application so there's a few things

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.030 
your application so there's a few things
you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.259> here<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.890> either

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
you can do right here you can either

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.700 
you can do right here you can either
resize<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.030> window<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.899> by<00:02:07.079> tapping<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
resize the window just by tapping and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.520 
resize the window just by tapping and
dragging<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.539> usually<00:02:09.539> sometimes<00:02:10.050> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
dragging and usually sometimes it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.340 
dragging and usually sometimes it
actually<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:12.209> really<00:02:12.480> know<00:02:12.660> why<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:12.959> does

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
actually I don't really know why it does

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.260 
actually I don't really know why it does
or<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.920> makes<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.240> actually

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
or what makes it do it but it actually

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.300 
or what makes it do it but it actually
switches<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.200> portrait<00:02:16.710> mode<00:02:16.740> rather<00:02:17.100> than

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
switches to portrait mode rather than

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.070 
switches to portrait mode rather than
landscape<00:02:17.670> mode<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.750> see<00:02:18.900> right

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
landscape mode but you can see right

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.020 
landscape mode but you can see right
here<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.800> tap<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.340> drag<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
here that you can just tap and drag and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.030 
here that you can just tap and drag and
it's<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.330> resize<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.960> window<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.890> if

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
it's going to resize that window now if

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.520 
it's going to resize that window now if
we<00:02:23.160> bring<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.520> over<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.960> side<00:02:25.260> right<00:02:25.290> here

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
we bring it over to the side right here

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.500 
we bring it over to the side right here
it<00:02:25.890> switches<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.280> portrait<00:02:26.730> mode<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.060> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it switches to portrait mode and it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.630 
it switches to portrait mode and it
actually<00:02:27.690> snaps<00:02:28.170> into<00:02:28.470> place<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.550> can

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
actually snaps into place so you can

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.430 
actually snaps into place so you can
actually<00:02:29.820> have<00:02:30.090> two<00:02:30.330> separate<00:02:31.260> applications

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
actually have two separate applications

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.130 
actually have two separate applications
side<00:02:32.340> by<00:02:32.550> side<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.240> you're<00:02:33.810> able<00:02:33.960> to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
side by side and you're able to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.050 
side by side and you're able to
multitask<00:02:34.680> use<00:02:35.220> them<00:02:35.400> both<00:02:35.520> at<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.820> same<00:02:36.030> time

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
multitask use them both at the same time

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.270 
multitask use them both at the same time
so<00:02:36.990> let's<00:02:37.290> go<00:02:37.410> ahead<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.650> open<00:02:37.710> up<00:02:37.920> another

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
so let's go ahead and open up another

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.890 
so let's go ahead and open up another
application<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.120> by<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.330> five<00:02:39.570> finger

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
application just by the five finger

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.750 
application just by the five finger
pinch<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.410> let's<00:02:40.950> say<00:02:41.070> we<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.340> want<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.580> open

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
pinch and let's say we just want to open

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.820 
pinch and let's say we just want to open
up<00:02:41.820> settings<00:02:42.240> for<00:02:42.420> whatever<00:02:42.660> reason<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.740> we're

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
up settings for whatever reason so we're

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.650 
up settings for whatever reason so we're
gonna<00:02:43.950> open<00:02:44.130> up<00:02:44.310> settings<00:02:44.520> we're<00:02:45.180> gonna<00:02:45.300> swipe

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
gonna open up settings we're gonna swipe

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.750 
gonna open up settings we're gonna swipe
down<00:02:45.960> with<00:02:46.200> four<00:02:46.380> fingers<00:02:46.770> we're<00:02:47.400> going<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
down with four fingers we're going to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.720 
down with four fingers we're going to
minimize<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.190> then<00:02:50.190> we're<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.520> to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
minimize this and then we're going to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.110 
minimize this and then we're going to
bring<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.120> over<00:02:51.270> here<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.980> side<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.250> snap

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
bring it over here to the side and snap

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.210 
bring it over here to the side and snap
it<00:02:54.450> into<00:02:54.510> place<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.710> see<00:02:55.770> right<00:02:56.070> here

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
it into place so you can see right here

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.490 
it into place so you can see right here
that<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.460> can<00:02:56.490> actually<00:02:56.730> swipe<00:02:57.270> through<00:02:57.630> both

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
that you can actually swipe through both

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.410 
that you can actually swipe through both
of<00:02:58.680> these<00:02:58.770> at<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> exact<00:02:59.640> same<00:02:59.970> time<00:03:00.390> so

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
of these at the exact same time so

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.850 
of these at the exact same time so
that's<00:03:00.870> actually<00:03:01.080> pretty<00:03:01.500> cool

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
that's actually pretty cool

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.890 
that's actually pretty cool
so<00:03:02.430> something<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.360> could<00:03:03.540> use<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.840> for

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
so something that you could use this for

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.780 
so something that you could use this for
maybe<00:03:04.290> would<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.770> you<00:03:05.190> know<00:03:05.310> you're<00:03:05.460> watching

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
the springboard right there and it would

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.880 
the springboard right there and it would
open<00:05:15.660> up<00:05:15.930> but<00:05:16.140> you<00:05:16.230> actually<00:05:16.380> have<00:05:16.590> to<00:05:16.680> pull

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890

through here now in this view you have
four<00:05:25.530> desktops<00:05:25.950> up<00:05:26.130> here<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.490> can<00:05:26.610> actually

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
four desktops up here you can actually

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.600 
four desktops up here you can actually
have<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.180> total<00:05:27.690> number<00:05:28.170> of<00:05:28.320> five<00:05:28.770> so<00:05:29.400> you<00:05:29.490> can

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
have a total number of five so you can

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.760 
have a total number of five so you can
see<00:05:29.790> right<00:05:29.970> there<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.420> can<00:05:30.600> add<00:05:31.260> up<00:05:31.650> to

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
see right there that you can add up to

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.260 
see right there that you can add up to
five<00:05:32.040> once<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.400> have<00:05:32.520> five<00:05:32.730> that's<00:05:33.030> pretty

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
five once you have five that's pretty

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.970 
five once you have five that's pretty
much<00:05:33.420> it<00:05:33.690> that's<00:05:33.960> probably<00:05:34.500> all<00:05:34.680> that<00:05:34.860> you're

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
much it that's probably all that you're

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.400 
much it that's probably all that you're
ever<00:05:35.130> going<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.460> need<00:05:35.550> anyways<00:05:36.180> but<00:05:36.870> really<00:05:37.230> if

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
ever going to need anyways but really if

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.990 
ever going to need anyways but really if
you<00:05:37.620> wanted<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:37.950> delete<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.280> desktop<00:05:38.760> then<00:05:38.940> you

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
you wanted to delete a desktop then you

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.670 
you wanted to delete a desktop then you
can<00:05:39.090> just<00:05:39.210> tap<00:05:39.420> and<00:05:39.570> hold<00:05:39.630> and<00:05:39.990> then<00:05:40.440> you<00:05:40.500> have

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
can just tap and hold and then you have

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.350 
can just tap and hold and then you have
the<00:05:40.770> ability<00:05:41.160> to<00:05:41.190> just<00:05:41.460> X<00:05:41.700> out<00:05:41.880> right<00:05:42.150> there

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
the ability to just X out right there

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.020 
the ability to just X out right there
and<00:05:42.510> then<00:05:42.960> that<00:05:43.110> little<00:05:43.290> plus<00:05:44.030> springboard

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
and then that little plus springboard

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.150 
and then that little plus springboard
comes<00:05:45.300> out<00:05:45.450> right<00:05:45.690> there<00:05:45.930> now<00:05:46.440> actually<00:05:46.770> using

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
comes out right there now actually using

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.370 
comes out right there now actually using
this<00:05:47.250> tweak<00:05:47.520> actually<00:05:47.910> takes<00:05:48.210> quite<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.140> bit<00:05:49.260> of

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
this tweak actually takes quite a bit of

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.830 
this tweak actually takes quite a bit of
getting<00:05:49.620> used<00:05:49.800> to<00:05:50.220> just<00:05:50.880> because<00:05:51.300> some<00:05:51.660> of<00:05:51.690> the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
getting used to just because some of the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.600 
getting used to just because some of the
gestures<00:05:52.260> aren't<00:05:52.650> necessarily<00:05:53.160> 100%

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
gestures aren't necessarily 100%

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.240 
gestures aren't necessarily 100%
intuitive<00:05:54.600> but<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.290> mean<00:05:55.530> once<00:05:55.800> you<00:05:55.860> get<00:05:56.040> used

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
intuitive but I mean once you get used

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.760 
intuitive but I mean once you get used
to<00:05:56.340> it<00:05:56.430> you<00:05:56.640> kind<00:05:56.970> of<00:05:57.090> get<00:05:57.300> an<00:05:57.480> idea<00:05:57.840> of<00:05:57.930> where

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
to it you kind of get an idea of where

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.050 
to it you kind of get an idea of where
he<00:05:58.800> was<00:05:58.980> going<00:05:59.280> with<00:05:59.430> this<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.580> how<00:05:59.880> it

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
he was going with this and how it

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.180 
he was going with this and how it
actually<00:06:00.090> all<00:06:00.510> works<00:06:00.870> but<00:06:01.530> you<00:06:01.650> can<00:06:01.800> see<00:06:02.010> right

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
actually all works but you can see right

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.770 
actually all works but you can see right
here<00:06:02.250> that<00:06:02.640> you<00:06:02.700> can<00:06:02.850> quickly<00:06:03.090> switch<00:06:03.600> between

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
here that you can quickly switch between

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.410 
here that you can quickly switch between
you<00:06:04.500> know<00:06:04.620> desktops<00:06:05.280> just<00:06:05.610> by<00:06:05.730> swiping<00:06:06.030> up

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
you know desktops just by swiping up

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.870 
you know desktops just by swiping up
swiping<00:06:07.380> over<00:06:07.680> and<00:06:07.890> then<00:06:08.310> bringing<00:06:08.610> it<00:06:08.730> down

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
swiping over and then bringing it down

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.150 
swiping over and then bringing it down
so<00:06:09.240> I<00:06:09.270> mean<00:06:09.510> it<00:06:09.720> is<00:06:10.200> actually<00:06:10.710> pretty<00:06:11.100> useful

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
so I mean it is actually pretty useful

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.040 
so I mean it is actually pretty useful
now<00:06:11.970> another<00:06:12.330> really<00:06:12.510> cool<00:06:12.720> thing<00:06:12.900> that<00:06:12.930> you

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
now another really cool thing that you

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.480 
now another really cool thing that you
can<00:06:13.110> do<00:06:13.320> is<00:06:13.440> actually<00:06:13.650> switch<00:06:14.160> through<00:06:14.370> your

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
can do is actually switch through your

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.270 
can do is actually switch through your
desktops<00:06:15.030> just<00:06:15.570> like<00:06:15.810> this<00:06:16.170> using<00:06:16.770> your<00:06:16.980> five

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
desktops just like this using your five

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.670 
desktops just like this using your five
finger<00:06:17.850> so<00:06:18.030> you<00:06:18.060> just<00:06:18.390> swipe<00:06:18.660> through<00:06:18.930> just

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
finger so you just swipe through just

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.230 
finger so you just swipe through just
like<00:06:19.950> that<00:06:20.280> now<00:06:20.580> what<00:06:20.880> you're<00:06:21.030> probably

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
like that now what you're probably

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.140 
like that now what you're probably
asking<00:06:21.570> is<00:06:21.900> does<00:06:22.110> this<00:06:22.230> work<00:06:22.290> in<00:06:23.150> portrait

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
asking is does this work in portrait

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.970 
asking is does this work in portrait
mode<00:06:24.180> well<00:06:24.540> yes<00:06:24.870> it<00:06:25.080> does<00:06:25.290> work<00:06:25.500> in<00:06:25.650> portrait

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
mode well yes it does work in portrait

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.770 
mode well yes it does work in portrait
mode<00:06:26.010> the<00:06:26.280> only<00:06:26.550> difference<00:06:26.970> is<00:06:27.150> that<00:06:27.360> you

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
mode the only difference is that you

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.620 
mode the only difference is that you
can't<00:06:28.140> snap<00:06:28.590> your<00:06:28.920> windows<00:06:29.370> to<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.090> sides<00:06:30.330> of

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
can't snap your windows to the sides of

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.740 
can't snap your windows to the sides of
the<00:06:30.920> iPad<00:06:31.920> springboard<00:06:32.910> but<00:06:33.180> everything<00:06:33.570> else

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
the iPad springboard but everything else

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.570 
the iPad springboard but everything else
works<00:06:34.020> completely<00:06:34.380> a<00:06:34.650> hundred<00:06:34.979> percent<00:06:35.100> well

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
works completely a hundred percent well

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.280 
works completely a hundred percent well
now<00:06:35.729> there's<00:06:36.120> been<00:06:36.300> a<00:06:36.330> few<00:06:36.630> bugs<00:06:36.930> that<00:06:37.200> I've

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
now there's been a few bugs that I've

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.500 
now there's been a few bugs that I've
run<00:06:37.470> into<00:06:37.800> where<00:06:38.040> I<00:06:38.220> couldn't<00:06:38.550> get<00:06:38.790> it<00:06:39.120> off<00:06:39.330> the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
run into where I couldn't get it off the

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.130 
run into where I couldn't get it off the
spring

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
spring

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.830 
spring
basically<00:06:40.560> just<00:06:40.680> wouldn't<00:06:41.310> recognize<00:06:42.000> any<00:06:42.600> of

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
basically just wouldn't recognize any of

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.630 
basically just wouldn't recognize any of
my<00:06:43.020> touches<00:06:43.290> which<00:06:43.800> was<00:06:43.950> kind<00:06:44.160> of<00:06:44.250> annoying<00:06:44.490> I

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
my touches which was kind of annoying I

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.890 
my touches which was kind of annoying I
couldn't<00:06:44.910> get<00:06:45.000> to<00:06:45.090> the<00:06:45.180> app<00:06:45.300> switcher<00:06:45.780> or

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
couldn't get to the app switcher or

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.610 
couldn't get to the app switcher or
anything<00:06:46.080> like<00:06:46.350> that

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
anything like that

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.100 
anything like that
there's<00:06:47.280> a<00:06:47.520> few<00:06:47.910> downsides<00:06:48.150> to<00:06:48.630> this<00:06:48.750> one

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
there's a few downsides to this one

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.950 
there's a few downsides to this one
being<00:06:49.380> that<00:06:49.590> you<00:06:49.680> don't<00:06:49.710> have<00:06:50.750> another<00:06:51.750> app

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
being that you don't have another app

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.570 
being that you don't have another app
switcher<00:06:52.410> like<00:06:52.560> this<00:06:52.740> is<00:06:52.890> all<00:06:53.100> that<00:06:53.280> you<00:06:53.400> have

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
switcher like this is all that you have

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.700 
switcher like this is all that you have
in<00:06:53.880> terms<00:06:54.150> of<00:06:54.330> an<00:06:54.420> app<00:06:54.570> switcher<00:06:54.990> the<00:06:55.470> other

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
in terms of an app switcher the other

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.160 
in terms of an app switcher the other
really<00:06:56.040> major<00:06:56.310> downside<00:06:57.300> of<00:06:57.570> this<00:06:57.750> tweak<00:06:58.020> is

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
really major downside of this tweak is

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.320 
really major downside of this tweak is
there's<00:06:58.380> no<00:06:58.590> control<00:06:59.100> center<00:06:59.460> as<00:06:59.610> you<00:06:59.850> can<00:07:00.120> see

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
there's no control center as you can see

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.300 
there's no control center as you can see
right<00:07:00.510> here<00:07:00.570> there's<00:07:01.080> absolutely<00:07:01.770> no<00:07:01.950> control

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
right here there's absolutely no control

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.590 
right here there's absolutely no control
center<00:07:02.610> so<00:07:02.730> if<00:07:02.820> you<00:07:02.940> want<00:07:03.120> to<00:07:03.210> change<00:07:03.450> your

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
center so if you want to change your

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.810 
center so if you want to change your
brightness<00:07:04.050> or<00:07:04.230> use<00:07:04.800> any<00:07:05.040> of<00:07:05.100> the<00:07:05.250> toggles<00:07:05.670> in

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820 
brightness or use any of the toggles in

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.370 
brightness or use any of the toggles in
your<00:07:05.940> control<00:07:06.300> center<00:07:06.510> then<00:07:07.080> you're<00:07:07.260> actually

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
your control center then you're actually

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.070 
your control center then you're actually
just<00:07:07.740> I<00:07:07.950> mean<00:07:08.310> you're<00:07:08.910> Sol<00:07:09.360> you<00:07:09.540> can't<00:07:09.780> do<00:07:09.960> it

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
just I mean you're Sol you can't do it

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.510 
just I mean you're Sol you can't do it
you<00:07:10.200> have<00:07:10.320> to<00:07:10.410> go<00:07:10.530> into<00:07:10.650> settings<00:07:10.920> to<00:07:11.220> actually

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
you have to go into settings to actually

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.430 
you have to go into settings to actually
change<00:07:11.820> your<00:07:12.090> brightness<00:07:12.840> or<00:07:12.960> anything<00:07:13.140> like

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
change your brightness or anything like

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.010 
change your brightness or anything like
that<00:07:13.500> so<00:07:13.920> that's<00:07:14.580> a<00:07:14.790> huge<00:07:15.000> downside<00:07:15.270> for<00:07:15.810> me

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
that so that's a huge downside for me

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.020 
that so that's a huge downside for me
just<00:07:16.530> because<00:07:16.710> I<00:07:16.920> mean<00:07:17.280> I<00:07:17.340> use<00:07:17.610> the<00:07:17.730> control

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030 
just because I mean I use the control

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.270 
just because I mean I use the control
center<00:07:18.300> all<00:07:18.480> the<00:07:18.660> time<00:07:18.900> but<00:07:19.470> like<00:07:19.650> I<00:07:19.770> said<00:07:20.070> if

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
center all the time but like I said if

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.520 
center all the time but like I said if
you're<00:07:20.430> a<00:07:20.520> hardcore<00:07:20.990> multitasker<00:07:21.990> and<00:07:22.110> you

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
you're a hardcore multitasker and you

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.230 
you're a hardcore multitasker and you
like<00:07:22.740> the<00:07:22.920> way<00:07:23.070> that<00:07:23.280> this<00:07:23.460> looks<00:07:23.520> and<00:07:24.090> how<00:07:24.210> it

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
like the way that this looks and how it

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.360 
like the way that this looks and how it
feels<00:07:24.390> then<00:07:25.320> you<00:07:25.530> definitely<00:07:25.710> should<00:07:26.010> try<00:07:26.310> it

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
feels then you definitely should try it
