something else you're doing you might

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.940 
something else you're doing you might
want<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.290> be<00:00:49.620> using<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.550> keys<00:00:50.880> so<00:00:51.870> first<00:00:52.740> of

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
want to be using the keys so first of

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.580 
want to be using the keys so first of
all<00:00:53.070> taking<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.000> keys<00:00:54.300> off<00:00:54.630> is<00:00:54.900> very<00:00:55.110> simple

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
all taking the keys off is very simple

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.030 
all taking the keys off is very simple
and<00:00:55.710> straightforward<00:00:56.090> you<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:58.040> small

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
and straightforward you just put a small

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.460 
and straightforward you just put a small
flat-head<00:00:59.430> screwdriver<00:01:03.170> underneath<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
flat-head screwdriver underneath the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.280 
flat-head screwdriver underneath the
edge<00:01:04.649> of<00:01:04.829> the<00:01:04.920> key<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.489> pry<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:07.170> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
edge of the key and pry it up and if you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.649 
edge of the key and pry it up and if you
really<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.479> go<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.690> it<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.920> take<00:01:11.659> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
really want to go at it you can take the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.230 
really want to go at it you can take the
little<00:01:13.310> clip<00:01:14.310> flanges<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.570> well<00:01:16.130> but<00:01:17.240> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
little clip flanges off as well but you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.469 
little clip flanges off as well but you
don't<00:01:18.390> really<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.260> what<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.530> doing

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
don't really have to for what I'm doing

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
don't really have to for what I'm doing
so<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.500> ahead<00:01:22.620> and<00:01:22.830> take<00:01:22.950> all

so I'm going to go ahead and take all

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.560 
so I'm going to go ahead and take all
these<00:01:23.310> keys<00:01:23.580> off<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.180> I'll<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.450> right

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.420 
connected to this circuit board and once
we<00:02:10.799> heat<00:02:11.039> up<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.459> keyboard<00:02:11.909> we'll<00:02:12.359> be<00:02:12.480> able<00:02:12.689> to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
we heat up the keyboard we'll be able to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.129 
we heat up the keyboard we'll be able to
separate<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.489> alright<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.389> I<00:02:15.569> preheated<00:02:16.109> my

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:16.139 
separate it alright so I preheated my

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:16.790 
separate it alright so I preheated my
oven<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
oven to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.360 
oven to
200<00:02:17.250> degrees<00:02:17.940> I'm<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.050> tie<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.770> cord

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
200 degrees I'm going to tie up the cord

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.610 
200 degrees I'm going to tie up the cord
so<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.330> doesn't<00:02:21.690> fall<00:02:21.870> down<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
so that it doesn't fall down and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.100 
so that it doesn't fall down and
potentially<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:24.030> know<00:02:24.060> fall<00:02:24.510> onto<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
potentially you know fall onto the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.830 
potentially you know fall onto the
heating<00:02:25.470> element<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.130> your<00:02:26.280> electric<00:02:26.840> stove

running a gas stove if you're running a
nuclear<00:02:40.170> fusion<00:02:41.210> cooking<00:02:42.210> device<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:43.080> can't

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
nuclear fusion cooking device I can't

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.690 
nuclear fusion cooking device I can't
help<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.340> there

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
help you there

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.380

so<00:02:45.690> we'll<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.260> throw<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.710> in<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.100> stove<00:02:47.460> I

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.420 

put<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> cooking<00:02:51.810> sheet<00:02:52.110> underneath<00:02:52.800> there<00:02:53.250> in

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
put a cooking sheet underneath there in

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.900 
put a cooking sheet underneath there in
case<00:02:53.640> any<00:02:54.120> mayhem<00:02:54.930> does<00:02:55.230> ensue<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.950> something

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
case any mayhem does ensue and something

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.400 
case any mayhem does ensue and something
melts<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.390> drips<00:02:57.630> down<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.900> don't<00:02:58.080> have<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
melts and drips down I don't have to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.120 
melts and drips down I don't have to
have<00:02:58.620> worry<00:02:59.460> about<00:02:59.520> cleaning<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.240> stove

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
have worry about cleaning up the stove

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.950 
have worry about cleaning up the stove
so<00:03:02.130> that's<00:03:02.310> going<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.580> cook<00:03:02.970> for<00:03:03.270> 20<00:03:03.660> minutes

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
so that's going to cook for 20 minutes

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.910 
so that's going to cook for 20 minutes
and<00:03:04.170> then<00:03:04.230> we'll<00:03:04.920> be<00:03:05.040> right<00:03:05.190> back

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
and then we'll be right back

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.310 
and then we'll be right back
alright<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.370> 20<00:03:09.210> minutes<00:03:09.450> have<00:03:09.570> gone<00:03:09.600> by<00:03:09.810> and

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
alright so 20 minutes have gone by and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:19.790 
alright so 20 minutes have gone by and
our<00:03:10.950> keyboard<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:12.150> done<00:03:18.170> I'm<00:03:19.170> going<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.530> show

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
our keyboard is done I'm going to show

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:28.160 
our keyboard is done I'm going to show
you<00:03:19.860> how<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.220> get<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.550> apart<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.930> what<00:03:28.020> we're

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
you how to get it apart so what we're

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.990 
you how to get it apart so what we're
going<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.320> do<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.890> we're<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.459> start<00:03:29.790> out

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
going to do is we're going to start out

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.390 
going to do is we're going to start out
by<00:03:34.489> just<00:03:35.489> putting<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:37.640> screwdriver<00:03:40.250> under<00:03:41.250> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
by just putting a screwdriver under the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.140 
by just putting a screwdriver under the
edge<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.209> corner<00:03:43.550> it's<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.730> little<00:03:44.940> bit<00:03:45.060> of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
edge of the corner it's a little bit of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.140 
edge of the corner it's a little bit of
work<00:03:45.330> but<00:03:46.130> once<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.250> get<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.489> started<00:03:47.670> it's

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
work but once you get it started it's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:57.080 
work but once you get it started it's
pretty<00:03:48.450> easy<00:03:55.220> that's<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> sound<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:56.850> want<00:03:57.030> to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
pretty easy that's the sound you want to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.530 
pretty easy that's the sound you want to
hear

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.879 

well<00:04:05.540> I'm<00:04:05.659> just<00:04:05.840> going<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:06.109> wedge<00:04:06.349> this<00:04:06.620> in

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
well I'm just going to wedge this in

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.890 
well I'm just going to wedge this in
here<00:04:07.189> and<00:04:07.310> put<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.849> kind<00:04:08.090> of<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.269> cross<00:04:08.569> like

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
here and put it kind of a cross like

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.080 
here and put it kind of a cross like
that<00:04:09.109> and<00:04:09.319> then<00:04:09.920> just<00:04:10.159> apply<00:04:10.310> lots<00:04:10.879> of

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
that and then just apply lots of

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:31.210 
that and then just apply lots of
downward<00:04:11.659> force<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:30.050> there<00:04:30.259> we<00:04:30.410> go<00:04:30.560> there's

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
downward force and there we go there's

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.939 
downward force and there we go there's
the<00:04:31.520> keyboard<00:04:32.000> now<00:04:32.930> sometimes<00:04:33.440> you'll<00:04:33.680> get

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
the keyboard now sometimes you'll get

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.760 
the keyboard now sometimes you'll get
the<00:04:34.550> this<00:04:35.210> metal<00:04:35.570> plate<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.840> release<00:04:36.440> and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
the this metal plate to release and

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.909 
the this metal plate to release and
you'll<00:04:37.400> be<00:04:37.550> in<00:04:37.699> between<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.300> plate<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:38.960> it

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
you'll be in between that plate and it

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.189 
you'll be in between that plate and it
will<00:04:40.039> work<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.250> way<00:04:40.699> but<00:04:41.449> this<00:04:41.660> time<00:04:41.990> when<00:04:42.169> I

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
will work that way but this time when I

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.830 
will work that way but this time when I
did<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.620> I'm<00:04:43.400> in<00:04:43.610> between<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:44.120> plastic<00:04:44.360> and

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
did it I'm in between the plastic and

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.640 
did it I'm in between the plastic and
that<00:04:44.870> metal<00:04:45.259> sheet<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:46.160> we're<00:04:46.340> going<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:47.650> when

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
that metal sheet but we're going to when

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.980 
that metal sheet but we're going to when
this<00:04:48.770> cools<00:04:49.099> down<00:04:49.310> we're<00:04:49.910> going<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.180> stick<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
this cools down we're going to stick the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.110 
this cools down we're going to stick the
screwdriver<00:04:51.169> in<00:04:51.740> again<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.370> we're<00:04:52.940> going<00:04:53.030> to

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120

the aluminum sheet off alright so when
this<00:05:01.130> cools<00:05:01.400> down<00:05:01.490> I'll<00:05:01.820> be<00:05:01.940> right<00:05:02.090> back<00:05:05.199> okay

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199

this cools down I'll be right back okay
so<00:05:06.800> here<00:05:07.039> we<00:05:07.159> are<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.550> keyboard<00:05:07.729> is<00:05:08.060> cooled

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
so here we are the keyboard is cooled

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.399 
so here we are the keyboard is cooled
off<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.940> only<00:05:11.210> real<00:05:11.449> useable<00:05:11.720> thing<00:05:12.169> from

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
off the only real useable thing from

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.890 
off the only real useable thing from
this<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:13.479> this<00:05:15.099> circuit<00:05:16.099> board<00:05:16.340> strip<00:05:16.900> there

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
this is this circuit board strip there

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.740 
this is this circuit board strip there
are<00:05:18.050> four<00:05:18.380> screws<00:05:18.740> holding<00:05:18.889> that<00:05:19.550> on<00:05:19.759> and<00:05:20.060> you

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
are four screws holding that on and you

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.020 
are four screws holding that on and you
need<00:05:20.930> to<00:05:21.050> use<00:05:21.199> a<00:05:21.229> really<00:05:21.500> small<00:05:21.940> Phillips<00:05:22.940> head

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
need to use a really small Phillips head

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.029 
need to use a really small Phillips head
and<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:23.990> just<00:05:24.169> take<00:05:24.349> those<00:05:24.530> off<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:24.919> then

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
and you just take those off and then

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.629 
and you just take those off and then
this<00:05:25.159> pops<00:05:25.430> out<00:05:25.699> and<00:05:27.070> that's<00:05:28.070> all<00:05:28.280> you<00:05:28.400> can<00:05:28.520> get

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
this pops out and that's all you can get

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.909 
this pops out and that's all you can get
out<00:05:28.789> of<00:05:28.909> there<00:05:29.199> and<00:05:30.199> now<00:05:31.130> for<00:05:31.430> this<00:05:32.919> we're

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
out of there and now for this we're

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.520 
out of there and now for this we're
basically<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.699> just<00:05:36.490> put<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.990> edge<00:05:39.199> of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
basically going to just put the edge of

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.820 
basically going to just put the edge of
the<00:05:39.650> screwdriver<00:05:41.259> we<00:05:42.259> have<00:05:42.349> to<00:05:42.500> get<00:05:42.710> it

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
the screwdriver we have to get it

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.810
