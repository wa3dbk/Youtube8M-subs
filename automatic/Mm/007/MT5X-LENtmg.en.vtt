at<00:00:21.610> number<00:00:22.270> 12<00:00:22.390> it's<00:00:22.750> Morrison's<00:00:23.140> clothesline

nothing<00:00:24.700> was<00:00:24.790> innovative<00:00:25.210> new<00:00:25.330> on<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.540> list

nothing was innovative new on the list

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.929 
nothing was innovative new on the list
but<00:00:26.290> I<00:00:26.320> like<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.860> way<00:00:26.950> more<00:00:27.100> than<00:00:27.279> executed<00:00:27.880> it

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
but I like the way more than executed it

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.240 
but I like the way more than executed it
puts<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.150> lot<00:00:28.240> of<00:00:28.270> energy<00:00:28.689> into<00:00:28.900> it<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:29.350> I<00:00:29.590> think

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
puts a lot of energy into it so I think

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.240 
puts a lot of energy into it so I think
it's<00:00:30.430> earned<00:00:30.580> its<00:00:30.730> spot

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
I really like the way it shows off

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.600 
I really like the way it shows off
Martin's<00:00:41.020> balance<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:41.710> flexibility<00:00:42.340> and

relatively<00:01:45.250> low<00:01:45.399> on<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.759> list<00:01:45.939> but<00:01:46.630> frankly<00:01:47.049> I

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
relatively low on the list but frankly I

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.469 
relatively low on the list but frankly I
just<00:01:47.200> seen<00:01:47.680> Morrison<00:01:48.250> not<00:01:48.490> hit<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:48.880> quite

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
just seen Morrison not hit it quite

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.649

right<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:50.049> few<00:01:50.500> too<00:01:50.619> many<00:01:50.649> times<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:52.479> very

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
right a few too many times it's very

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.600 
right a few too many times it's very
impressive<00:01:52.960> athletic<00:01:53.590> move<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.189> like<00:01:54.399> it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
impressive athletic move and I like it

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.940 
impressive athletic move and I like it
but<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.270> just<00:01:55.539> think<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.140> Morrison<00:01:56.619> needs<00:01:56.799> to

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
but I just think that Morrison needs to

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.649 
but I just think that Morrison needs to
work<00:01:57.130> on<00:01:57.220> his<00:01:57.310> accuracy<00:01:57.939> just<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.329> little<00:01:58.570> bit

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.580 
work on his accuracy just a little bit

Morrison and uh it makes for a very

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:28.500 
Morrison and uh it makes for a very
continued<00:02:18.790> move

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.090 

number<00:02:29.510> six<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.870> sto<00:02:30.290> backbreaker<00:02:30.860> as

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
number six is the sto backbreaker as

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.180 
number six is the sto backbreaker as
many<00:02:31.340> know<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.270> russian<00:02:32.750> legsweep

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
many know it to a russian legsweep

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.910 
many know it to a russian legsweep
I<00:02:34.780> really<00:02:35.780> like<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.140> creativity<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.830> this

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
I really like the creativity of this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.470 
I really like the creativity of this
move<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.520> think<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.850> works<00:02:38.030> as<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.210> great

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
move and I think it works as a great

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.690 
move and I think it works as a great
counterbalance<00:02:39.350> for<00:02:39.530> all<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.100> striking<00:02:40.430> and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
counterbalance for all the striking and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.400 
counterbalance for all the striking and
high-flying<00:02:41.240> that<00:02:41.480> he<00:02:41.600> does<00:02:41.840> for<00:02:42.110> him<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.320> have

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
high-flying that he does for him to have

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.820 
high-flying that he does for him to have
one<00:02:43.660> standing<00:02:44.660> grappling<00:02:44.990> move<00:02:45.470> that's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
one standing grappling move that's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:55.410 
one standing grappling move that's
really<00:02:46.370> him<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:47.030> like<00:02:47.840> it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.810 

at<00:02:56.420> number<00:02:56.750> five<00:02:56.990> it's<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.380> flying<00:02:57.710> Chuck<00:02:58.190> now

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
at number five it's the flying Chuck now

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.820 
at number five it's the flying Chuck now
personally<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.390> feel<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.810> Loki<00:03:00.410> does<00:03:00.650> this

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
personally I feel that Loki does this

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.220 
personally I feel that Loki does this
move<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.310> lot<00:03:01.580> better<00:03:01.910> getting<00:03:02.600> so<00:03:02.960> much<00:03:03.050> more

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
move a lot better getting so much more

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.980 
move a lot better getting so much more
air<00:03:03.440> under<00:03:03.800> him<00:03:04.040> but<00:03:04.910> it's<00:03:05.210> still<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.510> very

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
air under him but it's still a very

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.930 
air under him but it's still a very
solid<00:03:06.440> technique<00:03:06.830> it's<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.250> kick<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.640> face

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
solid technique it's a kick to the face

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.630 
solid technique it's a kick to the face
which<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.330> always<00:03:08.720> effective<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.640> quite

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
which is always effective and quite

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.190 
which is always effective and quite
frankly<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.030> can't<00:03:11.210> disregard<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.840> effort

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
frankly I can't disregard the effort

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.740 
frankly I can't disregard the effort
that<00:03:12.230> Morrison<00:03:13.040> put<00:03:13.190> in<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.370> naming<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.940> can't

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
that Morrison put in a naming it can't

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.450 
that Morrison put in a naming it can't
say<00:03:14.900> I'm<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.050> big<00:03:15.290> Chuck<00:03:15.500> Norris<00:03:15.740> found<00:03:16.010> myself

I'm<00:04:45.940> fairly<00:04:46.270> certain<00:04:46.450> Morrison<00:04:47.140> didn't

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
I'm fairly certain Morrison didn't

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.410 
I'm fairly certain Morrison didn't
invent<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.890> but<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:48.190> have<00:04:48.430> never<00:04:48.880> seen<00:04:49.180> anybody

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
invent it but I have never seen anybody

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.200 
invent it but I have never seen anybody
else<00:04:49.600> do<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.050> before<00:04:50.860> or<00:04:50.890> after<00:04:51.640> Morrison<00:04:52.060> did

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
else do it before or after Morrison did

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.170 
else do it before or after Morrison did
it<00:04:52.330> first<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:53.520> what<00:04:54.520> can<00:04:54.610> I<00:04:54.730> say

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
it first so what can I say

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.060 
it first so what can I say
innovativeness<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.900> important<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.620> me<00:04:56.830> so<00:04:57.040> I

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070
