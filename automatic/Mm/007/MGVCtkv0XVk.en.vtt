 they have the greatest popularity of the 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.119
 industry but compared with delta six 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.119
 they are simple toys 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.390

 a controller that change the way 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.710
 play is a video game controller 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.520
 designed to duplicate the appearance of

 inventors but do not be fooled by 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.350
 your office room the sales of your 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.180
 controller avenger in 2010 you 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.390
 allowed to retire as a teacher of 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.390
 high school 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.579
 it's not just realism that is different 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.140
 of the other weapons is the operation 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.239
 to recharge the charger is touched to 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.640
 stabilize the weapon approaches the delta 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.259
 sex basically when you do this you do 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.520
 a sum in a sensor helps to use it looks 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.850
 who wanted me to taste the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.800
 controller we already have a mechanism that 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.820
 when you shoot it gives you the feeling of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.820
 what is really happening 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.410
 hawking and he came up with the idea of 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.210
 delta siex when his wife forced him to 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.520
 get rid of your real weapons 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.590
 stuart I started working on this 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.890
 add hearing aids and the feeling that 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.539
 satisfies the need to shoot 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.670
 he invested 50 thousand dollars of his own 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.800
 pocket to build prototypes and 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.319
 then he raised almost 200 thousand dollars in 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.470
 line to reproduce it in mass that 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.090
 your wife thinks of this if I have think 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.880
 which is an unpleasant nightmare 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.440
 terrible possibly because she knows 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.720
 that violent video games have 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.520
 attracted some notorious players according to 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.590
 the researchers the authors of the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.869
 shots of the tragedies in newton in 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.239
 virginia beach in norway and columbine 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.770
 they were fans of video games like this one 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.770
 but cat king does not think the same 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.000
 this can not harm anyone is a game 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.709
 electronic with a controller but it's 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.830
 training the player to shoot at 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.370
 someone is perhaps too realistic to 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.930
 Sometimes I wonder 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.600
 talking recognizes that the controller does not 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.620
 is for all especially children add 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.330
 that you have to ignore the critics 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.610
 I can not worry about other people 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 even my wife should I think how 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.450
 I can improve it while my sense of 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.739
 morality does not harm anyone I can live with 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.260
 it
