there's<00:00:21.699> always<00:00:21.820> this<00:00:22.060> problem<00:00:22.480> I<00:00:22.570> used<00:00:22.750> to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
there's always this problem I used to

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:23.999 
there's always this problem I used to
have<00:00:23.050> in<00:00:23.199> terms<00:00:23.349> of<00:00:23.500> not<00:00:23.619> getting<00:00:23.800> enough

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
have in terms of not getting enough

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.859 
have in terms of not getting enough
feedback<00:00:24.250> from<00:00:24.609> the<00:00:24.730> road<00:00:24.880> and<00:00:24.910> that<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.630> past

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
feedback from the road and that the past

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.290 
feedback from the road and that the past
sharing<00:00:26.199> was<00:00:26.320> just<00:00:26.529> too<00:00:26.710> light<00:00:26.920> and<00:00:27.300> almost

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
sharing was just too light and almost

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.269 
sharing was just too light and almost
too<00:00:28.599> responsive<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.740> car<00:00:29.919> suspension

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
too responsive and the car suspension

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.609 
too responsive and the car suspension
and<00:00:30.820> overall<00:00:31.119> feel<00:00:31.390> was<00:00:31.630> a<00:00:31.839> little<00:00:32.200> toy<00:00:32.349> like

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
and overall feel was a little toy like

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.319 
and overall feel was a little toy like
that<00:00:32.920> was<00:00:33.040> always<00:00:33.190> the<00:00:33.430> phrase<00:00:33.670> I<00:00:33.820> used<00:00:34.030> with

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
that was always the phrase I used with

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.300 
that was always the phrase I used with
this<00:00:34.540> car<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:35.110> also<00:00:35.410> with<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.740> Xena<00:00:35.950> steer<00:00:36.220> oh

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
this car and also with the Xena steer oh

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.910 
this car and also with the Xena steer oh
well<00:00:36.970> sadly<00:00:37.450> those<00:00:37.990> characteristics<00:00:38.710> come

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
well sadly those characteristics come

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.410 
well sadly those characteristics come
through<00:00:39.130> in<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.280> new<00:00:39.460> generation<00:00:39.970> as<00:00:40.150> well

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
through in the new generation as well

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.840 
through in the new generation as well
and<00:00:40.690> here's<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.440> reason<00:00:41.740> why<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:41.950> think<00:00:42.250> we<00:00:42.760> are

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
and here's the reason why I think we are

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.790 
and here's the reason why I think we are
being<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.120> little<00:00:43.360> bit<00:00:43.480> judgmental<00:00:44.260> when<00:00:44.650> we

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
being a little bit judgmental when we

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.340 
being a little bit judgmental when we
talk<00:00:45.400> about<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.850> car<00:00:46.030> in<00:00:46.240> that<00:00:46.390> respect<00:00:46.840> it's

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
talk about the car in that respect it's

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.710 
talk about the car in that respect it's
the<00:00:47.620> fact<00:00:48.430> that<00:00:48.520> this<00:00:48.700> is<00:00:48.850> being<00:00:49.060> compared<00:00:49.510> now

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
the fact that this is being compared now

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.970 
the fact that this is being compared now
you're<00:00:50.200> comparing<00:00:50.500> apples<00:00:50.650> and<00:00:50.860> oranges

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
you're comparing apples and oranges

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.860 
you're comparing apples and oranges
you're<00:00:51.310> comparing<00:00:51.670> this<00:00:51.880> to<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:52.090> car<00:00:52.300> like

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
you're comparing this to a car like

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.300 
you're comparing this to a car like
let's<00:00:53.530> say<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.740> Ford<00:00:53.950> Figo

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
let's say the Ford Figo

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.170 
let's say the Ford Figo
or<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:55.540> i-10<00:00:55.960> and<00:00:56.380> that<00:00:56.890> means<00:00:57.130> that<00:00:57.430> you're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
or the i-10 and that means that you're

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.610 
or the i-10 and that means that you're
always<00:00:58.360> going<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.720> find<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.140> this<00:00:59.320> doesn't

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
always going to find that this doesn't

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.110 
always going to find that this doesn't
come<00:00:59.950> up<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.370> mark<00:01:00.580> when<00:01:00.700> it<00:01:00.790> comes<00:01:00.970> to

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
come up to the mark when it comes to

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.060 
come up to the mark when it comes to
handling<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:01.960> when<00:01:02.080> it<00:01:02.200> comes<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.680> adjust<00:01:02.980> the

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
handling and when it comes to adjust the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.219 
handling and when it comes to adjust the
overall<00:01:03.250> drive<00:01:03.550> field<00:01:03.850> which<00:01:04.689> means<00:01:04.930> that

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
overall drive field which means that

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.320 
overall drive field which means that
this<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.439> a<00:01:05.530> good<00:01:05.680> city<00:01:05.979> runabout<00:01:06.340> in<00:01:06.880> Japan

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
this is a good city runabout in Japan

this is a good city runabout in Japan
too<00:01:07.600> that's<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.020> kind<00:01:08.200> of<00:01:08.259> proposition<00:01:08.830> a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
look at the power well it looks every

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.930 
look at the power well it looks every
bit<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.590> WagonR<00:01:49.010> because<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.460> reminds<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.909> of

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
bit the WagonR because it reminds you of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.240 
bit the WagonR because it reminds you of
the<00:01:50.000> old<00:01:50.090> one<00:01:50.390> overall<00:01:50.810> shape<00:01:51.020> size<00:01:51.350> looks

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
the old one overall shape size looks

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.250 
the old one overall shape size looks
just<00:01:52.490> like<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.729> bread<00:01:52.940> box<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.330> wheels<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
just like a bread box on wheels like the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.200 
just like a bread box on wheels like the
old<00:01:54.409> car<00:01:54.680> did<00:01:54.830> but<00:01:55.400> there<00:01:55.580> are<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.759> few<00:01:55.850> things

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
old car did but there are a few things

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.999 
old car did but there are a few things
that<00:01:56.479> are<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:57.080> little<00:01:57.290> bit<00:01:57.440> different<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:57.860> let's

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
that are a little bit different so let's

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.910 
that are a little bit different so let's
get<00:01:58.130> closer<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.520> it<00:02:02.110> it's<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.350> big<00:02:03.560> thick

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
get closer to it it's this big thick

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.800 
get closer to it it's this big thick

WagonR<00:02:06.259> weaved<00:02:06.740> into<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:07.880> feel<00:02:08.179> is<00:02:08.330> the

WagonR weaved into it that I feel is the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.999 
WagonR weaved into it that I feel is the
biggest<00:02:08.720> difference<00:02:09.170> between<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.619> old<00:02:09.770> car

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
biggest difference between the old car

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.990 
biggest difference between the old car
and<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:10.250> one<00:02:10.399> because<00:02:10.610> otherwise<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and this one because otherwise the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.120 
and this one because otherwise the
overall<00:02:11.239> shape<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.200> know<00:02:12.319> feel<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.890> just

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
overall shape and you know feel is just

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.070 
overall shape and you know feel is just
like<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.730> old<00:02:13.850> wagon<00:02:14.000> art<00:02:14.269> even<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.870> way<00:02:15.050> that

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
like the old wagon art even the way that

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.570 
like the old wagon art even the way that
a<00:02:15.380> lamb<00:02:15.560> cluster<00:02:15.920> has<00:02:15.980> been<00:02:16.160> done<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.550> a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
a lamb cluster has been done this is a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.009 
a lamb cluster has been done this is a
little<00:02:16.790> bit<00:02:16.880> grown-up<00:02:17.269> it's<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.570> little<00:02:17.810> bigger

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
little bit grown-up it's a little bigger

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.630 
little bit grown-up it's a little bigger
but<00:02:18.560> still<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.920> get<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.070> same<00:02:19.310> sort<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.580> a

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
but still you get the same sort of a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.310 
but still you get the same sort of a
style<00:02:19.880> impression<00:02:20.390> as<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.930> did<00:02:21.080> from<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
style impression as you did from the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.580 
style impression as you did from the
older<00:02:21.590> car<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.090> well<00:02:23.090> same<00:02:23.540> feel<00:02:24.110> carries<00:02:24.500> on

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590

older car and well same feel carries on
on<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.920> side<00:02:25.130> but<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.150> feeling<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.600> this

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
on to the side but the feeling of this

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.210 
on to the side but the feeling of this
being<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.170> taller<00:02:27.410> car<00:02:27.769> well<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.100> gets

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
being a taller car well it gets

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.070 
being a taller car well it gets
accentuated<00:02:29.000> when<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.150> stand<00:02:29.510> next<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:29.930> on

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
accentuated when you stand next to it on

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.050 
accentuated when you stand next to it on
the<00:02:30.170> side<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.769> is<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> pretty<00:02:31.190> tall<00:02:31.430> car<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.850> so

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
the side it is a pretty tall car and so

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.990 
the side it is a pretty tall car and so
the<00:02:32.390> quintessential<00:02:32.930> tall<00:02:33.320> boy<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.830> well<00:02:34.760> now

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
the quintessential tall boy is well now

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000 
the quintessential tall boy is well now
the<00:02:35.060> only<00:02:35.360> one<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.600> market<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.230> the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
the only one in the market like it the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.740 
the only one in the market like it the
roof<00:02:37.160> rail<00:02:37.400> helps<00:02:37.760> add<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.420> height<00:02:38.720> and

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
roof rail helps add to that height and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.660 
roof rail helps add to that height and
gives<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.530> little<00:02:39.560> bit<00:02:39.800> of<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.010> sporty<00:02:40.400> Flair

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
with otherwise very bland looking side

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.280 
with otherwise very bland looking side
what<00:02:42.890> helps<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.310> side<00:02:43.519> styling<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.290> this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
what helps the side styling is this

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.930 
what helps the side styling is this
little<00:02:45.680> wheel<00:02:46.130> arch<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.790> little
