00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
part that takes the bitmaps you create

with illustrator Arnold after effects
after<00:00:19.439> effect<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.750> pieces<00:00:21.750> them<00:00:21.930> together

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
after effect and pieces them together

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.720 
after effect and pieces them together
into<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.769> single<00:00:24.050> file<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> GUI

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
into a single file so this is a GUI

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.009 
into a single file so this is a GUI
version<00:00:27.029> instead<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.539> command<00:00:27.840> line

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
version instead of a command line

version right sweet can give us a
demonstration<00:00:30.119> sure<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:33.350> load<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.800> first

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
demonstration sure so load the first

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.290 
demonstration sure so load the first
found<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.820> sequence<00:00:37.790> few<00:00:38.790> smaller<00:00:39.090> icons

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
found the sequence few smaller icons

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
found the sequence few smaller icons
that<00:00:39.690> might<00:00:39.870> help<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.559> list<00:00:40.860> oh<00:00:43.640> so<00:00:44.640> you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
you working on over here testing the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.100 
you working on over here testing the
latest<00:01:33.700> version<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.149> this<00:01:34.240> code<00:01:34.479> did<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:34.929> work

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
latest version of this code did it work

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.200 
latest version of this code did it work
yeah<00:01:35.439> I<00:01:35.470> did<00:01:35.649> give<00:01:36.340> us<00:01:36.429> a<00:01:36.490> demonstration<00:01:36.610> fees

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
yeah I did give us a demonstration fees

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.840 
yeah I did give us a demonstration fees
so<00:01:37.719> after<00:01:37.929> all<00:01:38.259> three<00:01:38.469> are<00:01:38.649> lit<00:01:38.890> if<00:01:39.429> you<00:01:39.610> hit

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
so after all three are lit if you hit

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.700 
so after all three are lit if you hit
one<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.360> lights<00:01:40.659> it<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.110> then<00:01:41.200> when<00:01:41.380> it's<00:01:41.409> done

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
one it lights it and then when it's done

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.410 
one it lights it and then when it's done
with<00:01:41.950> what<00:01:42.130> would<00:01:42.280> be<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.549> blinking<00:01:42.939> section

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
with what would be the blinking section

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.410 
with what would be the blinking section
it<00:01:43.630> stays<00:01:44.049> like<00:01:44.350> okay<00:01:45.009> so<00:01:45.069> that<00:01:46.060> was<00:01:46.179> a<00:01:46.210> bug

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
it stays like okay so that was a bug

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.300 
it stays like okay so that was a bug
before<00:01:46.659> alright<00:01:47.259> so<00:01:47.439> if<00:01:47.530> you're<00:01:47.679> you<00:01:48.039> know<00:01:48.069> it

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
before alright so if you're you know it

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.919 
before alright so if you're you know it
could<00:01:48.490> because<00:01:48.939> before<00:01:49.240> when<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.509> complete

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
could because before when you complete

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.300 
could because before when you complete
him<00:01:50.049> they<00:01:50.170> blink<00:01:50.380> for<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.590> little<00:01:50.679> bit<00:01:50.920> but<00:01:51.189> they

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
him they blink for a little bit but they

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.230 
him they blink for a little bit but they
wouldn't<00:01:51.549> register<00:01:51.700> while<00:01:52.030> they<00:01:52.179> were

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
wouldn't register while they were

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.539 
wouldn't register while they were
blinking<00:01:52.479> right<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.679> would<00:01:53.829> reset<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.429> at

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
blinking right and it would reset it at

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.399 
blinking right and it would reset it at
the<00:01:54.579> end<00:01:54.819> to<00:01:55.119> would<00:01:55.479> clever<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.990> one<00:01:56.140> that<00:01:56.289> was

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
the end to would clever the one that was

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.109 
the end to would clever the one that was
here<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:56.890> now<00:01:57.009> if<00:01:57.220> it's<00:01:57.369> blinking<00:01:57.759> if<00:01:57.909> you<00:01:58.000> have

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
here so now if it's blinking if you have

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.490 
here so now if it's blinking if you have
one<00:01:58.329> it'll<00:01:58.569> stop<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.750> blinking<00:01:59.170> but<00:01:59.289> at<00:01:59.409> least

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
one it'll stop the blinking but at least

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.100 
one it'll stop the blinking but at least
it<00:01:59.679> works<00:01:59.890> right<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:01.179> stops<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.630> blinking<00:02:01.959> but

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
it works right it stops the blinking but

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.410 
it works right it stops the blinking but
it<00:02:02.259> saves<00:02:02.709> the<00:02:02.920> state<00:02:03.090> right<00:02:04.090> even<00:02:04.329> though

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
it saves the state right even though

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.880 
it saves the state right even though
it's<00:02:04.539> very<00:02:04.750> unlikely<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.590> get<00:02:05.709> a<00:02:05.739> normal

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
it's very unlikely that you get a normal

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.039 
it's very unlikely that you get a normal
another<00:02:06.369> one<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:06.610> fast<00:02:06.819> you<00:02:07.000> could<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.569> now

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
another one that fast you could and now

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.229 
another one that fast you could and now
it<00:02:08.200> handles<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.799> it<00:02:09.399> doesn't<00:02:09.700> handle<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.060> the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
it handles it it doesn't handle it the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.600 
it handles it it doesn't handle it the
best<00:02:10.450> but<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.750> handles<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.200> well<00:02:11.590> enough<00:02:11.890> it's

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
best but it handles it well enough it's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.009 
best but it handles it well enough it's
pin<00:02:12.819> Boyd<00:02:13.030> had<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.269> assume<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:13.630> everything

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
pin Boyd had to assume that everything

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.140 
pin Boyd had to assume that everything
that<00:02:14.290> could<00:02:14.380> happen<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.920> happen<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.519> will<00:02:15.910> oh

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
that could happen can happen and will oh

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.240 
that could happen can happen and will oh
this<00:02:16.630> tops<00:02:16.930> off<00:02:17.170> at<00:02:17.349> nine<00:02:17.530> x<00:02:17.829> that's<00:02:17.980> probably

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
this tops off at nine x that's probably

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.699 
this tops off at nine x that's probably
enough<00:02:18.459> right<00:02:18.730> yeah<00:02:19.299> that's<00:02:19.989> more<00:02:20.290> than<00:02:20.500> that

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
enough right yeah that's more than that

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.349 
enough right yeah that's more than that
cool<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.609> yeah<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:21.970> we're<00:02:22.090> doing<00:02:22.150> today

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
cool so yeah but we're doing today

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.699 
cool so yeah but we're doing today
basically<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.810> working<00:02:23.079> in<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.230> programming

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
basically is working in the programming

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.830

at the moment so far yes so which we

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.129 
at the moment so far yes so which we
clearly<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.489> think<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.790> ball<00:02:43.090> war<00:02:43.900> video
