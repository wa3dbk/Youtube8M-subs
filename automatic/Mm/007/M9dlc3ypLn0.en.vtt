00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
and forth and I'm not pushing I'm really

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.350 
and forth and I'm not pushing I'm really
just<00:06:09.390> doing<00:06:09.660> it<00:06:09.900> really<00:06:10.380> light

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.550 

then<00:06:17.360> I'll<00:06:17.479> tap<00:06:17.779> on<00:06:17.840> these<00:06:18.289> spots<00:06:20.319> blend<00:06:21.319> them

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
then I'll tap on these spots blend them

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:29.560 
then I'll tap on these spots blend them
in

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.620 

so<00:06:30.170> just<00:06:30.410> like<00:06:30.560> that<00:06:30.800> you<00:06:31.670> can<00:06:31.700> just<00:06:32.060> do<00:06:32.210> a

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
so just like that you can just do a

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.770 
so just like that you can just do a
little<00:06:33.620> more<00:06:33.830> blending<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:34.550> then<00:06:35.450> I'll<00:06:35.570> just

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
little more blending and then I'll just

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.920 
little more blending and then I'll just
add<00:06:35.960> my<00:06:36.560> powder<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:37.360> I'm<00:06:38.360> set<00:06:38.930> um<00:06:40.570> so<00:06:41.570> far<00:06:41.750> this

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
add my powder and I'm set um so far this

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.290 
add my powder and I'm set um so far this
has<00:06:41.990> taken<00:06:42.230> me<00:06:42.430> under<00:06:43.430> seven<00:06:43.850> minutes<00:06:43.880> so

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
has taken me under seven minutes so

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.060 
has taken me under seven minutes so
that's<00:06:44.930> not<00:06:45.170> bad<00:06:45.350> and<00:06:45.560> that's<00:06:45.800> with<00:06:45.950> me

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
that's not bad and that's with me

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.010 
that's not bad and that's with me
talking<00:06:46.310> to<00:06:46.640> if<00:06:46.820> I<00:06:46.910> wasn't<00:06:47.210> talking<00:06:47.570> I<00:06:47.780> would

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
talking to if I wasn't talking I would

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.980 
talking to if I wasn't talking I would
