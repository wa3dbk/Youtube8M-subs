00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.850 

I<00:02:24.360> think<00:02:25.360> outhouse<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.080> ultimate<00:02:26.500> test<00:02:26.710> of

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
I think outhouse is the ultimate test of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.860 
I think outhouse is the ultimate test of
endurance<00:02:27.130> because<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.940> really<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.720> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
endurance because it really is it's a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.380 
endurance because it really is it's a
definition<00:02:29.500> run<00:02:29.710> for<00:02:30.010> skiing<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.550> one<00:02:31.090> that

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
definition run for skiing it's one that

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.520 
definition run for skiing it's one that
if<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.900> ski<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.350> from<00:02:32.830> top<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.070> bottom<00:02:34.530> there's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
if you ski it from top to bottom there's

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:48.760 
if you ski it from top to bottom there's
nothing<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.220> it's<00:02:37.150> an<00:02:37.210> accomplishment
