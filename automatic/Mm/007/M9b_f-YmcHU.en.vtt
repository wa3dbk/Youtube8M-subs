 a video and maybe it does not appear here is 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.430
 very common a rare game of 26 and even 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.189
 adults also almost in association with 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.110
 alcoholic beverage and party fun 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.090
 that today it would not have 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.630
 how to have fun without alcohol and 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.000
 such 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.509
 it is as if alcohol were the factor 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.180
 stop fun but you do not know that the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.670
 alcohol is not at all healthy but the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.789
 harmful it is for those who train for 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.950
 who does bodybuilding ocorro there may ii 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.269
 be to this group of people 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.950
 I'll start talking about good plan 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.840
 simple that I 'm not chicken the presence 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.030
 of our body presents when people 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.890
 generates a considerable amount of alcohol 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.870
 It was dehydration 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.010
 we know that young muscles are 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.140
 formed 70% consider practically 0% 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.299
 and we also know that water has 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.420
 a key role in building 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.780
 muscle while you are drinking in your 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.579
 body to work much more to 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.890
 filtering the toxins seems to be 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.709
 something a bit more acceptable because 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.079
 body your body there and water too 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.470
 is present in this process is water 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.270
 who is responsible 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.970
 these toxins that I spoke about and 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.960
 replacement of the books that is spent in this 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.600
 process there 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.970
 that is today the presence of large 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.270
 quantities of water to be filtered 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.520
 brown and all this process already 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.320
 causes a dehydration fruit and if water 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.660
 so well is the mass gain 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.570
 Muscle stay treaty is the same 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.670
 that you have one of that process ie you 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.830
 Are you drinking? Are you sabotaging? 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.780
 approaching your earnings and now has a 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.160
 second problem is that it is a bit more 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.830
 aimed at those who want to learn and 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.620
 pedro ken is an evidence of mass 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.000
 muscle that is something more defined drink 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.620
 alcoholic is caloric for old man 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.450
 exactly is not only to take the ones that you 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.840
 covers when you're drinking in the bar 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.310
 There you make me fat not the album. 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.370
 debt can be to have a 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.620
 fundamental in this pochettino stay in 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.140
 Get your kick out of it , if we were 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.220
 put on an equal table with the protein 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.050
 fat 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.450
 alcohol would only lose to fat with 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.370
 two calorie difference because every 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.980
 gram of alcohol responds to seven calories 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.290
 with more or less heat while the 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.720
 fats go away then just do the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.050
 accounts and is each about 200 ml being 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.880
 virgin and over 10 to 14 grams 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.550
 alcohol and there are lots of people who take pride in 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.680
 For three or four editions, he's 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.330
 alone it is only you can see the accounts of 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.300
 how much each person harming them 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.609
 still exuding pride the baby alone 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.410
 this infinite amount of high then 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.660
 these two problems I quoted here 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.690
 were only to illustrate and show that the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.460
 Alcohol is rather harmful to anyone 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.790
 have expressive results in bodybuilding 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.590
 for those who really want to have results 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.780
 big on bodybuilding but these two there 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.390
 were just to illustrate among them have 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.790
 decreased cide protein increased 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.010
 cortisol decrease tirone managers has 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.200
 a host of other ills that 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.820
 alcoholic beverage can bring not only 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.520
 who trains but like anyone 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.220
 normal is obvious if you can control 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.320
 and know how to measure and not make an article 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.810
 site every weekend and filled the 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.850
 face is not that it will not hurt you that 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.250
 in that case and if you knew a lot there 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.010
 does a little less harm to 10 and can 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.110
 take away the people from that old saying 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.840
 different 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.820
 If I worship the remedy it is only the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.760
 amount in the case of the social 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.070

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.140
 a glass or will not be at all the end of the 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.610
 world but if you want to have results 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.270
 expressive you'll have to 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.130
 around and reconcile the 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.570
 bodybuilding with alcoholic beverage is a 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.610
