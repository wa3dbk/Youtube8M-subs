definitely think that it doesn't look so
much<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.170> family<00:00:31.439> vehicle<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.859> anymore

kind<00:00:34.229> of<00:00:34.260> mines<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> sports<00:00:35.100> car<00:00:35.370> which

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
kind of mines we have a sports car which

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.029 
kind of mines we have a sports car which
I<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.389> love<00:00:36.629> also<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> lights<00:00:37.889> are<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
I really love also the lights are a

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.229 
I really love also the lights are a
little<00:00:38.190> different<00:00:38.429> too<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:38.999> what<00:00:39.089> I<00:00:39.149> can

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
little different too from what I can

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.059 
little different too from what I can
tell<00:00:39.299> from<00:00:39.569> the<00:00:39.690> previous<00:00:40.049> Camrys<00:00:40.499> and<00:00:40.769> I

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:41.069 
tell from the previous Camrys and I

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:42.049

edgy<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.139> looking<00:00:43.319> at<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> side<00:00:43.769> view<00:00:43.799> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
edgy so just looking at the side view of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
another thing I have to say is it's not

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
another thing I have to say is it's not
like<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.850> spending<00:01:18.359> an<00:01:18.539> arm<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.079> a<00:01:19.170> leg

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
like you're spending an arm and a leg

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.649 
like you're spending an arm and a leg
words<00:01:19.859> of<00:01:20.009> money<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.450> expensive

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
words of money so not that expensive

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.240 
words of money so not that expensive
they<00:01:21.929> actually<00:01:22.229> dropped<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.710> rates<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.130> these

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
they actually dropped the rates on these

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.859 
they actually dropped the rates on these
newer<00:01:23.549> vehicles<00:01:24.000> compared<00:01:24.329> to<00:01:24.390> last<00:01:24.570> year's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
newer vehicles compared to last year's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.590

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.980 
so looking at the interior of the car
everything<00:01:28.170> seems<00:01:28.530> pretty<00:01:28.799> basic<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:30.090> work

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
