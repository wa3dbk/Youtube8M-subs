00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 uli forte is extremely demanded more permanent 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.319
 Changes especially in defense and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.780
 poor efficiency in the financial statements 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.440
 make him and the young boys 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 create 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 even today he has three u21 players 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.699
 use 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.760
 due to locks and injuries 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.220
 the first minute of the game the first attack 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.260
 and what kind of one 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.810
 Delicate prevails against politically 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.849
 and finds his master in david 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.270
 There would still be evidence of this 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.270
 Usage on the subject of efficiency would be here 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.070
 and that is the first attack of the home 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 clubs extended to lezcano 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.700
 he successfully fights with the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.239
 18-year-old dear defender wronged 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.050
 but is there and it is 1 0 for the fc 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.710
 lucerne 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:01.430
 That's the efficiency you can miss 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.320
 no offside when playing gothic and 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.659
 routine is here against 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.260
 Inexperience benefited by Karaba 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.200
 from that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.360
 this is the decisive duel lescano 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.360
 continues through oncoming traffic 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.680
 fc sports director alex free and his 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.890
 former game partner hakan yakin see 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.140
 a varied beginning nuzzolo 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.880
 drives the ball forward left to the outside 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.439
 like to use me again freely 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.220
 fails at tingling and also costanzo 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.220
 stays without success 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.490
 yes michael frey but forgives the big one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.710
 balancing chance 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.710
 next scene free kick lucerne with busses 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.030
 the 19 year old betrayed Mattli brings the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.560
 do not stop at wölfli all this 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.450
 plays in the first quarter of an hour 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.680
 the party entertaining especially for 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.680
 the fans of the Lucerne 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.239
 After that, it will be a bit quieter on the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.720
 but not enough for the guests 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.720
 trainers 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:25.130
 Do the oncoming debris afterwards 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.010
 he more for the game than the lucerne 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.720
 a good and successful combination with 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.720
 the conclusion of michael frey 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.140
 but really fun at the game has stood 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.750
 especially alex free on the go 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.430
 second half time 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.930
 free from renggli after this foul 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.560
 after a few seconds free kick for 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.130
 costanzo 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.290
 then users from the rotation immediately 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.060
 again a chance for the guests from the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.860
 Capital 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.710
 The Bernese continue to do a lot 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.710
 effort must be a lot of effort 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.959
 michael frey then alexander gerndt but 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.739
 that's too harmless like to stay so far 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.360
 under his possibilities 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.110
 Michael Frey, on the other hand, is very much 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.569
 on road 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.650
 he sees costanzo and his shot 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.330
 tingling in the corner 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.569
 the next possibility for the young 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.380
 boys at the opportunities change the guests 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.380
 really not 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.810
 the Lucerne people have less 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.470
 game parts but you have cables 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.019
 he is relocated by the following penalty for the fc 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.670
 lucerne 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.370
 he is quite naive shortly before 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.569
 Substitutes to the work of the penalty 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.569
 decision is correct 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.019
 his current league goalie remains 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.360
 winner and also darabos after 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.310
 shot option wind not be that way 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.319
 strong the parade of wölfli was the 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.040
 The penalty from boss united was weak 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.590
 shot 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.200
 bernecker fc lucerne forgives this 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.180
 possibly decisive 2 0 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.729
 and that's how the young boys stay 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.039
 Everything in the field has something in the game 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.519
 them for the offensive for disposal 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.670
 stands 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:29.530
 but then too happy ball and 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:33.550
 michael frey because that's in the 85 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.680
 minute of salvation by michael frey 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.660
 himself thus for a strong one 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:44.950
 rewarded lot but now reacted fc 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.760
 lucerne again with adrian winter and 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.310
 lezcano 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.410
 the rebound is previously were the 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.540
 High-level language but that makes the bill 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:59.110
 without marco wölfli point sharing between 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.760
 Lucas and ideas about the number of actions 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.570
 I could have been through the Bernese 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.090
 increase 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.920
 but I think that in the whole thing 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.710
 One has 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.690
 the results are okay that's great 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.640
 This is great time for morality 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.590
 from the team for the character 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.540
 probably the team is and that is great 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.910
 me especially after standpoint where 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.830
 of course you dance with names but that 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.450
 is the whole positive sign and if 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.530
 you are like the night of rest 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:34.230
 Krampfer does 401 points so a good one 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.230
 point for uli forte and the plant
