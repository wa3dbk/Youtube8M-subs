00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.760 

we'll<00:00:01.110> talk<00:00:01.319> about<00:00:02.000> as<00:00:03.000> far<00:00:03.300> as<00:00:03.560> systems<00:00:04.560> go

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
we'll talk about as far as systems go

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.030 
we'll talk about as far as systems go
being<00:00:05.100> able<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.430> have<00:00:06.390> control<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
being able to have control of the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.230 
being able to have control of the
engines<00:00:08.870> obviously<00:00:10.820> they're<00:00:11.820> set<00:00:12.090> up<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.269> run

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
engines obviously they're set up to run

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.960 
engines obviously they're set up to run
so<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.199> aircraft<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.920> set<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.490> such<00:00:17.520> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
so that the aircraft is set up in such a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.510 
so that the aircraft is set up in such a
way<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.539> engines<00:00:19.010> are<00:00:20.010> trying<00:00:20.400> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
way that the engines are trying to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.779 
way that the engines are trying to
maintain<00:00:20.750> 100%<00:00:22.039> rpm<00:00:23.480> which<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.830> 264<00:00:25.830> alright

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
maintain 100% rpm which is 264 alright

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.250 
maintain 100% rpm which is 264 alright
that's<00:00:27.029> equals<00:00:27.539> 100%<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.529> far<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:30.260> movement

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that's equals 100% as far as movement

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.120 
that's equals 100% as far as movement
goes<00:00:32.090> if<00:00:33.090> one<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> engines<00:00:33.840> rolls<00:00:34.079> back<00:00:34.500> we

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
goes if one of the engines rolls back we

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.940 
goes if one of the engines rolls back we
need<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.489> able<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:36.059> control<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.750> based<00:00:37.620> on

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
need to be able to control that based on

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.049 
need to be able to control that based on
fuel<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.850> take

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
fuel so what we can do is we can take

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.979 
fuel so what we can do is we can take
manual<00:00:42.420> control<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.920> engines<00:00:44.510> by<00:00:45.510> arming

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
manual control of the engines by arming

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.100 
manual control of the engines by arming
the<00:00:46.170> manual<00:00:46.860> trim<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:48.480> use<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.870> two

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the manual trim and we use these two

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.000 
the manual trim and we use these two
rocker<00:00:49.379> switches<00:00:49.850> basically<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.120> tell<00:00:52.010> small

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
rocker switches basically to tell small

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.000 
rocker switches basically to tell small
computers<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.210> back<00:00:54.390> how<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.050> program<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
computers in the back how to program the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
computers in the back how to program the
fuel<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.730> particular<00:00:57.090> engine<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:59.030> once

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
fuel for that particular engine so once

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.500 
fuel for that particular engine so once
we<00:01:00.210> take<00:01:00.239> control<00:01:01.609> for<00:01:02.609> lack<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.359> better

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
we take control for lack of a better

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
we take control for lack of a better
term<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.290> collective<00:01:04.799> isn't<00:01:05.159> part<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.430> our

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
term the collective isn't part of our

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:21.639 
term the collective isn't part of our
throttle<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:07.310> once<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.490> arm<00:01:09.119> manual<00:01:10.080> trend

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.010 

once<00:01:22.649> we<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.950> manual<00:01:23.429> trim<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.420> computer

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
once we are manual trim the computer

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.010 
once we are manual trim the computer
knows<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.740> disregard<00:01:26.270> how<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.329> move<00:01:27.810> our

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
knows to disregard how we move our

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.249 
knows to disregard how we move our
throttle<00:01:28.490> all<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.789> wants<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.179> know<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
throttle all that wants to know is you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.039 
throttle all that wants to know is you
tell<00:01:31.530> me<00:01:31.710> where<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.920> set<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.850> fuel<00:01:33.149> based<00:01:33.780> on

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
tell me where to set the fuel based on

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
tell me where to set the fuel based on
these<00:01:34.829> rocker<00:01:35.159> switches<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.119> will

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
these rocker switches and it will

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.740 
these rocker switches and it will
program<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.200> fuel<00:01:38.009> controls<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.909> maintain

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
program the fuel controls to maintain

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080 
program the fuel controls to maintain
what<00:01:40.469> we<00:01:40.649> needed<00:01:40.859> to<00:01:41.009> maintain<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.759> keep<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
what we needed to maintain to keep the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
what we needed to maintain to keep the
aircraft<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.020> control<00:01:43.349> as<00:01:43.530> far<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
aircraft and control as far as the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.779 
aircraft and control as far as the
engines<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.429> concerned<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:46.310> this<00:01:47.780> system

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
engines are concerned so this system

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.130 
engines are concerned so this system
that<00:01:50.789> was<00:01:51.000> set<00:01:51.179> up<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.539> that<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.780> could<00:01:51.959> have

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that was set up so that we could have

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.979 
that was set up so that we could have
manual<00:01:52.739> control<00:01:53.060> over<00:01:54.060> each<00:01:54.209> engine<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.780> case

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 
manual control over each engine in case

00:01:54.989 --> 00:02:05.530 
manual control over each engine in case
that<00:01:55.289> it<00:01:55.679> went<00:01:55.920> offline

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.750 

this<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.720> our<00:02:06.869> CD<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.130> a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.449 

all-purpose<00:02:11.959> display<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.709> can<00:02:13.740> program<00:02:14.220> our

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
all-purpose display we can program our

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.570 
all-purpose display we can program our
radios<00:02:15.319> GPS<00:02:16.319> gives<00:02:16.980> us<00:02:17.220> engine<00:02:18.080> information

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
radios GPS gives us engine information

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.910 
radios GPS gives us engine information
digitally<00:02:20.840> not<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.200> with<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.530> analog

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
digitally not just with the analog

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.699 
digitally not just with the analog
gauges<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.569> digital<00:02:25.020> readout<00:02:25.260> from

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
gauges but with a digital readout from

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.300 
gauges but with a digital readout from
each<00:02:25.830> engine<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:27.209> well<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:29.010> kind<00:02:29.220> of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
each engine as well so we can kind of

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.140 
each engine as well so we can kind of
monitor<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> engines<00:02:30.900> are<00:02:31.050> doing<00:02:32.150> with

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
monitor what the engines are doing with

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.949 
monitor what the engines are doing with
this<00:02:33.360> with<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.290> setup<00:02:34.560> as<00:02:34.890> well<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.780> all

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
this with this setup as well so all

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.259 
this with this setup as well so all
basically<00:02:37.560> all<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.860> our<00:02:38.010> avionics<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.940> far<00:02:39.180> as

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
basically all of our avionics as far as

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.740 
basically all of our avionics as far as
communications<00:02:40.140> navigation<00:02:40.739> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
communications navigation and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.000 
communications navigation and
maintenance<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> aircraft<00:02:43.290> can<00:02:43.890> be

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
maintenance of the aircraft can be

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.590 
maintenance of the aircraft can be
accessed<00:02:44.550> with<00:02:44.760> these<00:02:45.080> these<00:02:46.080> displays
