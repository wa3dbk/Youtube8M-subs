00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
best of both worlds where I can have a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
best of both worlds where I can have a
tablet<00:00:50.789> without<00:00:51.329> being<00:00:51.719> tied<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.170> an<00:00:52.260> external

lugging with me and the other cool thing

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.830 
lugging with me and the other cool thing
is<00:00:55.860> either<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.270> cool<00:00:57.600> little

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
is either you can use this cool little

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.380 
is either you can use this cool little
pin<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.590> called<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> Pogo<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> comes<00:01:00.090> in

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
pin it's called the Pogo it comes in

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.619 
pin it's called the Pogo it comes in
this<00:01:00.570> fantastic<00:01:01.320> pink<00:01:01.859> color<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:02.370> silver<00:01:02.820> or

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
this fantastic pink color or silver or

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.770 
this fantastic pink color or silver or
you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.989> use<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.199> finger<00:01:05.299> but<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.570> pretty

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
you can use your finger but it's pretty

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
you can use your finger but it's pretty
cool<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.710> pressure<00:01:07.950> sensitive<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
cool and it's pressure sensitive so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300 
cool and it's pressure sensitive so
it'll<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.150> thin<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.659> thick<00:01:09.689> lines<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:11.100> let's

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it'll do thin to thick lines but let's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.190 
it'll do thin to thick lines but let's
go<00:01:11.610> ahead<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.210> let<00:01:12.869> me<00:01:12.900> show<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
go ahead and let me show you so the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
go ahead and let me show you so the
first<00:01:16.229> thing<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.009> works<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.369> quite<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> few

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
first thing is it works in quite a few

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.700 
first thing is it works in quite a few
different<00:01:18.210> programs<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
different programs the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190 
different programs the
pressure-sensitive<00:01:20.220> though<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.570> only<00:01:21.900> have

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
pressure-sensitive though I only have

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.080 
pressure-sensitive though I only have
the<00:01:22.380> cs3<00:01:22.890> version<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> Photoshop<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.939> guess

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the cs3 version of Photoshop and I guess

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
the cs3 version of Photoshop and I guess
the<00:01:24.240> pressure-sensitive<00:01:24.630> doesn't<00:01:25.560> show<00:01:25.710> up

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the pressure-sensitive doesn't show up

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.410 
the pressure-sensitive doesn't show up
there<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> show<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.240> looks

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
there but I can show you what it looks

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.410 
there but I can show you what it looks
like<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.409> Photoshop<00:01:28.890> document<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.579> have

like in a Photoshop document so I have
it<00:01:33.540> set<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:34.619> ahead<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.040> toggle<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.820> using

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it set to go ahead and toggle with using

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.289 
it set to go ahead and toggle with using
a<00:01:36.930> tap<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> corner<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.189> trackpad<00:01:38.430> so

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.280 
to do it temporarily you can help it hit
the<00:01:59.340> tilde<00:01:59.759> key<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.840> go<00:02:00.960> choose

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the tilde key and then I can go choose

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.800 
the tilde key and then I can go choose
like<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> paintbrush<00:02:02.159> I've<00:02:02.579> got<00:02:02.759> blue<00:02:03.090> selected

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
like a paintbrush I've got blue selected

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.520 
like a paintbrush I've got blue selected
so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.340 
so
see<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.180> pressure-sensitive<00:02:07.049> so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
see you just it's pressure-sensitive so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.180 
see you just it's pressure-sensitive so
let's<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.650> here

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
let's see here

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249 
let's see here
it's<00:02:08.490> not<00:02:08.729> doing<00:02:09.090> my<00:02:09.240> thick<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.750> thin<00:02:09.780> lines

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it's not doing my thick to thin lines

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
it's not doing my thick to thin lines
it's<00:02:10.830> basically<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.280> sticking<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.819> with

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
it's basically just sticking with with

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.770 
it's basically just sticking with with
the<00:02:12.330> same<00:02:12.600> with<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.620> brush<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.790> selected<00:02:15.240> so

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the same with a brush that I selected so

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.880 
the same with a brush that I selected so
let's<00:02:15.810> go<00:02:16.050> ahead<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.230> show<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.530> what<00:02:16.800> it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
let's go ahead and show you what it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.100 
let's go ahead and show you what it
looks<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.660> an<00:02:19.010> acorn<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:21.600> corns<00:02:21.900> one<00:02:22.020> of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
looks like in an acorn it corns one of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.350 
looks like in an acorn it corns one of
those<00:02:22.200> apps<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.680> got<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.730> Mac<00:02:24.120> heist

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
those apps that I got in a Mac heist

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.420 
those apps that I got in a Mac heist
bundle<00:02:24.780> last<00:02:24.959> year<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.470> actually<00:02:25.709> had<00:02:26.160> not

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
bundle last year and I actually had not

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.960 
bundle last year and I actually had not
opened<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.090> until<00:02:27.930> today<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.660> let's<00:02:30.660> say<00:02:31.970> now

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
opened it until today so let's say now

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.880 
opened it until today so let's say now
you'll<00:02:33.239> see<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.510> my<00:02:33.900> selection<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.410> really

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
you'll see that my selection is really

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.270 
you'll see that my selection is really
big<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:36.150> let's<00:02:36.180> make<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.510> smaller<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.380> let's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
big so let's make it smaller and let's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.710 
big so let's make it smaller and let's
move<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.640> around<00:02:38.700> each<00:02:39.000> step<00:02:39.300> or<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.570> that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
move it around each step or do that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.340 
move it around each step or do that
command<00:02:40.019> Z<00:02:40.200> okay<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.269> pink<00:02:42.750> selected

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
command Z okay so I have pink selected

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.770 
command Z okay so I have pink selected
and<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.340> move<00:02:44.610> lightly<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.360> moves<00:02:45.600> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
and if I just move lightly it moves the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.449 
and if I just move lightly it moves the
cursor<00:02:45.989> but<00:02:46.709> with<00:02:46.800> just<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.010> little<00:02:47.130> bit<00:02:47.280> of

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
cursor but with just a little bit of

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.300 
cursor but with just a little bit of
pressure<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.350> this<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.620> see<00:02:49.830> if<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.069> do<00:02:50.130> it

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
pressure and this you can see if I do it

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.509 
pressure and this you can see if I do it
lighter<00:02:50.550> it's<00:02:50.819> smaller<00:02:52.340> heavier<00:02:53.340> it's

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
lighter it's smaller heavier it's

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.240 
lighter it's smaller heavier it's
thicker<00:02:54.110> now<00:02:55.110> if<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.260> was<00:02:55.410> really<00:02:55.680> artistic<00:02:56.010> I'd

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
thicker now if I was really artistic I'd

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.320 
thicker now if I was really artistic I'd
do<00:02:56.340> something<00:02:56.550> really<00:02:56.700> cool<00:02:56.910> for<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.150> guys

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
do something really cool for you guys

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.559 
do something really cool for you guys
but<00:02:57.650> there's<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.709> reason<00:02:59.160> I'm<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.610> geek<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.510> do

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
but there's a reason I'm a geek and I do

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.540 
but there's a reason I'm a geek and I do
computer<00:03:01.080> stuff<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:04.019> toggle<00:03:04.980> change

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
computer stuff and it's a toggle change

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:14.160 
computer stuff and it's a toggle change
colors

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.200 

pretty<00:03:15.170> cool<00:03:15.460> so<00:03:16.460> I<00:03:16.490> actually<00:03:16.670> have<00:03:16.940> another

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
pretty cool so I actually have another

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.080 
pretty cool so I actually have another
program<00:03:17.510> that's<00:03:18.470> really<00:03:18.830> artistic<00:03:19.460> if<00:03:19.790> any<00:03:19.940> of

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
program that's really artistic if any of

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.250 
program that's really artistic if any of
you<00:03:20.240> guys<00:03:20.390> are<00:03:24.160> real<00:03:25.160> artistic<00:03:25.520> I<00:03:25.820> guess<00:03:25.970> huh

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
you guys are real artistic I guess huh

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.380 
you guys are real artistic I guess huh
so<00:03:27.260> let's<00:03:27.560> see<00:03:27.740> let's<00:03:27.770> start<00:03:28.250> with<00:03:28.490> a<00:03:29.090> nice

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
so let's see let's start with a nice

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.750 
so let's see let's start with a nice
blue<00:03:29.960> color<00:03:30.260> let's<00:03:30.920> toggle<00:03:31.190> this<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.610> going

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
blue color let's toggle this it's going

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.660 
blue color let's toggle this it's going
to<00:03:31.820> make<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.120> bigger<00:03:32.830> move<00:03:33.830> it<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.280> fingers

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
to make it bigger move it to fingers

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.240 
to make it bigger move it to fingers
slides<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.120> around<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.680> program<00:03:36.980> is

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
slides it around so this program is

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.250 
slides it around so this program is
pretty<00:03:37.400> cool<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:37.970> if<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.240> notice<00:03:38.540> as<00:03:38.960> I'm

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
pretty cool and if you notice as I'm

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.500 
pretty cool and if you notice as I'm
twirling<00:03:39.740> around<00:03:39.860> if<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.910> can<00:03:40.940> still<00:03:41.300> little

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
twirling around if you can still little

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.360 
twirling around if you can still little
oval<00:03:41.840> that's<00:03:42.170> my<00:03:42.320> brush<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.040> twirling

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
oval that's my brush and it's twirling

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.410 
oval that's my brush and it's twirling
around<00:03:43.460> too<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:43.940> now<00:03:44.000> I'm<00:03:44.060> going<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.270> go<00:03:44.330> ahead

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
around too so now I'm going to go ahead

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.840 
around too so now I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:44.600> add<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> little<00:03:44.840> pressure<00:03:48.520> look<00:03:49.520> at<00:03:49.670> you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
and add a little pressure look at you

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.420 
and add a little pressure look at you
can<00:03:49.970> see<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.380> does<00:03:51.620> like<00:03:51.800> real<00:03:52.100> paint

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
can see and it does like real paint

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.750 
can see and it does like real paint
swipes<00:03:53.590> there<00:03:54.590> stays<00:03:54.920> when<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.190> wish<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.610> could

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
swipes there stays when I wish I could

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.310 
swipes there stays when I wish I could
actually<00:03:55.970> paint<00:03:56.390> because<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:56.990> would<00:03:57.140> be<00:03:57.290> a

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
actually paint because this would be a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.390 
actually paint because this would be a
lot<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.620> fun<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:59.800> program<00:04:00.800> is<00:04:00.920> called<00:04:01.070> art

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
lot of fun this program is called art

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.670 
lot of fun this program is called art
rage<00:04:01.700> -<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.690> it's<00:04:02.810> not<00:04:02.959> very<00:04:03.170> expensive<00:04:03.200> I

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
rage - and it's not very expensive I

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.840 
rage - and it's not very expensive I
think<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:03.890> was<00:04:03.980> like<00:04:04.130> thirty<00:04:04.370> five<00:04:04.430> forty

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
think it was like thirty five forty

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.060 
think it was like thirty five forty
dollars<00:04:05.330> but<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.290> things<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.650> does<00:04:06.800> it's
