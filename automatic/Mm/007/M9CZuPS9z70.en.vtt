Nintendo characters are having an
argument<00:01:41.610> about<00:01:41.670> who<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> biggest

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
argument about who is the biggest

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
argument about who is the biggest
superstar<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.530> essentially<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.189> decide<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
superstar so essentially they decide to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.670 
superstar so essentially they decide to
battle<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> game<00:01:45.659> there's<00:01:46.470> really

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
battle it out on the game there's really

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.109 
battle it out on the game there's really
nothing<00:01:47.070> more<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> than<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> be

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
nothing more to it than that and to be

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
nothing more to it than that and to be
honest<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.869> hardly<00:01:49.140> an<00:01:49.290> RPG<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
honest this is hardly an RPG so it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.219 
honest this is hardly an RPG so it
doesn't<00:01:50.310> need<00:01:50.399> much<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> backstory<00:01:51.229> anyway

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
doesn't need much of a backstory anyway

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.620 
doesn't need much of a backstory anyway
I<00:01:52.409> digress<00:01:52.619> back<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> game<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.390> also

tons of them there are over 15 total in
the<00:01:59.040> game<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> they<00:01:59.790> range<00:01:59.969> from<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.390> player

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
