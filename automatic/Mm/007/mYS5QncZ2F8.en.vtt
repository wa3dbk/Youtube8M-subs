hi I'm Jan and I'm rye and we're

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.940 
hi I'm Jan and I'm rye and we're
designing<00:00:02.730> dishes<00:00:03.330> today<00:00:03.959> we're<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.620> be

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
designing dishes today we're going to be

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.930 
designing dishes today we're going to be
making<00:00:05.310> flat<00:00:06.150> or<00:00:06.569> butterfly<00:00:07.379> or<00:00:07.940> marinated

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
making flat or butterfly or marinated

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.400 
making flat or butterfly or marinated
grilled<00:00:09.059> chicken<00:00:09.599> we're<00:00:09.929> going<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.200> be<00:00:10.290> doing

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
grilled chicken we're going to be doing

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.520 
grilled chicken we're going to be doing
this<00:00:10.679> on<00:00:10.860> outside<00:00:11.400> grill<00:00:11.840> but<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.049> think<00:00:13.110> what's

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
this on outside grill but I think what's

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.480 
this on outside grill but I think what's
important<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.429> that<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.690> know<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.490> chicken

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
important is that you know that chicken

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.920 
important is that you know that chicken
a<00:00:17.730> whole<00:00:18.029> chicken<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.510> sometimes<00:00:18.840> very

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
a whole chicken is sometimes very

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.599 
a whole chicken is sometimes very
difficult<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.680> cook<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.250> why<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.460> that

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
difficult to cook and why is that

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.750 
difficult to cook and why is that
running<00:00:21.090> because<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:22.320> breast<00:00:22.769> usually<00:00:23.519> will

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
running because the breast usually will

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.359 
running because the breast usually will
get<00:00:23.910> done<00:00:24.119> before<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:25.199> dark<00:00:25.439> meat<00:00:25.680> know<00:00:26.130> what

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
get done before the dark meat know what

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.529 
get done before the dark meat know what
can<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.029> doing<00:00:27.240> today<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
can we what are we doing today to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.660 
can we what are we doing today to
prevent<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.410> well<00:00:28.890> we're<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.340> take

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
prevent that well we're going to take

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.020 
prevent that well we're going to take
the<00:00:29.849> backbone<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> chicken<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.030> so

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the backbone out of the chicken and so

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.760 
the backbone out of the chicken and so
will<00:00:33.210> turn<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> over<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.590> I've

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
will turn it over and you can see I've

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.260 
will turn it over and you can see I've
actually<00:00:35.010> already<00:00:35.280> started<00:00:35.760> cutting<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.180> out

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
actually already started cutting it out

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.580 
actually already started cutting it out
but<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> matter<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.110> taking<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but it's just a matter of taking the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.930 
but it's just a matter of taking the
kitchen<00:00:37.920> shares<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.430> cutting<00:00:38.670> down<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
kitchen shares and cutting down the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.630 
kitchen shares and cutting down the
backbone<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.370> for

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
backbone and what that's going to do for

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
backbone and what that's going to do for
us<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:42.450> we'll<00:00:42.570> flatten<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.020> chicken<00:00:43.320> out

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
us then we'll flatten the chicken out

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.400 
us then we'll flatten the chicken out
our<00:00:43.770> butterfly<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.520> open<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.120> basically<00:00:45.870> then

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
our butterfly it open and basically then

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.569 
our butterfly it open and basically then
the<00:00:46.530> chicken<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> cook<00:00:47.250> evenly

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the chicken is going to cook evenly

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
the chicken is going to cook evenly
because<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.149> exposed<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> heat<00:00:49.110> evenly

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
because it's exposed to the heat evenly

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.319 
because it's exposed to the heat evenly
it's<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> top<00:00:50.489> has<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:50.940> heater<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
it's not the top has more heater the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.500 
it's not the top has more heater the
bottom<00:00:51.629> has<00:00:51.809> less<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.289> whatever<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.510> we're

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
bottom has less or whatever so we're

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
bottom has less or whatever so we're
going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> marinade<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.530> okay<00:00:56.399> what

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
by putting it under the skin Ronnie I

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.560

think that's a very good idea because

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.240 
think that's a very good idea because
that<00:03:16.810> gets<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.109> flea<00:03:17.350> go<00:03:17.530> right<00:03:17.799> next<00:03:18.130> to
