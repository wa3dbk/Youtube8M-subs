00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.590 

okay<00:00:00.870> I've<00:00:01.050> hemmed<00:00:01.410> both<00:00:01.829> my<00:00:02.070> seams<00:00:02.520> so<00:00:03.240> the

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
okay I've hemmed both my seams so the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.390 
okay I've hemmed both my seams so the
one<00:00:03.750> that<00:00:03.929> needs<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.259> go<00:00:04.380> on<00:00:04.529> first<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.310> if

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
one that needs to go on first and if

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.920 
one that needs to go on first and if
you're<00:00:05.549> using<00:00:05.730> material<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.600> matters

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
you're using material that it matters

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.780 
you're using material that it matters
which<00:00:07.200> side<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.680> use<00:00:07.890> make<00:00:08.130> sure<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
which side you use make sure that the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.660 
which side you use make sure that the
right<00:00:09.480> sides<00:00:09.870> are<00:00:10.349> both<00:00:10.860> facing<00:00:11.370> each<00:00:11.490> other

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
right sides are both facing each other

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.310 
right sides are both facing each other
like<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.660> would<00:00:12.870> be<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> wrong

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
like that so this would be the wrong

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.630 
like that so this would be the wrong
side<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.780> simply<00:00:16.670> pin<00:00:17.670> these<00:00:17.820> together<00:00:19.640> about

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
side and simply pin these together about

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.990 
side and simply pin these together about
an<00:00:20.850> inch<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.580> don't<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.850> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
an inch in so that you don't have to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.990 
an inch in so that you don't have to
remove<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.449> pins<00:00:24.689> when<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.990> come<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.380> sew<00:00:26.000> and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
remove the pins when you come to sew and

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.150 
remove the pins when you come to sew and
just<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:27.930> stays<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.560> place

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.400 

so<00:00:35.850> that's<00:00:36.060> the<00:00:36.270> pocket<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.900> we're<00:00:37.080> actually

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
so that's the pocket that we're actually

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.600 
so that's the pocket that we're actually
gonna<00:00:37.710> see<00:00:38.070> once<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.700> cushion<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.630> finished

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
gonna see once the cushion is finished

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.200 
gonna see once the cushion is finished
the<00:00:41.610> next<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:42.060> goes<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.600> again<00:00:43.080> make<00:00:43.620> sure<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
the next one goes on again make sure the

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
the next one goes on again make sure the
right<00:00:45.210> side<00:00:45.540> is<00:00:45.780> facing<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.650> side<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
right side is facing the right side of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.080 
right side is facing the right side of
the<00:00:47.190> other<00:00:47.340> material<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:49.320> pop<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.130> try

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the other material and pop that on try

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.460 
the other material and pop that on try
and<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.660> level<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.860> possibly<00:00:53.340> can

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.530 

it's<00:00:58.470> about<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.550> again<00:00:59.880> just<00:01:00.210> pin<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
it's about right and again just pin that

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.650 
it's about right and again just pin that
into<00:01:00.870> place<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:02.070> again<00:01:02.340> anyway<00:01:03.330> we'll<00:01:03.540> do

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
into place and again anyway we'll do

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.410 
into place and again anyway we'll do
it's<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:03.989> hold<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:08.180> cuz<00:01:09.180> we're<00:01:09.330> gonna

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830

away<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> seam<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.439> don't<00:01:28.710> have

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
away from the seam then you don't have

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.230 
away from the seam then you don't have
to<00:01:28.950> worry<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.159> removing<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> pins<00:01:30.000> when

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
to follow when you're sewing everything

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.930
