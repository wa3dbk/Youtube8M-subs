reason<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.779> say<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.560> because<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.490> know<00:00:26.779> we

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
reason I say that is because you know we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.140 
reason I say that is because you know we
like<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> preserve<00:00:28.260> magic<00:00:28.859> history<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.699> lot
