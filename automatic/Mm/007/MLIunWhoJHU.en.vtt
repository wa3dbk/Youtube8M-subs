it<00:03:13.930> what<00:03:14.110> do<00:03:14.170> we<00:03:14.290> think<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.770> they<00:03:15.340> do<00:03:15.400> due<00:03:15.820> to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
it what do we think of it they do due to

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.120 
it what do we think of it they do due to
diesel<00:03:16.810> engines<00:03:17.110> on<00:03:17.260> those<00:03:17.500> we've<00:03:17.800> got<00:03:17.980> the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
diesel engines on those we've got the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.280 
diesel engines on those we've got the
turbo<00:03:18.760> diesel<00:03:19.060> engine<00:03:19.330> which<00:03:19.450> we<00:03:19.600> bro<00:03:19.780> tested

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
turbo diesel engine which we bro tested

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.170 
turbo diesel engine which we bro tested
and<00:03:20.440> they<00:03:20.710> do<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.860> normal<00:03:21.040> aspirated<00:03:21.790> engine

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
and they do a normal aspirated engine

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.540 
and they do a normal aspirated engine
now<00:03:22.660> both<00:03:22.960> engines<00:03:23.500> are<00:03:23.740> readily<00:03:24.370> available

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
now both engines are readily available

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.120 
now both engines are readily available
they<00:03:25.390> both<00:03:25.660> returned<00:03:26.050> roughly<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.740> same<00:03:26.860> fuel

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
they both returned roughly the same fuel

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.070 
they both returned roughly the same fuel
consumptions<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.090> really<00:03:28.450> just<00:03:28.480> depends<00:03:28.960> on

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
consumptions so really just depends on

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.230
