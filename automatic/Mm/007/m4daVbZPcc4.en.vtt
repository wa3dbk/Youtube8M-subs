00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.370
 elite gaming today on destiny 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.200
 going to show you what they were 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.389
 my trai too in the upper classes fall 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.040
 the night held this week 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.170
 assault that I remember being that of 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.750
 prelate to the count again with all the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.850
 embers again there was type two 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.220
 weeks ago I don't know why it happened 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 again but in any case here we are 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.390
 the first drop was beautiful 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.859
 conqueror 8 an assault rifle 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.140
 legendary of the new monarchy 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 I think that I think that land because 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.189
 different from all other rifles 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.050
 assault assault that they put up with 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.670
 the darkness from the depths where the rat is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.680
 the damage is very high 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.260
 this is the opposite of a rocket it is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.700
 quite high but decent condemnation 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 let's say it 's more balanced and for 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.270
 this reason terror also zero 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.600
 in view of the new dlc where he can 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.820
 take it to 365 damage in theory then it 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 I will hold second jump canoe the night instead 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.110
 ascending energy that makes me shit 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.360
 an almost 300 but all in all 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.980
 they might also be useful to you 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.719
 just to exchange them for the lumen 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.969
 hooker at the exit of the new dlc 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.890
 so for the moment I don't mind 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.810
 also find ascending materials 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.150
 finally in my last calanna night I have 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.159
 found in the clothes of the empty bite though 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.960
 chiseled for the pretty good sorcerer 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.000
 discarded for two reasons 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.530
 I already needed a brain two 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.710
 exotic fragment and we certainly put the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.770
 third reason gave only 136 of strength 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.560
 when what I was about 150 160 mi 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 it seems so much that it was much higher for 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.890
 this reason did not interest me to have 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.020
 a weaker piece than it already is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.159
 I had then say that I discarded it 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.170
 also for this reason 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.850
 all in all this week is not given 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.880
 bad I found an assault rifle 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.170
 which I needed that he wanted to use 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.729
 lucky i found materials 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 ancestors that we can use col 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.299
 new dlc and that I will also need 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.350
 if only to exchange them for lumens like 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.820
 I told you before 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.920
 so I don't mind that either 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.049
 too many and finally an exotic fragment 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.399
 in the end, not only are you happy 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.500
 nerves that I have to march that is between 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.090
 gaglione 3 icebreaker a work towards 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.899
 the junta here are six fragments that if 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.369
 they go 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.590
 let's say some more fragment 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.600
 I didn't mind therefore all in all 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 I'm not complaining this week too 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.320
 because let's face it at the moment I have all 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.399
 armor or all weapons 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.560
 that I don't care much about what 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.270
 I find it enough that I only have one 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.740
 purpose actually find a weapon 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.990
 legendary that dismantled life two 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.459
 fragments or two ascending energy per 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.050
 better to say not the energetic fragments 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.310
 let's say I don't care either 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.190
 relatively little at that point 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.560
 I prefer to find the stocked set of 9 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720
 from 11 how many cabbage are energies 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.150
 ascending and I am much happier then 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.560
 these names too this week there 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.720
 invitation left the comment by telling me 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.850

 count I know that I all wanted reste 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.080
 find it quiet says the video 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.520
