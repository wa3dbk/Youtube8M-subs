exposure<00:00:43.350> settings<00:00:43.860> before<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> take<00:00:44.489> my

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
exposure settings before I take my

not<00:00:52.500> only<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.829> terms<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.160> composition<00:00:53.520> but

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
not only in terms of composition but

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
not only in terms of composition but
also<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.989> setting<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.469> aperture<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.160> my

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
also in setting my aperture and my

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.330 
also in setting my aperture and my
shutter<00:00:56.730> speed<00:00:57.320> what<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> realized<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.129> like

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
shutter speed what I realized is like

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.040 
shutter speed what I realized is like
photographed<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> camera<00:01:00.420> what's<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
photographed with the camera what's that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.500 
photographed with the camera what's that
I<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.230> developing<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.859> much<00:01:02.190> better<00:01:02.460> sense<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
I was developing a much better sense and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
I was developing a much better sense and
understanding<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.439> exposure<00:01:04.920> than<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.280> had

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
understanding of exposure than I had

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.760 
understanding of exposure than I had
when<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.729> relied<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.119> my<00:01:06.299> digital<00:01:06.540> camera<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
when I relied on my digital camera to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190 
when I relied on my digital camera to
handle<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> settings<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.570> when<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.080> out

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
handle the settings so now when I'm out

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.219 
handle the settings so now when I'm out
photographing<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.890> my<00:01:10.979> DSLR<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.780> look<00:01:12.930> at

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
photographing with my DSLR I can look at

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.020 
photographing with my DSLR I can look at
what<00:01:13.260> settings<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> camera<00:01:14.189> recommends<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
what settings the camera recommends and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
what settings the camera recommends and
know<00:01:15.930> intuitively<00:01:16.740> whether<00:01:17.640> they<00:01:17.820> will<00:01:17.970> give

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
know intuitively whether they will give

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
know intuitively whether they will give
me<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.509> want<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.320> picture<00:01:19.680> or<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
me what I want for my picture or not and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
me what I want for my picture or not and
if<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.180> don't<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.930> camera<00:01:22.170> suggests

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
if I don't like what my camera suggests

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.940 
if I don't like what my camera suggests
I<00:01:22.979> know<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:23.909> changes<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.950> before

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I know what changes to make before

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.499 
I know what changes to make before
spending<00:01:26.340> time<00:01:26.640> shooting<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> manual

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
spending time shooting with the manual

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.990 
spending time shooting with the manual
camera<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.140> usually<00:01:28.860> shoot<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.400> settings<00:01:29.729> that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
camera I usually shoot the settings that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.910 
camera I usually shoot the settings that
the<00:01:30.270> camera<00:01:30.509> suggested<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.530> I'd<00:01:31.650> look<00:01:31.829> at

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the camera suggested then I'd look at

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.520 
the camera suggested then I'd look at
the<00:01:32.009> back<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.430> adjust<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.329> there<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.840> also

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the back and adjust from there I also

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
the back and adjust from there I also
tended<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> auto<00:01:35.100> bracket<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.640> shot<00:01:35.909> shots

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
tended to auto bracket my shot shots

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.209 
tended to auto bracket my shot shots
just<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.320> case<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.710> exposure<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.310> off

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
just in case my exposure was off

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.880 
just in case my exposure was off
now<00:01:40.820> I'm<00:01:41.270> much<00:01:41.719> more<00:01:41.899> confident<00:01:42.499> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
now I'm much more confident and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.349 
now I'm much more confident and
comfortable<00:01:42.950> with<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.609> basic<00:01:43.969> exposure

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
comfortable with the basic exposure

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.450 
comfortable with the basic exposure
relationships<00:01:45.109> and<00:01:45.499> it<00:01:45.799> more<00:01:45.979> confidence

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
relationships and it more confidence

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.980 
relationships and it more confidence
that<00:01:46.579> I've<00:01:46.640> gotten<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:46.999> photos<00:01:47.299> I<00:01:47.450> want<00:01:47.600> all
