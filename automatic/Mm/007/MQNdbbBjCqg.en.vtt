00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.820

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.900
 offer and that consists of the following 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.700
 the lenovo ideapad es 6000 and the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 matching bluetooth keyboard 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.990
 the whole is currently in media 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.199

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.180
 but you can also use the ideapad 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 Buy individual for 299 euros 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.859
 keyboard is said to cost but scarce 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.210
 120 if you have bought media market 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:40.890
 on offer and we want the whole thing 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:51.510
 just look like you have seen 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:54.270
 We are here first 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.340
 lenovo ideapad always very short 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 thereon we have here 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.859
 Android tablet with a 10.1 inch 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.739
 ips display apps for all who do not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:10.799
 knowledge is very good that the angle 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.510
 The device is stable at the age of 26 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.259
 times 18 inches and we have here 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.330
 a thickness of only 7 mm 6 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.790
 The device is equipped with a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.360
 dual quadcore processor as well as with 1.2 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.630
 gigahertz 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.810
 we have a 3g module that means 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.360
 we can also insert a card for 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.729
 mobile radio and thus on the way to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.290
 we have surfing on the go 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.380
 ideapad it's already 6000 gigabytes 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.079
 Memory tear is expandable around yet 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.240
 times 64 gb 128 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.530
 we can work with that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.200
 the whole time we have it 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.600
 a camera the camera has a front 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.329
 resolution of only 0.2 megapixels that is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.250
 not much talk for skype 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.860
 Well, you can at least try it 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.799
 We have the mobile phone camera that triggers with 5 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.300
 megapixel on the whole here consists of 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.670
 plastic but here we still have 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.400
 what rips a bit more stable here 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.850
 downstairs so in piano lacquer look we have 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.160
 here are the speakers here at the side 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.990
 we can not have anything up here 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.990
 we turn it on and off 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.170
 you can see it and here we have it 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.560
 bad cards we have micro-usb 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.470
 have micro hdmi and then another 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.280
 because as I said the place for the gps 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.690
 card yes the whole as I said but um 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.770
 that sucks to look 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.450
 Lenovo actually has the surface 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.550
 almost only a few small ones left 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.430
 Adjustments like you see here 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.170
 is it a pure android one has 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.060
 Explicitly, something bigger is dispensed with 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.770
 which I personally always build over 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.830
 I think it's very nice 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:04.200
 supple in my opinion is yet 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:06.080
 Open up and you see the whole thing 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.670
 running 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.210
 Pretty nice as I said for a price of 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.470
 299 euro , you really can not do much 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.020
 against say 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.910
 this price is definitely in the class 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.770
 justified but it also has one 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.290
 be unboxing and that's why we come 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.180
 out here instruction 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.860
 we have our micro usb cable here 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.160
 USB connection and the right plug 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.700
 and I think so too 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.060
 so far so there is not much left now 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.550
 no headphones or something good 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.230
 witty end effect on out and here 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.570
 we come then as it has said yes 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.230
 This bundle comes from media market 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.700
 then to the keyboard and we had 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.700
 We already had them tomorrow 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:05.120
 freshly packed that they can have here 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:07.010
 We then reset the keyboard with usb 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.630
 cable and connect the whole and 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:27.200
 to separate manual instructions 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:30.320
 and then yes pressure point is okay 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.680
 slightly spongy but I'll tell you 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.630
 that goes so far for the tablet keyboard 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.650
 alright we have again 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:43.529
 connections and easy to the whole then 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:48.899
 to show it as the 1000th 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:50.699
 entire skeleton inserted and holds 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:52.919
 then connected by itself as I said via 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.189
 bluetooth bluetooth 4.0 we have 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.109
 of course I think so too 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:00.719
 actually pretty chic for 39 90 

00:04:58.109 --> 00:05:03.239
 is there really nothing against it? 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:07.019
 you have to be honest for that 

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:09.899
 ask if one thereby the gps a 

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:10.949
 gps card goes in his calling card 

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:12.739
 and you can also make calls with it 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.059
 no, that does not work 

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:17.849
 Phone options is not now one 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:20.249
 samsung galaxy tab available but skype 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.749
 etc so all the whole voice over ip 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.549
 services work 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:26.369
 yes that was a very quick one 

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:27.749
 an talking and a quick test, thanks 

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:30.829
 Let's see it for the next one 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.829
 your applause next time
