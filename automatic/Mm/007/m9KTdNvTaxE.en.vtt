00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:09.950
 Thank you for viewing the Bishop Auction here. 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:14.150
 It is a cassette cylinder type gas stove of the manufacturer named greenwood 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:21.250
 The model number is gcp hyphen 16 round 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.250
 Looking It is Well political year from the serial number it is thought that it is 2011 years 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 Well, first of all, when it comes to damage, it's still there , but it's understandable from the front 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.680
 I am a little distorted 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.600
 Is there a feeling that also a little wobbly individual base in the mass under that, but that another 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.340
 There is no problem to carry 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.530
 It is usable normally 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.780
 Yes I'm firing test now and this is the whole condition It's quite hot 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.629
 Let's see with this button 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.990
 Or weak Toka misfortune whether you do it but a little heavier go motion what about if this originally specifications of 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.270
 I do not understand 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:01.660
 Originally I do not know whether it is heavy like this 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.970
 Well then I will digest this a little 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.970
 It seems to be up and down if I did it to here most 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:16.820
 Please note that there is neither a manual nor a box. 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.330
 I mean when you ignition country to spark Turn of up to world one has here ignition switch 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.330
 I will 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.009
 The road may not have been reflected for a while, but it is sparking and maintenance 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.930
 But it is 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:35.610
 It is a second-hand product which becomes the finish of the extent which blows off with a compressor and wipes lightly 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.850
 I think that there is no problem in that use There is something as a magnet here This is removed 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.909
 I am sorry 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.380
 It is such a state, yes 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.590
 It is a problem of that kind of bruises, but please be careful because there are fine abrasions 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.580
 Yes angle adjustment seems to move if you loosen this 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.760
 Nde I feel that that completely does not fit tight lightly is doing this moves 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.430
 Even in the closed state 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:01.110
 It is the other side 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:04.770
 It is such a state, and it is in the cassette cylinder which is in this 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.550
 I think this is a loan I think if you remove and remove 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.390
 Please prepare separately as it is not included in the cassette room 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.520
 Will be delivered in this state 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.110
 This product is 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.110
 I don't think it's a little difficult to close in this state 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.110
 Hmm 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:32.459
 The green cylinder's cassette cylinder type ensemble part number is gcp hyphen 160 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.459
