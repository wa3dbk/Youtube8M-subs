00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.970 
always thought that our goals were
lacking<00:02:13.569> was<00:02:13.930> great<00:02:14.170> lighting<00:02:14.379> package<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
lacking was great lighting package and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.619 
lacking was great lighting package and
now<00:02:15.069> we<00:02:15.129> have<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.580> also<00:02:15.879> included<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
now we have it also included in the

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.130 
now we have it also included in the
package<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.459> receiver<00:02:19.450> winch<00:02:19.720> comes<00:02:19.989> with

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
package is the receiver winch comes with

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.990 
package is the receiver winch comes with
two<00:02:20.260> brush<00:02:20.470> guard<00:02:20.769> simply<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> matter<00:02:21.879> of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
two brush guard simply a matter of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.569 
two brush guard simply a matter of
unplugging<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.230> moving<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.860> back<00:02:24.189> onto

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
unplugging it moving it to the back onto

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.000 
unplugging it moving it to the back onto
the<00:02:24.819> receiver

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the receiver

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.830 
the receiver
and<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.730> winch<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.209> backwards<00:02:27.420> if<00:02:27.720> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
and you can winch up backwards if you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.800 
and you can winch up backwards if you
need<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.379> great<00:02:29.099> feature<00:02:29.459> as<00:02:29.790> always

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
need to a great feature as always

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.259 
need to a great feature as always
so<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.890> outfitter<00:02:32.340> makes<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.849> very<00:02:33.060> pretty

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
so the outfitter makes a very pretty

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.330 
so the outfitter makes a very pretty
package<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.019> let's<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.709> down<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.129> nuts

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
package but let's get down to the nuts

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.069 
package but let's get down to the nuts
and<00:02:35.489> bolts<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.909> mean<00:02:36.030> after<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.390> when<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.840> count

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
and bolts I mean after all when we count

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.720 
and bolts I mean after all when we count
on<00:02:37.230> these<00:02:37.379> things<00:02:37.560> out<00:02:37.799> in<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> bush<00:02:38.159> we<00:02:38.579> have
