00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
and then what you can do for example is

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.039 
and then what you can do for example is
that<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.310> into<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.910> was<00:02:34.360> just<00:02:34.570> playing<00:02:34.840> my

course<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:14.180> want<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.540> creative<00:03:14.990> and<00:03:15.080> come

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
course you want to be creative and come

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.410 
course you want to be creative and come
up<00:03:15.290> with<00:03:15.560> your<00:03:15.709> own<00:03:15.740> ways<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.430> start<00:03:16.670> tunes<00:03:16.970> I'm

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
up with your own ways to start tunes I'm

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.020 
up with your own ways to start tunes I'm
just<00:03:17.810> showing<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.400> some<00:03:19.400> really<00:03:19.430> really

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
just showing you some really really

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.670 
just showing you some really really
basic<00:03:20.630> stuff<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:22.190> can<00:03:22.400> get<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:22.670> going<00:03:22.700> and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
basic stuff that can get you going and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.070 
basic stuff that can get you going and
like<00:03:24.680> here<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.190> wrote<00:03:25.640> out<00:03:25.850> some<00:03:26.150> minor

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
like here I just wrote out some minor

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.780 
like here I just wrote out some minor
seven<00:03:27.730> chords<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.380> arpeggiated<00:03:30.380> them

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
seven chords and arpeggiated them

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.180 
seven chords and arpeggiated them
backwards<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.290> first<00:03:33.560> one<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:33.890> was

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
backwards so the first one I was

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.380 
backwards so the first one I was
starting<00:03:34.840> we<00:03:35.840> have<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.200> root<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.590> D<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.390> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
starting we have the root is D and the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.590 
starting we have the root is D and the
third<00:03:38.600> is<00:03:38.780> f<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.620> fifth<00:03:40.190> is<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:40.970> C<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.570> the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
third is f the fifth is a and C is the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.500 
third is f the fifth is a and C is the
seventh<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.580> was<00:03:43.580> starting<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.090> seventh

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
seventh I was starting on the seventh

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.320 
seventh I was starting on the seventh
and<00:03:44.630> playing<00:03:44.750> them<00:03:45.050> backwards<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.880> then<00:03:47.060> I

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
and playing them backwards and then I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.290 
and playing them backwards and then I
had<00:03:47.600> some<00:03:47.810> other<00:03:47.930> ones<00:03:48.230> where<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.620> started<00:03:49.300> on

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
had some other ones where I started on

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.340 
had some other ones where I started on
an<00:03:50.959> E<00:03:51.430> which<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.640> major<00:03:52.910> third<00:03:53.269> higher<00:03:53.540> but<00:03:54.320> I

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
an E which is a major third higher but I

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.620 
an E which is a major third higher but I
kept<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.890> same<00:03:55.130> thing<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.489> used<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.850> major<00:03:56.090> the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
kept the same thing I used the major the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.280 
kept the same thing I used the major the
the<00:03:57.260> E<00:03:57.290> as<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.769> seventh<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:59.600> C<00:03:59.780> sharp<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.230> the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
the E as the seventh the C sharp is the

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.080 
the E as the seventh the C sharp is the
fifth<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:01.070> is<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.430> third<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:01.940> F

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
fifth that a is the third and the F

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.390 
fifth that a is the third and the F
sharp<00:04:02.120> was<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.660> root<00:04:02.870> for<00:04:03.200> an<00:04:03.350> F<00:04:03.799> sharp<00:04:03.829> minor

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
sharp was the root for an F sharp minor

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.090 
sharp was the root for an F sharp minor
so<00:04:06.519> my<00:04:07.519> first<00:04:07.910> set<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.420> changes<00:04:08.810> was<00:04:09.560> based<00:04:09.890> on

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
so my first set of changes was based on

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.930 
so my first set of changes was based on
D<00:04:10.489> minor<00:04:10.880> 7<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.739> then<00:04:12.739> what<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:12.980> did<00:04:13.130> was<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.700> went

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
D minor 7 and then what I did was I went

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.680 
D minor 7 and then what I did was I went
up<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.269> major<00:04:14.540> 3rd<00:04:15.609> to<00:04:16.609> get<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:17.090> little<00:04:17.540> variety

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
up a major 3rd to get a little variety

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.540 
up a major 3rd to get a little variety
and<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.769> played<00:04:19.489> an<00:04:19.729> F<00:04:19.970> sharp<00:04:20.590> minor<00:04:21.590> 7<00:04:21.799> going

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
and I played an F sharp minor 7 going

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.390 
and I played an F sharp minor 7 going
backwards<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.990> I'll<00:04:24.560> just<00:04:24.800> do<00:04:24.950> that<00:04:24.979> again<00:04:25.130> for

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
backwards so I'll just do that again for

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.170 
backwards so I'll just do that again for
you<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:25.700> little<00:04:26.090> bit<00:04:26.270> I<00:04:26.479> had<00:04:27.820> actually<00:04:28.820> you

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
first I'm gonna start on the F sharp

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.500 
first I'm gonna start on the F sharp
minor<00:04:30.770> because<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.580> want<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:31.940> come<00:04:32.090> back<00:04:32.240> down

minor because I want to come back down
to<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.900> key<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.140> I'm<00:04:33.380> actually<00:04:33.560> going<00:04:33.890> to

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
to the key that I'm actually going to

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.460 
to the key that I'm actually going to
play<00:04:34.190> in<00:04:34.490> ok<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.300> I'm<00:04:35.360> starting<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:36.020> third

play in ok so I'm starting a third
higher<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.910> get<00:04:38.060> some<00:04:38.270> attention<00:04:38.419> into<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:42.280> so
