00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
possible and you're wanting to line up

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.080 
possible and you're wanting to line up
those<00:03:48.330> headshots<00:03:48.630> as<00:03:49.020> best<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.500> can<00:03:49.530> and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
those headshots as best you can and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.880 
those headshots as best you can and
perfect<00:03:51.090> balance<00:03:51.300> really<00:03:52.200> really<00:03:52.440> helps<00:03:52.739> you

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
perfect balance really really helps you

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.100 
perfect balance really really helps you
engage<00:03:53.120> multiple<00:03:54.120> enemies<00:03:54.420> at<00:03:54.450> longer<00:03:54.840> range

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
engage multiple enemies at longer range

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.050 
engage multiple enemies at longer range
like<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.440> really<00:03:56.010> don't<00:03:56.340> think<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:56.790> scholar

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
like I really don't think this scholar

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.229 
like I really don't think this scholar
would<00:03:57.330> be<00:03:57.560> usable<00:03:58.560> even<00:03:58.860> without<00:03:59.730> perfect

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
would be usable even without perfect

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.090 
would be usable even without perfect
balance<00:04:00.780> because<00:04:00.930> again<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.410> recall<00:04:01.830> before

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
balance because again the recall before

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.100 
balance because again the recall before
you<00:04:02.160> upgrade<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.670> pretty<00:04:03.180> gnarly<00:04:03.450> now

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
you upgrade it is pretty gnarly now

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.810 
you upgrade it is pretty gnarly now
although<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.590> damage<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.160> quite<00:04:05.400> high<00:04:05.760> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
although the damage is quite high the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.780 
although the damage is quite high the
rate<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.510> fire<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.989> simply<00:04:07.440> not<00:04:07.770> enough<00:04:08.010> to

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
rate of fire is simply not enough to

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.870 
rate of fire is simply not enough to
compete<00:04:09.239> with<00:04:09.390> most<00:04:09.810> guns<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.410> closer<00:04:11.340> medium

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
compete with most guns in closer medium

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.040 
compete with most guns in closer medium
and<00:04:12.060> short<00:04:12.480> range

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
and short range

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.630 
and short range
this<00:04:13.380> really<00:04:13.590> isn't<00:04:13.800> helped<00:04:14.160> by<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.340> fact

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
this really isn't helped by the fact

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.820 
this really isn't helped by the fact
that<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:15.030> lot<00:04:15.270> of<00:04:15.300> maps<00:04:15.600> simply<00:04:16.169> aren't<00:04:16.380> meant

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
that a lot of maps simply aren't meant

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.340 
that a lot of maps simply aren't meant
for<00:04:16.919> long<00:04:17.370> range<00:04:17.549> engagements<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.870> lot<00:04:19.320> of

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
for long range engagements and a lot of

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.620 
for long range engagements and a lot of
players<00:04:19.919> are<00:04:20.190> using<00:04:20.459> close<00:04:20.940> range<00:04:21.239> weapons

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
players are using close range weapons

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.080 
players are using close range weapons
like<00:04:22.169> shotguns<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.979> fusion<00:04:23.250> rifles<00:04:23.700> which

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
like shotguns and fusion rifles which

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.850 
like shotguns and fusion rifles which
will<00:04:24.300> absolutely<00:04:24.690> melt<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.740> you're

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
will absolutely melt you if you're

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.810 
will absolutely melt you if you're

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.460 
with the scholar so in summary the
scholars<00:04:29.790> excellent<00:04:30.450> performance<00:04:31.050> at<00:04:31.170> long

scholars excellent performance at long

scholars excellent performance at long

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
range but only long-range means that

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.320 
range but only long-range means that
this<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.620> not<00:04:34.650> gonna<00:04:34.860> become<00:04:35.040> my<00:04:35.340> go<00:04:35.640> to<00:04:35.700> PvP

alright<00:05:03.000> let's<00:05:03.300> move<00:05:03.480> on<00:05:03.720> to<00:05:03.840> its<00:05:04.050> performance

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
alright let's move on to its performance

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.140 
alright let's move on to its performance
in<00:05:04.830> PvE<00:05:05.490> now<00:05:06.450> first<00:05:06.840> things<00:05:07.140> first<00:05:07.230> void<00:05:08.160> void

better in PvE it's not even funny now
this<00:05:22.740> is<00:05:22.860> because<00:05:23.250> there's<00:05:23.910> no<00:05:24.300> downside<00:05:24.780> to

downside<00:05:37.950> to<00:05:38.520> shooting<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.420> wrong<00:05:39.720> element

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
downside to shooting the wrong element

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.070 
downside to shooting the wrong element
so<00:05:40.830> there's<00:05:41.340> only<00:05:41.580> upside<00:05:42.180> you<00:05:42.450> really<00:05:42.780> only

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
so there's only upside you really only

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.410 
so there's only upside you really only
get<00:05:43.440> bonus<00:05:44.010> damage<00:05:44.250> if<00:05:44.550> you<00:05:44.790> do<00:05:45.060> end<00:05:45.300> up

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
get bonus damage if you do end up

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.230 
get bonus damage if you do end up
encountering<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:46.110> guy<00:05:46.260> with<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.920> void<00:05:47.280> shield<00:05:47.730> so

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
encountering a guy with a void shield so

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.260 
encountering a guy with a void shield so
again<00:05:48.600> there's<00:05:48.870> just<00:05:49.560> no<00:05:50.100> reason<00:05:50.520> to<00:05:50.640> use<00:05:50.910> any

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
again there's just no reason to use any

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.410 
again there's just no reason to use any
sort<00:05:51.960> of<00:05:52.110> kinetic<00:05:52.710> version<00:05:53.250> of<00:05:53.400> an<00:05:53.940> elemental

gun the elemental gun will always be

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.690 
gun the elemental gun will always be
better

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
better

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.080 
better
in<00:05:56.820> PvE<00:05:57.350> now<00:05:58.350> although<00:05:58.530> PvP<00:05:59.490> is<00:05:59.670> a<00:05:59.700> little<00:05:59.970> bit

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
in PvE now although PvP is a little bit

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.940 
in PvE now although PvP is a little bit
more<00:06:00.240> cutthroat<00:06:00.600> and<00:06:01.020> close-range

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
more cutthroat and close-range

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.610 
more cutthroat and close-range
PvE<00:06:02.670> actually<00:06:03.540> has<00:06:03.720> you<00:06:03.900> putting<00:06:04.200> a<00:06:04.260> lot<00:06:04.500> of

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
PvE actually has you putting a lot of

PvE actually has you putting a lot of

extremely long ranges is very very

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.720

is<00:06:19.230> one<00:06:19.500> of<00:06:19.620> my<00:06:19.800> favourite<00:06:20.400> weapons<00:06:20.730> of<00:06:20.880> all

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
is one of my favourite weapons of all

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.420 
is one of my favourite weapons of all
time<00:06:21.420> but<00:06:21.660> honestly<00:06:22.140> the<00:06:22.350> scholar<00:06:22.740> is<00:06:22.980> pretty

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
time but honestly the scholar is pretty

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.390 
time but honestly the scholar is pretty
close<00:06:23.940> it<00:06:24.330> is<00:06:24.690> just<00:06:24.930> so<00:06:25.290> powerful<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:26.070> I<00:06:26.340> don't

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
close it is just so powerful and I don't

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.890 
close it is just so powerful and I don't
think<00:06:26.760> this<00:06:26.850> gun<00:06:27.090> would<00:06:27.240> be<00:06:27.270> anywhere<00:06:27.630> near<00:06:27.780> as

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
think this gun would be anywhere near as

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.870 
think this gun would be anywhere near as
good<00:06:28.020> without<00:06:28.170> the<00:06:28.530> outlaw<00:06:28.980> perk<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.460> outlaw

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
good without the outlaw perk the outlaw

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.990 
good without the outlaw perk the outlaw
perk<00:06:30.210> in<00:06:30.390> PvE<00:06:31.050> is<00:06:31.440> insane<00:06:31.980> because<00:06:32.160> it's<00:06:32.640> very

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
perk in PvE is insane because it's very

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.690 
perk in PvE is insane because it's very
easy<00:06:33.270> to<00:06:33.510> line<00:06:33.750> up<00:06:33.900> headshots<00:06:34.380> in<00:06:34.560> PvE<00:06:34.919> and<00:06:35.310> you

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
easy to line up headshots in PvE and you

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.000 
easy to line up headshots in PvE and you
can<00:06:35.910> basically<00:06:36.120> have<00:06:36.480> a<00:06:36.540> constant<00:06:37.500> stream<00:06:37.950> of

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.130 
can basically have a constant stream of
bullets<00:06:38.480> reloading<00:06:39.480> you

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
in a flash in PVE because you were just

version for the vex now that's because

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.790 
version for the vex now that's because

enemy it works best against yours might
not<00:07:06.690> be<00:07:07.200> void<00:07:07.500> but<00:07:08.130> again<00:07:08.340> the<00:07:08.490> fact<00:07:08.670> that<00:07:08.880> is

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
not be void but again the fact that is

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.530 
not be void but again the fact that is
just<00:07:09.390> an<00:07:09.540> element<00:07:10.110> period<00:07:10.770> makes<00:07:11.190> it<00:07:11.430> so<00:07:11.970> so

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540 
just an element period makes it so so

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.840 
just an element period makes it so so
important<00:07:13.110> so<00:07:13.650> in<00:07:13.830> summation<00:07:14.070> that<00:07:14.400> means<00:07:14.700> the

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850 
important so in summation that means the

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.910 
important so in summation that means the
adept<00:07:15.180> variant<00:07:15.630> of<00:07:15.720> the<00:07:15.930> scholar<00:07:16.290> is<00:07:16.530> a<00:07:16.560> very

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:16.920 
adept variant of the scholar is a very

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.660 
adept variant of the scholar is a very
very<00:07:17.130> powerful<00:07:17.640> PvE<00:07:18.630> weapon<00:07:19.310> definitely<00:07:20.310> more

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
very powerful PvE weapon definitely more

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.820 
very powerful PvE weapon definitely more
so<00:07:20.940> than<00:07:21.180> PvP<00:07:21.750> in<00:07:21.870> my<00:07:22.020> opinion<00:07:22.440> it's<00:07:22.590> just<00:07:22.620> a

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
so than PvP in my opinion it's just a

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.430 
so than PvP in my opinion it's just a
little<00:07:23.040> too<00:07:23.190> niche<00:07:23.520> in<00:07:23.760> PvP<00:07:24.630> for<00:07:24.840> my<00:07:25.020> liking

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
little too niche in PvP for my liking

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.980 
little too niche in PvP for my liking
but<00:07:25.590> in<00:07:25.950> PvE<00:07:26.310> again<00:07:26.670> you<00:07:26.880> can<00:07:27.060> of<00:07:27.240> use<00:07:27.750> and

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
but in PvE again you can of use and

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.710 
but in PvE again you can of use and
abuse<00:07:28.110> this<00:07:28.650> a<00:07:28.710> lot<00:07:29.070> more<00:07:29.370> just<00:07:30.090> the<00:07:30.330> fact<00:07:30.600> that

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720
