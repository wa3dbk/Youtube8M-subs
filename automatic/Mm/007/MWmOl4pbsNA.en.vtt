00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 Y 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.670
 in the day of the east very interesting game 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.250
 that I found by the google place this 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.169
 game is called my not doctor reading 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.669
 doctor reading the name this person 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.310
 right now the screen you have here 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.250
 down in the description you have it so 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.880
 guys is this thing 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.070
 this this is 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.630
 and what the game is about, the game is about 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.310
 we are a driver with and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.200
 we have to get our license 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.760
 drive so you do not know it's meat 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 you're like the known license but 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.390
 good is in different countries it is said of 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.940
 different way is worth the redundancy 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.860
 here we have a very ugly car the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.790
 true but while we are passing the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.800
 levels we have new cars that was going 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.980
 the game because the game is about 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.739
 drive without crashing yes and it is something very very 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.520
 very stressful for me the truth as 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.270
 we put that I think to take it for ass 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.250
 shocked 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.720
 here we have for example tells us that the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.900
 mission was failed we have to 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.930
 start in a habitat then 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.229
 let's continue the case of the game is to double 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.640
 and things like that so they do not go well 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.780
 exists the game is to reach the goal that 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.790
 I'm getting complicated right now 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 to reach the goal without crashing to me is 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.780
 something very stressful but for some 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.400
 people we make them a very 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.840
 easy that has a lot of peace but what the fuck 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.420
 is what it is 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:41.200
 well guys I think that's the bierzo 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.090
 well that car had had good way 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.890
 of acquaintances that stopped and did not go from 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.040
 long because if there had not been a 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.659
 hit then guys it's called doctor 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.549
 driving is a game the truth where 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.080
 we are going to put in our sights as 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.759
 for example we can have there the cycles 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.799
 different meters to go bending 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.979
 We expose ourselves to crashing, we crash again and 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.540
 we crash again mother of mine 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.690
 What's that this is 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.690
 we continue is a gameplay a gameplay 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.759
 review review gameplay or what you guys 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.620
 want to call you from this game is a 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.920
 pretty pretty game has graphics there 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.720
 very nice but you have what it takes to 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.660
 make a good game besides that does not weigh 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.670
 cap are almost almost nothing about 10 megabytes and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.380
 the truth does not relieve to remember but 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.040
 how is it that each and every one of them does not 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.050
 it makes sense 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.540
 it was one in a containment bar 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.980
 it is can not be but good at 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.050
 different options we can see the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.970
