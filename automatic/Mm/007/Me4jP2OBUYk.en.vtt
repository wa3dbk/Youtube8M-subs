on them they actually provide a web
browser<00:01:42.110> control<00:01:43.110> inside<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.920> details<00:01:44.640> page

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
browser control inside the details page

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.450 
browser control inside the details page
as<00:01:45.090> i<00:01:45.180> call<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:46.829> when<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.159> click<00:01:47.280> on

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
through the web browser and it acts up

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.240 
through the web browser and it acts up
sometimes<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.530> working<00:01:56.009> right<00:01:56.040> now

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
sometimes so it's not working right now

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.959 
sometimes so it's not working right now
there<00:01:56.850> he<00:01:56.909> goes<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:58.250> all<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.729> pretty

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
much concluding the web browser control

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.109 
much concluding the web browser control
on<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:04.159> touching<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> link<00:02:05.460> from<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> RSS
