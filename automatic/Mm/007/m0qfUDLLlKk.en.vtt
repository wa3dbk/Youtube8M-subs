00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.950
 The first thing we are going to do is cut or 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.779
 file a nail I 'm the nail is very 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.820
 long so I advise you to use 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.700
 Scissors but if they are not very 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.250
 very sharp tuning sorry what 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 you can get is that your nail is 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.970
 I open them in layers then if it's not very 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.090
 long as mine, I always advise you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.130
 that you use then a file we are going to 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 filing how to file the nail will be 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.320
 always in the same sense because if not 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.830
 what we are going to do is provoke let's say 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 that the nail also opens in layers 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.140
 then we are going to do it only in 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.380
 a sense to look 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.860
 we prioritize the one the nail forgiveness always in 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.000
 a sense and thus we avoid that it 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.970
 cause us this type of injury in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.579
 our nail is worth 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.699
 Well, we're going to a little way 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.059
 you also have to file the sides and 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.420
 the way you and you want 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:08.509
 give guess 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.509
 because the square is the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.850
 that today is more worn but I 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.759
 I always say that the way there is also 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.340
 to give it according to the finger we have and 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.240
 the nail that we have the most we go 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.610
 to go to our hand is worth 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.619
 well once we have filed the nail 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.130
 I already tell you always in one direction what 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.890
 What we are going to do is clean our nail 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.780
 as well I told you yesterday I will use a 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.149
 orange stick in the tip 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.689
 placed a little bit of cotton is very 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.149
 Easy to apply and with hydrogen peroxide 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.590
 As I have said yesterday, what I said 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.100
 let's do 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.750
 is impregnate 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.750
 the tip of hydrogen peroxide 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.690
 and with this con tita what we are going to do 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.840
 It is clean 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:03.310
 all the edges of our footprint will 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.380
 clean well so they are clean 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.649
 and good feeling and then low 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.569
 of the free edge as you are seeing then 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.280
 we also pass this is going to make 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.099
 let's raise our free edge much more 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.459
 and therefore be much more aesthetic 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.960
 It's good because we have it clean with 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.780
 one we enjoy 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.830
 If you have any burrs left on the nail 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.720
 rule in the nail are 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.940
 when filing the sometimes we are left 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.630
 wants appointments by low as nothing we take 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.670
 our nail and very carefully 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.180
 we remove them but with the help of the other 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.190
 unit because we take it out because if not 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.000
 Then when we polish, we 're not going 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.500
 to look good 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.560
 the step that we are going to follow 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.320
 next is to remove the cuticle I do not 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.690
 I advise you to put your nails in water 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.260
 hot because the hot water speak 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.390
 from cee 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.060
 Let's say too much the skin softens it 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.090
 a lot and then then we can cut 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.220
 more than the account and the days you can see 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.200
 those unsightly stepfathers those 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.570
 skin pools and appointments that stand up 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.000
 and that are so unsightly and even to 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.920
 sometimes very painful then I advise 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.550
 you always do it dry for it 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:25.090
 let's use a little bit of cream 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.090
 hands that we are using we are going to 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.650
 place it all over the cuticle and with 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.230
 help from the other party that is not 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.300
 pointy because it's more chatita than 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.090
 orange stick so we're going to 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.600
 to do is to withdraw it 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.450
 back to back 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.910
 and we're going to hide the excess 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.250
 cuticle we are going to hide 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.100
 I did not advise you to cut 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.400
 cut if you have done this step once 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.470
 as is my case, the cuticle is 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.020
 Pretty little hiding place is not necessary 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.710
 cut we would cut in case with one 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.170
 cuticles cut because because the more 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.790
 the skin is cut more is regenerated 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.950
 then we enter a vicious circle 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.360
 the more we cut more times we 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.370
 we have to do the manicure then 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.780
 if we do not really need it, 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.370
 we have to cut 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.850
 we will only cut then in those 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.380
 areas like me in this case 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.259
 that we have 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.460
 Well, a little bit of 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:32.340
 Greece see surplus 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.319
 and I'm the little girl I cut myself in a 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.430
 lateral here because I was a little 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:40.830
 the more the skin dries and it bothered me 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.530
 because it scraped me well then once 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.720
 we have done this already below the 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.490
 step that we are going to follow and in this case 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.650
 as well show us yesterday I'm 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.800
 using a special gel to 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.710
 sensitive cuticles of your brand and 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.819
 me to finish before glazing what 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.550
 What I do is put a little oil 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.949
 all over my cuticle and massage it's worth 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.350
 this is going to keep our cuticles 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.080
 much more hydrated 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.400
 and therefore we are going to have a 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.190
 feeling like a more careful one 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.020
 the step to follow would be cleaner 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.790
 we would like to glaze the me in this case 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.260
 I will not do it but if you would like 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.270
 do it since you already know that first 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.050
 we would apply a base and then 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.120
 we would apply the enamel because nothing I hope 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.290
 that you have liked that you try and that 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.290
 you count chao
