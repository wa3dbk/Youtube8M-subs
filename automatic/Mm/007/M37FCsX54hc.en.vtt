00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
comes into a nice smooth paste so all

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.309

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
water if you've got a rubber spatula

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.569 
water if you've got a rubber spatula
that's<00:01:15.719> quite<00:01:15.960> handy<00:01:16.319> for<00:01:16.399> mixing<00:01:17.399> it<00:01:17.520> all

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
that's quite handy for mixing it all

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.819 
that's quite handy for mixing it all
together<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:19.020> basically<00:01:19.289> want<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> same

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
together you basically want the same

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.300 
together you basically want the same
consistency<00:01:20.459> as<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.299> pancake<00:01:21.630> batter<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.219> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
consistency as a pancake batter so if it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
consistency as a pancake batter so if it
looks<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.579> dry<00:01:23.819> like<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.270> does<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:25.079> add

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
looks a bit dry like that does just add

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.090 
looks a bit dry like that does just add
another<00:01:25.409> 50<00:01:25.799> grams<00:01:26.039> of<00:01:26.189> water<00:01:27.950> mix<00:01:28.950> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
another 50 grams of water mix it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
another 50 grams of water mix it
together<00:01:29.249> you<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.149> try<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.539> all<00:01:30.749> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
together you want to try and get all the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.929 
together you want to try and get all the
large<00:01:31.200> clumps<00:01:31.679> of<00:01:31.799> flour<00:01:32.039> out<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.789> nice

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
large clumps of flour out so it's a nice

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.599 
large clumps of flour out so it's a nice
smooth<00:01:33.299> paste<00:01:33.679> which<00:01:34.679> is<00:01:34.829> why<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.039> fork<00:01:35.429> is

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
smooth paste which is why the fork is

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.449 
smooth paste which is why the fork is
good<00:01:36.529> you<00:01:37.529> can<00:01:37.590> use<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> whisk<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.310> it's

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
good you can use a whisk but it's

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:45.660 
good you can use a whisk but it's
sometimes<00:01:38.670> clumps<00:01:39.240> together<00:01:39.389> so

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.870 

great<00:01:46.670> once<00:01:46.940> it's<00:01:47.119> all<00:01:47.240> together<00:01:51.880> that's

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
great once it's all together that's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.960 
great once it's all together that's
smoother<00:01:58.090> great<00:01:59.710> what<00:02:00.710> we're<00:02:00.800> going<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.950> do<00:02:01.159> is

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
smoother great what we're going to do is

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.749 
smoother great what we're going to do is

to<00:02:09.649> our<00:02:09.770> Bowl<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.610> should<00:02:10.850> look<00:02:10.910> very<00:02:10.970> similar

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
to our Bowl it should look very similar

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.280 
to our Bowl it should look very similar
to<00:02:11.840> how<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:11.959> was<00:02:12.200> before<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.140> what

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
to how it was before and and so what

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.460 
to how it was before and and so what
we're<00:02:15.410> going<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.560> do<00:02:16.900> there's<00:02:17.900> two<00:02:18.140> things<00:02:18.320> in

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
we're going to do there's two things in

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.620 
we're going to do there's two things in
a<00:02:18.560> sourdough<00:02:18.950> starter<00:02:19.459> there's<00:02:20.150> bacteria

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
a sourdough starter there's bacteria

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.690 
a sourdough starter there's bacteria
natural<00:02:21.380> occurring<00:02:21.590> bacteria<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:22.370> natural

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
natural occurring bacteria and natural

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.250 
natural occurring bacteria and natural
occurring<00:02:22.970> yeast<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.510> all<00:02:23.810> we're<00:02:23.930> doing<00:02:24.170> at

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
occurring yeast and all we're doing at

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.290 
occurring yeast and all we're doing at
the<00:02:24.350> minute<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.830> basically<00:02:25.220> feeding<00:02:25.640> them<00:02:26.000> so

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
the minute is basically feeding them so

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.759 
the minute is basically feeding them so
that<00:02:26.420> they<00:02:26.540> get<00:02:26.720> nice<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.140> strong<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.650> we

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
that they get nice and strong so that we

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.949 
that they get nice and strong so that we
can<00:02:27.890> make<00:02:28.010> our<00:02:28.160> bread<00:02:28.310> rise<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.810> we're<00:02:29.930> just

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
can make our bread rise so we're just

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.020 
can make our bread rise so we're just
going<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.230> do<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.769> nice<00:02:31.220> little<00:02:31.459> sprinkle<00:02:31.970> of

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
going to do a nice little sprinkle of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.240 
going to do a nice little sprinkle of
flour<00:02:32.300> like<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.620> feed<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
flour like that just to feed the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.300 
flour like that just to feed the
bacteria<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> yeast<00:02:36.010> I'm<00:02:37.010> going<00:02:37.250> to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
bacteria and the yeast I'm going to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.420 
bacteria and the yeast I'm going to
cover<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.820> our<00:02:37.940> toth<00:02:38.180> again<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:39.430> leave

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
cover it with our toth again and leave

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.000 
cover it with our toth again and leave
it<00:02:40.580> for<00:02:40.670> another<00:02:40.790> 24<00:02:41.300> hours<00:02:41.440> great<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.769> Dave

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
it for another 24 hours great so Dave

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.009 
it for another 24 hours great so Dave
three<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.519> we<00:02:44.180> put<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.450> sprinkle<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.870> flour

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
three and we put the sprinkle the flour

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.680 
three and we put the sprinkle the flour
and<00:02:45.590> now<00:02:45.890> what<00:02:46.069> we're<00:02:46.190> going<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.340> do<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:47.540> we're

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
and now what we're going to do is we're

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.319 
and now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.840> add<00:02:48.049> another<00:02:48.290> 100<00:02:49.130> grams<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.730> strong

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
going to add another 100 grams of strong

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.640 
going to add another 100 grams of strong
white<00:02:50.510> bread<00:02:50.720> flour<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:53.030> another<00:02:53.900> 100<00:02:54.380> grams

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
white bread flour and another 100 grams

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.390 
white bread flour and another 100 grams
of<00:02:55.570> tepid<00:02:56.570> water<00:02:56.769> it's<00:02:57.769> really<00:02:57.980> important

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
of tepid water it's really important

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.680 
of tepid water it's really important
when<00:02:58.489> you're<00:02:58.610> making<00:02:58.640> sourdough<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.420> weigh

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
when you're making sourdough to weigh

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.479 
when you're making sourdough to weigh
your<00:02:59.870> water<00:03:00.110> because<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.070> can<00:03:01.190> be<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.340> little

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
your water because it can be a little

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.340 
your water because it can be a little
bit<00:03:01.670> inaccurate<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.810> know<00:03:02.930> if<00:03:03.049> you're<00:03:03.200> using

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
bit inaccurate you know if you're using

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.770 
bit inaccurate you know if you're using
a<00:03:03.560> jargon<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.549> sides<00:03:04.850> a<00:03:05.030> bit<00:03:05.180> worn<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.660> might

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
a jargon the sides a bit worn you might

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.150 
a jargon the sides a bit worn you might
not<00:03:05.959> get<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.230> correct<00:03:06.350> measurement<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.040> it's

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
not get the correct measurement so it's

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.080 
not get the correct measurement so it's
really<00:03:07.310> important<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.760> weigh<00:03:07.940> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
really important to weigh the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.360 
really important to weigh the
ingredients<00:03:11.680> great<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:12.950> once<00:03:13.130> you've<00:03:13.250> got

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
ingredients great so once you've got

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.140 
ingredients great so once you've got
smooth<00:03:13.670> batter<00:03:13.940> again

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.190 

just<00:03:20.150> going<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.299> make<00:03:20.480> sure<00:03:20.629> that's<00:03:20.749> all<00:03:20.989> off

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
just going to make sure that's all off

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.920 
just going to make sure that's all off
the<00:03:21.349> sides<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:22.489> might<00:03:22.670> after<00:03:23.209> day<00:03:23.629> three

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
the sides you might after day three

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.839 
the sides you might after day three
start<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.319> see<00:03:24.439> some<00:03:24.650> bubbles<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:25.670> when<00:03:25.760> it

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
start to see some bubbles and when it

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.250 
start to see some bubbles and when it
might<00:03:25.939> smell<00:03:26.120> quite<00:03:26.420> sour<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.019> that's<00:03:27.139> a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
might smell quite sour and that's a

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.780 
might smell quite sour and that's a
really<00:03:27.620> good<00:03:27.769> sign<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.400> sourdough

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
really good sign that the sourdough

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.069 
really good sign that the sourdough
start<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.239> building<00:03:29.569> up<00:03:29.659> some<00:03:29.870> strength<00:03:30.909> right

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
start is building up some strength right

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.970 
start is building up some strength right
once<00:03:33.079> that's<00:03:33.290> all<00:03:33.469> mixed<00:03:35.230> same<00:03:36.230> again<00:03:36.530> tea

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
once that's all mixed same again tea

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.119 
once that's all mixed same again tea
towel<00:03:37.189> on<00:03:37.400> warm<00:03:37.849> place<00:03:38.090> for<00:03:38.329> 24<00:03:38.719> hours<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.980> day

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
towel on warm place for 24 hours so day

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.740 
towel on warm place for 24 hours so day
four<00:03:40.400> we've<00:03:40.579> come<00:03:40.730> back<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:40.909> the<00:03:41.060> starter<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
four we've come back to the starter and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.119 
four we've come back to the starter and
you<00:03:41.959> can<00:03:42.109> see<00:03:42.319> now<00:03:42.469> it's<00:03:42.650> really<00:03:42.920> really

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
you can see now it's really really

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.949 
you can see now it's really really
active<00:03:43.609> there's<00:03:44.209> lots<00:03:44.359> of<00:03:44.450> bubbles<00:03:44.629> on<00:03:44.930> top

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
active there's lots of bubbles on top

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.339 
active there's lots of bubbles on top
and<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:46.519> you<00:03:47.209> give<00:03:47.389> it<00:03:47.480> a<00:03:47.540> shake<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:48.079> can<00:03:48.109> see

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
and and you give it a shake you can see

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.020 
and and you give it a shake you can see
it's<00:03:48.469> much<00:03:48.709> looser<00:03:49.219> now<00:03:49.249> there's<00:03:49.609> not<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.879> big

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
it's much looser now there's not the big

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.000 
it's much looser now there's not the big
clumps<00:03:50.389> of<00:03:50.540> flour<00:03:50.810> it's<00:03:51.349> become<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.769> nice

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
clumps of flour it's become a nice

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.129 
clumps of flour it's become a nice
smooth<00:03:52.340> batter<00:03:52.579> and<00:03:53.540> again<00:03:53.750> that's<00:03:53.989> a<00:03:54.109> really

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
smooth batter and again that's a really

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.479 
smooth batter and again that's a really
really<00:03:54.560> good<00:03:54.859> sign

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
really good sign

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.740 
really good sign
that<00:03:55.730> we're<00:03:55.849> ready<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.060> make<00:03:56.239> bread<00:03:56.450> with<00:03:56.480> it

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
that we're ready to make bread with it

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.539 
that we're ready to make bread with it
so<00:03:57.349> what<00:03:57.439> we're<00:03:57.530> going<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.680> do<00:03:57.829> today<00:03:58.129> is<00:03:58.370> we're

so what we're going to do today is we're
going<00:03:58.639> to<00:03:58.699> take<00:03:58.909> away<00:03:59.209> half<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.840> this<00:03:59.959> starter

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
going to take away half of this starter

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.020 
going to take away half of this starter
and<00:04:00.739> we're<00:04:00.949> going<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.129> replace<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.669> with<00:04:01.699> fresh

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
and we're going to replace it with fresh

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.179 
and we're going to replace it with fresh
flour<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.629> fresh<00:04:02.780> water<00:04:02.989> it's<00:04:03.769> might<00:04:03.949> seem<00:04:04.129> a

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
flour and fresh water it's might seem a

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.830 
flour and fresh water it's might seem a
bit<00:04:04.219> confusing<00:04:04.849> but<00:04:05.209> it's<00:04:05.359> similar<00:04:05.540> to<00:04:05.750> when

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
bit confusing but it's similar to when

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.149 
bit confusing but it's similar to when
you<00:04:05.930> get<00:04:06.079> a<00:04:06.109> new<00:04:06.290> kettle<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.859> you<00:04:06.949> need<00:04:07.069> to

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
you get a new kettle and you need to

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.559 
you get a new kettle and you need to
boil<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.489> once<00:04:07.669> before<00:04:07.909> you<00:04:08.090> make<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.239> cup<00:04:08.449> of

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
boil it once before you make a cup of

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.259 
boil it once before you make a cup of
tea<00:04:08.829> it's<00:04:09.829> going<00:04:10.159> to<00:04:10.219> make<00:04:10.609> sure<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:11.000> bread<00:04:11.180> is

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
tea it's going to make sure the bread is

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.789 
tea it's going to make sure the bread is
really<00:04:11.659> strong<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.230> we'll<00:04:12.469> get<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.590> nice

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
really strong and we'll get a nice

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.280 
really strong and we'll get a nice
volumous<00:04:13.340> loaf<00:04:13.549> so<00:04:14.329> all<00:04:14.540> I'm<00:04:14.689> going<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.840> do<00:04:15.049> I

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
volumous loaf so all I'm going to do I

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.449 
volumous loaf so all I'm going to do I
don't<00:04:15.620> need<00:04:15.859> to<00:04:15.919> be<00:04:16.039> particularly<00:04:18.459> concise

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
don't need to be particularly concise

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.999

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.190 

you've<00:04:54.300> got<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.480> give<00:04:54.600> that<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.750> really<00:04:54.960> good

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
you've got to give that a really good

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:04.790 
you've got to give that a really good
mix<00:04:55.380> just<00:04:55.650> as<00:04:55.830> we<00:04:55.950> have<00:04:56.070> previously<00:05:03.710> it's<00:05:04.710> a

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
mix just as we have previously it's a

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.220 
mix just as we have previously it's a
bit<00:05:04.980> too<00:05:05.160> loose<00:05:05.340> like<00:05:05.640> this<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:06.180> bit<00:05:06.870> too<00:05:07.020> water

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
bit too loose like this a bit too water

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.130 
bit too loose like this a bit too water
we<00:05:07.710> need<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.980> do<00:05:08.100> is<00:05:08.220> add<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.400> bit<00:05:08.610> more<00:05:08.640> flour

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
we need to do is add a bit more flour

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.680 
we need to do is add a bit more flour
the<00:05:10.340> 100<00:05:11.340> grams<00:05:11.580> of<00:05:11.820> each<00:05:12.000> are<00:05:12.300> more<00:05:12.540> of<00:05:12.630> a

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
the 100 grams of each are more of a

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.510 
the 100 grams of each are more of a
guide<00:05:12.930> is<00:05:13.320> basically<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:13.950> will<00:05:14.040> depend<00:05:14.400> on

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
guide is basically it will depend on

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.610 
guide is basically it will depend on
what<00:05:14.580> flour<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.210> use<00:05:15.240> so<00:05:15.660> you<00:05:15.750> just<00:05:15.930> want<00:05:16.530> to

what flour you use so you just want to

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.100 
what flour you use so you just want to
go<00:05:16.770> for<00:05:16.920> the<00:05:17.010> consistency<00:05:17.820> of<00:05:18.000> with<00:05:18.780> quite

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
go for the consistency of with quite

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:29.900 
go for the consistency of with quite
thick<00:05:19.410> pancake<00:05:19.950> batter<00:05:28.640> great<00:05:29.640> that's
