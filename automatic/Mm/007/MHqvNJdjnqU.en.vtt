00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.460
 one as the second best time we're going to do 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.460
 I had the honor of juveniles the video that asked ecotourism 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.150
 so in series we foresee platoon with the true concept cresto celebration 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.140
 since some of his rivals turn mystery into Baghdad and took it for crazy 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.720
 for the video 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.239
 hello all the relevant greetings 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.829
 I wanted to tell you that I made the decision to make a touch worse 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.139
 caricatures of the month of halloween let's start number 4 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.449
 the frankestein cat 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.930
 many will wonder why he is in this position 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.950
 simple because this series is the biggest insult to a great book 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.980
 of terror especially when we talk about frankenstein is to say I like that 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.210
 book and teach me about the dangers that the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.660
 experimentation on women's human beings 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.640
 I do not know if the producers did not read the book or the assholes were done to 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.020
 make this series this series comes with many errors 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.200
 with atmosphere and I do not know why shit they mix in massachusetts 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.230
 16th century with a 19th century Europe I seriously do not understand what you want to get with 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.020
 this 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.350
 the characters are a few point assholes since according to the series the women are 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.430
 discriminated 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.080
 this sounds to me that the creator wants to promote machismo to the public 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.610
 childish another factor more why he called the series a garbage 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.300
 of terror has absolutely nothing 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.630
 and to top it off I can not believe that this series is still in the air 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.450
 if you are a fan of the horror genre if you read Frankenstein 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.930
 I recommend that you do not see this series the only thing you will see is an insult 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.690
 disappointment and a desire to kill the creators number 3 super league 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.780
 evil or should I say the league of super assholes 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.320
 although this series does not have terror but it should be of evil another factor more 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.260
 of the celebration of alhaurín 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
 this series lacks personality and character 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.960
 the only thing they do in this series is to make evil the most ridiculous and 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.990
 stupidly possible 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.280
 the quartet of subnormales is made up of a man in red who 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.070
 The only thing he does is appreciate that he will be the best of all and his plans are the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.879
 stupid I've seen 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.529
 a scientist with metal teeth that is a parody of bush fermin 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 a fat shit that is a brazen plagiarism of robin 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.629
 and a monster that eats everything 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.359
 fuck I thought that duscher min was stupid but I think that they already surpassed it in 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.669
 stupidity and mental retardation 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.609
 and it's not everything gets worse 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.099
 the plot is to try to conquer the world something that they will never achieve 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:36.049
 the only thing that will leave you this series is a shameless offense to the villains 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:41.099
 another thing if they wanted to attract the young public because they screwed it up and big 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.929
 I'm telling those of disney 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:47.359
 number 2 the grim adventures of Billy and he quoted witnesses 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.359
 in the modality of alcalá 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.529
 Do nothing 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.529
 fortes says that 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.129
 different when 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.129
 the day that I stayed with this happen 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.249
 too annoying 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.479
 his family others should be in an insane asylum 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.489
 the councilman of celebrations 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.489
 the economic endowment 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.839
 it's hard to play 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.839
 towards the end of this year 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.479
 this nightmare of the dissident general 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.679
 No doubt 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.679
 human relations 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.319
 he was the creator 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.519
 after congratulating and profits left 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.519
 the characters of this zoning 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.279
 I would have to send the 'sms' 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.449
 only for drawer elders 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.449
 problems with parents has been official 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.579
 well this is the most stupid post 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.870
 mysteres tico and the worst of this top 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.249
 I give you a question imagine if edgar allan poe still lived 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.030
 simple would have thrown a fifth floor because I would not stand to see that a 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.640
 genre of terror that he tried so hard to be thrown away for a few 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.349
 greedy creators of shit now yes 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.659

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.080
 What is it 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.080
