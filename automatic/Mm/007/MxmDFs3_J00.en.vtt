00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 good guys here we are like troy del 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.420
 complex landa and let's show the place 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.760
 where are we going to assemble the lambda study 1 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.349
 which is a provisional name we are going to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.570
 Do a little job where it matters 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.830
 the house so you can see it good here 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.350
 is the kitchen where we will prepare 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.240
 Our menus is important 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.570
 here is a room where I do not know a 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.970
 fuck but you can turn on the light 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.260
 where we will store junk and others here 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.350
 a toilet that is not used 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.350
 ah 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.450
 a bed for those long nights of 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.800
 marathons so we can rest 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.290
 we have the bathroom that works for 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.050
 our little things and here is the room 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.629
 main as it is quite broad where 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.129
 let's set up what will be the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.540
 study itself the mixer 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.879
 the whole theme of the internet the whole theme 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.699
 of streaming and a room that we're going 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.199
 decorate to make it look fit 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.059
 so that it is the true study of 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.070
 lambda complex and that will require quite 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.140
 work on our part now you see a 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.820
 premature version but I insist when 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.100
 this will finish you will see a study in 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.750
 conditions and now let's see the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.720
 members of the landa complex that are 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.450
 here talking in the room in the rooms 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.200
 of base meetings here we are of 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.770
 buy the band 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.770
 looking for recording 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:34.210
 and nothing guys I'm going to ask a question that 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.500
 This new study seems like a study 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.060
 of landau from the complex in half 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.640
 let's listen to the opinions of each 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.130
 one in particular good karim to see what 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.140
 you think this lambda study 1 what do you 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.970
 it seems the potential is yes or no is 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.560
 potential has because it's a room 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.390
 big of the moment is a fucking shit 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.189
 it's all messy we're going to have to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.009
 work pretty 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.270
 removing clutter and ordering 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.220
 collector editions yours 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.720
 for example is 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.460
 and the truth is that he has a job 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.270
 above and above we have to put the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.710
 lampholder because there is no light either 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.630
 the reality is that you have to do a lot 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.390
 I still work but when everything is 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.610
 finished it's going to be industry 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.819
 and what is this new stage of 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.740
 Landa complex that is excited by 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.550
 start the xiv but I'm also afraid 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.680
 you have milito if what happens that because 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.090
 now let's have our for 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.740
 us greater freedom at the time of 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.720
 express ourselves when making our 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.490
 things that if we can move to 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.380
 limit on who could do two hours 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.150
 of the program we do two and a half hours 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.220
 all that kind of stuff has very well 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.220
 that later we do not have support from behind 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.390
 it's going to be the best time to complete 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.240
 maybe it's still in the spending 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.720
 shows a blue screen 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.180
 hello friends that such good 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.610
 first of all I wanted to tell you that 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.920
 we are dead we are still alive 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.990
 in fact we decided to make this video for 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.420
 that you see that yes 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.210
 and good to teach us a little what 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.040
 we are doing that we are seeing this 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.840
 new this new space this new 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.470
 space that is not of our partner 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.950
 david that is this this big room 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.349
 where 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.180
 it's a site that has a lot of potential 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.200
 it's still very messy there are 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.569
 to do a lot of things 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.700
 some things like that but we're very 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.800
 excited because it will be great what 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.970
 let's leave nickel-plated and good at 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.260
 As for the complex band, I think that 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.930
 this new stage is going to be a 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.700
 rebirth in the sense we will 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.150
 improve in every way we have 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.200
 I really want to start and I think that 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.489
 with your support 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.489
 They are going to do things 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.440
 and nothing I think is all I can 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.340
 say by Jorge a special request 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.340
 atrocious azim 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.910
 good we 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.850
 hello, friends, I'm like that, 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.260
 director and good we are here because we 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.040
 we are gathering in one of our 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.620
 multiple meetings not to say how 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.410
 we will do in our new stage not 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.290
 we have everything ready to prepare 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.980
 the study of Landa one that I hope that 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.250
 you like it and nothing because in this new 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.070
 stage I do not think 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.840
 not having the support of coke fm is going to 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.300
 harm some things but I think 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.640
 that in the long run we will get to do 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.380
 the program that you deserve and I believe 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.540
 looming the best time of qom 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.020
 propaganda so very soon we will be 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.419
 with you 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.100
 and I say Victor today gaspar is not here 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.910
 you go to charly 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.680
 which is to be pending pending 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.180
 a specific meeting to see what 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.640
 we do with him we have to discipline what 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.280
 we have a very wild throne so 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.890
 well we'll see what we do with gaspar 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.340
 but but it does not seem to think I do not know 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.370
 but me that maybe we have a good 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.870
 all surprise we will give a space to 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.210
 sign then vÃ­ctor will explain us is 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.490
 something you know and ts vitacura when 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.380
 enter the Roman there was a show and 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.440
 at the end towards the symbol of life or 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.440
 death 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.720
 Thank you 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.689
 if you stop tolerating a little 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:34.749
 I think that what most summarizes all the 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.539
 complex holland let's have a 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:40.269
 atmosphere to finish one this season 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.189
 very good and I think the programs 

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:44.619
 that is going to like us so they are 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:48.819
 earrings thank you very much for continuing 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:51.120
 continue there good now guys in 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.669
 relation to the study 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.320
 I am know even if it is my house and take 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.750
 to get the truth that 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.640
 meditation is done shit a lot 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.940
 trash and a lot of shit you have to start 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.290
 everything and you have to organize everything but 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.480
 the block has a lot of potential and 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.820
 we want something something curious that will give a 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.740
 study not only functional but also 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.160
 beautiful aesthetically, so I think 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.290
 that the thing will surprise you 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.620
 and about this new stage of the complex 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.110
 good lambda 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.729
 and I see it with great enthusiasm as 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.280
 said oscar at the time we have 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:27.100
 more freedom we can increase the number 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.409
 of hours and we may be more 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.509
 us the invitations of any kind 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.209
 but that will be positive and also 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.979
 we will be in our house we will be in 

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:38.439
 our privacy and I think that we 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.209
 will benefit everyone but not only in the 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:42.429
 subject of the program cou but also 

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:44.559
 then in the marathons in little things that 

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:47.019
 we can imagine later if 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:51.139
 possible long-term projects I think 

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:54.490
 that everything will improve so complex landa 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.450
 and quite happy 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.670
 and what are you going to do with the excellent 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.980
 economic we have of the people who 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.750
 has supported us and right now it has 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.670
 taken life 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.420
 and it's getting the partisan edition and 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.000
 little more 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.440
 5 life goals because I failed and 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.850
 I want to relive 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.850
 that's why a happy bunch 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.590
 good what do you think the room in the 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.590
 that we are going to assemble the study 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.660
 let's say expand our territories 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.370
 why 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.700
 disabling so dark where I 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.930
 I left in the marathons recently 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.620
 it stopped going out while 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:40.200
 they played bastards 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:42.510
 but it's so big that two or three 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.710
 ok I am and what do you think this new 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.930
 stage the complex the in which the 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.800
 potential everest is already disappointed 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.800
 what's your opinion about it 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:02.750
 not worth 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.050
 while in oslo capital is composed 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.350
 by word the compound chapter is already 

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.350
 okay
