00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
people what's up let's talk about I was

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.089 
people what's up let's talk about I was
a<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.960> skeptical<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> trailer

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
a little skeptical going to this trailer

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130 
a little skeptical going to this trailer
because<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.520> wasn't<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> biggest<00:00:33.450> fan<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
because I wasn't the biggest fan of the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
because I wasn't the biggest fan of the
first<00:00:34.380> Thor<00:00:34.710> yeah<00:00:35.100> grew<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.640> me<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.850> little<00:00:36.059> bit

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
first Thor yeah grew on me a little bit

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.569 
first Thor yeah grew on me a little bit
but<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> whole<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.559> wasn't<00:00:37.890> nearly<00:00:38.489> as

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
but as a whole it wasn't nearly as

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280 
but as a whole it wasn't nearly as
satisfying<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.329> some<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> other<00:00:39.809> Morrible

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
satisfying as some of the other Morrible

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.560 
satisfying as some of the other Morrible
efforts<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.340> don't<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.120> not

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
efforts and I don't know just it was not

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
efforts and I don't know just it was not
entirely<00:00:43.110> satisfying<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> say

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
entirely satisfying but I have to say

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.459 
entirely satisfying but I have to say
