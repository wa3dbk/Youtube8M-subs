00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 but it is what matters is the principle is the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.649
 life and death 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.150
 you would give your life for an ideal this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.519
 book will make you think 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:26.220
 review of the pacifist soon after 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:28.170
 daniel has a long story with john 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 boy started with my striped pajamas 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.059
 and spread through all the other books 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 that the company released from it but I should 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.450
 admit that after the kid on the deck 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 what is his favorite until today I gave 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.190
 a daunting one I thought the books 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.890
 Maybe not one of them would come back so 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 good as in that moment is that he 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
 He released a new book and I told him to see 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 no law even 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
 first because I have prejudice 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.550
 never ugly pronto i said 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.699
 second because I did not want to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.250
 Disappoint but it did not disappoint me 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.610
 a sensitive story is a story 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.170
 exciting and it's a sad story but 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.040
 Let's talk a little bit about the story. 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 first we are in 1900 and 1930 seller 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.590
 go to norwich find a woman she 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 is the mother of william well prof who fought 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.340
 along with him in the First World War 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.979
 Three years ago 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.860
 he is now 21 years old, what are you going to do in 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.259
 town he was to deliver letters letters 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.150
 which she sent to William while he 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.729
 I was struggling on this trip. 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.640
 even after he meets her 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.680
 he keeps reminding himself of all his 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.979
 history to television his childhood and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.229
 adolescence the moment of recruitment 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.750
 about the battle over william well 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.700
 itself not necessarily in that order 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.799
 because even if you've read something 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.040
 You know he does not count. 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.720
 nothing chronologically and you also know 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.280
 that he keeps secrets until the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.930
 end and what he likes to tell 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.860
 half stories 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.010
 only after 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.140
 to complete an important pacifist 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.570
 is the one who adopts pacifism is a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.420
 posture of those who refuse to take 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.700
 guns or be there a war and talk look 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.850
 I will not take up arms I will not kill 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.160
 another person does not necessarily go 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.810
 refuse to enter the rest until the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.930
 consequences for being arrested by 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.060
 steal but he will refuse to catch on 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.510
 guns he has a posture really 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.580
 pacifist non-violence take 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.170
 beginning of stories will already know 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.380
 a person who is there in the recruitment 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.510
 like island and with the tourist that is the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.030
 and you will see how it is that 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.709
 they deal with pacifists at that time 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.690
 Talking about it is also very 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.630
 interesting mainly at a time when 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.140
 In which Brazil recognizes marriage 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.480
 between homosexuals like the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.959
 United States of America at that time nor 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.270
 they gave as homosexuals they held 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.220
 people if they found out that she was 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.270
 gay is almost a thing and the new 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.100
 saudi 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.950
 for those who do not know of a good 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.920
 homosexual and usually has a mild 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.040
 touch of homosexuality in stories 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.560
 it is in this book that this aspect 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.260
 more open than mine at the beginning of 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.510
 book he is picking up very light he is 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.370
 very light indeed throughout free 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.500
 but here it gets very wide open 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.440
 because we have tourists and we have 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.299
 his feelings about the island and the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.489
 excerpts about the horrors of 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.100
 war are stunning and also spoke 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.840
 of the effects of war on the head 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.560
 soldiers when they return to the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.360
 House 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.220
 only that he prepared so much to die 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.100
 during the war that at the time they 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.110
 Come home they can not 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.330
 early the way you want to live like them 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.769
 lived before they can not stay 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.450
 talking about the story so this 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.000
 story seems that the free have a 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.910
 spoiler I consider now pass track 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.680
 in the second favorite book joão boy logo 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.659
 then the boy in the trade 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.939
 comment on the end of the book I 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.010
 really did not expect 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.349
 the issue is nice I found some 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.930
 Portuguese errors but not many 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.450
 for more at the beginning of the book and I do not 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.790
 I liked the cover but there goes from each one. 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.859
 the short alloy in the letters are large 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.579
 then everyone will be able to finish 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.889
 quickly 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.780
 I swear that when I just read not 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.810
 had the least idea of ​​building nests 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.860
 and mêda where I got so involved in the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.050
 narrative in the reading that I forgot 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.900
 dipensa a grade from 1 to 5 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.240
 seems a superfluous thing and this book 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.090
 Do this to me, he deserves nothing less. 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.370
