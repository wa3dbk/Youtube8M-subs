00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.120
 I bring to you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.790
 well I do not know what it is but I brought them 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 something that you can entertain this is going to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.710
 be the new biome of minecraft 0.10 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.710
 zero point 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.789
 how it's not going to be like this is not going to look 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:26.839
 the whole truth I 'm not like a guy who 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.839
 it's going to be like 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.780
 a type sky wars type floating islands 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.250
 that delimit what can happen to 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.790
 get to this point that seeing them 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.420
 farland the distant lands of of very 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.010
 far very far east 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.920
 and well imagine they will be able to 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.200
 be here but they will be able to be 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.540
 there were while they are going to be able to 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.360
 you are not going to see yourself like that you are not going to look for 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.320
 is going to see hook they will be able to walk 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.830
 between islands between floating islands back 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.830
 floating 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.970
 good to be able to change down here down 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.909
 to be something something I'm seeing diamond not 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.590
 something totally crazy 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.329
 and about the 0.10 baker and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.690
 vice english has end because minecraft 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:27.240
 run on the java platform I think 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.430
 I think it's like man is in java is 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.850
 intended for him to be 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.400
 infinitely or that is clearly what 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.740
 this causes that have no more 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.200
 data because java does not exist as much and 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.670
 infinite blouses how will you see when 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:52.180
 they are going to see a trunk stuck 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:56.770
 in the grass never in his life in the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.909
 favelas in the forlÃ¡n everything is possible 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.310
 it is also possible yes 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.979
