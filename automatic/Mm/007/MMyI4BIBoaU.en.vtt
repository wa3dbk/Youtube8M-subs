00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.109
 hello my name is Tanya I'm 27 years old I 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.059
 happy to the operator 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.929
 in childhood I dreamed of being standards 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.039
 also stressed that no rules 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.260
 shallow 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.090
 and for a long time does not remain indifferent therefore I 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.409
 did not understand how much I dreamed 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.569
 I think she might have been 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.429
 because it could have pushed year 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.739
 made 2 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.730
 I honestly do not quite understand 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.580
 as far as judged by photos 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.770
 after all, such a purchased delegation was made 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.210
 both world wars then I can't even 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.970
 remember how to react 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.540
 I like this with loved ones 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.780
 added prime so 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 like a miracle 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 success close people sometimes 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.830
 The report shows that I am not so relevant. 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.480
 for me, it's not just me that I don't want 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.570
 I do not know why she can pass for 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.330
 me even standards 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.090
 unexpected for an old man he said 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.280
 what are you sleeping 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.080
 in life so short awake for myself 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.530
 there is a semblance of death 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.000
 optimization mogilev here bye 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.210
 this verse is pitiable 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.160
 of my life since I really love to sleep 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.880
 a day ago I decided to go on 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 economic field because 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530
 Abrosim grenade 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.290
 probably didn't understand the company anymore 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.290
 own work of the museum director 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.229
 colors why the editorial meeting but 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.630
 what is remarkable what 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 obedient workers 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.280
 this is not the word that should 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.890
 to be an employee I love to be an employee 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.710
 like that time and workers were made 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.470
 without your job 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.810
 and then I really like these 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.600
 employees if they love the client if 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.200
 they understand products then march 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.260
 read by a very good employee 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.580
 it's all interesting that all light colors 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.450
 teams 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.569
 this is not a strange country 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.459
 revised 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.429
 pricing policy 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:15.369
 already ended that saying this why 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.369
 you don't do it before 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.229
 so the prosecutor's office 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:35.939
 strange your photos 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.260
 mapping animals for our 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.669
 the club 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:44.669
 i look like a cat 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.099
 because 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.089
 is very similar 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.319
 in general, I can read news 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.339
 as noted in the report of Alan that I 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.080
 I can be 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.130
 what if the solution is real 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.620
 tragedy what happens 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.599
 I really want to leave the residual tandems 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.409
 tragedy this contributes to the fact that 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.780
 just tough decisions
