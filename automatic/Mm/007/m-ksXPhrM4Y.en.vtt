family so we went in but I looked and I
saw<00:02:23.410> them<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.890> thought<00:02:23.920> hmm

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
saw them and I thought hmm

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.850 
saw them and I thought hmm
I'll<00:02:25.390> go<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.660> see<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:26.020> else<00:02:26.170> other<00:02:26.560> places

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
I'll go and see what else other places

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.660 
I'll go and see what else other places
have<00:02:27.280> but<00:02:28.170> no<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.440> basis<00:02:29.860> had<00:02:30.010> once<00:02:30.310> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
have but no of a basis had once to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.020 
have but no of a basis had once to
possess<00:02:31.110> really<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.500> thought<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:33.460> iPad

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
possess really and I thought this iPad

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.450 
possess really and I thought this iPad
case<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.630> now<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.680> was<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.980> cheapest<00:02:36.310> one

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
case and now this was the cheapest one

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.060 
case and now this was the cheapest one
they<00:02:36.610> had<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.240> was<00:02:37.390> ten<00:02:37.630> pounds<00:02:38.320> which<00:02:39.040> is

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
they had and it was ten pounds which is

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.480 
they had and it was ten pounds which is
a<00:02:39.220> really<00:02:39.550> good<00:02:39.790> buy<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.060> think<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:42.400> it

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
a really good buy I think because it

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.110 
a really good buy I think because it
Virginia<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.880> 39<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.690> for<00:02:44.170> Japan<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.730> saved

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
Virginia is 39 so for Japan so I saved

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.370 
Virginia is 39 so for Japan so I saved
30<00:02:47.050> quid<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.150> like<00:02:49.270> leather

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
30 quid on it and it's like leather

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.410 
30 quid on it and it's like leather
I<00:02:50.410> think<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.400> will<00:02:51.520> never<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.850> don't<00:02:52.090> know<00:02:52.150> and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
I think it will never I don't know and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.820 
I think it will never I don't know and
it's<00:02:52.540> got<00:02:52.690> like<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.840> zip<00:02:53.110> on<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.260> front<00:02:53.560> but

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
it's got like a zip on the front but

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.280 
it's got like a zip on the front but
stuffing<00:02:54.280> as<00:02:54.430> well<00:02:54.610> but<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.660> energy<00:02:55.750> is<00:02:56.110> is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
stuffing as well but the energy is is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.540 
stuffing as well but the energy is is
more<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.710> stone<00:02:57.160> one<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.830> you<00:02:59.920> open<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.370> up

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
more like a stone one so you open it up

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.460 
more like a stone one so you open it up
I<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.650> goes<00:03:02.830> in<00:03:03.360> slots<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.540> here<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.200> then

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
I like it goes in slots in here and then

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.880 
I like it goes in slots in here and then
you've<00:03:05.560> got<00:03:05.710> place<00:03:06.209> or<00:03:07.209> really<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.410> don't<00:03:08.620> know

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
you've got place or really I don't know

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.020

of video I think that's basically five
pound<00:04:19.930> off<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.880> think<00:04:21.880> so<00:04:22.420> is<00:04:22.630> about<00:04:22.720> 20<00:04:23.110> quid

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
pound off I think so is about 20 quid

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.740 
pound off I think so is about 20 quid
and<00:04:24.100> for<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.370> massive<00:04:24.730> towel<00:04:24.970> why<00:04:25.330> isn't<00:04:25.630> that
