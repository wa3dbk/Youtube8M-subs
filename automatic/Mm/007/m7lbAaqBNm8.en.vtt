00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
great and the way it was attached and I

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.680 
great and the way it was attached and I
was<00:00:16.410> also<00:00:16.710> able<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.010> get<00:00:17.340> some<00:00:17.690> hardwood

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
was also able to get some hardwood

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.380 
was also able to get some hardwood
flooring<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:19.740> wood<00:00:20.640> nice<00:00:21.000> kiln-dried

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
flooring for my wood nice kiln-dried

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.900 
flooring for my wood nice kiln-dried
hardwood<00:00:21.660> flooring<00:00:22.289> from<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.740> Amish<00:00:23.220> saw<00:00:23.670> mill

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
hardwood flooring from an Amish saw mill

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.300 
hardwood flooring from an Amish saw mill
that<00:00:24.029> makes<00:00:24.090> hardwood<00:00:24.660> flooring<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:26.220> at

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
that makes hardwood flooring so I was at

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
that makes hardwood flooring so I was at
least<00:00:26.460> able<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:27.029> some<00:00:27.269> good<00:00:28.199> wood<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
least able to get some good wood and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320 
least able to get some good wood and
we'll<00:00:29.220> see<00:00:29.369> if<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.699> any<00:00:29.849> issues<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
we'll see if I have any issues of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.700 
we'll see if I have any issues of
bridging<00:00:30.660> or<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.140> I've<00:00:31.260> only<00:00:31.349> got<00:00:31.619> about

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
bridging or not but I've only got about

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.520 
bridging or not but I've only got about
fifty<00:00:32.130> pounds<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.730> fuel<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.350> we'll

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
fifty pounds of fuel in here so we'll

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.130 
fifty pounds of fuel in here so we'll
pull<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.700> seal<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> goes<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.960> main

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
pull what the seal it goes the main

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.470 
pull what the seal it goes the main
thing<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.410> did<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.219> took<00:00:38.489> my<00:00:38.670> hinge<00:00:39.120> great

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
thing I did was I took my hinge great

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.110 
thing I did was I took my hinge great
and<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.230> limit<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.710> eliminated<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.940> went

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and I limit I eliminated it and I went

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.190 
and I limit I eliminated it and I went
to<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:43.460> great<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> swivel<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.899> center

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to a a great that's on a swivel a center

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
to a a great that's on a swivel a center
point<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.250> rock<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.760> back<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.120> forth

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
point so I can rock it back and forth

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
point so I can rock it back and forth
because<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.680> getting<00:00:49.800> too<00:00:50.160> much<00:00:50.280> char

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
because I was getting too much char

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
because I was getting too much char
depositing<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.690> side<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> gasifier

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
depositing on one side of the gasifier

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.819 
depositing on one side of the gasifier
than<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> other<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> by<00:00:54.660> doing<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
than the other and by doing that I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.680 
than the other and by doing that I
wasn't<00:00:56.670> getting<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> call<00:00:57.390> even

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
wasn't getting what I call even

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.299 
wasn't getting what I call even
distribution<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.680> char<00:00:58.890> coming<00:00:59.190> down

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
distribution of the char coming down

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.410 
distribution of the char coming down
through<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> heart<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> made<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.890> change

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
through the heart so I made that change

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.840 
through the heart so I made that change
I've<00:01:03.420> been<00:01:03.660> after<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.670> well<00:01:05.670> I've<00:01:05.760> been

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
I've been after about well I've been

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.310 
I've been after about well I've been

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.740 
into this for five minutes already and
I've<00:01:07.380> already<00:01:07.560> got

climbing my rates at 284 I'm running at

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.580 
climbing my rates at 284 I'm running at
about<00:01:19.160> two<00:01:19.790> inches<00:01:20.120> of<00:01:20.590> pressure

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
about two inches of pressure

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.240 
about two inches of pressure
differential<00:01:22.370> and<00:01:22.990> I'm<00:01:23.990> actually<00:01:24.500> as<00:01:24.830> a<00:01:24.860> total

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.040 
differential and I'm actually as a total
system<00:01:25.640> I'm<00:01:25.760> running<00:01:26.030> about<00:01:26.270> four<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.990> half

five<00:01:27.440> inches<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.800> water<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:30.200> can<00:01:30.350> see<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.710> if

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
five inches of water you can see that if

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.640 
five inches of water you can see that if
the<00:01:30.950> gas<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.160> coming<00:01:31.490> out<00:01:31.730> you<00:01:32.000> can<00:01:32.530> when<00:01:33.530> it

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
the gas is coming out you can when it

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.950 
the gas is coming out you can when it
first<00:01:33.830> started<00:01:34.130> coming<00:01:34.400> out<00:01:34.520> very<00:01:35.150> very<00:01:35.570> gray

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
first started coming out very very gray

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.220 
first started coming out very very gray
very<00:01:35.990> yellow<00:01:36.740> gray<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.400> but<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.510> time<00:01:38.750> goes<00:01:38.990> on

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
very yellow gray and but as time goes on

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.430 
very yellow gray and but as time goes on
that<00:01:40.090> yellow<00:01:41.090> gray<00:01:41.300> starts<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.840> disappear<00:01:42.320> and

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
that yellow gray starts to disappear and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.310 
that yellow gray starts to disappear and
it<00:01:42.560> becomes<00:01:42.830> more<00:01:43.100> grey<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:44.050> hopefully<00:01:45.050> and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
it becomes more grey and hopefully and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.410 
it becomes more grey and hopefully and
eventually<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.100> gas<00:01:46.640> coming<00:01:46.940> out<00:01:47.119> of<00:01:47.270> here

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
eventually the gas coming out of here

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.230 
eventually the gas coming out of here
will<00:01:48.080> be<00:01:48.710> almost<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.430> look<00:01:49.580> like<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.729> mist<00:01:50.030> or

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
will be almost just look like a mist or

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.150 
will be almost just look like a mist or
fog<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.229> hopefully<00:01:51.619> I'll<00:01:51.740> be<00:01:51.770> able<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.040> do

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
fog and hopefully I'll be able to do

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.790 
fog and hopefully I'll be able to do
that<00:01:52.310> for<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.580> whole<00:01:52.729> run<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.600> not<00:01:54.500> just<00:01:54.680> a

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
that for the whole run and not just a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.350 
that for the whole run and not just a
part<00:01:55.040> of<00:01:55.100> it<00:01:55.220> one<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.700> reasons<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:56.060> shut<00:01:56.270> her

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
part of it one of the reasons I shut her

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.850 
part of it one of the reasons I shut her
down<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.600> last<00:01:56.750> time<00:01:56.990> was<00:01:57.110> because<00:01:57.259> I<00:01:57.440> lost<00:01:57.710> my

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
down the last time was because I lost my

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.740 
down the last time was because I lost my
heart<00:01:58.160> temperature<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:59.000> then<00:01:59.390> I<00:01:59.450> wasn't

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
heart temperature and then I wasn't

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.020 
heart temperature and then I wasn't
producing<00:02:00.110> good<00:02:00.259> gas<00:02:00.470> so

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
producing good gas so

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.010 
producing good gas so
my<00:02:02.360> objective<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.020> produce<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.500> gas<00:02:03.710> that's

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
my objective is to produce a gas that's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.560 
my objective is to produce a gas that's
that's<00:02:06.020> easy<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.770> filtration<00:02:07.220> system

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
that's easy on the filtration system

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.400 
that's easy on the filtration system
whatever<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.780> might<00:02:08.960> be

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
whatever that might be

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.700 
whatever that might be
so<00:02:09.619> we'll<00:02:10.550> just<00:02:10.760> monitor<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.260> we'll

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
so we'll just monitor this and we'll

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.870 
so we'll just monitor this and we'll
pull<00:02:13.040> another<00:02:13.340> video<00:02:13.670> here<00:02:13.910> as<00:02:14.150> things<00:02:15.050> go

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
pull another video here as things go

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.400 
pull another video here as things go
okay<00:02:16.880> weasel<00:02:17.420> here<00:02:17.540> with<00:02:17.660> another<00:02:17.870> update

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
Amish go mill and I had to chunk it up a

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.470 
Amish go mill and I had to chunk it up a
little<00:02:47.620> bit<00:02:47.860> smaller<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.460> that's<00:02:49.000> all<00:02:49.180> killed

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
little bit smaller but that's all killed

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.710 
little bit smaller but that's all killed
with<00:02:49.720> kiln<00:02:50.020> dried<00:02:50.080> red<00:02:50.500> oak<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:52.480> has

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
with kiln dried red oak and that has

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.520 
with kiln dried red oak and that has
made<00:02:52.990> for<00:02:53.700> partly<00:02:54.700> for<00:02:55.060> some<00:02:55.330> good<00:02:56.140> success

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
made for partly for some good success

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.420 
made for partly for some good success
and<00:02:56.560> running<00:02:56.980> today

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430

so so far no hiccups it's been working
really<00:03:00.850> good<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:02.650> think<00:03:03.070> my<00:03:03.220> next<00:03:03.370> endeavor

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
really good and I think my next endeavor

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.560 
really good and I think my next endeavor
will<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.260> see<00:03:05.260> what<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.530> can<00:03:05.620> do<00:03:05.860> about

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
will be to see what I can do about

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.480 
will be to see what I can do about
filtering

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
filtering

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.120 
filtering
and<00:03:08.580> get<00:03:09.330> some<00:03:09.540> clean<00:03:10.140> gas<00:03:10.350> going<00:03:10.710> so<00:03:10.980> it's

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
and get some clean gas going so it's

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.220 
and get some clean gas going so it's
clean<00:03:11.430> enough<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:11.810> internal<00:03:12.810> combustion

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
clean enough for internal combustion

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.490 
gasifier test today I've been running
for<00:03:41.340> about<00:03:41.400> two<00:03:41.730> hours<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.300> 15<00:03:42.750> minutes<00:03:42.780> close

I have two objectives for today for two

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.940 
I have two objectives for today for two
different<00:03:55.270> things<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.110> try<00:03:56.140> today

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
different things to try today

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.030 
different things to try today
one<00:03:57.490> was<00:03:57.730> my<00:03:58.030> fuel<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:59.350> other<00:03:59.470> one<00:03:59.680> was<00:03:59.860> a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
one was my fuel and the other one was a

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.090 
one was my fuel and the other one was a
change<00:04:00.400> inside<00:04:01.150> my<00:04:01.480> gasifier<00:04:02.080> from<00:04:02.950> my

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
change inside my gasifier from my

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.790 
change inside my gasifier from my
previous<00:04:03.550> video<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.270> opening<00:04:05.140> up<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.260> gas<00:04:05.530> by

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
previous video and opening up the gas by

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.470 
previous video and opening up the gas by
looking<00:04:06.160> at<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.430> after<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.730> ran<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.240> didn't

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
looking at it after I ran it I didn't

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.250 
looking at it after I ran it I didn't
like<00:04:07.630> what<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.840> saw<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:09.880> felt<00:04:10.810> like<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.050> needed

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
like what I saw so I felt like I needed

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.830 
like what I saw so I felt like I needed
to<00:04:11.440> make<00:04:11.590> some<00:04:11.650> changes<00:04:12.120> in<00:04:13.120> order<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.540> see<00:04:13.720> if

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
to make some changes in order to see if

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.960 
to make some changes in order to see if
I<00:04:13.959> could<00:04:14.230> have<00:04:14.770> my<00:04:14.950> gasifier<00:04:15.550> run<00:04:15.790> more

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
I could have my gasifier run more

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.970 
I could have my gasifier run more
consistently<00:04:16.690> then<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.470> had<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.769> last

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
consistently then it had the last

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.180 
consistently then it had the last
several<00:04:18.700> times<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:19.480> my<00:04:19.660> fourth<00:04:20.190> gasifier

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
several times this is my fourth gasifier

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.659 
several times this is my fourth gasifier
run<00:04:21.549> then<00:04:22.210> my<00:04:22.419> second<00:04:22.870> gasifier<00:04:23.410> video<00:04:23.740> one<00:04:24.580> of

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
run then my second gasifier video one of

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.580 
run then my second gasifier video one of
the<00:04:24.730> things<00:04:24.940> I<00:04:25.120> did<00:04:25.330> was<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.690> did<00:04:25.750> find<00:04:26.140> an<00:04:26.290> Amish

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
the things I did was I did find an Amish

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.470 
the things I did was I did find an Amish
saw<00:04:26.800> mill<00:04:27.040> that<00:04:27.220> makes<00:04:27.280> hardwood<00:04:28.120> red<00:04:28.330> oak

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
saw mill that makes hardwood red oak

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.840 
saw mill that makes hardwood red oak
flooring<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.710> was<00:04:29.860> able<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.190> purchase<00:04:30.520> a

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
flooring and I was able to purchase a

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.310 
flooring and I was able to purchase a
55-gallon<00:04:31.419> barrel<00:04:32.200> of<00:04:32.610> nice<00:04:33.610> kiln<00:04:34.360> dried<00:04:34.660> red

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
oak flooring that just needed to be made

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.000 
oak flooring that just needed to be made
a<00:04:39.730> little<00:04:40.030> bit<00:04:40.120> smaller<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:41.290> wouldn't<00:04:41.830> have

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
a little bit smaller so I wouldn't have

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.400 
a little bit smaller so I wouldn't have
any<00:04:42.190> issues<00:04:43.090> with<00:04:43.120> bridging<00:04:43.840> inside<00:04:44.229> my

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
any issues with bridging inside my

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.740 
any issues with bridging inside my
gasifier<00:04:44.950> so<00:04:45.640> I<00:04:45.700> was<00:04:45.880> able<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.150> forget<00:04:46.630> the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
gasifier so I was able to forget the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.040 
gasifier so I was able to forget the
pellets<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.850> try<00:04:48.850> some<00:04:49.120> good<00:04:49.360> kiln-dried

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
pellets and try some good kiln-dried

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.100 
pellets and try some good kiln-dried
hardwood<00:04:51.030> which<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.210> what<00:04:52.389> I'm<00:04:52.510> running<00:04:52.660> today

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
hardwood which is what I'm running today

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.850 
hardwood which is what I'm running today
and<00:04:53.410> then<00:04:54.130> on<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.580> gasifier<00:04:55.360> itself<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:56.139> didn't

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
and then on the gasifier itself I didn't

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.590 
and then on the gasifier itself I didn't
like<00:04:57.010> what<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.250> saw<00:04:57.520> inside<00:04:57.910> when<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.150> opened<00:04:58.540> it

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
like what I saw inside when I opened it

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.490 
like what I saw inside when I opened it
up<00:04:58.750> and<00:04:58.930> originally<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.650> had<00:04:59.950> a<00:04:59.979> hinge<00:05:00.400> great

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
up and originally I had a hinge great

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.380 
up and originally I had a hinge great
for<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.680> char<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:03.100> come<00:05:03.280> down<00:05:03.520> and<00:05:03.820> I<00:05:04.120> think

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
for the char to come down and I think

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.710 
for the char to come down and I think
co2<00:05:04.570> is<00:05:04.750> depositing<00:05:05.640> more<00:05:06.640> char<00:05:06.970> on<00:05:07.180> one<00:05:07.390> side

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
co2 is depositing more char on one side

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.120 
co2 is depositing more char on one side
through<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.110> hearth<00:05:08.350> and<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.650> other<00:05:08.860> by

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
through the hearth and the other by

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.410 
through the hearth and the other by
virtue<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.729> hinge

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
virtue of the hinge

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.380 
virtue of the hinge
so<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:11.230> cut<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.620> hinge<00:05:11.860> out<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.730> welded<00:05:13.180> a

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
so I cut the hinge out and I welded a

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.750 
so I cut the hinge out and I welded a
center<00:05:13.690> post<00:05:13.930> on<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.290> grate<00:05:14.530> so<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.190> could<00:05:15.580> go

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
center post on the grate so I could go

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.410 
center post on the grate so I could go
with<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:17.040> great<00:05:18.040> that<00:05:18.340> I<00:05:18.370> can<00:05:18.520> rock<00:05:18.880> back<00:05:18.910> and

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
with a great that I can rock back and

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.660 
with a great that I can rock back and
forth<00:05:19.720> with<00:05:20.440> hopes<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:21.010> would<00:05:21.100> get<00:05:21.430> nice

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
forth with hopes that I would get nice

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.790 
forth with hopes that I would get nice
even<00:05:22.120> distribution<00:05:22.240> as<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.110> chars<00:05:23.380> coming

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
even distribution as the chars coming

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.700 
even distribution as the chars coming
down<00:05:23.980> through<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.340> heart<00:05:24.720> so<00:05:25.720> I<00:05:25.750> don't<00:05:26.560> have

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
down through the heart so I don't have

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.000 
down through the heart so I don't have
any<00:05:26.920> hotspots<00:05:27.190> or<00:05:27.760> lose<00:05:27.970> my<00:05:29.010> heart

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
any hotspots or lose my heart

any hotspots or lose my heart
temperature<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:31.300> other<00:05:31.420> thing<00:05:31.720> that<00:05:31.750> I've

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
temperature the other thing that I've

temperature the other thing that I've
noticed<00:05:32.230> today<00:05:32.590> is<00:05:32.860> firm<00:05:33.130> running<00:05:33.490> is<00:05:33.670> I've

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
noticed today is firm running is I've

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.860

hardly<00:05:45.400> touched<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:46.720> grate<00:05:46.960> at<00:05:47.110> all

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
hardly touched the the grate at all

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.240 
hardly touched the the grate at all
today<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:48.040> it's<00:05:48.490> just<00:05:48.760> been<00:05:49.000> going<00:05:49.980> on<00:05:50.980> its
