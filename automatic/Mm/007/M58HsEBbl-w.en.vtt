00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.070 
review for chapters 14 and 15 of hungry
Joker<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.840> things<00:00:10.830> seem<00:00:11.219> like<00:00:11.570> after<00:00:12.570> chapter

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
Joker and things seem like after chapter

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.919 
Joker and things seem like after chapter
15<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.799> series<00:00:14.549> definitely<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.299> setting<00:00:15.780> up

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
15 the series definitely is setting up

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.040 
15 the series definitely is setting up
for<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.529> guess<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.980> preparing<00:00:17.430> itself<00:00:17.820> for

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
for I guess it's preparing itself for

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.420 
for I guess it's preparing itself for
possible<00:00:19.050> cancellation<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.100> way<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.310> has

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
possible cancellation so that way it has

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.700 
possible cancellation so that way it has
an<00:00:20.609> actual<00:00:20.880> ending<00:00:21.300> which<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> bummer<00:00:22.020> but

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
an actual ending which is a bummer but

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.929 
an actual ending which is a bummer but
I'll<00:00:22.890> explain<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> minute

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
I'll explain that in a minute

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.599 
I'll explain that in a minute
so<00:00:24.390> chapter<00:00:24.810> 14<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.650> most<00:00:25.890> part<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.490> was

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so chapter 14 for the most part it was

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.250 
so chapter 14 for the most part it was
really<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.060> development<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> felt<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
really just development I felt for a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.479 
really just development I felt for a
nils<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:30.410> between<00:00:31.410> what<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
nils and between what it was and

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.670 
nils and between what it was and
ultimately<00:00:32.940> gonna<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.239> Eureka<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> he<00:00:34.500> got

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
ultimately gonna be Eureka that he got

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080 
ultimately gonna be Eureka that he got
from<00:00:34.950> his<00:00:35.070> grandmother<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.820> know<00:00:35.880> left

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
from his grandmother that you know left

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360 
from his grandmother that you know left
that<00:00:36.239> final<00:00:36.570> message<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.110> whatnot<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.829> shall

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
that final message and whatnot or shall

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.650 
that final message and whatnot or shall
I<00:00:38.399> say<00:00:38.700> her<00:00:38.940> grandmother

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
I say her grandmother

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
I say her grandmother
we'll<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.890> minute<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.250> well

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we'll get to that in a minute as well

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.959 
we'll get to that in a minute as well
but<00:00:42.500> it<00:00:43.500> kind<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> reminded<00:00:44.280> me<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.550> mean<00:00:44.789> it's

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
but it kind of reminded me I mean it's

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.819 
but it kind of reminded me I mean it's
not<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> kind<00:00:46.800> of

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
not what it is but like it kind of

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.010 
not what it is but like it kind of
reminded<00:00:47.190> me<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.280> kuma<00:00:47.730> morals<00:00:48.090> bankai<00:00:48.629> from

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
reminded me of kuma morals bankai from

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.110 
reminded me of kuma morals bankai from
bleach<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.820> really<00:00:51.090> that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
bleach but it's not really that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.990 
bleach but it's not really that
basically<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.960> guess<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> Eureka<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
basically I guess the Eureka what it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400 
basically I guess the Eureka what it
does<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.539> allows<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.140> imagine

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
does is it allows you to imagine

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
does is it allows you to imagine
whatever<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.039> want<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:57.030> comes<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
whatever you want and it comes to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.270 
whatever you want and it comes to
fruition<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.680> becomes<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.160> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
fruition and it just becomes like you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.040 
fruition and it just becomes like you
know<00:00:59.370> something<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.969> use<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.239> battle<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
know something you can use in battle the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
know something you can use in battle the
grandmother<00:01:01.500> made<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.160> maze<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
grandmother made the maze with the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.990 
grandmother made the maze with the
minions<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.470> Minotaur<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.250> Nils

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
minions in it then the Minotaur and Nils

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.210 
minions in it then the Minotaur and Nils
makes<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.630> giant<00:01:07.110> bull<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.710> anything<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
makes this giant bull or anything with a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730 
makes this giant bull or anything with a
cute<00:01:08.520> face<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.900> guess<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
cute face so I guess that's what it is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.450 
cute face so I guess that's what it is
but<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> way

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
but the way

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.609 
but the way
Nils<00:01:11.729> used<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.330> reminded<00:01:12.780> me<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.140> Kumar's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
Nils used it reminded me of like Kumar's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.990 
Nils used it reminded me of like Kumar's
bankai<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.640> Mills<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
bankai and I don't know if Mills is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
bankai and I don't know if Mills is
gonna<00:01:15.150> keep<00:01:15.299> using<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.560> Nils

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
gonna keep using it like that or if Nils

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.109 
gonna keep using it like that or if Nils
is<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:17.070> use<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.490> other<00:01:17.640> different<00:01:17.820> ways

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
is gonna use it in other different ways

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.270 
is gonna use it in other different ways
like<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.900> maybe<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.229> could<00:01:19.590> create<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> big

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
like you know maybe I could create a big

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.350 
like you know maybe I could create a big
death<00:01:21.590> machine<00:01:22.590> gun<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.130> crazy<00:01:23.610> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
death machine gun or some crazy so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
death machine gun or some crazy so
it<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:24.930> depends<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.380> how<00:01:25.560> those<00:01:25.830> wants<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it really depends on how those wants to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.710 
it really depends on how those wants to
keep<00:01:26.430> using<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> hopefully<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.270> doesn't<00:01:27.420> stay

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
keep using it hopefully it doesn't stay

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.929 
keep using it hopefully it doesn't stay
like<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> bull<00:01:28.909> you<00:01:29.909> know

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
like that with the bull you know

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
like that with the bull you know
attacking<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.900> whatnot<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.290> looking<00:01:31.650> like

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
attacking and whatnot like looking like

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
attacking and whatnot like looking like
kuma<00:01:32.009> Morrow's<00:01:32.340> bankai<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:32.939> police<00:01:33.119> because

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
kuma Morrow's bankai from police because

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.880 
kuma Morrow's bankai from police because
i<00:01:33.509> wasn't<00:01:33.689> feeling<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.140> too<00:01:34.409> much<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.680> felt

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
i wasn't feeling that too much I felt

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.020 
i wasn't feeling that too much I felt
like<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.369> could<00:01:35.520> create<00:01:35.670> whatever<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like if you could create whatever you

interesting<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.200> wasn't<00:01:46.409> too<00:01:46.619> hyped<00:01:46.860> about

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
interesting but I wasn't too hyped about

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.609 
interesting but I wasn't too hyped about
chapter<00:01:47.490> 14<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.270> would<00:01:48.630> give<00:01:48.810> chapter<00:01:49.229> 14

I<00:01:52.619> wasn't<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.340> too<00:01:53.520> keen<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.000> because

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I wasn't really too keen on that because

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.230 
I wasn't really too keen on that because
it<00:01:54.299> felt<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:55.009> more<00:01:56.009> something<00:01:56.520> I've<00:01:56.969> seen

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it felt like more something I've seen

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.789 
it felt like more something I've seen
already<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.810> something<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.680> could

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
already and something that they could

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
already and something that they could
have<00:01:58.920> done<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> lot<00:01:59.219> more<00:01:59.280> original<00:02:00.090> but

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
have done a lot more original but

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330 
have done a lot more original but
instead<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.930> kind<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.530> seeing<00:02:02.189> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
instead of kind of like seeing that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
instead of kind of like seeing that
you've<00:02:02.820> been<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:03.299> done<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
you've been there done that but at the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.810 
you've been there done that but at the
same<00:02:04.469> time<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:04.920> cool<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.189> see<00:02:05.340> Neil<00:02:05.549> step

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
same time it was cool to see Neil step

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.070 
same time it was cool to see Neil step
up<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.540> was<00:02:06.750> okay<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.200> chapter<00:02:07.770> 15<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
up so it was okay but chapter 15 that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
up so it was okay but chapter 15 that
 like<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.860> totally<00:02:11.220> tell<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
 like you can totally tell that the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.000 
 like you can totally tell that the
author<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.970> really<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.540> doing<00:02:13.230> two<00:02:13.530> things

that we're in the day and age where the

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.410 
that we're in the day and age where the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
balls to the wall at this point to try

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.280

everything he can and at the same time

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.229 
everything he can and at the same time
he's<00:02:25.470> setting<00:02:25.739> up<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.549> possible

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
he's setting up for a possible

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.380 
he's setting up for a possible
cancellation<00:02:28.140> now<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.860> 15<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> believe<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:30.209> was

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
cancellation now in 15 I believe it was

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.259 
cancellation now in 15 I believe it was
a<00:02:30.450> chapter<00:02:31.010> where<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.250> seemed<00:02:32.459> as<00:02:32.579> though<00:02:32.610> cuz

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
a chapter where it seemed as though cuz

a chapter where it seemed as though cuz
after<00:02:33.450> they'd<00:02:33.720> be<00:02:33.840> told<00:02:34.049> oh<00:02:34.110> my<00:02:34.230> geez<00:02:34.409> they

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
a shot of what appears to be knows is a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.460 
a shot of what appears to be knows is a
girl<00:02:39.239> maybe<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.079> looked<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.440> though

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
girl maybe because it looked as though

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.890 
girl maybe because it looked as though
Nils<00:02:41.159> was<00:02:41.370> kind<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:42.390> had<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.569> chest

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
Nils was kind of like like had a chest

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.809 
Nils was kind of like like had a chest
and<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.319> there<00:02:43.980> was<00:02:44.099> bad<00:02:44.340> news<00:02:44.549> wrapped

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
and like there was bad news wrapped

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.240 
and like there was bad news wrapped
around<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.359> his<00:02:45.629> hair<00:02:46.230> hurts<00:02:46.590> has<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.190> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
around like his hair hurts has so to

speak

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.670 
speak
and<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.970> would<00:02:48.090> also<00:02:48.239> make<00:02:48.480> sense<00:02:48.540> why<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and it would also make sense why it's a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.220 
and it would also make sense why it's a
fierce<00:02:50.040> bull<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.209> has<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.390> cute<00:02:51.720> face<00:02:51.930> so

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
fierce bull but it has a cute face so

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.410 
fierce bull but it has a cute face so
Nils<00:02:52.650> might<00:02:52.920> actually<00:02:53.099> be<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.489> female<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.329> how

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
really like shows that the author is

the<00:04:51.860> series<00:04:52.129> is<00:04:52.189> ending<00:04:52.460> but<00:04:52.520> what<00:04:52.639> do<00:04:52.699> you

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
guys think as far as this whole thing

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.659 
guys think as far as this whole thing
goes<00:04:55.460> do<00:04:55.729> you<00:04:55.789> think<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.330> you<00:04:57.199> know<00:04:57.669> Heidi's

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
goes do you think that you know Heidi's

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.890 
goes do you think that you know Heidi's
brother's<00:04:59.030> showing<00:04:59.300> up<00:04:59.419> means<00:04:59.569> that<00:04:59.810> the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
brother's showing up means that the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.300 
brother's showing up means that the
series<00:05:00.169> is<00:05:00.229> like<00:05:00.409> gonna<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:00.949> I<00:05:00.979> mean<00:05:01.189> it's

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
series is like gonna and so I mean it's

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.920 
series is like gonna and so I mean it's
been<00:05:01.460> doing<00:05:01.669> really<00:05:02.120> bad<00:05:02.330> in<00:05:02.509> the<00:05:02.569> rankings

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
been doing really bad in the rankings

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.230 
been doing really bad in the rankings
like<00:05:03.110> last<00:05:03.740> week<00:05:04.009> it<00:05:04.189> was<00:05:04.250> second-to-last<00:05:04.819> I

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
like last week it was second-to-last I

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.879 
like last week it was second-to-last I
think<00:05:05.449> the<00:05:05.509> week<00:05:05.659> prior<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.229> was<00:05:06.379> last<00:05:06.590> place

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
think the week prior it was last place

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.219 
think the week prior it was last place
so<00:05:07.210> I'm<00:05:08.210> pretty<00:05:08.419> sure<00:05:08.539> that<00:05:08.689> the<00:05:08.840> series<00:05:09.080> might

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
so I'm pretty sure that the series might

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.050 
so I'm pretty sure that the series might
be<00:05:09.349> on<00:05:09.469> me<00:05:09.590> pretty<00:05:09.770> soon<00:05:10.009> but<00:05:10.159> again<00:05:10.340> let<00:05:11.000> me

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
be on me pretty soon but again let me

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.369 
be on me pretty soon but again let me
know<00:05:11.150> what<00:05:11.270> you<00:05:11.330> think<00:05:11.479> this<00:05:11.930> series<00:05:12.139> has<00:05:12.349> been

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
might be the depth of the series and

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.140 
might be the depth of the series and
also<00:06:16.250> as<00:06:16.339> far<00:06:16.430> as<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.580> rankings<00:06:16.909> though<00:06:17.029> I'm

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
not going to be including the last ones

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:19.990 
not going to be including the last ones
because<00:06:18.710> they're<00:06:19.129> irrelevant<00:06:19.339> at<00:06:19.610> this<00:06:19.759> point

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
because they're irrelevant at this point
