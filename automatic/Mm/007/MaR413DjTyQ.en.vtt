research projects so today i'm going to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.779 
research projects so today i'm going to
review<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.939> five<00:00:24.500> types<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.949> research

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
review the five types of research

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.750 
review the five types of research
methods<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.320> should<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:28.800> familiar<00:00:29.310> with

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
methods and you should be familiar with

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.400 
methods and you should be familiar with
these<00:00:30.449> names<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.579> what<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.730> need<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.450> an

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
these names and what they need as an

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.729 
these names and what they need as an
academic<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.660> student<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
academic as a student at the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.780 
academic as a student at the
undergraduate<00:00:38.250> level<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.530> getting<00:00:40.530> into

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
undergraduate level and getting into

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.049 
undergraduate level and getting into
graduate<00:00:41.790> level<00:00:42.149> studies<00:00:42.649> okay<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.190> five<00:00:44.579> main

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
graduate level studies okay so five main

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
graduate level studies okay so five main
types<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.719> research<00:00:46.110> methods<00:00:46.710> i'm<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
types of research methods i'm going to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.770 
types of research methods i'm going to
start<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:48.680> lowest<00:00:50.270> effectiveness<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.570> go

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
start from lowest effectiveness and go

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.430 
start from lowest effectiveness and go
to<00:00:52.199> high<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.360> some<00:00:54.360> people<00:00:54.719> would<00:00:54.870> say<00:00:54.930> from

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
to high so some people would say from

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
to high so some people would say from
the<00:00:55.559> easiest<00:00:56.070> method<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> most<00:00:57.090> difficult

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the easiest method to the most difficult

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.290 
the easiest method to the most difficult
method<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.949> i'll<00:00:59.039> start<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.030> first

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
method so i'll start with the first

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.509 
method so i'll start with the first
research<00:01:00.840> method<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:02.120> qualitative

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
research method is qualitative

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.070 
research method is qualitative
qualitative<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:06.000> remember<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.869> word

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
qualitative you can remember this word

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.149 
qualitative you can remember this word
because<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> looks<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.270> quality<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
because it looks like quality and

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.859 
because it looks like quality and
qualitative<00:01:11.159> research<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.090> basically

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
qualitative research is basically

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.910 
qualitative research is basically
describing<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.549> qualities<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.920> topic

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
describing the qualities of the topic

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.820 
describing the qualities of the topic
that<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.220> researching<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.590> might

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that you're researching so you might

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.679 
that you're researching so you might
observe<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.240> topic<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.380> you're

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
observe a topic that you're

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.559 
observe a topic that you're
you<00:01:24.689> might<00:01:25.020> interview<00:01:25.979> people<00:01:26.219> about<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
you might interview people about the

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.899 
you might interview people about the
topic<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> you're<00:01:28.289> researching<00:01:28.909> it's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
topic that you're researching it's

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
topic that you're researching it's
basically<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.569> description<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.130> way

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
basically a description of the way

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.450 
basically a description of the way
things<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> when<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.469> qualitative

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
things are and when I think qualitative

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.410 
things are and when I think qualitative
research<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.179> think<00:01:36.569> feelings<00:01:38.030> it's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.149> little

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
research I think feelings it's a little

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.139 
research I think feelings it's a little
more<00:01:39.600> subjective<00:01:39.990> than<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.340> next<00:01:41.700> kind<00:01:41.939> of

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
more subjective than the next kind of

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.649 
more subjective than the next kind of
research<00:01:42.569> that<00:01:42.929> I'd<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.859> to<00:01:43.950> talk<00:01:44.130> about

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
research that I'd like to talk about

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.260 
research that I'd like to talk about
quantitative

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
quantitative

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.990 
quantitative
the<00:01:47.140> second<00:01:47.500> kind<00:01:47.649> of<00:01:47.859> research<00:01:48.280> method<00:01:48.850> that

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
the second kind of research method that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.330 
the second kind of research method that
I'm<00:01:49.119> talking<00:01:49.509> about<00:01:49.719> today<00:01:49.899> is<00:01:50.340> quantitative

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
I'm talking about today is quantitative

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.840 
I'm talking about today is quantitative
research<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.210> this<00:01:52.810> looks<00:01:53.109> like<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.530> word

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
research and this looks like the word

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.209 
research and this looks like the word
quantity<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.390> can<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:56.049> remember<00:01:56.560> this

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
quantity so can you can remember this

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.520 
quantity so can you can remember this
word<00:01:57.549> because<00:01:57.939> it<00:01:57.969> has<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.450> do<00:01:58.600> with<00:01:58.810> numbers

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
word because it has to do with numbers

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.429 
word because it has to do with numbers
any<00:02:00.069> kind<00:02:00.579> of<00:02:00.729> research<00:02:01.119> where<00:02:01.780> you're<00:02:02.140> going

much how many how often you look at the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.569 
much how many how often you look at the
frequency<00:02:24.849> of<00:02:25.090> events<00:02:26.049> or<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.650> might<00:02:26.829> look<00:02:27.220> at

this<00:02:45.819> is<00:02:45.849> a<00:02:46.000> little<00:02:46.090> more<00:02:46.329> difficult<00:02:46.810> than

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
this is a little more difficult than

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.610 
this is a little more difficult than
qualitative<00:02:48.489> or<00:02:48.700> quantitative<00:02:49.049> research<00:02:50.049> or

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
qualitative or quantitative research or

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.740 
qualitative or quantitative research or
it<00:02:50.769> can<00:02:51.010> be<00:02:51.040> more<00:02:51.400> difficult<00:02:51.639> because<00:02:52.030> you're

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
it can be more difficult because you're

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.039 
it can be more difficult because you're
comparing<00:02:53.350> two<00:02:54.190> or<00:02:54.400> more<00:02:54.670> different<00:02:55.120> sources

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
comparing two or more different sources

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.569 
comparing two or more different sources
of<00:02:56.170> information<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:58.329> correlates<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.950> look

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
of information to correlates is to look

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.090 
of information to correlates is to look
at<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.819> connection<00:03:01.510> between<00:03:02.100> different

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
at a connection between different

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.120 
at a connection between different
sources<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.850> information<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:05.590> you're<00:03:05.769> looking

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
sources of information so you're looking

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.890 
sources of information so you're looking
at<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> strength<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.150> relationship

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
at the strength of a relationship

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.770 
at the strength of a relationship
between<00:03:08.200> two<00:03:08.739> topics<00:03:09.750> for<00:03:10.750> example<00:03:11.470> teachers

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
between two topics for example teachers

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.839 
between two topics for example teachers
qualifications<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.139> their<00:03:14.980> students

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
qualifications and their students

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.390 
qualifications and their students
success<00:03:16.420> these<00:03:17.349> are<00:03:17.500> two<00:03:17.650> different<00:03:17.680> topics

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
success these are two different topics

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.699 
success these are two different topics
you<00:03:18.819> can<00:03:18.970> see<00:03:19.209> if<00:03:19.299> they're<00:03:19.510> related<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:20.530> might

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
you can see if they're related you might

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.500 
you can see if they're related you might
see<00:03:20.950> if<00:03:21.010> they're<00:03:21.250> related<00:03:21.819> through

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
see if they're related through

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.650 
see if they're related through
quantitative<00:03:23.170> research<00:03:23.859> so<00:03:24.389> well<00:03:25.389> you're

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
quantitative research so well you're

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.410 
quantitative research so well you're
looking<00:03:25.989> at<00:03:26.319> a<00:03:26.709> correlational<00:03:27.400> analysis<00:03:28.060> you

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
looking at a correlational analysis you

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
looking at a correlational analysis you
might<00:03:28.569> have<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.810> use

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
might have to use

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.490 
might have to use
they're<00:03:29.590> kind<00:03:29.710> of<00:03:29.890> research<00:03:30.550> to<00:03:31.200> get<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.320> to

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
they're kind of research to get you to

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.540 
they're kind of research to get you to
analyze<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.580> correlation<00:03:34.210> okay<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.950> that's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
analyze the correlation okay so that's

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.430 
analyze the correlation okay so that's
our<00:03:36.700> third<00:03:37.060> research<00:03:37.510> method<00:03:37.960> let's<00:03:38.230> take<00:03:38.410> a

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
our third research method let's take a

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.100 
our third research method let's take a
look<00:03:38.740> at<00:03:38.860> for<00:03:39.420> fourth<00:03:40.420> kind<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.780> research

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
look at for fourth kind of research

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.090 
look at for fourth kind of research
method<00:03:41.590> is<00:03:42.180> experimental<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.500> a

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
method is experimental this is a

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.660 
method is experimental this is a
scientific<00:03:45.520> method<00:03:46.360> where<00:03:47.020> you<00:03:47.560> have<00:03:47.800> two

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
scientific method where you have two

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.120 
scientific method where you have two
groups<00:03:48.970> or<00:03:49.360> maybe<00:03:49.930> more<00:03:50.200> than<00:03:50.230> two<00:03:50.500> groups<00:03:50.770> but

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
groups or maybe more than two groups but

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.470 
groups or maybe more than two groups but
one<00:03:51.610> group<00:03:51.850> is<00:03:52.240> a<00:03:52.690> control<00:03:53.320> group<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
one group is a control group and the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.530 
one group is a control group and the
other<00:03:55.690> group<00:03:56.020> you<00:03:56.520> intervene<00:03:57.520> you<00:03:57.910> apply<00:03:58.240> some

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
other group you intervene you apply some

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.260 
other group you intervene you apply some
treatment<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.230> so<00:03:59.770> for<00:03:59.950> example<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.670> am<00:04:01.000> an

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
treatment to so for example I am an

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.570 
treatment to so for example I am an
English<00:04:01.810> teacher<00:04:02.020> let's<00:04:02.410> say<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.620> have<00:04:02.680> two

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
English teacher let's say I have two

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.240 
English teacher let's say I have two
English<00:04:04.240> classes<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.170> they're<00:04:05.710> relatively

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
English classes and they're relatively

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.460 
English classes and they're relatively
similar<00:04:06.640> let's<00:04:07.120> say<00:04:07.300> they're<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.540> same<00:04:07.990> level

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
similar let's say they're the same level

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.110 
similar let's say they're the same level
they're<00:04:08.800> both<00:04:08.980> intermediate<00:04:09.910> english

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
they're both intermediate english

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.260 
they're both intermediate english
classes<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.290> let's<00:04:11.860> say<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.490> all<00:04:13.210> the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
classes and let's say that all the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.170 
classes and let's say that all the
students<00:04:13.900> are<00:04:14.230> from<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:15.070> same<00:04:15.280> country<00:04:15.910> just

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
students are from the same country just

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.240 
students are from the same country just
to<00:04:16.269> make<00:04:16.480> this<00:04:16.660> easy<00:04:16.989> let's<00:04:17.350> say<00:04:17.500> all<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:17.859> my

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
to make this easy let's say all of my

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.699 
to make this easy let's say all of my
students<00:04:18.640> in<00:04:18.820> both<00:04:19.030> classes<00:04:19.359> are<00:04:19.840> from<00:04:20.290> Japan

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
students in both classes are from Japan

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.660 
students in both classes are from Japan
and<00:04:21.040> they're<00:04:21.700> all<00:04:21.910> between<00:04:22.440> 22<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.470> 25<00:04:24.310> years

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
and they're all between 22 and 25 years

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.000 
and they're all between 22 and 25 years
old<00:04:24.970> all<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:26.020> intermediate<00:04:26.290> level<00:04:26.920> of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
old all the intermediate level of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.660 
old all the intermediate level of
English<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.750> there's<00:04:29.350> an<00:04:29.500> even<00:04:29.680> mix<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.340> male

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
English and there's an even mix of male

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.850 
English and there's an even mix of male
and<00:04:30.700> female<00:04:31.060> students<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.200> there<00:04:32.560> are<00:04:32.590> two

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
and female students so there are two

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.030 
and female students so there are two
very<00:04:33.430> similar<00:04:33.850> groups<00:04:34.330> one<00:04:35.169> class<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.830> just

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
very similar groups one class I just

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.700 
very similar groups one class I just
teach<00:04:36.520> as<00:04:36.790> normal<00:04:37.270> that's<00:04:37.780> my<00:04:37.990> control<00:04:38.470> group

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
teach as normal that's my control group

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.480 
teach as normal that's my control group
my<00:04:39.640> other<00:04:40.030> group<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.840> might<00:04:41.590> try<00:04:41.890> some<00:04:42.250> new

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
my other group I might try some new

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.909 
my other group I might try some new
method<00:04:42.880> of<00:04:43.000> teaching<00:04:43.320> that<00:04:44.320> is<00:04:44.650> my

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
method of teaching that is my

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.790 
method of teaching that is my
intervention<00:04:45.640> so<00:04:46.510> then<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:46.780> can<00:04:47.169> compare<00:04:47.620> the

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
intervention so then I can compare the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.700 
intervention so then I can compare the
results<00:04:48.310> from<00:04:48.520> two<00:04:49.000> classes<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.560> my

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
results from two classes and that is my

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.040 
results from two classes and that is my
experiment<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.760> see<00:04:52.000> if<00:04:52.030> my<00:04:52.419> new

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
experiment to see if my new

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.610 
experiment to see if my new
of<00:04:53.199> teaching<00:04:53.830> worked<00:04:54.520> if<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.120> was<00:04:55.270> successful

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
of teaching worked if it was successful

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.950 
of teaching worked if it was successful
if<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.830> helped<00:04:57.129> my<00:04:57.250> students<00:04:57.759> or<00:04:57.909> not<00:04:58.210> so

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
if it helped my students or not so

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.770 
if it helped my students or not so
that's<00:04:59.229> a<00:04:59.349> simple<00:04:59.530> example<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.780> experimental

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
that's a simple example of experimental

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.800 
that's a simple example of experimental
research<00:05:02.490> there's<00:05:03.490> also<00:05:05.520> quasi-experimental

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
research there's also quasi-experimental

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.080 
research there's also quasi-experimental
which<00:05:07.810> my<00:05:08.259> example<00:05:08.770> would<00:05:08.889> actually<00:05:09.280> be<00:05:09.430> quasi

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
which my example would actually be quasi

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.589 
which my example would actually be quasi
experimental<00:05:10.930> because<00:05:11.349> I<00:05:11.710> did<00:05:12.039> not<00:05:12.069> choose<00:05:12.639> my

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
experimental because I did not choose my

experimental because I did not choose my
participants<00:05:14.139> randomly<00:05:15.099> so<00:05:15.970> it's<00:05:16.120> important

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
participants randomly so it's important

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.770 
participants randomly so it's important
to<00:05:16.750> have<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.900> truly<00:05:17.610> experimental<00:05:18.610> study<00:05:19.120> to

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
to have a truly experimental study to

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.070 
to have a truly experimental study to
choose<00:05:20.110> participants<00:05:21.270> randomly<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.780> you

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
choose participants randomly that you

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.300 
choose participants randomly that you
are<00:05:23.639> intervening<00:05:24.639> with<00:05:25.120> so<00:05:25.750> that's

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
are intervening with so that's

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.770 
are intervening with so that's
impossible<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.460> do<00:05:27.580> with<00:05:27.699> my<00:05:27.879> example<00:05:28.479> because

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
impossible to do with my example because

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.170 
impossible to do with my example because
I<00:05:29.020> have<00:05:29.620> my<00:05:29.889> two<00:05:29.949> classes<00:05:30.370> they're<00:05:30.909> already

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
I have my two classes they're already

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.760 
I have my two classes they're already
separated<00:05:31.539> I<00:05:32.169> can't<00:05:32.560> randomly<00:05:33.810> apply<00:05:34.810> my<00:05:35.139> new

both<00:05:39.610> classes<00:05:39.909> because<00:05:40.449> that<00:05:40.990> would<00:05:41.139> be

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
both classes because that would be

both classes because that would be
unfair<00:05:42.129> and<00:05:42.310> unrealistic<00:05:42.819> okay<00:05:43.300> but<00:05:43.990> we<00:05:44.080> have

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
unfair and unrealistic okay but we have

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.670 
unfair and unrealistic okay but we have

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
that you treat differently great okay

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.459 
that you treat differently great okay
let's<00:05:57.789> look<00:05:57.909> at<00:05:58.029> our<00:05:58.180> last<00:05:58.599> kind<00:05:59.050> of<00:05:59.169> research

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
let's look at our last kind of research

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:04.350 
let's look at our last kind of research
method<00:06:02.460> meta-analysis<00:06:03.460> is<00:06:03.759> a<00:06:03.819> research

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
method meta-analysis is a research

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.010 
method meta-analysis is a research
method<00:06:04.930> where<00:06:05.469> you<00:06:05.830> look<00:06:06.669> at<00:06:06.940> similar<00:06:07.360> studies

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
method where you look at similar studies

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.480 
method where you look at similar studies
and<00:06:08.639> you<00:06:09.639> compare<00:06:10.330> them<00:06:10.569> through<00:06:11.529> looking<00:06:11.800> to

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
and you compare them through looking to

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.490 
and you compare them through looking to
synthesize<00:06:13.389> or<00:06:14.490> put<00:06:15.490> together<00:06:15.930> results<00:06:16.930> from

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
synthesize or put together results from

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.550 
synthesize or put together results from
several<00:06:18.190> studies<00:06:18.520> that<00:06:19.029> are<00:06:19.569> similar<00:06:20.529> that

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
several studies that are similar that

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.450 
several studies that are similar that
applied<00:06:21.460> a<00:06:21.490> similar<00:06:22.210> intervention<00:06:23.169> okay<00:06:23.889> so

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
applied a similar intervention okay so

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.740 
applied a similar intervention okay so
for<00:06:25.419> example<00:06:25.569> if<00:06:26.409> I'm<00:06:26.650> looking<00:06:27.099> at<00:06:27.509> whether<00:06:28.509> my

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
for example if I'm looking at whether my

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.170 
for example if I'm looking at whether my
new<00:06:28.990> teaching<00:06:29.560> method<00:06:29.590> would<00:06:30.159> be<00:06:30.190> effective<00:06:30.940> I

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
new teaching method would be effective I

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.300 
new teaching method would be effective I
might<00:06:31.779> look<00:06:31.960> at<00:06:32.110> other<00:06:32.379> studies<00:06:32.919> where

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
might look at other studies where

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.510 
might look at other studies where
teachers<00:06:33.580> have<00:06:34.029> used<00:06:34.389> the<00:06:34.900> same<00:06:35.169> new<00:06:35.979> teaching

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
teachers have used the same new teaching

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.170 
teachers have used the same new teaching
method<00:06:36.990> may<00:06:37.990> be<00:06:38.050> for<00:06:38.529> example<00:06:38.590> using<00:06:39.430> videos

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
method may be for example using videos

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.930 
method may be for example using videos
like<00:06:40.449> this<00:06:40.690> in<00:06:40.900> the<00:06:40.990> classroom<00:06:41.590> and<00:06:41.740> I<00:06:42.580> might

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
like this in the classroom and I might

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.070 
like this in the classroom and I might
compare<00:06:43.449> the<00:06:43.629> results<00:06:44.139> they've<00:06:44.440> found<00:06:44.710> to<00:06:45.490> see

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
compare the results they've found to see

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.379 
compare the results they've found to see
the<00:06:47.080> average<00:06:47.289> to<00:06:48.009> see<00:06:48.190> the<00:06:48.310> synthesis<00:06:48.940> of<00:06:49.120> the

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
the average to see the synthesis of the

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.959 
the average to see the synthesis of the
results<00:06:49.870> so<00:06:50.379> that's<00:06:50.699> meta-analysis<00:06:51.699> and

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:51.969 
results so that's meta-analysis and

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:53.730 
results so that's meta-analysis and
because<00:06:52.419> you're<00:06:52.539> drawing<00:06:52.900> from<00:06:53.199> a<00:06:53.319> lot<00:06:53.560> of

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
because you're drawing from a lot of

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.350 
because you're drawing from a lot of
different<00:06:54.069> studies<00:06:54.520> a<00:06:54.610> lot<00:06:54.879> of<00:06:55.029> different

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
different studies a lot of different

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.950 
different studies a lot of different
people's<00:06:55.719> work<00:06:56.110> and<00:06:56.409> the<00:06:56.770> results<00:06:57.279> its

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
people's work and the results its

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.119 
people's work and the results its
strongest<00:06:58.960> out<00:06:59.259> of<00:06:59.440> all<00:06:59.650> the<00:06:59.830> research

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:00.129 
strongest out of all the research

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.060 
strongest out of all the research
methods<00:07:00.639> but<00:07:01.270> it's<00:07:01.960> just<00:07:02.229> it's<00:07:02.500> different

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
methods but it's just it's different

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.670 
methods but it's just it's different
these<00:07:03.699> methods<00:07:04.120> are<00:07:04.210> all<00:07:04.419> different<00:07:04.750> and<00:07:05.169> you

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
these methods are all different and you

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.159 
these methods are all different and you
choose<00:07:05.949> the<00:07:06.520> right<00:07:06.789> one<00:07:06.820> for<00:07:07.090> your<00:07:07.539> project

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
choose the right one for your project

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.529 
choose the right one for your project
and<00:07:08.350> more<00:07:08.620> assignment<00:07:09.430> but<00:07:10.120> it's<00:07:10.240> good<00:07:10.389> to

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:10.539 
and more assignment but it's good to

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:12.870 
and more assignment but it's good to
have<00:07:10.690> a<00:07:10.750> basic<00:07:11.289> understanding<00:07:11.410> of<00:07:12.009> what<00:07:12.520> each

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
have a basic understanding of what each

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.480 
have a basic understanding of what each
kind<00:07:13.630> of<00:07:13.900> research<00:07:14.199> means<00:07:14.680> and<00:07:15.130> what<00:07:15.340> is

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
kind of research means and what is

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.200 
kind of research means and what is
involved<00:07:16.060> in<00:07:16.449> each<00:07:17.169> procedure<00:07:17.880> so<00:07:18.880> I<00:07:18.910> hope

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
involved in each procedure so I hope

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.439 
involved in each procedure so I hope
that<00:07:19.479> this<00:07:20.259> presentation<00:07:21.009> helps<00:07:21.759> and<00:07:21.940> then

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449 
that this presentation helps and then

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:23.790 
that this presentation helps and then
now<00:07:22.600> you're<00:07:22.750> a<00:07:22.810> little<00:07:23.080> more<00:07:23.259> familiar<00:07:23.470> with

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
now you're a little more familiar with

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.300 
now you're a little more familiar with
five<00:07:24.460> main<00:07:25.449> types<00:07:26.080> of<00:07:26.440> research<00:07:26.770> methods

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
five main types of research methods

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.700
