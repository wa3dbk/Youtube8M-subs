00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
but with all that being said what do I

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.979 
but with all that being said what do I
think<00:02:23.319> about<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.950> texas<00:02:24.310> chainsaw<00:02:24.340> 3d<00:02:25.150> well

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
there again right off the bat the title

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.199 
there again right off the bat the title
kind<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.420> throws<00:02:28.660> me<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.930> bit<00:02:29.340> why<00:02:30.340> ruin<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:31.090> good

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
kind of throws me a bit why ruin a good

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.089 
kind of throws me a bit why ruin a good
thing<00:02:31.269> even<00:02:31.959> if<00:02:32.170> you're<00:02:32.319> cashing<00:02:32.739> in<00:02:32.830> for<00:02:32.860> the

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
thing even if you're cashing in for the

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.970 
thing even if you're cashing in for the
dollars<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.790> title<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:35.560> that's<00:02:35.800> what's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
dollars the title because that's what's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.070 
dollars the title because that's what's
going<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.160> bring<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> most<00:02:36.730> money<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:38.050> I

going to bring you the most money and I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.890 
going to bring you the most money and I
think<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.890> main<00:02:39.130> reason<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:40.060> because<00:02:40.269> of<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
think the main reason is because of the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.089 
think the main reason is because of the
recent<00:02:42.690> massacre<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.170> will<00:02:44.380> or<00:02:44.680> whatever
