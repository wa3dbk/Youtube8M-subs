so oily I have to wash my hair every day
and<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.770> reason<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.789> wash

and the reason that you have to wash
your<00:00:57.000> hair<00:00:57.300> every<00:00:57.510> day<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.770> you're

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
your hair every day is because you're

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.250 
your hair every day is because you're
washing<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.520> every<00:00:59.730> day<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> wash<00:01:01.230> your

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
washing it every day when you wash your

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.920 
washing it every day when you wash your
hair<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.920> removes<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.820> sebum<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:03.780> your

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
hair it removes the sebum from your

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.120 
hair it removes the sebum from your
glands<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:05.129> scalp<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:07.130> produce

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
glands and your scalp has to produce

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.270 
glands and your scalp has to produce
more<00:01:08.729> oil<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.630> oil<00:01:09.689> than<00:01:10.110> before<00:01:10.590> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
more oil and more oil than before to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
more oil and more oil than before to
substitute<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> fact<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.170> had

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
substitute for the fact that you had

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
substitute for the fact that you had
just<00:01:13.320> removed<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.369> oil

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
just removed all of that oil

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.190 
just removed all of that oil
so<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.150> shampooing<00:01:15.540> every<00:01:15.810> day<00:01:15.930> you're

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
so by shampooing every day you're

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
so by shampooing every day you're
constantly<00:01:16.710> stripping<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:17.610> hair<00:01:17.670> down<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
constantly stripping your hair down and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.090 
constantly stripping your hair down and
your<00:01:18.659> scalp<00:01:18.990> kind<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.350> goes<00:01:19.470> into<00:01:19.770> overdrive

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
your scalp kind of goes into overdrive

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.030 
your scalp kind of goes into overdrive
reducing<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.479> amount<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.750> oil<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> get<00:01:22.920> your

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
reducing the amount of oil to get your

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
reducing the amount of oil to get your
scalp<00:01:23.310> back<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.670> where<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> because

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
scalp back to where it was so because

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
scalp back to where it was so because
it's<00:01:25.799> doing<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.340> producing<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> oil

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it's doing that it's producing the oil

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
it's doing that it's producing the oil
faster<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:27.960> quicker<00:01:28.200> than<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> were<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
faster or quicker than if you were to

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
everything so much but if you decide to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.650 
everything so much but if you decide to

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
using I can go four or five days because

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.430 
using I can go four or five days because
when<00:05:09.730> it<00:05:09.850> does<00:05:10.000> you<00:05:10.480> know<00:05:10.570> remove<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.140> oils
