00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.230 
demonstrations is a symposium format
here<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.590> think<00:02:03.070> it's<00:02:03.190> really<00:02:03.490> important<00:02:04.150> that

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
here I think it's really important that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.510 
here I think it's really important that
you<00:02:04.570> have<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.840> good<00:02:05.260> example<00:02:06.040> of<00:02:06.130> what<00:02:06.340> you're

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
you have a good example of what you're

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.969 
you have a good example of what you're
trying<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:06.910> do<00:02:07.060> I<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:08.320> you<00:02:08.770> said<00:02:08.950> earlier

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
trying to do I I as you said earlier

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.640 
trying to do I I as you said earlier
learn<00:02:09.550> visually<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.200> think<00:02:11.320> it's<00:02:11.590> very

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
learn visually and so I think it's very

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.550 
learn visually and so I think it's very
important<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.370> have<00:02:12.640> good<00:02:13.540> examples<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:14.320> good

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
important to have good examples of good

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.250 
important to have good examples of good
dressage<00:02:14.740> horses<00:02:15.280> as<00:02:15.670> well<00:02:15.700> as<00:02:16.090> riders<00:02:16.780> that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
dressage horses as well as riders that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.070 
dressage horses as well as riders that
are<00:02:17.320> doing<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.860> correct<00:02:18.250> correct<00:02:19.090> aids<00:02:19.420> and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
are doing the correct correct aids and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.830 
are doing the correct correct aids and
correct<00:02:20.950> movements<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:21.970> good<00:02:22.270> ways<00:02:22.450> I

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
correct movements and in good ways I

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.920 
correct movements and in good ways I
think<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.650> gives<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> audience<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.580> better

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
think that gives the audience a better

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.150 
think that gives the audience a better
understanding<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.140> score<00:02:26.470> Michelle<00:02:26.830> I

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
understanding of the score Michelle I

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.210 
understanding of the score Michelle I
caught<00:02:27.910> one<00:02:28.300> portion<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.440> your<00:02:29.590> clinic<00:02:30.010> where

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
caught one portion of your clinic where

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.970 
caught one portion of your clinic where
you<00:02:30.400> kind<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.760> talked<00:02:31.060> about<00:02:31.980> practicing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you kind of talked about practicing

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.980 
you kind of talked about practicing
perfect<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.120> know<00:02:34.240> breaking<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.959> down

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
perfect and you know breaking it down

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.520 
perfect and you know breaking it down
like<00:02:35.530> if<00:02:35.680> you're<00:02:35.860> your<00:02:36.430> horse<00:02:37.110> can't<00:02:38.110> do<00:02:38.350> what

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
like if you're your horse can't do what

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.470 
like if you're your horse can't do what
you're<00:02:38.650> asking<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:39.459> think<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.850> were<00:02:39.970> saying<00:02:40.300> it

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
you're asking I think you were saying it

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.710 
you're asking I think you were saying it
bring<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.720> back<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.620> basics<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.430> it

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
bring it back to the basics and it

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
bring it back to the basics and it
doesn't<00:02:43.720> do<00:02:43.810> any<00:02:43.959> good<00:02:43.990> for<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.350> writer<00:02:44.590> or

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
doesn't do any good for the writer or

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.560 
doesn't do any good for the writer or
the<00:02:44.830> horse<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.250> get<00:02:45.370> frustrated<00:02:45.610> exactly

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
the horse to get frustrated exactly

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.170 
the horse to get frustrated exactly
exactly<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.470> only<00:02:47.650> causes<00:02:48.280> more<00:02:48.910> problems

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
exactly that only causes more problems

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.510 
exactly that only causes more problems
and<00:02:49.660> more<00:02:49.750> resistance<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:51.310> lack<00:02:51.490> of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
and more resistance and a lack of

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.699 
and more resistance and a lack of
understanding<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.360> horses<00:02:52.630> part<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
understanding of the horses part and the

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.590 
understanding of the horses part and the
more<00:02:53.920> emotional<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.610> rider<00:02:54.850> becomes<00:02:55.330> the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
more emotional the rider becomes the

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.780 
more emotional the rider becomes the
more<00:02:55.780> tense<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.530> frustrated<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.580> horse

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
more tense and frustrated the horse

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.090 
more tense and frustrated the horse
becomes<00:02:58.180> as<00:02:58.390> well<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.140> think<00:02:59.620> it's<00:02:59.800> good<00:03:00.040> to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
becomes as well so I think it's good to

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.460 
becomes as well so I think it's good to
explain<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.330> horses<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.380> riders

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
explain it to the horses and the riders

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.400 
explain it to the horses and the riders
to<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.220> very<00:03:03.430> basic<00:03:03.670> way<00:03:03.910> if<00:03:04.720> somebody<00:03:05.140> was
