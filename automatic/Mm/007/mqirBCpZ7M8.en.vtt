00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.679
 samet wessel and together with dennis and we 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 arrived in this jar it is becoming newspaper

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.230
 external ex and notaries and everyone 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.460
 gets a little irritated and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.080
 is that there say boys come on 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.939
 you just stay that top 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.769
 also dominate here in the parquet de folder 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.029
 if you cross the escalators 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.590
 names dominates 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.090
 then you dominated entire man 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.890
 overview on the beeck vlog about saying 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 the A flag if there is a very flag tackle the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.489
 doesn't matter because they have to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 also have a flag it is different too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.180
 very annoying so I sat a bit 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.860
 courage to speak for boys who suit 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.360
 the top of the escalator dominate that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.920
 place and we just still can 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.420
 the jar inside and we can still 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.090
 just all nice score him 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.890
 and that's what happened because me 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.469
 can here firstly a two minutes and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 45 beautiful on that is of course already 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.649
 very fast 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.750
 in addition, ecological mole then makes it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.640
 it automatically becomes a chunk of two mops 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.670
 in a game together with a friend of yours 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.350
 plus we really make an epic comeback 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.510
 and I deliberately give away the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.610
 outcome of this game because you are going here 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.799
 see that we are really hard at once 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.630
 gynecol strip and rock hard there 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.700
 maybe it dominated because of this I knew 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.110
 that they sometimes go to the General I ending 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.090
 just wait and this kind of game 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.500
 place these kinds of jars are so epic 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 welcome at the beginning 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 no one really good I get one 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.220
 pair of blades I was already slightly from 50 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.960
 at 10 or so so much good score can me 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.100
 not really perfect plus we were still standing 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.110
 once card behind 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.939
 and you will see that if you just get in 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.320
 Once better you could caress if you 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.759
 busy watching one starts one 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.259
 bit to communicate with each other 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.369
 that you get twenty times better in one go 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.990
 can go to your mouth at once 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.939
 channel that you can still win the post 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
 and these types of games are in call or duty 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.630
 the best games you can get 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.340
 and also the best games that you can 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.689
 so you see it here we were 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.829
 of course vlog this because 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.329
 we had to have those flags to 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.170
 win and take a look on the left 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.520
 scoreboard 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.439
 137 versus 180 we stood guy where i 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.880
 really hard behind and I thought ok here 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.990
 you know we have two flags we can 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.820
 it becomes your own can no longer win 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.259
 But then you never think you should 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.729
 never thought sporting number came in 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.410
 because I was good I always thought he 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.910
 okay street you I'm good, I said 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.560
 against the cost tension construction du 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.060
 corps and the road can best help me 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.770
 I am standing next to the construction that you have before me 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.880
 would be fine and you should lie down 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.140
 so pretty no to her either 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.610
 always link when you started there 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.200
 lie and just go straight dead 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.459
 and I kept tenants in the construction 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.770
 holes that I knew that they did not because the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.270
 and once stood the moment 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.830
 and may we image and I thought holy shit 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.300
 call it on immediately of course because 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.610
 if you will invoke him or your core 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.620
 tight calls the nmi party 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.700
 does not become a yes person and if not a person 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.080
 have seemed at least more 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.000
 can no longer rely on recently 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.700
 they are completely disoriented and can 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.590
 so you grab them hard by mine 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.660
 mole therefore also had a joke for all duco 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.150
 because the m is nothing me could 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.310
 and because of my joke and because they chose beautiful 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.290
 on the pot still connect and that 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.440
 I find so fat just because of such a fat 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.760
 compact but look at scoreboard and msm 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.780
 191 point right now I am beautiful 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.099
 within 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.660
 of course I also mention it immediately 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.620
 because I thought after the game they ended 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.390
 can't win anymore 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.150
 then i thought ok wait and tomorrow will come 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.890
 there comes to him communicators 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.360
 immediately grab all the flags 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.830
 one on the side for a trembling still 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.299
 one on the sea ​​of latch team 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.430
 little unnecessary none at all 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.049
 and communicate with each other focus all that 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.530
 grab flags trip i've got ms 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.850

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.230
 keep the three flat 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.489
 everything in the amy's wounded soul site 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.180
 boys are trash and then follow to 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.680
 the exit 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.209
 I saw our entire party in one go 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.959
 to the exit tour and then I thought oh 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.980
 shit 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.450
 no one knows where the sea is from 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.650
 Seek immediately ran back to one 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.180
 vlog and i loved it on my own 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.040

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.739

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.510

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.010
 sea ​​vlog to those nature who find the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.959
 had to keep those three flags 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.400
 we did the whole tenant out 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.350
 three sods the ma once did not know anymore 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.489
 what she came across the emmy's tried 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.810
 grabbing flags but it succeeds 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.310
 just not because here try the 7 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.049

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.579
 shot shot again so that b 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.350
 flag address where they immediately 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.660
 shot by other teams of mine and 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.579
 That communication is so very important in that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.100
 Call of duty one looks coming all the time 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.480
 closer to the win 106 995
