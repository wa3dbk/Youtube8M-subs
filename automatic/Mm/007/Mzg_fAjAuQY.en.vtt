to<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.300> exact<00:00:42.960> same<00:00:43.110> thing<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:44.219> being

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to do the exact same thing now being

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.639 
to do the exact same thing now being
mindful<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> bottom<00:00:45.539> bun<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.320> twist

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
up the middle section exactly how you

00:00:48.870 --> 00:01:03.569

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.410 

I<00:01:04.320> used<00:01:05.320> about<00:01:05.560> two<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.159> three<00:01:06.189> bobby<00:01:06.610> pins<00:01:06.970> /

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
I used about two to three bobby pins /

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.899 
I used about two to three bobby pins /
bun<00:01:07.750> so<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:08.950> is<00:01:09.159> what<00:01:09.430> it<00:01:09.549> will<00:01:09.670> look<00:01:09.729> like

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
bun so that is what it will look like

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.710 
bun so that is what it will look like
now<00:01:11.310> once<00:01:12.310> you're<00:01:12.490> done<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.909> you<00:01:13.330> can<00:01:13.360> just

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
now once you're done that you can just

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.560 
now once you're done that you can just
start<00:01:13.990> on<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.439> top<00:01:14.649> section<00:01:15.189> so<00:01:16.090> for<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.420> lot<00:01:16.509> of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
start on the top section so for a lot of

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.149 
start on the top section so for a lot of
people<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:17.020> will<00:01:17.229> be<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.500> shortest<00:01:17.830> section

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
people this will be the shortest section

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.310 
people this will be the shortest section
of<00:01:18.250> hair<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.759> as<00:01:19.149> you<00:01:19.540> can<00:01:19.689> see<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:19.869> realized

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
of hair and as you can see I realized

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.039 
of hair and as you can see I realized
that<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:21.070> looked<00:01:21.549> like<00:01:21.729> I<00:01:21.880> had<00:01:21.909> like<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.450> short

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
that it looked like I had like a short

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.929 
that it looked like I had like a short
bob<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.710> was<00:01:23.890> kind<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.159> mesmerised<00:01:24.640> for<00:01:24.820> that

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
bob so I was kind of mesmerised for that

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.420 
bob so I was kind of mesmerised for that
but<00:01:25.780> once<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.409> get<00:01:26.649> over<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.890> fact<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.250> you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
but once you get over the fact that you

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.760 
but once you get over the fact that you
it<00:01:28.000> looks<00:01:28.210> like<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.420> have<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.570> fake<00:01:28.750> bomb<00:01:29.020> then

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
it looks like you have a fake bomb then

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.800 
it looks like you have a fake bomb then
you<00:01:29.890> can<00:01:30.039> continue<00:01:30.310> on<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.880> do<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.179> top<00:01:31.509> layer

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
you can continue on and do the top layer

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.130 
you can continue on and do the top layer
of<00:01:31.840> your<00:01:32.080> head<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.310> for<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.610> Slayer<00:01:33.850> be<00:01:34.630> extra
