00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
kind of educated him in some ways that

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.250 
kind of educated him in some ways that
you<00:03:55.979> felt<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.639> just<00:03:56.669> totally<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.989> told<00:03:58.109> him

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
you felt it I just totally just told him

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.020 
you felt it I just totally just told him
so<00:03:58.439> I'm<00:03:58.500> surprised<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:58.919> he's<00:03:59.669> not<00:03:59.819> working

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
so I'm surprised that he's not working

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.710 
so I'm surprised that he's not working
with<00:04:00.269> how<00:04:00.810> Amy<00:04:02.090> tell<00:04:03.090> me<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.239> think<00:04:03.479> that<00:04:03.629> he

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
with how Amy tell me I think that he

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.809 
with how Amy tell me I think that he
would<00:04:03.840> if<00:04:03.959> he<00:04:03.989> did<00:04:04.139> work<00:04:04.290> maybe<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.859> work<00:04:05.040> that

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
would if he did work maybe you work that

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:06.800 
would if he did work maybe you work that
Ridley<00:04:06.180> what<00:04:06.329> does<00:04:06.419> he<00:04:06.510> would<00:04:06.599> have<00:04:06.689> made<00:04:06.780> a

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
Ridley what does he would have made a
