your bananas so first things first when

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.389 
your bananas so first things first when
I<00:00:59.180> buy<00:00:59.480> bananas<00:00:59.690> i<00:01:00.110> buy<00:01:00.260> them<00:01:00.410> in<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.620> box<00:01:00.800> of<00:01:01.040> 40

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
I buy bananas i buy them in a box of 40

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.119 
I buy bananas i buy them in a box of 40
pounds<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.230> they<00:01:03.350> already<00:01:03.530> come<00:01:03.890> in<00:01:04.009> this

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
pounds and so they already come in this

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.920 
pounds and so they already come in this
box<00:01:04.339> with<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.729> plastic<00:01:05.149> which<00:01:05.300> is<00:01:05.330> awesome

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
box with the plastic which is awesome

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.590 
box with the plastic which is awesome
you<00:01:06.229> want<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.560> plastic<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:07.580> what<00:01:07.789> I<00:01:07.820> do<00:01:07.940> is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
you want the plastic so what I do is

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.840 
you want the plastic so what I do is
actually<00:01:11.600> close<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.740> plastic<00:01:13.250> completely

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
actually close the plastic completely

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.210 
actually close the plastic completely
because<00:01:14.539> that<00:01:14.690> helps<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.229> trap<00:01:15.530> in<00:01:15.740> ethylene

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
because that helps to trap in ethylene

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.570 
because that helps to trap in ethylene
gas<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.959> bananas<00:01:18.679> naturally<00:01:19.190> produce

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
gas that the bananas naturally produce

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.859 
gas that the bananas naturally produce
and<00:01:19.819> that's<00:01:19.910> what's<00:01:20.179> going<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.360> help<00:01:20.600> them

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
and that's what's going to help them

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.320 
and that's what's going to help them
ripen<00:01:21.289> quicker<00:01:21.649> and<00:01:22.220> then<00:01:22.429> sometimes<00:01:23.149> you

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
ripen quicker and then sometimes you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.779 
ripen quicker and then sometimes you
know<00:01:23.569> I<00:01:23.899> lay<00:01:24.319> a<00:01:24.350> towel<00:01:24.830> or<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:25.220> blanket<00:01:25.280> over

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
know I lay a towel or a blanket over

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:26.650 
know I lay a towel or a blanket over
them<00:01:26.090> as<00:01:26.209> well

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
them as well

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.199 
them as well
trapping<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.590> heat<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.160> I<00:01:28.610> lay<00:01:28.819> them<00:01:29.030> out<00:01:29.149> in

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209 
trapping that heat and I lay them out in

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:30.999 
trapping that heat and I lay them out in
the<00:01:29.450> Sun<00:01:29.660> like<00:01:29.990> where<00:01:30.170> they<00:01:30.289> are<00:01:30.440> now<00:01:30.649> we<00:01:30.709> get

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
ripening now a huge mistake that I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.460 
ripening now a huge mistake that I

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
actually made when I first started doing

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.160 
actually made when I first started doing
and<00:01:54.860> like<00:01:55.340> trying<00:01:55.790> different<00:01:56.120> ways<00:01:56.450> was<00:01:56.930> that

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
and like trying different ways was that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.820 
and like trying different ways was that
I<00:01:57.970> trap<00:01:58.970> them<00:01:59.180> in<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.630> let<00:01:59.660> them<00:02:00.080> completely

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
I trap them in and let them completely

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.960 
I trap them in and let them completely
ripen<00:02:02.650> what<00:02:03.650> happens<00:02:04.190> though<00:02:04.460> was<00:02:04.760> when<00:02:04.910> I

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
ripen what happens though was when I

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.590 
ripen what happens though was when I
actually<00:02:05.240> removed<00:02:05.900> them<00:02:06.290> all<00:02:06.470> from<00:02:06.740> Fox

the<00:02:18.800> stems<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.580> broke<00:02:20.060> off<00:02:20.330> when<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.600> picked

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
the stems just broke off when I picked

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.470 
the stems just broke off when I picked
them<00:02:21.260> up<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.770> they<00:02:22.250> just<00:02:22.460> didn't<00:02:22.790> taste<00:02:23.000> nice

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
them up and they just didn't taste nice

them up and they just didn't taste nice
at<00:02:23.750> all<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.110> kind<00:02:24.410> of<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:25.130> completely

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
ruined a box of bananas that way I froze

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.540 
ruined a box of bananas that way I froze
the<00:02:28.340> ones<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.880> like<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.420> could<00:02:30.050> eat<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.340> there

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
the ones that like I could eat but there

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.230 
the ones that like I could eat but there
were<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.730> lot<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.120> throughout<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.670> when<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.700> see

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
were a lot that throughout so when I see

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.200 
were a lot that throughout so when I see
the<00:02:35.480> spots<00:02:35.810> appearing<00:02:36.700> then<00:02:37.700> I<00:02:37.970> actually

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
the spots appearing then I actually

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.900 
the spots appearing then I actually
remove<00:02:38.930> all<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.080> bananas<00:02:39.560> from<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.890> box<00:02:40.190> get

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
remove all the bananas from the box get

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.640 
remove all the bananas from the box get
rid<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.210> plastic<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.870> then<00:02:42.290> put<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
rid of the plastic and then put the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.160 
rid of the plastic and then put the
bananas<00:02:43.100> back<00:02:43.370> into<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.940> box<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.480> leave<00:02:44.990> them

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
bananas back into the box and leave them

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.410 
bananas back into the box and leave them
out<00:02:45.290> in<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.500> Sun<00:02:45.710> so<00:02:46.070> that<00:02:46.220> any<00:02:46.370> moisture<00:02:47.090> is

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
out in the Sun so that any moisture is

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.230 
out in the Sun so that any moisture is
dried<00:02:48.080> up<00:02:48.380> absorbed<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.370> they<00:02:49.880> don't<00:02:50.090> get

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
dried up absorbed and they don't get

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.820 
dried up absorbed and they don't get
soggy<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:51.110> continue<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.800> ripen<00:02:52.070> now

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
soggy and they continue to ripen now

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.470 
soggy and they continue to ripen now
this<00:02:54.830> works<00:02:55.190> obviously<00:02:55.970> if<00:02:56.120> you're<00:02:56.330> in<00:02:56.420> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
this works obviously if you're in a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.380 
this works obviously if you're in a
warmer<00:02:56.780> climate<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:57.590> you're<00:02:57.740> in<00:02:58.360> like<00:02:59.360> a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
warmer climate but if you're in like a

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.590 
warmer climate but if you're in like a
colder<00:03:00.050> climate<00:03:00.080> area<00:03:00.920> like<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.910> East<00:03:02.209> at<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
colder climate area like the East at the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.250 
colder climate area like the East at the
moment<00:03:02.989> east<00:03:03.170> coast<00:03:04.270> what<00:03:05.270> you<00:03:05.390> want<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.660> do<00:03:05.900> is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
moment east coast what you want to do is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.800 
moment east coast what you want to do is
wrap<00:03:06.709> them<00:03:06.950> in<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.160> plastic<00:03:07.660> put<00:03:08.660> like<00:03:08.780> a

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
wrap them in the plastic put like a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.600 
wrap them in the plastic put like a
blanket<00:03:09.410> over<00:03:09.680> them<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.070> as<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.250> can<00:03:10.370> put

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
them next to a heating unit or something

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.449 
them next to a heating unit or something
like<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:14.120> if<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.570> heat<00:03:14.870> mixed<00:03:15.770> with<00:03:15.950> you

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
like that if the heat mixed with you

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.580 
like that if the heat mixed with you
know<00:03:16.580> trapping<00:03:17.090> in<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.300> ethylene<00:03:17.690> gas<00:03:17.959> that's

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
know trapping in the ethylene gas that's

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.830 
know trapping in the ethylene gas that's
going<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.890> help<00:03:19.070> them<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.850> ripen<00:03:20.060> quicker<00:03:20.630> and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
going to help them to ripen quicker and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.229 
going to help them to ripen quicker and
so<00:03:21.320> there's<00:03:21.709> some<00:03:21.950> tips<00:03:22.489> if<00:03:22.730> you've<00:03:22.940> got<00:03:23.120> the
