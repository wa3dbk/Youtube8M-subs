you access the internet on the the
Kindles<00:00:18.849> 3G<00:00:19.210> connection<00:00:19.659> but<00:00:19.960> they<00:00:20.169> took<00:00:20.409> away

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
Kindles 3G connection but they took away

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.290 
Kindles 3G connection but they took away
that<00:00:20.769> functionality<00:00:21.400> on<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.579> paperwhite<00:00:22.150> I

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
that functionality on the paperwhite I

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.939 
that functionality on the paperwhite I
don't<00:00:22.480> know<00:00:22.539> why<00:00:22.689> but<00:00:22.929> they<00:00:23.050> did<00:00:23.289> kind<00:00:23.829> of

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
don't know why but they did kind of

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.979 
don't know why but they did kind of
stinks<00:00:24.339> but<00:00:24.579> in<00:00:24.699> a<00:00:24.820> pinch<00:00:25.060> it<00:00:25.269> was<00:00:25.419> it<00:00:25.869> was<00:00:25.960> a

stinks but in a pinch it was it was a

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.929 
stinks but in a pinch it was it was a
cool<00:00:26.199> tool<00:00:26.409> but<00:00:26.650> there<00:00:26.769> is<00:00:26.919> a<00:00:27.159> way<00:00:27.339> around<00:00:27.489> it

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
cool tool but there is a way around it

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.659 
cool tool but there is a way around it
on<00:00:28.089> the<00:00:28.720> paperwhite<00:00:29.249> so<00:00:30.249> check<00:00:30.399> it<00:00:30.489> I'll<00:00:30.579> show

on the paperwhite so check it I'll show
you<00:00:30.730> how<00:00:30.789> to<00:00:30.849> do<00:00:30.970> it's<00:00:31.149> pretty<00:00:31.300> easy

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
you how to do it's pretty easy

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.030 
you how to do it's pretty easy
it<00:00:32.140> doesn't<00:00:32.350> require<00:00:32.470> any<00:00:32.619> kind<00:00:32.800> of<00:00:32.890> like

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
it doesn't require any kind of like

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.410 
it doesn't require any kind of like
hacking<00:00:33.460> or<00:00:33.580> anything<00:00:33.760> like<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.000> but<00:00:34.240> check

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
hacking or anything like that but check

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.680 
hacking or anything like that but check
it<00:00:34.450> out<00:00:34.600> you<00:00:35.110> just<00:00:35.320> go<00:00:35.440> into<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.770> settings<00:00:36.690> you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
it out you just go into the settings you

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.390 
it out you just go into the settings you
want<00:00:37.810> to<00:00:37.960> come<00:00:38.170> down<00:00:38.380> don't<00:00:38.980> go<00:00:39.160> into<00:00:39.280> the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
want to come down don't go into the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.010 
want to come down don't go into the
experimental<00:00:39.760> browser<00:00:40.090> because<00:00:40.480> that's<00:00:40.900> what

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
experimental browser because that's what

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.140 
experimental browser because that's what
used<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.320> do<00:00:41.470> on<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:41.800> on<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.760> previous

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
used to do on the on the the previous

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.370 
used to do on the on the the previous
three<00:00:43.540> G's<00:00:43.690> but<00:00:43.840> if<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:43.990> do<00:00:44.080> that<00:00:44.200> on<00:00:44.320> the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
three G's but if you do that on the

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.840 
three G's but if you do that on the
touch<00:00:44.590> it'll<00:00:44.920> just<00:00:45.130> tell<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:45.460> the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
touch it'll just tell you the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.400 
touch it'll just tell you the
experimental<00:00:46.180> browser<00:00:46.510> only<00:00:47.050> works<00:00:47.380> on<00:00:48.060> on

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
experimental browser only works on on

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.230 
experimental browser only works on on
Wi-Fi<00:00:50.410> so<00:00:50.950> this<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.460> workaround<00:00:51.880> it's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
Wi-Fi so this is the workaround it's

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.670 
Wi-Fi so this is the workaround it's
really<00:00:52.480> cool<00:00:52.690> so<00:00:53.230> just<00:00:53.590> go<00:00:53.680> into<00:00:53.830> the<00:00:53.980> settings

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
really cool so just go into the settings

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.530 
really cool so just go into the settings
all<00:00:56.680> right<00:00:56.800> then<00:00:57.340> what<00:00:57.490> you<00:00:57.610> need<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.850> do<00:00:57.970> is<00:00:58.210> a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
all right then what you need to do is a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.300 
all right then what you need to do is a
