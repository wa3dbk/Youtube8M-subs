00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.520 

the<00:00:46.359> reason<00:00:46.629> I<00:00:46.690> jumped<00:00:47.019> into<00:00:47.170> multiplayer

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
the reason I jumped into multiplayer

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.349 
the reason I jumped into multiplayer
first<00:00:47.949> as<00:00:48.129> I<00:00:48.219> presume<00:00:48.519> to<00:00:48.640> be<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.789> multiplayer

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
first as I presume to be a multiplayer

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.849 
first as I presume to be a multiplayer
game<00:00:49.449> but<00:00:49.870> actually<00:00:50.289> it's<00:00:50.379> got<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.530> really<00:00:50.769> good

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
game but actually it's got a really good

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.740 
game but actually it's got a really good
campaign<00:00:51.429> wing<00:00:51.670> could<00:00:51.909> unlock<00:00:52.120> these<00:00:52.300> weapons

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
campaign wing could unlock these weapons

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.170 
campaign wing could unlock these weapons
so<00:00:53.109> it's<00:00:53.469> not<00:00:53.739> actually<00:00:53.920> that<00:00:54.190> bad<00:00:54.429> a<00:00:54.640> place<00:00:54.940> to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
so it's not actually that bad a place to

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.880 
so it's not actually that bad a place to
start<00:00:55.510> in<00:00:56.140> case<00:00:56.350> you're<00:00:56.500> wondering<00:00:56.530> how

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
start in case you're wondering how

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.439 
start in case you're wondering how
campaign<00:00:57.339> relates<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:57.909> whole<00:00:58.059> idea<00:00:58.269> of

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
campaign relates to the whole idea of

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.000 
campaign relates to the whole idea of
not<00:00:58.629> playing<00:00:58.839> multiplayer<00:00:59.170> first<00:00:59.739> you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
not playing multiplayer first you

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.500 
not playing multiplayer first you
actually<00:01:00.339> find<00:01:00.519> balls<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:01.030> yarn<00:01:01.239> while

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
actually find balls of yarn while

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.509 
actually find balls of yarn while
playing<00:01:01.750> through<00:01:02.079> each<00:01:02.229> level<00:01:02.260> and<00:01:02.799> this<00:01:03.369> is

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
playing through each level and this is

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.039 
playing through each level and this is
what<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.729> use<00:01:03.850> as<00:01:04.030> currency<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.659> buy<00:01:04.689> new

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
what you use as currency to buy new

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.050 
what you use as currency to buy new
weapon<00:01:05.409> there<00:01:06.250> are<00:01:06.369> also<00:01:06.490> gems<00:01:06.909> scattered

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
weapon there are also gems scattered

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.520 
weapon there are also gems scattered
throughout<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.570> levels<00:01:07.780> that<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.110> can<00:01:08.320> use

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
throughout the levels that you can use

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.139 
throughout the levels that you can use
to<00:01:08.680> trade<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.070> for<00:01:09.189> prisoners<00:01:09.700> which<00:01:09.880> is<00:01:10.060> just

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
to trade in for prisoners which is just

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.520 
to trade in for prisoners which is just
a<00:01:10.299> fancy<00:01:10.450> way<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.840> saying<00:01:11.080> that<00:01:11.259> you<00:01:11.319> can't

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
a fancy way of saying that you can't

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:25.109 
a fancy way of saying that you can't
unlock<00:01:11.619> new<00:01:11.979> heads<00:01:12.250> for<00:01:12.460> your<00:01:12.490> character<00:01:24.119> but

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
as you play campaign you realize it's

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.020 
as you play campaign you realize it's
worth<00:01:26.830> playing<00:01:27.009> anyway<00:01:27.459> just<00:01:27.640> because<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:28.000> the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
worth playing anyway just because of the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.430 
worth playing anyway just because of the
way<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.299> levels<00:01:28.600> have<00:01:28.720> been<00:01:28.750> designed<00:01:29.170> it's

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
they're probably the main thing that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
they're the one thing that's I guess

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.490 
they're the one thing that's I guess
unpredictable<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.750> can't<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:40.050> learned<00:02:40.290> but

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
unpredictable and can't be learned but

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.140 
unpredictable and can't be learned but
because<00:02:40.739> checkpoints<00:02:41.280> are<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.520> generous<00:02:41.790> it's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
because checkpoints are so generous it's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.790 
because checkpoints are so generous it's
never<00:02:42.480> really<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.930> frustrating<00:02:43.560> when<00:02:43.680> you

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
never really that frustrating when you

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:55.820 
never really that frustrating when you
die<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.510> campaigns<00:02:54.989> good<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
die so campaigns good but really the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.229 
die so campaigns good but really the
whole<00:02:55.950> point<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.340> playing<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.000> collect

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
whole point for playing is to collect

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.910 
whole point for playing is to collect
gems<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.870> collect<00:02:58.050> these<00:02:58.230> balls<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.739> yarn

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
gems and to collect these balls of yarn

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.070 
gems and to collect these balls of yarn
so<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.430> lock<00:02:59.640> heads<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.450> weapons<00:03:00.930> to

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
so you can lock heads and weapons to

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.990 
so you can lock heads and weapons to
using<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.380> x<00:03:01.860> box<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.950> reason<00:03:08.250> multiplied<00:03:08.730> so

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
using the x box the reason multiplied so

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.940 
using the x box the reason multiplied so
fun<00:03:09.239> is<00:03:09.390> it's<00:03:09.600> kind<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.080> like<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.290> party<00:03:10.769> game

again very messy but little of a lot of
fun<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.830> big<00:04:08.010> question<00:04:08.160> for<00:04:08.400> this<00:04:08.610> game<00:04:08.790> is

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
fun the big question for this game is

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.610 
fun the big question for this game is
really<00:04:09.030> how<00:04:09.270> long<00:04:09.450> calls<00:04:09.720> playable<00:04:10.170> last<00:04:10.410> year

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
really how long calls playable last year

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.380 
really how long calls playable last year
because<00:04:10.770> it's<00:04:11.010> not<00:04:11.160> particularly<00:04:11.700> deep<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.330> is

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
because it's not particularly deep it is

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.880 
because it's not particularly deep it is
a<00:04:12.450> game<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.720> relies<00:04:13.110> on<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.440> fact<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.740> it

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
a game that relies on the fact that it
