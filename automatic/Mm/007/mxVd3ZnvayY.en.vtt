00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and I could still see her sneakers and I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.340 
and I could still see her sneakers and I
was<00:02:16.860> able<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.070> crawl<00:02:17.370> over<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:19.080> pull<00:02:19.320> on

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
was able to crawl over and just pull on

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.840 
was able to crawl over and just pull on
her<00:02:19.530> feet<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.920> try<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.100> pull<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.490> towards<00:02:20.790> me

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
her feet and try to pull it towards me

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.050 
her feet and try to pull it towards me
and<00:02:21.030> she<00:02:21.900> wasn't<00:02:22.200> conscious<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.640> she<00:02:23.790> wasn't

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and she wasn't conscious so she wasn't

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.110 
and she wasn't conscious so she wasn't
responding<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.720> me<00:02:24.840> at<00:02:24.930> all<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.850> didn't

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
responding to me at all and I didn't

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.820 
responding to me at all and I didn't
think<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.420> had<00:02:27.660> anything<00:02:27.990> left<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.470> me<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.770> I

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
think I had anything left to me so I

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.090 
think I had anything left to me so I
just<00:02:28.860> laid<00:02:29.220> there<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:31.560> felt<00:02:31.980> like

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
just laid there and it felt like

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.620 
just laid there and it felt like
eternity<00:02:32.580> lying<00:02:32.910> there<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.140> was<00:02:34.260> probably

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
eternity lying there and it was probably

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.720 
eternity lying there and it was probably
gonna<00:02:36.630> say<00:02:36.930> about<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.230> minute<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:40.350> wasn't

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
gonna say about a minute and it wasn't

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.730 
gonna say about a minute and it wasn't
till<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:41.970> started<00:02:42.270> crawling<00:02:42.540> again<00:02:42.930> and

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
till I just started crawling again and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.040 
till I just started crawling again and
it's<00:02:44.340> crawled<00:02:44.580> around<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.150> held<00:02:45.480> my<00:02:45.630> hand<00:02:45.870> up

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
it's crawled around and held my hand up

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.920 
it's crawled around and held my hand up
and<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.460> felt<00:02:47.460> along<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.850> wall<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.090> went

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and just felt along the wall and went

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.080 
and just felt along the wall and went
around<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.280> vestibule<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.550> front<00:02:50.880> door

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
around the vestibule to the front door

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.450 
around the vestibule to the front door
and<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:52.320> was<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.470> hole<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.920> wall<00:02:53.100> where<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
and it was a hole in the wall where I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.450 
and it was a hole in the wall where I
guess<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.790> was<00:02:53.880> an<00:02:54.000> ATM<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.980> they<00:02:55.980> took<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.280> out

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
guess it was an ATM and they took it out

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.830 
guess it was an ATM and they took it out
but<00:02:56.790> they're<00:02:56.940> selling<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> building<00:02:57.690> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
but they're selling the building the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.370 
but they're selling the building the
next<00:02:57.990> day<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.790> piece<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.120> plywood

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
next day so it's just a piece of plywood

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.650 
next day so it's just a piece of plywood
someone<00:03:01.380> heard<00:03:01.530> already<00:03:01.770> kicked<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.190> out

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
someone heard already kicked that out

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.930 
someone heard already kicked that out
and<00:03:03.770> when<00:03:04.770> my<00:03:04.890> hand<00:03:05.130> went<00:03:05.340> through<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.730> I

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and when my hand went through that I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.100 
and when my hand went through that I
thought<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.390> was<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> window<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.430> dove

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
thought it was a window so I just dove

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.530 
thought it was a window so I just dove
the<00:03:10.110> wall<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.220> wound<00:03:11.430> up<00:03:11.610> about<00:03:12.000> six<00:03:12.360> feet

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
the wall and I wound up about six feet

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.350 
the wall and I wound up about six feet
in<00:03:12.690> front<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.050> front<00:03:13.290> door<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.910> was<00:03:15.030> in

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
in front of the front door and I was in

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.300 
in front of the front door and I was in
the<00:03:15.420> middle<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.780> vestibule<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.890> looked

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the middle of the vestibule and I looked

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.420 
the middle of the vestibule and I looked
to<00:03:17.400> my<00:03:17.520> right<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.820> this<00:03:18.240> is<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.480> wall<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.840> flames

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
to my right and this is a wall of flames

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.590 
to my right and this is a wall of flames
and<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.490> look<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.670> my<00:03:20.730> left<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.270> can<00:03:21.420> see

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
and I look to my left and I can see

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.200 
and I look to my left and I can see
flashing<00:03:22.080> lights<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.280> crawled<00:03:23.610> out<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:23.880> I

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
flashing lights so I crawled out and I

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.690 
flashing lights so I crawled out and I
was<00:03:24.360> at<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.920> railing<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> stairs

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
was at the railing and the stairs

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.120 
was at the railing and the stairs
I<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:27.630> see<00:03:27.780> all<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.290> firefighters<00:03:28.980> and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
I just see all the firefighters and

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.000 
I just see all the firefighters and
everything<00:03:29.460> I<00:03:29.610> had<00:03:29.700> over<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.180> back<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> lot<00:03:30.690> and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
everything I had over the back a lot and

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.090 
everything I had over the back a lot and
kind<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.100> leaned<00:03:32.310> against<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.730> tour<00:03:33.390> bus<00:03:33.600> and

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
kind of leaned against the tour bus and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.500 
kind of leaned against the tour bus and
when<00:03:35.100> firefighters<00:03:35.760> ran<00:03:35.910> over<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.240> grabbed

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
when firefighters ran over and grabbed

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.820 
when firefighters ran over and grabbed
me<00:03:36.690> because<00:03:36.930> I'm<00:03:37.050> sure<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.500> was<00:03:37.620> still
