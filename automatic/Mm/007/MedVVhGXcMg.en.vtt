00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
the the flat iron was too hot and I

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.260 
the the flat iron was too hot and I
don't<00:02:47.900> have<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:49.220> like<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.459> cheap<00:02:49.790> little<00:02:49.970> flat

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.500 
don't have but like a cheap little flat
iron<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:52.400> think<00:02:52.760> what<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.120> think<00:02:53.390> what

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
iron and I think what I think what

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.699 
iron and I think what I think what
happened<00:02:53.780> was<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.080> wasn't<00:02:54.350> using<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.590> heat

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
happened was I wasn't using a heat

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.680 
happened was I wasn't using a heat
protector<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.730> think<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.060> flat<00:02:56.300> iron<00:02:56.450> was

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
protector and I think the flat iron was

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.420 
protector and I think the flat iron was
too<00:02:56.720> hot<00:02:57.050> i<00:02:57.080> was<00:02:57.290> already<00:02:57.530> at<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.800> highest<00:02:57.980> and

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
too hot i was already at the highest and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.770 
too hot i was already at the highest and
i<00:02:59.270> think<00:02:59.570> i<00:02:59.660> actually<00:02:59.920> burnt<00:03:00.920> my<00:03:01.280> hair<00:03:01.640> wolf<00:03:02.510> I

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
i think i actually burnt my hair wolf I

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.810 
i think i actually burnt my hair wolf I
think<00:03:03.110> that's<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:04.040> reason<00:03:04.220> why<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.670> like

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
think that's the reason why it's like

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.600 
think that's the reason why it's like
that<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.420> that's<00:03:05.720> one<00:03:05.959> problem<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:07.400> other

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
that so that's one problem the other

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.100 
that so that's one problem the other
problem<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:08.530> all<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:09.830> it's<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:10.989> kind<00:03:11.989> of

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
problem is all of this it's like kind of

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.320 
problem is all of this it's like kind of
break<00:03:12.410> in<00:03:13.360> Breaking<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:15.640> it's<00:03:16.640> really<00:03:17.030> thin
