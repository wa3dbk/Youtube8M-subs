00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:13.650
 Crochet road guide Amigurumi Hen 5th 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:17.910
 This time we will learn about how to put on the eyeball buttons and how to hand-embroider with your brother 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:24.300
 First of all, for the eyeball button, this is the general eyeball button 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:28.340
 There are several types such as size and shape pattern which is also called a height button 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.970
 This time, let's put two here button 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.950
 Let's first look at the image of how to attach roughly 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:40.329
 You put the needle from location two places decided the intermediate position to put the eye 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.809
 Through the back of the road to the first point 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.109
 The side of the button door still goes to the back of 3 o'clock 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:53.890
 Through the button in the same way from one point of this 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:56.660
 Return to the first point Tie the thread and put the knot in the fabric and complete 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.610
 Did you get a rough image ? 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:05.970
 Personally, is it easier to put a needle between eyes like this ? 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:10.830
 There is also a pattern in this way through Ito from the back of the three-dimensional 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:17.610
 I'll try in Ito convex side from between the eyes and the eyes in this video 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.180
 Basically, it is attached using the same yarn as the knitted fabric, but this time it's a different color yarn to make it easy to see 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.590
 Use 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.590
 Let's use the thing of the thickness that can pass through the hole of the eyeball button 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.479
 We decide point to put on eyes At this time, it is easy to do the Kashiwaki with a lot of weaving for knitting 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.479
 Ne 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.670
 Insert a needle from the middle of the eyes 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.580
 I will put out the point to catch 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.190
 Distant eyeball button 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.040
 From the place where the thread was released to the back of the knitted fabric again 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.560
 Issued a needle to the other point 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560
 Hmm 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.780
 Go through another featured button 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.810
 Insert the needle from where you put out the thread 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.560
 And you will return to the first point 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.920
 eh 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.780
 I will draw a good and firm tie 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.280
 The excess yarn is cut short 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.690
 eh 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.879
 Put the knot in the fabric and you're done 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.340
 eh 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:09.050
 Next it is about Kate's poetry, but this is not a particularly difficult thing 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:13.780
 Basically you just tie it through thread 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.780
 Like this when you want to 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.630
 Put the needle from bending want to point 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.950
 When this happens 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:48.280
 There is also a way to live and fix in the form of pulling a thread 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:54.640
 It became pretty pretty just with eyes and mouth 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:56.910
 So the cheers for good work is this time next time up to this point is how joining a plurality of parts 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.910
