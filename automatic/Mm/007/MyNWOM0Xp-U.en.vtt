00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi the gamer in the previous episode 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.040
 we had talked about the difference between 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.580
 games to American and games 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.230
 German 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.179
 you have to know that some like 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
 talk about a third school games to 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.840
 French or Francophone who 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.429
 would group games that focuses 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.560
 rather on the atmosphere around the table 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.720
 so it would be most often 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 bluff game mesandans already talked about 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.830
 in video number 2 is party 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.590
 games that are going to be the subject of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 today's episode the party games 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.610
 also called atmosphere games game 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.840
 fun or games apéro stands for 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.980
 many of us a first step 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.570
 towards the modern board game 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.430
 must say that his players have the advantage 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.840
 to be very affordable and we will not 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.420
 swing puerto rico in the phase of a 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.270
 poor beginners you teach me his boat 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.410
 hours for tomorrow since pretty much 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.940
 so everyone has already played at a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.899
 party game we all see more or less this 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.890
 that it is 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.449
 however it is interesting to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.530
 notice that despite this it is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.079
 difficult to give a definition 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.190
 what a party game is but 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.750
 seeing that I'm brave I'm going when 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.780
 even to dwell on this question 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.410
 what exactly a party game 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.699
 let's start by observing the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 features that often come up 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.390
 in this kind of game it's about the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 most of the game time including parties 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.090
 are fast enough 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.710
 they have at least an hour often 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.490
 can be found in stores because they are sold in 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.110
 small boxes 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.939
 I wanted to talk about French games 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.650
 just now you have to know that 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.479
 the games cocktail editor which is 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.680
 French specializes precisely in 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.090
 party games 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.350
 but yes you know it it's about 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.550
 those little metal boxes that you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.070
 find in your game shops 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.840
 or sometimes in large shops 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 can also quote rest prod that does not 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.720
 not only in the party game and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.260
 has a range known to all and who 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.090
 as for them are Belgians other 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.410
 characteristic of party games the goal 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.150
 is above all to have a good time 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.350
 have fun and have a good time 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.880
 it is obviously the goal of 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.110
 any game but let's say that the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 party games often seek to create 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.380
 deliberately funny situations 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.180
 and funny rather than proposing a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.340
 duel of mind as will propose a game 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.229
 in normal quotation marks that's why 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.700
 we often talk about aperitif games because 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.160
 the atmosphere is light there is not too much 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.540
 need to focus then more more 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.340
 we are drunk more it becomes funny 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.479
 particles are also made to 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.950
 to be played to a lot of players 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.270
 so when I say a lot I think that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.140
 if players forget themselves it's already a lot 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.090
 for a board game 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.619
 but there are also a lot of party games 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.750
 which in absolute terms have no limit of 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.670
 players even if a moment it becomes 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.800
 just stupid to play 50 around a 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.840
 table also note that they can 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.340
 also easily played in team and 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.660
 that the mechanics of some judges are 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.000
 based precisely on being in 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.320
 team with one or more players and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.680
 since they are meant to be played at 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.180
 a lot 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.769
 these games are often very simple in 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.209
 term of rules that's why these 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.650
 games are perfect for initiating 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.060
 beginners at board games or for 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.769
 play with casual players 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.720
 but all these features are not 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.709
 not inherent to all party games and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.540
 do not really answer the question 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.870
 how do we define a party 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.580
 game 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.470
 so obviously there is no 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.610
 answer quite accurate but I think 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.230
 what makes a game a party 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.239
 game is that it includes a human side 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.140
 in his game mechanics 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.549
 by that I mean it's not about 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.799
 just a combination of choice and 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.810
 chance but rather speed of 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.760
 memory of general culture drawings 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.440
 and it's good I'm still fine 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 insisted that this is my opinion 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.280
 is that I am well aware that not bad 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.900
 games are really subject to debate where 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.610
 for example is a bluff game 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.290
 is a party game we have a 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.640
 human component a very atmosphere 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.660
 strong around the table 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.090
 but this game are often considered 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.680
 as very serious is that the same 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.020
 ricochet robot enters the category 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.459
 party games this is a game of 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.620
 speed in which players must 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.360
 find as quickly as possible 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.069
 following the shortest moving 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.520
 take a robot from point a to point 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.560
 b 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.850
 except that the robots only move in 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.650
 straight line up to meet a 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.970
 obstacle and that one can choose in 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.770
 his suite of moves to move others 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.870
 robots which would also count as 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.270
 a cost but will shorten the 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.709
 way of our main robot the idea 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.160
 so will be to find in a while 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.810
 limit 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.700
 the route using the least hits 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.150
 possible so this is a game of 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.550
 speed 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.230
 however the atmosphere around the table 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.820
 is far from that of a party game on 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.040
 no longer there is triturating neurons 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.350
 in the face of a puzzle that something else 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.790
 another example galaxy trickster yet a 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.320
 game of speed or this time it will take 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.209
 build a spaceship in a 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.590
 limited time to then undergo a 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.330
 series of random events that 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.670
 will test the capabilities of 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.989
 our ship here the game is really fun 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.880
 but it's the fact that he's in a 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.200
 big box and the thickness of the rules 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.180
 that make the game not necessarily 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.050
 considered a mood game in 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.459
 all cases I still like 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.110
 the idea of ​​telling oneself that for a lot of 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.060
 party games this is the human side of the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.290
 game mechanics that characterizes them 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.880
 because they still emphasize this aspect 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.350
 important is usability and 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.900
 human contact in board games 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.790
 this human side nevertheless has disadvantages 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.620
 we are not all equal in the face of a 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.700
 party game as much in a game of 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.560
 strategy we can admit that with 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.950
 experience will eventually catch up with 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.690
 other players 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.030
 but for a game of speed or 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.710
 memory for example difficult to 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.940
 catch up some of the more so as 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.330
 knows all in our group of 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.669
 players 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.830
 this annoying player who has a species of 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.090
 donations for a particular game and that is 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.930
 impossible to beat at 23.0 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.860
 applied jack 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.259
 one last point that it's good to 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.849
 specify on this type of game despite their 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.259
 simple appearance and the fact that these games 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.150
 quite an audience of 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.620
 casual players a lot of party 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.419
 games remains very interesting for 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.680
 big players and the number of mechanics 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.240
 innovative that can be found in 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.050
 the modern and fair party games 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.629
 impressive 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.099
 take tokyo trane for example where he 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.020
 is a speed game that is played 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.999
 in a team of 2 or each team will 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.039
 successfully move six pass cards 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.599
 is represented by colors for 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.939
 bring them into a good configuration 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.319
 accurate except that in each team 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.090
 only one of the two players knows the 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.590
 configuration to perform and that's 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.449
 only the other player who will have the 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.919
 right to touch passengers by 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.479
 on top of the market they will have to communicate 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.370
 with a special language that is a 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.099
 mix of hand signs and words 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.599
 in pseudo japanese it's fun it's a 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.009
 little spin the neurons and especially 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.969
 it's a perfect example of mechanics 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.590
 super innovative 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.949
 I promise you this is an example 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.789
 among a lot of others here it is 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.770
 the end of this video 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.330
 I hope you have liked me 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.919
 strongly invites to come to debate in 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.749
 the comments of what a party is 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.310
 game or not for you it can be great 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:47.449
 interesting as usual in the 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.460
 description you can find my 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.990
 facebook and my twitter I invite you 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.150
 also to take a look at the webzine 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.779
 jds mag in which I wrote some 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.250
 goods 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:59.080
 it seems I put you a link in the 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.080
