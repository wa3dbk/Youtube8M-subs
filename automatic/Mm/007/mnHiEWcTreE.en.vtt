00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
7 here and it simply placed in the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.290 
7 here and it simply placed in the
plastic<00:00:30.810> clips<00:00:34.070> on<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> side<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.000> then

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
plastic clips on the side and then

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.220 
plastic clips on the side and then
slowly<00:00:37.110> work<00:00:37.500> them<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> corners<00:00:39.780> they

slowly work them out to the corners they

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.590 
slowly work them out to the corners they
are<00:00:40.379> elasticized<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.550> there's<00:00:41.820> some<00:00:42.030> clicking

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
are elasticized so there's some clicking

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
are elasticized so there's some clicking

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
this don't force matters there's fear

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.960 
this don't force matters there's fear
that<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.560> plastic<00:01:15.979> might<00:01:16.190> crack<00:01:16.460> if<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:16.759> try
