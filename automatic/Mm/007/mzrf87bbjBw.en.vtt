00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.360
 a vegetable that is not often planted in the garden 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.180
 They do not scare right away when the beans situation many think about it 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.319
 Cherry Pie Bolay 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.319
 on the threads sometimes have the floor 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 which makes this vegetable then not just to enjoy 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.509
 I would like to introduce them today to the rods bean Eckert Queen 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.159
 do not be afraid if they come or hear 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.899
 these poles live as delicate as a bus lane million 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.970
 and also has no strings 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.300
 and the big advantage is it saves space 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.060
 If you have a small garden you can use it even in the smallest of spaces 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.870
 one is very 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.460
 earn 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.190
 after being in the tight 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.020
 The snails were often faster than the Poles could often go 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.560
 I decided 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.060
 to prefer the beans 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.910
 I'll make that work sooner but every bean has a chance 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.770
 really giving up 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 they can not 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.780
 with root ball 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.780
 right there I put in the garden 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.090
 that starts with it 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.390
 that the planters with 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.390
 the DAV feel good 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.100
 important here 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.470
 to choose that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.930
 Loose earth 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.970
 Immediately write back of the hand 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.330
 otherwise when casting later 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.280
 The key is equal to half Blair is and we do not want him 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.080
 then something else 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 something else 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.750
 the holes Cores you see coming from last year i 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.890
 prefer my apartment Kerner even that is only incidentally 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.170
 the boys at the core we are laid flat in the ground 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.260
 an old farmer rule says 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.470
 to lie flat so that they can hear the bells 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.929
 that means nothing else live plan you should not bury 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.290
 so and if I live the crumb now 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.919
 I put in a lot of copies of playing time here 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.919
 then 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.919
 for the some earth over it 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.529
 and calmed down 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.699
 the period together with live Corner 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.540
 so and now this Â»we all the rest and 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.669
 that would actually be done 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.239
 put the bowl 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.849
 Do not break too much with the ground 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.499
 the delay that comes up after just over a week 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.099
 Tips surely something out 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.549
 and then after a while this already happens 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.510
 at this size know the beans 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.859
 be put in the garden well 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.849
 and also Dorothea Bachmann the ground 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.140
 she saw 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.109
 very well developed 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.839
 I'm sitting around five to six poles around every pole that's fine with me 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.839
 proven 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:25.309
 Beans could be stopped until the end of June. Someone was with us 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:29.659
 Just give it a try and you'll be surprised how good the 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.319
 Beans Schwegmann and it will be a great addition to their motto 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.229
 Be on the plate 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.890
 yes and then I wish you 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.419
 for fun in favor of the beans 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.549
