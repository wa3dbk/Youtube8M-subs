00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.830 

there<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:30.230> look<00:02:31.230> at<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:33.510> took<00:02:33.660> me<00:02:33.810> a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
there we go look at that it took me a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.860 
there we go look at that it took me a
while<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.080> figure<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.410> out<00:02:34.590> -<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
while to figure this out - this is the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.350 
while to figure this out - this is the
gray<00:02:37.050> beard<00:02:37.230> outfit<00:02:40.850> play<00:02:41.850> around<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.210> a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
second now I believe it stands it's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.920 
second now I believe it stands it's
pretty<00:02:49.590> much<00:02:49.710> like<00:02:49.920> any<00:02:50.130> other<00:02:50.250> rope<00:02:50.720> which<00:02:51.720> is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
pretty much like any other rope which is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.510 
pretty much like any other rope which is
pretty<00:02:52.200> much<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.680> no<00:02:52.980> armor<00:02:53.400> or
