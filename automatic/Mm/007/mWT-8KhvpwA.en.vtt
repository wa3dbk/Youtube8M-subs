00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
an issue normally if you just upload a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.560 
an issue normally if you just upload a
save<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.059> there<00:00:36.480> was

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
save you can do it but there was

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.260 
save you can do it but there was
something<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.870> wanted<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:38.270> couldn't

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
something I wanted to do that couldn't

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.530 
something I wanted to do that couldn't
be<00:00:39.930> done<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.010> there's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> few<00:00:42.000> things<00:00:42.329> like

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
be done so there's a few things like

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.670 
be done so there's a few things like
this<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:42.930> example

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
this for example

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440 
this for example
this<00:00:44.040> sign<00:00:44.280> will<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.460> gone<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> second<00:00:45.270> so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
this sign will be gone in a second so

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.900 
this sign will be gone in a second so
first<00:00:46.260> thing<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.530> let's<00:00:46.739> say<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.399> map<00:00:47.640> was

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
first thing I let's say if this map was

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.360 
first thing I let's say if this map was
built<00:00:48.180> by<00:00:48.360> me<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.930> entire<00:00:49.289> thing<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> guess

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
built by me the entire thing so I guess

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.619 
built by me the entire thing so I guess
we've<00:00:50.520> got<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:50.700> people<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> game<00:00:51.120> now<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
we've got some people in the game now so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
we've got some people in the game now so
this<00:00:52.110> map<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.500> built<00:00:52.680> by<00:00:52.770> made<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.219> lobby

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this map was built by made the lobby

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.510 
this map was built by made the lobby
however<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.239> built<00:00:54.510> by<00:00:54.899> fuzzy<00:00:55.739> fox<00:00:55.949> films<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
however was built by fuzzy fox films I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
however was built by fuzzy fox films I
did<00:00:57.030> create<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.510> arena<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.379> something

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
did create the arena that is something

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
did create the arena that is something
that's<00:00:58.829> changed<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.219> time<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.600> new<00:01:00.750> mod

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that's changed this time so the new mod

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.619 
that's changed this time so the new mod

this map is I love this map this is
really<00:02:01.920> cool<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.340> worked<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.700> lot<00:02:03.000> better<00:02:03.060> than

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
really cool it worked a lot better than

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.230 
really cool it worked a lot better than
I<00:02:03.659> thought<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:05.130> whole<00:02:05.340> thing<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.729> really<00:02:05.850> tiny

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
I thought the whole thing is really tiny

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.919 
I thought the whole thing is really tiny
map<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:08.119> just<00:02:09.119> generally<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.569> really<00:02:09.810> happy

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
map and just generally I'm really happy

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.660 
map and just generally I'm really happy
with<00:02:10.080> how<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.349> came<00:02:10.379> out<00:02:10.649> now<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.280> notice

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
with how it came out now if you notice

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.350 
with how it came out now if you notice
that<00:02:11.819> little<00:02:12.000> bit<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.239> actually<00:02:12.569> delay<00:02:12.840> with

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
that little bit of actually delay with

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.940 
that little bit of actually delay with
dragon<00:02:13.570> spawning<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.560> added<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.890> on

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
dragon spawning I have added that on

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.480 
dragon spawning I have added that on
purpose<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:16.630> gives<00:02:16.930> people<00:02:17.080> time<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.220> load

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
purpose so it gives people time to load

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.110 
purpose so it gives people time to load
the<00:02:18.580> chunks<00:02:18.910> which<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:19.960> really<00:02:20.200> cool<00:02:20.440> now<00:02:21.120> so

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
the chunks which is really cool now so

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.880 
the chunks which is really cool now so
let's<00:02:22.360> take<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.570> look<00:02:22.720> at<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.900> map<00:02:23.080> shall<00:02:23.320> we<00:02:23.470> so

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
let's take a look at the map shall we so

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.440

so the reason I have steak is because I

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.190 
so the reason I have steak is because I
