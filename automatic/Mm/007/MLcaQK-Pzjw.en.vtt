what's<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:14.119> good<00:00:14.270> about<00:00:14.330> this<00:00:14.570> camera<00:00:14.900> well

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
what's so good about this camera well

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.080 
what's so good about this camera well
the<00:00:15.559> thing<00:00:15.770> that's<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.160> different<00:00:16.580> about<00:00:16.910> of

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
the thing that's so different about of

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.759 
the thing that's so different about of
course<00:00:17.269> is<00:00:17.510> that<00:00:17.539> it's<00:00:17.840> full<00:00:17.990> frames<00:00:18.320> so<00:00:18.590> this

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
course is that it's full frames so this

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.159 
course is that it's full frames so this
is<00:00:18.949> Sony's<00:00:19.340> new<00:00:19.400> 24<00:00:20.119> Meg<00:00:20.300> full<00:00:20.570> frame<00:00:20.779> camera

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
is Sony's new 24 Meg full frame camera

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.810 
is Sony's new 24 Meg full frame camera
okay<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:21.529> of<00:00:21.829> course<00:00:22.009> why<00:00:22.279> is<00:00:22.339> full<00:00:22.609> frame

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
okay so of course why is full frame

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.700 
okay so of course why is full frame
beneficial<00:00:23.570> well<00:00:24.019> I<00:00:24.050> think<00:00:24.199> there's<00:00:24.499> a<00:00:24.560> group

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
beneficial well I think there's a group

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.169 
beneficial well I think there's a group
of<00:00:24.800> photographers<00:00:24.980> that<00:00:25.490> are<00:00:25.789> looking<00:00:26.029> for

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
of photographers that are looking for

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.060 
of photographers that are looking for
maybe<00:00:26.359> a<00:00:26.449> better<00:00:26.599> quality<00:00:26.900> picture<00:00:27.619> yeah<00:00:27.859> and

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
maybe a better quality picture yeah and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.370 
maybe a better quality picture yeah and
there<00:00:28.400> they<00:00:28.909> like<00:00:29.329> the<00:00:29.480> traditional<00:00:29.720> numbers

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
there they like the traditional numbers

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.920 
there they like the traditional numbers
of<00:00:30.529> saying<00:00:30.829> my<00:00:31.009> 24<00:00:31.489> mill<00:00:31.699> lens<00:00:31.939> is<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.239> 24<00:00:32.780> mill

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
of saying my 24 mill lens is a 24 mill

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.510 
of saying my 24 mill lens is a 24 mill
and<00:00:33.170> this<00:00:33.350> is<00:00:33.470> true<00:00:33.590> you<00:00:34.040> have<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.280> deal<00:00:34.399> with

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
and this is true you have to deal with

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.190 
and this is true you have to deal with
that<00:00:34.579> conversion<00:00:34.970> factor<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:35.870> of<00:00:36.020> course

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
that conversion factor and of course

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.540 
that conversion factor and of course
with<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.440> larger<00:00:36.740> sensor<00:00:37.040> you're<00:00:37.190> also<00:00:37.310> going

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
with the larger sensor you're also going

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.160 
with the larger sensor you're also going
to<00:00:37.640> get<00:00:37.760> those<00:00:37.970> higher<00:00:38.150> quality<00:00:38.630> images<00:00:38.960> in

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
to get those higher quality images in

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.780 
to get those higher quality images in
low<00:00:39.320> light<00:00:39.530> as<00:00:39.650> well<00:00:39.800> right<00:00:40.130> the<00:00:40.280> sensor<00:00:40.610> just

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
low light as well right the sensor just

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.340 
low light as well right the sensor just
covers<00:00:41.060> more<00:00:41.210> geography<00:00:41.810> and<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.020> think<00:00:42.200> that's

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
covers more geography and I think that's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.780 
covers more geography and I think that's
great<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:42.620> think<00:00:42.800> it<00:00:43.010> just<00:00:43.040> gives<00:00:43.340> you<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.550> better

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
great I think it just gives you a better

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.400 
great I think it just gives you a better
resolution<00:00:43.970> so<00:00:44.690> what<00:00:44.840> are<00:00:44.870> some<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.290> other

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
resolution so what are some of the other

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.080 
resolution so what are some of the other
notable<00:00:45.800> features<00:00:46.040> about<00:00:46.160> this<00:00:46.310> camera<00:00:46.610> well

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
notable features about this camera well

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.470 
notable features about this camera well
so<00:00:47.510> it's<00:00:47.660> 24<00:00:48.230> Meg's<00:00:48.470> full<00:00:48.770> frame<00:00:49.070> yeah<00:00:49.550> it<00:00:49.760> does

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
so it's 24 Meg's full frame yeah it does

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.240 
so it's 24 Meg's full frame yeah it does

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
that's sort of new for us to a full

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.320 
that's sort of new for us to a full
frame<00:00:54.260> video<00:00:54.410> yeah<00:00:54.860> six<00:00:55.430> frames<00:00:55.610> per<00:00:55.880> second

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
frame video yeah six frames per second

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.590 
frame video yeah six frames per second
and<00:00:56.890> things<00:00:57.890> like<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.880> camera<00:00:59.180> is<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.330> little

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
and things like the camera is a little

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.330 
and things like the camera is a little
bit<00:00:59.690> more<00:00:59.870> oriented<00:01:00.560> towards<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.100> video

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
bit more oriented towards the video

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.090 
bit more oriented towards the video
where<00:01:01.880> you've<00:01:02.030> got<00:01:02.240> audio<00:01:02.540> controls<00:01:03.140> now<00:01:03.470> the

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
where you've got audio controls now the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.770 
where you've got audio controls now the
dials<00:01:04.579> are<00:01:04.759> silent<00:01:05.269> so<00:01:05.390> if<00:01:05.509> you're<00:01:05.630> running

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
dials are silent so if you're running

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.270 
dials are silent so if you're running
video<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.380> need<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.619> change<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.979> dials

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
video and you need to change the dials

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.160 
video and you need to change the dials
it's<00:01:07.400> all<00:01:07.490> silent<00:01:07.970> okay<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.630> cameras<00:01:08.930> weather

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
it's all silent okay the cameras weather

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.230

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
bit more of a pro level camera than some

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.640
