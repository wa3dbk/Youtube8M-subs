folks who are in charge of the Olympics

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.060 
folks who are in charge of the Olympics
that<00:05:15.570> they<00:05:15.720> should<00:05:15.990> be<00:05:16.020> able<00:05:16.230> to<00:05:16.530> handle<00:05:16.740> this

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
that they should be able to handle this

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.540 
that they should be able to handle this
thing<00:05:17.340> in<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.550> proper<00:05:17.970> way<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:19.550> my

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
thing in a proper way and my

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.340 
thing in a proper way and my
disappointment<00:05:21.300> is<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.600> to<00:05:21.720> see<00:05:21.930> that<00:05:22.140> the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
disappointment is just to see that the

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.610 
disappointment is just to see that the
league<00:05:22.730> baseball<00:05:23.730> in<00:05:23.760> particular<00:05:24.620> didn't

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
league baseball in particular didn't

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.180 
league baseball in particular didn't
take<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:25.980> on<00:05:26.570> sooner<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.770> more<00:05:28.950> serious

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
take this on sooner in a more serious

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.670 
take this on sooner in a more serious
way<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.820> think<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.390> NFL<00:05:30.750> but<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.990> better<00:05:31.200> job<00:05:31.470> on

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
way I think the NFL but a better job on

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.890 
way I think the NFL but a better job on
it<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:31.980> that<00:05:32.010> tells<00:05:32.670> me<00:05:32.970> that<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.720> know<00:05:33.840> if

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
it and that tells me that you know if

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.690 
it and that tells me that you know if
you<00:05:33.990> crack<00:05:34.260> down<00:05:34.500> on<00:05:34.530> these<00:05:34.770> folks<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.280> you

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
you crack down on these folks and you

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.530 
you crack down on these folks and you
lay<00:05:36.180> down<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.540> law<00:05:36.570> in<00:05:37.470> a<00:05:37.620> serious<00:05:37.980> way<00:05:38.010> that

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
lay down the law in a serious way that

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.330 
lay down the law in a serious way that
that<00:05:39.540> you<00:05:40.020> can<00:05:40.200> get<00:05:40.290> control<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.680> this<00:05:40.830> thing<00:05:40.950> I

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
that you can get control of this thing I

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.800 
that you can get control of this thing I
know<00:05:41.730> since<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.150> think<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.480> right<00:05:42.630> way<00:05:42.750> to

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
know since I think the right way to

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.720 
know since I think the right way to
handle<00:05:42.930> when<00:05:43.350> we<00:05:43.650> had<00:05:43.860> you<00:05:43.980> on<00:05:44.100> before<00:05:44.130> center

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
handle when we had you on before center

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.220 
handle when we had you on before center
I<00:05:44.790> never<00:05:45.120> really<00:05:45.390> got<00:05:45.540> around<00:05:45.630> to<00:05:45.930> ask<00:05:46.050> you

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
I never really got around to ask you

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.780 
I never really got around to ask you
about<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.470> NCAA<00:05:46.980> tournament<00:05:47.280> which<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.730> know

about the NCAA tournament which I know
