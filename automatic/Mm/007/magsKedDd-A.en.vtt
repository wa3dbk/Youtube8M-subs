red spruce which we find around here

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.420 
red spruce which we find around here
we're<00:03:45.900> very<00:03:46.170> fortunate<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.920> be<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.280> area

we're very fortunate to be in the area

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.970 
we're very fortunate to be in the area
and<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.750> grows<00:03:49.019> all<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.410> way<00:03:49.500> up<00:03:49.650> into<00:03:49.890> Vermont

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
and it grows all the way up into Vermont

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.460 
and it grows all the way up into Vermont
higher<00:03:52.980> elevations<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.660> red<00:03:54.840> spruce<00:03:55.140> is

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
higher elevations and the red spruce is

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.710 
higher elevations and the red spruce is
sort<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.920> gold<00:03:56.220> standard<00:03:56.370> now<00:03:56.940> it's<00:03:57.239> as

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
sort of the gold standard now it's as

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.839 
sort of the gold standard now it's as
the<00:03:57.900> highest<00:03:58.260> modulus<00:03:58.830> of<00:03:58.980> elasticity<00:03:59.430> it's

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
the highest modulus of elasticity it's

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.630 
the highest modulus of elasticity it's
the<00:04:00.090> strongest<00:04:00.870> stuff<00:04:01.319> on<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.590> planet<00:04:01.980> right

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the strongest stuff on the planet right

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.979 
the strongest stuff on the planet right
now<00:04:02.849> so<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.660> lot<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.500> people<00:04:04.830> are<00:04:04.920> after<00:04:05.069> that

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
now so a lot of people are after that
