00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.690 
putting on this shimmery purple color
and<00:01:45.909> into<00:01:46.719> my<00:01:46.810> crease<00:01:47.229> I'm<00:01:47.590> using<00:01:47.890> my<00:01:48.130> contour

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
and into my crease I'm using my contour

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.730 
and into my crease I'm using my contour
color<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.270> then<00:01:49.750> I'm<00:01:49.840> using<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:50.289> blending

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
color and then I'm using a blending

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.770 
color and then I'm using a blending
brush<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:51.009> blend<00:01:51.490> out<00:01:51.729> all<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.030> colors<00:01:52.359> so<00:01:52.630> it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
brush to blend out all the colors so it

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.240 
brush to blend out all the colors so it
just<00:01:52.960> all<00:01:53.079> flows<00:01:53.619> nicely<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:55.920> off-camera<00:01:56.920> I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
just all flows nicely and off-camera I

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.719 
just all flows nicely and off-camera I
actually<00:01:57.429> went<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.179> I<00:01:58.810> do<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:59.590> nice<00:02:00.280> bold

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
actually went in and I do a nice bold

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.550 
actually went in and I do a nice bold
winged<00:02:01.000> liner<00:02:01.299> because<00:02:01.570> I<00:02:01.750> physically<00:02:02.229> can't

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
winged liner because I physically can't

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.620

do<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:03.100> camera<00:02:03.609> it's<00:02:03.820> impossible<00:02:04.420> for<00:02:04.450> me

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
do that on camera it's impossible for me

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.620 
do that on camera it's impossible for me
and<00:02:04.929> then<00:02:05.649> I<00:02:05.679> went<00:02:05.979> in<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.789> brown<00:02:07.240> liner

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630

just like lightly brush it brush it onto
my<00:03:23.260> cheeks<00:03:23.910> now<00:03:24.910> for<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.209> lips<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.780> started<00:03:26.139> off

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
my cheeks now for the lips I started off

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.590 
my cheeks now for the lips I started off
with<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.440> lip<00:03:26.650> liner<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.370> I'm<00:03:27.609> using<00:03:27.940> this<00:03:28.359> I

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
with a lip liner and I'm using this I

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.979 
with a lip liner and I'm using this I
think<00:03:29.230> it's<00:03:29.350> removed<00:03:29.799> 24-hour<00:03:30.730> lip<00:03:31.299> gloss<00:03:31.569> and

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
think it's removed 24-hour lip gloss and

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.340 
think it's removed 24-hour lip gloss and
it<00:03:32.829> actually<00:03:33.310> lasts<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.150> really<00:03:34.209> long<00:03:34.569> time<00:03:35.049> but

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
it actually lasts a really long time but

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.539 
it actually lasts a really long time but
we<00:03:35.470> have<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> do<00:03:35.829> is<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.040> have<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.190> apply<00:03:36.280> it

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
we have to do is you have to apply it

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.729 
we have to do is you have to apply it
and<00:03:36.819> then<00:03:36.970> let<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.299> like<00:03:37.450> set<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.200> dry<00:03:38.560> out

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
and then let it like set and dry out
