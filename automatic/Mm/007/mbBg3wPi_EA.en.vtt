00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:17.974
AROUND 2000 YEARS AGO

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.108
A MAN DIED FOR US

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.801
DEFYING THE WORLD

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.435
THE JACKAL PRESENTS

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.508
NOW IT’S TIME

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.029
Father, I’m back.

00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:15.721
There are strange noises
coming from the tomb

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.383
Go and give news to
John of the things

00:01:26.383 --> 00:01:28.486
which you are seeing and hearing

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:31.631
the blind receive their sight,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.470
the lame walk

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.582
The dead are raised up.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.237
TO START BELIEVING

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:40.429
Send officers to check

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.691
The kingdom of God is
not to attract attention

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.732
and no one will say: Here it is, or there it is

00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:51.141
The third day he came back from the dead

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:56.239
Christ?

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:58.510
Because the kingdom of God

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.645
Jesus, are you in there?

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.597
is among you

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.184
What you mean he is fuckin revived?

00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:26.579
Jesus Christ!

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:29.890
it’s up to me now

00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:38.318
THEY HAD AN ARMY

00:02:38.318 --> 00:02:39.589
Peace be with you!

00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:44.405
As the Father has sent me, I send you too!

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.747
WE HAD A MESSIAH

00:02:50.717 --> 00:02:53.844
Resurrection Mode: On

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.405
He’s revived!

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.520
Respect! GO!

00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:02.417
Ok, I can walk on the water...
