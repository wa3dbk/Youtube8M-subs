00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.649
 oh how about friends greetings to all the 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:08.320
 Today I am going to show you a very 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.590
 interesting for your galaxy in this 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.730
 occasion I share one for the version 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.080
 4 4.2 is the theme domination is this a 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.340
 theme to dark usp totally aspect 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.770
 pure android here as you can see 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.580
 we keep running in our our 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.970
 touchwiz interface with its classics 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.940
 colors then if you do not want 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.579
 okay to have one more look this fine and 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.130
 minimalist I'm going to share this 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.870
 the only thing that needs to be done is that 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.300
 if we have mods then we have to 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.160
 uninstall the by say the installer 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.090
 xbox can be one of those we're going to 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.660
 uninstall 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.880
 there already already uninstalled we make a 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.640
 restart for what 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.160
 for it to take effect 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.160
 normal restart 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.170
 ok restart this is a requirement that 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.750
 ask the developer not to have any 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.960
 installed mode do not have any subject 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.880
 It also does not ask us for a requirement 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.210
 that with road explorer we edit a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.070
 application that is this browser provider 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.890
 I think it's the application of 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.700
 Samsung's 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.210
 that of 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.159
 your native explorer we go with route 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.159
 explore and we go to system 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.960
 system and in system app we look for the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.670
 application that I tell you that is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.550
 browser 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.740
 browser provider apk is this 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.740
 let's select and we will rename 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.930
 we grant superuser permissions 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 we see that if we put it back 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.860
 point back 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.490
 there we already change the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.270
 the name of this application that are the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.040
 only requirements that the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.430
 developer does not have many installed 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.140
 have no issues and avoid that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.690
 application then now yes we already have 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.040
 downloaded our theme that I'm going to 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.480
 leave the link of the description of 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.080
 video is the domination theme we're going to 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.370
 restart the computer 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.370
 the recovery mode 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.210
 we wait for it to turn off well 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.360
 ah already turned off home power and volume 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.360
 above 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.380
 and let's power 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.380
 we leave volume and home pressed 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.069
 ok there we are in the recovery field and 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.379
 we are going to settle 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.980
 susi from store so I have it in the 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.310
 card 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.620
 I have it in the download folder 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:35.989
 domination downloads version 1.91 which is 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.989
 the theme adapted for version 442 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.390
 we install 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.739
 As I tell you, it is not necessary to do 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.370
 no white since in the sip script 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.680
 comes already included there was first made the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.540
 cleaning of cache and dalby cache already 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.069
 the archives are just wavering 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.959
 all the images 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.530
 then there is no need to do 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.530
 no wipe 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.830
 this topic is very good because a lot 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.540
 people like to have the kindness of 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.299
 all wish as is the camera as they are 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.979
 the sensors but they do not like the 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.410
 Samsung interface is green 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.110
 then with this theme that we 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.470
 provides the developer bert humus 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.470
 we got all the appearance to usp that 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.050
 minimalist and dark look with type 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.599
 pure android 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.840
 and at the same time we have got 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.669
 keeping all the benefits of 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.830
 Wish all finished by then takes 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.560
 something has to be patient classes 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.630

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.210
 all the applications of the equipment is going to 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.910
