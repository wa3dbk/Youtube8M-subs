cold
yeah<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:56.060> what<00:01:57.060> caused<00:01:57.329> some<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
yeah so that's what caused some of the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.850 
yeah so that's what caused some of the
problem<00:01:58.700> saving<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> would<00:02:00.810> mean<00:02:01.020> coming<00:02:01.619> up

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
problem saving it would mean coming up

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.580 
problem saving it would mean coming up
with<00:02:02.040> seven<00:02:02.369> million<00:02:02.670> dollars<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.409> to

with seven million dollars to just to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.530 
with seven million dollars to just to
cover<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.979> debts<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:05.759> without

cover the debts they have now without
even<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.079> deficit<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> year<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.069> come<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
even the deficit for the year to come so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.820 
even the deficit for the year to come so
it<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.509> impossible<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.349> diocese<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
it was impossible for the diocese to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.420 
it was impossible for the diocese to
lend<00:02:11.220> more<00:02:11.400> money

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
lend more money

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
and the money that's lent it comes from

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.690 
and the money that's lent it comes from
the<00:02:14.049> Compostela<00:02:14.620> fund<00:02:14.890> which<00:02:15.010> has<00:02:15.159> a<00:02:15.219> separate

the possibility that the money's gonna
be<00:02:19.209> repaid<00:02:19.659> it<00:02:20.530> isn't<00:02:20.829> a<00:02:20.890> grant<00:02:21.189> we<00:02:21.519> don't<00:02:21.700> have

be repaid it isn't a grant we don't have
the<00:02:22.060> money<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.329> the<00:02:22.510> diocese<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:22.989> be<00:02:23.260> able<00:02:23.439> to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
perhaps you can say it's our fault that

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.720 
perhaps you can say it's our fault that
we<00:02:47.590> lend<00:02:47.889> the<00:02:47.950> money<00:02:47.980> money<00:02:48.310> but<00:02:48.519> we<00:02:48.609> don't

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
we lend the money money but we don't

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.610 
we lend the money money but we don't
have<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.909> money<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.150> lend<00:02:49.419> them<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:50.109> that<00:02:50.349> and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
have the money to lend them and that and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.860 
have the money to lend them and that and
that<00:02:50.739> way<00:02:50.950> when<00:02:51.609> you<00:02:51.669> say<00:02:51.849> 70<00:02:52.239> students<00:02:52.689> you

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
that way when you say 70 students you

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.050 
that way when you say 70 students you
mean<00:02:53.019> 70<00:02:53.439> incoming<00:02:53.980> fresh<00:02:54.250> food<00:02:54.549> yes<00:02:54.849> right

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
mean 70 incoming fresh food yes right

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.610 
mean 70 incoming fresh food yes right
right<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:55.810> think<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.139> total<00:02:56.409> enrollment

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
right and I think the total enrollment

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.409 
right and I think the total enrollment
for<00:02:57.069> next<00:02:57.310> year<00:02:57.459> was<00:02:57.609> projected<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.180> be<00:02:58.269> about

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
for next year was projected to be about

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.229 
for next year was projected to be about
420<00:02:59.290> which<00:02:59.889> was<00:03:00.069> only<00:03:00.250> about<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.519> third<00:03:00.879> of<00:03:01.180> what

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
420 which was only about a third of what

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.300 
420 which was only about a third of what
where<00:03:01.659> they<00:03:01.810> were<00:03:01.870> but<00:03:02.109> it<00:03:02.260> definitely<00:03:02.829> it's

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
where they were but it definitely it's

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.330 
where they were but it definitely it's
way<00:03:03.489> down<00:03:03.760> way<00:03:04.030> down<00:03:04.060> yeah<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.709> it's<00:03:06.040> part<00:03:06.280> of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
way down way down yeah so it's part of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.009 
way down way down yeah so it's part of
the<00:03:06.400> problem<00:03:06.730> demographics<00:03:07.329> then<00:03:07.510> are<00:03:07.900> there

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
the problem demographics then are there

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.869 
the problem demographics then are there
not<00:03:08.200> enough<00:03:08.469> kids<00:03:08.709> or<00:03:08.919> the<00:03:09.069> kids<00:03:09.310> not<00:03:09.489> able<00:03:09.730> to

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
not enough kids or the kids not able to

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.699 
not enough kids or the kids not able to
pay<00:03:10.060> there<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.359> a<00:03:10.389> little<00:03:10.810> demographic<00:03:11.530> issue

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
pay there is a little demographic issue

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.709 
pay there is a little demographic issue
there's<00:03:12.099> less<00:03:12.340> children<00:03:12.939> being<00:03:13.120> born<00:03:13.209> in<00:03:13.569> this

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
there's less children being born in this

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.409 
there's less children being born in this
this<00:03:13.989> cohort<00:03:14.409> these<00:03:14.680> years<00:03:15.099> but<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:16.000> really<00:03:16.150> is

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419 
this cohort these years but it really is

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.229 
this cohort these years but it really is
people<00:03:16.810> can't<00:03:17.049> pay<00:03:17.229> the<00:03:17.409> tuition<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.129> so<00:03:18.459> they

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
people can't pay the tuition and so they

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.849 
people can't pay the tuition and so they
have<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.540> give<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> lot<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.019> scholarships<00:03:20.590> which

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
have to give a lot of scholarships which

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.360 
have to give a lot of scholarships which
they<00:03:21.159> don't<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.519> money<00:03:21.699> to<00:03:21.940> do<00:03:22.090> mm-hmm

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
they don't have the money to do mm-hmm

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.129 
they don't have the money to do mm-hmm
what<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.519> what<00:03:25.090> are<00:03:25.180> they<00:03:25.329> trying<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:25.750> do<00:03:25.959> for

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
they had a high school fair I think they

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.899 
they had a high school fair I think they
had<00:03:31.419> 25<00:03:31.900> schools<00:03:32.229> there<00:03:32.560> from<00:03:33.280> our<00:03:33.459> diocese

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
had 25 schools there from our diocese

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.149 
had 25 schools there from our diocese
from<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.269> Archdiocese<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.079> New<00:03:35.260> York<00:03:35.439> that

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
from the Archdiocese of New York that

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.879 
from the Archdiocese of New York that
were<00:03:36.370> enrolling<00:03:37.030> students<00:03:37.689> I<00:03:37.900> don't<00:03:38.620> know<00:03:38.739> the

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
were enrolling students I don't know the

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.740 
were enrolling students I don't know the
final<00:03:39.250> numbers<00:03:39.639> but<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.939> seems<00:03:40.209> like<00:03:40.419> some<00:03:40.659> of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
final numbers but it seems like some of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.330 
final numbers but it seems like some of
those<00:03:40.810> schools<00:03:41.319> picked<00:03:41.680> up<00:03:41.829> quite<00:03:42.069> a<00:03:42.099> few

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
those schools picked up quite a few

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.520 
those schools picked up quite a few
students<00:03:42.759> some<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.810> them<00:03:43.930> were<00:03:44.019> offering<00:03:44.409> them

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
students some of them were offering them

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.670 
students some of them were offering them
the<00:03:44.680> same<00:03:44.889> tuition<00:03:45.129> until<00:03:46.090> they<00:03:46.329> graduated<00:03:47.079> so

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
the same tuition until they graduated so

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.990 
the same tuition until they graduated so

I think that was very generous on the
part<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.449> other<00:03:49.569> schools<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.769> don't<00:03:51.430> know

could have saved the school it's a long

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.700 
could have saved the school it's a long
shot<00:06:03.969> because<00:06:04.240> you'd<00:06:05.110> have<00:06:05.139> to<00:06:05.319> raise<00:06:05.529> the

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
shot because you'd have to raise the

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.379 
shot because you'd have to raise the
money<00:06:05.830> first<00:06:06.159> then<00:06:06.669> you'd<00:06:06.849> have<00:06:06.939> to<00:06:07.089> build<00:06:07.240> to

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
money first then you'd have to build to

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.360 
money first then you'd have to build to
make<00:06:07.449> sure<00:06:07.659> that<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.469> students<00:06:08.919> got<00:06:09.069> the

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
make sure that the students got the

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.939 
make sure that the students got the
relief<00:06:10.120> on<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.479> tuition<00:06:10.659> so<00:06:11.409> they<00:06:11.529> could<00:06:11.740> come

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
relief on the tuition so they could come

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.070 
relief on the tuition so they could come
so<00:06:12.219> that's<00:06:12.879> a<00:06:13.029> really<00:06:13.330> long<00:06:13.539> shot

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
so that's a really long shot

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.719 
so that's a really long shot
it's<00:06:14.379> unfortunate<00:06:14.889> it<00:06:14.949> didn't<00:06:15.159> happen<00:06:15.520> but

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
it's unfortunate it didn't happen but

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.459 
it's unfortunate it didn't happen but
that<00:06:16.360> would<00:06:16.569> not<00:06:16.750> have<00:06:16.900> saved<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.349> school

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:17.469
