been on it ever since having fun trying
to<00:00:21.720> learn<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> sequencer<00:00:22.560> trying<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:22.980> my

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
to learn a sequencer trying to get my

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.640 
to learn a sequencer trying to get my
drums<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.640> right<00:00:24.140> it's<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> little<00:00:25.350> different

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
drums just right it's a little different

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710 
drums just right it's a little different
than<00:00:26.369> your<00:00:26.550> regular<00:00:26.670> sample<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.390> workstation

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
than your regular sample or workstation

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.050 
than your regular sample or workstation
it's<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.380> really<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.619> workstation<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.340> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it's not really a workstation but it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.849 
it's not really a workstation but it
doesn't<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.480> pressure-sensitive<00:00:31.380> pass

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
doesn't have pressure-sensitive pass

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.110 
doesn't have pressure-sensitive pass
velocity<00:00:32.489> sensor<00:00:32.880> that's<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.480> past<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.670> got

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
velocity sensor that's the past so I got

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
velocity sensor that's the past so I got
to<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.570> workarounds<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.920> far<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.219> getting

let's<00:02:38.210> say<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:39.290> same<00:02:39.560> type<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:39.980> was<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:41.140> 44.1<00:02:42.140> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
let's say the same type of was a 44.1 a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.000 
let's say the same type of was a 44.1 a
16-bit<00:02:45.700> sampler<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:46.910> like<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:48.140> 2000<00:02:48.710> XL

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
16-bit sampler just like the the 2000 XL

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.380 
16-bit sampler just like the the 2000 XL
and<00:02:49.960> so<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:51.230> planned<00:02:51.740> on<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.850> know<00:02:52.970> using<00:02:53.330> the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
and so I planned on you know using the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.530 
and so I planned on you know using the
two<00:02:53.570> machines<00:02:53.720> together<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.830> maybe<00:02:55.790> doing

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
two machines together and maybe doing

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.080 
two machines together and maybe doing
some<00:02:56.750> stuff<00:02:56.930> on<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.170> XL<00:02:57.530> chopping<00:02:58.070> maybe<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
some stuff on the XL chopping maybe and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.940 
some stuff on the XL chopping maybe and
then<00:02:59.239> putting<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.630> on<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.780> SD<00:03:00.110> card<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.680> then

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
then putting it on the SD card and then

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.160 
then putting it on the SD card and then
load<00:03:01.700> an<00:03:01.790> SD<00:03:02.090> card<00:03:02.330> into<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.980> sexier<00:03:05.170> but

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170
