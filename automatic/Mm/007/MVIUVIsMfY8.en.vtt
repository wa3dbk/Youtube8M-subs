00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.050
 hello here is our century shipment 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.389
 and explain yourself in the next few minutes 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 how easy is our offer together 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.850
 To preserve our impression consists of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 following part 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:26.490
 First we have the saddle with the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.619
 of course, next you come 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.950
 the impeller with crank already formatted 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.390
 and the mature there's the here 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.140
 Practically small box with the dress 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:48.899
 share because we even have the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 both pedals the saying clamp and in 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:58.829
 the cl finale manages to last 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.129
 we have a rat course in there 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.949
 all other colors as a tool 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.310
 you will need about 10 mm of key to change 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.500
 to assemble the frame 15 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.909
 millimeter exclusions and pedals too 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.320
 attach and 1 5 millimeter inbus 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.119
 key around designer clamp stuck 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.200
 turn 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.900
 maybe you need one more 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.900
 iron saw the salt bar too short 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.760
 First, we assemble the unicycle 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.070
 frame fork called to the impeller 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.780
 It should be noted that it was at 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.990
 unicycle a right and a left side 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.960
 they can recognize this at the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.000
 inside of the bend where an 11 for left 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.270
 side is and then rather for 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.770
 right side being in the frame from the front 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.330
 is recognizable by the step of 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.340
 after all, it has to be 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.000
 located on the inside of the bend 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.020
 he rightly cut his fork 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.990
 is at least the first I set the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.560
 fork on the impeller important as straight 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.650
 declared to pay attention to right and left 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 then I turn the wheel around 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.680
 put the bearing shells on the bearings 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.400
 after that I lead the screw through the 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.560
 holes are provided for the ring 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.880
 Fix them with the screws 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.450
 at first only a little bit with the mother 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.980
 the same thing works on the other side 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.500
 screw through ring on the screws 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.430
 fix 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:47.520
 Now I need the 10 mm x key 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.520
 to tighten the screws 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.260
 put the mother on hand and there 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.420
 otherwise the bearings will be damaged 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.670
 important is that it did not work anymore 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.040
 but that's still good 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.050
 the same thing they do on the move 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.970
 other side so all four 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.220
 screws are well tightened 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.680
 Next we assemble the pedals 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.739
 here is like the one boost 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.480
 rather engraved which means that the 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.790
 pedals on the right side of a rad 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.950
 First of all , we will start to mount 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.120
 to the pedals as far as it goes with the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.360
 to screw on before we reach the 15th 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.040
 mm mouse key to take help 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.549
 the pedals can be really solid 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.129
 now it is already on 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.640
 almost finished together as a last step 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:46.629
 we take the thing clear to them on 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.709
 the fork on it was we note 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:53.799
 slit on next to the sac 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.060
 this one in Italy 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.530
 very important the direction still 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.200
 to control once 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.150
 right side on the right side now 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.150
 take the hexagonal connections inside 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.900
 both tighten screws 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.360
 Now the unicycle is ready mounted 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.530
 check the air pressure again 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.520
 and look that saddle right 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.980
 is set 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.810
 as a guide, it offers the 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.240
 navel at the upper edge 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.730
 The man should be more 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.870
 You can find information on www one 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.220
 art versand.de the whole team wish 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.060
 them a lot of fun with their new
