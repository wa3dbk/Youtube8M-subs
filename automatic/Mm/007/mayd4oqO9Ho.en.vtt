 his fourth also became a contraction of preparing a button for you 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.769
 can do iphone 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.269
 this is how the coolpix circulates around 15 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.440
 and not members have all in it 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.989
 the baker with vision 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.839
 what you shoot a lot is that we deal with 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.429
 or a perfect trail girl the driver used this way to spell it 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.550
 the background of course it's a good way but the best time over and over 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.720
 I am sitting here with his obligations, in that sense she is also one 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:35.580
 harmless 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.570
 employer we guarantee a faster and more professional way 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.880
 take the training the road again with chef's knife I use now lay flat 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.020
 could use 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.450
 3 limit 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 I just put it 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.410
 in the second place but barely on the facade a child makes a good impression 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.480
 both clubs 6 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.230
 the padt the recordings made are generated 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.950
 pull there would take weighing haarlem the sheet he gets i told you 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.500
 then 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.240
 in the garlic 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.760
 the so-called 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.410
 piece is wrong when I use it after he missed it in the front 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.640
 then I have a lot less trouble 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.500
 van Broekhoven if we do that 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.840
 nine paper newspapers are there 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.460
 the new broadcaster also one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.410
 and the lead to process the fact that not 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.410
 fifth place 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.170
 this way 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.520
 that things are going so well 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.390
 it can also be smaller 8 because I have to work behind on a bit of bad luck 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.080
 the smoke 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.610
 and I only a little 3 higher 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.140
 8 8 the workplace 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.550
 Amsterdam anp a group of people 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.950
 the hole with pursuer 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.530
 another method 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.620
 Of course I know him sometimes 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.060
 press the garlic 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.490
 also press 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.160
 peeled garlic a shrink 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.170
 and I bite each 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.609
 especially on the girl 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.649
 on the backside 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.589
 well on the way recently 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.389
 the passage i have the plague every day 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.150
 the original says this is not necessary either 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.989
 for work for editing once again very happy with this 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.090
 garlic does indicate how difficult the shield is a nice match 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.500
 caught or the press 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.159
 what you should not do the sector 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.719
 the villepin and she has 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.079
 so used for also in the process of the century 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.269
 and women arrested for the same time as 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.760
 it is true that it gets rather brown it freezes when the roma and it goes after all 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.760
 more often so you get a bit of a search, so even the ones on it are still running 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.579
 recorded 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.989
 stay as low as possible 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.659
 conclusion was that the weight of the chain can reach by Christmas 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:55.420
 such an expensive one
