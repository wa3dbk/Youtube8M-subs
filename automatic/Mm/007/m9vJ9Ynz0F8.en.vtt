00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
inventory I haven't tested up the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
inventory I haven't tested up the
experience<00:01:27.119> exactly<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> imagine<00:01:28.439> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
experience exactly but I imagine it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
experience exactly but I imagine it
hasn't<00:01:28.799> changed<00:01:28.829> too<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.310> since<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> actual

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
hasn't changed too much since the actual

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.200 
hasn't changed too much since the actual
game<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> live<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:32.460> old<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
game like the live with old are so I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.910 
game like the live with old are so I
guess<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.479> call<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.780> again<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.770> it's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
guess in call it again but it's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.230 
guess in call it again but it's
definitely<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.369> more<00:01:35.430> relaxing<00:01:36.119> because

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
definitely a lot more relaxing because

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.149 
definitely a lot more relaxing because
before<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.720> don't<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.320> wouldn't<00:01:37.680> waste<00:01:37.890> any<00:01:38.070> time

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
before I don't I wouldn't waste any time

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.520 
before I don't I wouldn't waste any time
before<00:01:38.490> I'm<00:01:39.390> dropping<00:01:39.840> my<00:01:39.869> oars<00:01:40.140> cuz<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.409> would

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
before I'm dropping my oars cuz I would

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.749 
before I'm dropping my oars cuz I would
use<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.680> mouse<00:01:40.920> keys<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
use my mouse keys and I do it as a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.639 
use my mouse keys and I do it as a
mining<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> would<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.840> lose<00:01:42.990> any<00:01:43.170> ticks

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
mining so I would really lose any ticks

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.749 
mining so I would really lose any ticks
I<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:44.100> leave<00:01:44.220> some<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.579> there<00:01:44.700> but

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I would leave some here and there but

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
I would leave some here and there but
with<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> ability<00:01:45.960> basically<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> don't

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
with this ability basically you don't

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.830 
with this ability basically you don't
lose<00:01:46.890> any<00:01:47.100> ticks<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.570> save<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
lose any ticks and so you will save a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.450 
lose any ticks and so you will save a
little<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.110> experience<00:01:49.320> by<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.040> won't

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
little more experience by that but won't

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.160 
little more experience by that but won't
be<00:01:50.579> too<00:01:50.759> much<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:50.970> i'm<00:01:51.479> imagining<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.020> when

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
be too much more i'm imagining this when

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
be too much more i'm imagining this when
you're<00:01:52.259> probably<00:01:52.409> around<00:01:52.619> 100k<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.220> hour<00:01:53.369> so

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you're probably around 100k an hour so

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
you're probably around 100k an hour so
i'm<00:01:54.450> currently<00:01:54.659> still<00:01:55.020> doing<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.530> stubbed

I'm<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.239> from<00:02:33.359> doing<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.569> method<00:02:33.959> it's

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
I'm just from doing this method it's

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.899 
I'm just from doing this method it's
very<00:02:34.290> simple<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.739> not<00:02:34.980> exactly<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.700> call

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
very simple it's not exactly you call

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.569 
very simple it's not exactly you call
AFK<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:37.079> um<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:38.069> know<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.310> know<00:02:38.400> that

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
fact that you know as our gold ores

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.309 
fact that you know as our gold ores
gonna<00:03:06.060> rise<00:03:06.299> now<00:03:06.510> because<00:03:06.780> everyone<00:03:07.169> that

legitimately legitimately mines will

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.360 
legitimately legitimately mines will
start<00:03:10.379> dropping<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.799> words<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.280> know

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
start dropping the words you know

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.649 
start dropping the words you know
because<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.639> takes<00:03:11.760> two<00:03:11.970> seconds<00:03:12.359> right<00:03:12.480> not

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
because it takes two seconds right not

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.970 
because it takes two seconds right not
too<00:03:12.900> many<00:03:13.019> people<00:03:13.230> we've<00:03:13.349> banking<00:03:13.739> them<00:03:13.859> now

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
too many people we've banking them now

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.409 
too many people we've banking them now
because<00:03:14.459> it's<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.639> huge<00:03:14.849> waste<00:03:14.909> of<00:03:15.150> time<00:03:15.359> and

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
because it's a huge waste of time and

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.119 
because it's a huge waste of time and
you<00:03:15.780> know<00:03:15.900> slows<00:03:16.290> down<00:03:16.379> its<00:03:16.560> killing<00:03:16.859> all<00:03:16.979> that

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
you know slows down its killing all that

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.039 
you know slows down its killing all that
crap<00:03:17.340> right<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.030> people<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.419> wanted<00:03:18.629> like<00:03:18.750> won't

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
crap right so people I wanted like won't

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.930 
crap right so people I wanted like won't
gold<00:03:19.500> ores<00:03:19.680> go<00:03:19.919> up<00:03:20.129> then<00:03:20.370> since<00:03:20.609> no<00:03:20.760> one's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
gold ores go up then since no one's

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.610 
gold ores go up then since no one's
going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.150> bother<00:03:21.299> with<00:03:21.780> bank<00:03:22.379> of<00:03:22.500> them

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
going to bother with bank of them

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.259 
going to bother with bank of them
anymore<00:03:22.829> that's<00:03:23.459> kinda<00:03:23.669> what<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.819> thought<00:03:23.849> too

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
anymore that's kinda what I thought too

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.670 
anymore that's kinda what I thought too
but<00:03:24.510> then<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.900> gotta<00:03:25.049> also<00:03:25.349> think<00:03:25.620> that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
but then you gotta also think that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.559 
but then you gotta also think that
there's<00:03:25.949> still<00:03:26.040> our<00:03:26.340> botters<00:03:26.849> in<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.090> game<00:03:27.299> so

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
there's still our botters in the game so

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.670 
there's still our botters in the game so
it's<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:27.989> they're<00:03:28.139> actually<00:03:28.440> going<00:03:28.560> to

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
it's not like they're actually going to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.710 
it's not like they're actually going to
be<00:03:28.769> going<00:03:29.090> anyway<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.180> Prime<00:03:30.389> Minister<00:03:30.690> is

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
be going anyway the Prime Minister is

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.939 
be going anyway the Prime Minister is
actually<00:03:31.079> seeing<00:03:31.199> praised<00:03:31.409> you<00:03:31.590> might<00:03:31.739> go<00:03:31.859> up

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
actually seeing praised you might go up

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.050 
actually seeing praised you might go up
for<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.159> first<00:03:32.340> few<00:03:32.459> days<00:03:32.639> because<00:03:32.760> right<00:03:33.030> now

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
for the first few days because right now

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.849 
for the first few days because right now
there's<00:03:33.750> probably<00:03:34.049> no<00:03:34.169> borders<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:34.739> they

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
there's probably no borders but they

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.259 
there's probably no borders but they
will<00:03:35.010> probably<00:03:35.430> all<00:03:35.609> be<00:03:35.729> back<00:03:35.879> within<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
will probably all be back within the

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.460 
will probably all be back within the
next<00:03:36.419> hour<00:03:36.599> but<00:03:36.959> yeah<00:03:37.109> i'm<00:03:37.199> quite<00:03:37.440> sure

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
next hour but yeah i'm quite sure

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.379 
next hour but yeah i'm quite sure
botters<00:03:38.159> will<00:03:38.310> be<00:03:38.400> banking<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.879> i<00:03:39.060> mean<00:03:39.269> it

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
botters will be banking on i mean it

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.729 
botters will be banking on i mean it
doesn't<00:03:39.599> make<00:03:39.750> sense<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.139> but<00:03:40.379> if<00:03:40.530> you're<00:03:40.650> not

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
doesn't make sense to but if you're not

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:41.930 
doesn't make sense to but if you're not
going<00:03:40.919> to<00:03:40.979> bank<00:03:41.190> them<00:03:41.370> unless<00:03:41.519> you're<00:03:41.729> just

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
going to bank them unless you're just

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.610 
going to bank them unless you're just
trying<00:03:42.449> to<00:03:42.510> get<00:03:42.599> some<00:03:42.720> mining<00:03:43.079> levels<00:03:43.379> i<00:03:43.440> guess

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
trying to get some mining levels i guess

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.569 
trying to get some mining levels i guess
but<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.889> might<00:03:44.040> as<00:03:44.069> even<00:03:44.340> if<00:03:44.430> you're<00:03:44.549> not

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
but you might as even if you're not

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.580 
but you might as even if you're not
legitimately<00:03:45.359> mining<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.260> might<00:03:46.440> as<00:03:46.530> well

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
legitimately mining you might as well

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.869 
legitimately mining you might as well
still<00:03:46.829> bank<00:03:47.040> them<00:03:47.250> if<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:47.579> like<00:03:47.729> you're

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
still bank them if it's like you're

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.699 
still bank them if it's like you're
training<00:03:48.269> your<00:03:48.299> account<00:03:48.659> but<00:03:48.840> anyways<00:03:49.079> yeah<00:03:49.680> i

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
training your account but anyways yeah i

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.379 
training your account but anyways yeah i
just<00:03:49.739> want<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.159> in<00:03:50.340> there<00:03:50.519> so<00:03:50.729> i<00:03:51.000> don't<00:03:51.269> think

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
just want that in there so i don't think

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.280 
just want that in there so i don't think
they'll<00:03:51.510> be<00:03:51.569> going<00:03:51.659> up<00:03:51.840> at<00:03:51.930> all<00:03:52.019> so<00:03:52.169> i'm

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
they'll be going up at all so i'm

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.780 
they'll be going up at all so i'm
probably<00:03:52.470> going<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.859> GE<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.280> buying<00:03:53.489> some

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
probably going to the GE and buying some

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.199 
probably going to the GE and buying some
i<00:03:53.940> mean<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.359> can<00:03:54.540> if<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.780> want<00:03:54.930> feel
