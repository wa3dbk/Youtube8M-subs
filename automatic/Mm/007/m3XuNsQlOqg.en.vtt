have<00:02:05.249> been<00:02:05.399> pre<00:02:05.609> wired<00:02:05.819> but<00:02:06.569> it's<00:02:06.719> really<00:02:06.989> very

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:07.169 
have been pre wired but it's really very

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.350 
have been pre wired but it's really very
cool<00:02:07.289> what<00:02:07.679> also<00:02:07.889> is<00:02:08.369> neat<00:02:08.759> about<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.030> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
cool what also is neat about this is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.720 
cool what also is neat about this is
that<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:10.380> are<00:02:10.410> some<00:02:10.800> additional<00:02:11.039> pockets

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that there are some additional pockets

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.209 
that there are some additional pockets
that<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.030> don't<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.560> others<00:02:13.829> for

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
that we don't have on the others for

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.450 
that we don't have on the others for
example<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.909> right<00:02:15.090> hand<00:02:15.299> side<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
example on the right hand side you

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.820 
example on the right hand side you
see<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.850> we<00:02:17.600> have<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.810> pocket<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.410> has<00:02:18.620> that

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
see that we have a pocket in has that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.540 
see that we have a pocket in has that
the<00:02:19.190> nuclear<00:02:19.370> touch<00:02:19.910> fabric<00:02:20.420> which<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:20.990> nice

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
the nuclear touch fabric which is nice

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.730 
the nuclear touch fabric which is nice
because<00:02:22.550> if<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.940> put<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> device<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.080> there<00:02:24.320> you

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
because if you put a device in there you

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.650 
because if you put a device in there you
can<00:02:24.920> see<00:02:24.950> through<00:02:25.460> it<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:26.030> if<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.300> have<00:02:26.450> your

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
can see through it so if you have your

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.110 
can see through it so if you have your
media<00:02:27.320> player<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.650> like<00:02:27.860> academy<00:02:28.430> zoom<00:02:28.670> with<00:02:28.940> me

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
media player I like academy zoom with me

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.950 
media player I like academy zoom with me
so<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:30.110> will<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:32.150> ability<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.660> see<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
so it will be the ability to see the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.810 
so it will be the ability to see the
screen<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.530> there<00:02:34.010> which<00:02:34.250> which<00:02:34.490> makes<00:02:34.730> it

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
screen is there which which makes it

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.940

something in a pocket and having it bulk

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.740 
something in a pocket and having it bulk
because<00:02:51.560> squad<00:02:52.040> has<00:02:52.280> designed<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.030> pocket<00:02:53.510> so

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
because squad has designed the pocket so

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.320 
because squad has designed the pocket so
that<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.140> weight<00:02:54.680> balance<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.760> tied<00:02:56.090> into

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
that the weight balance it tied into

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.720 
that the weight balance it tied into
about<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.200> collar<00:02:57.470> along<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.190> side<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
about the collar along the side and

about the collar along the side and
along<00:02:59.660> where<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.530> pull<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.070> sleeve<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.210> so

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
along where the pull the sleeve is so

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.720 
along where the pull the sleeve is so
you<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> white<00:03:03.650> balance<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.370> it's<00:03:04.580> just

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
you have a white balance and it's just

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.360 
you have a white balance and it's just
everything<00:03:05.150> hangs<00:03:05.480> correctly<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:07.070> I'm<00:03:07.190> going

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
everything hangs correctly so I'm going
