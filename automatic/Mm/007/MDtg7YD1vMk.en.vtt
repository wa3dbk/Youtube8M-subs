00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
to look for is applications and in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
to look for is applications and in
applications<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.399> should<00:00:41.640> see

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
applications you should see

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.560 
applications you should see
USB<00:00:42.780> settings<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.760> what<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
USB settings and what we have to do is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.100 
USB settings and what we have to do is
put<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> phone<00:00:46.950> into<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> mass<00:00:48.239> storage<00:00:48.600> device

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
put the phone into a mass storage device

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.090 
put the phone into a mass storage device
now<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:51.410> my<00:00:52.410> phone<00:00:52.590> set<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
spawn connection so that when I plug it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
spawn connection so that when I plug it
in<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.559> gives<00:00:55.739> me<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.100> options<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.940> keys

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
pertaining to the particular phone here

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.890 
pertaining to the particular phone here
and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:22.520> there's<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.610> media<00:01:23.939> player<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.659> not

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and then there's a media player I'm not

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.249 
and then there's a media player I'm not
sure<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.560> means<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.930> when<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> play

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
sure if that means that when you play

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.319 
sure if that means that when you play
songs<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:28.979> does<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> play<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.939> your

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
songs on here does it play on your

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210 
songs on here does it play on your
computer<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.500> what<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
computer I think that's what it is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
computer I think that's what it is
and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.090> there's<00:01:33.270> mass<00:01:33.509> storage<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.140> that's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and then there's mass storage and that's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.010 
and then there's mass storage and that's
what<00:01:34.860> we're<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.340> using<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:36.119> order<00:01:36.810> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
what we're going to be using in order to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.530 
what we're going to be using in order to
put<00:01:37.380> music<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> memory<00:01:38.909> cards<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
put music on to the memory cards that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.530 
put music on to the memory cards that
are<00:01:40.070> both<00:01:41.070> built<00:01:41.520> into<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> phone<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
are both built into the phone and the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.719 
are both built into the phone and the
external<00:01:43.290> memory<00:01:43.409> card<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:43.950> I've<00:01:44.460> added

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
external memory card that's I've added

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.469 
external memory card that's I've added
into<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.840> phone<00:01:46.049> itself<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.820> Mass<00:01:47.820> Storage<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
into the phone itself so Mass Storage I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.480 
into the phone itself so Mass Storage I
usually<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> spawn<00:01:49.920> connection<00:01:50.340> so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
usually like to do a spawn connection so

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.240 
usually like to do a spawn connection so
every<00:01:50.700> time<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.880> plug<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.420> it'll<00:01:52.020> ask<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
every time I plug it in it'll ask me but

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.679 
every time I plug it in it'll ask me but
for<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> purpose<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.509> demonstration

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
for the purpose of this demonstration

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.800 
for the purpose of this demonstration
I'm<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.860> mass<00:01:56.430> storage<00:01:56.810> right

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
I'm just going to do mass storage right

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.510 
I'm just going to do mass storage right
and<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.560> you're<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> also<00:01:58.979> want<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and then you're going to also want to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.810 
and then you're going to also want to
make<00:01:59.670> sure<00:01:59.700> that<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.840> development<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:02.490> USB

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
make sure that in development that USB

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.209 
make sure that in development that USB
debugging<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.659> off<00:02:03.930> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.920> USB
