I<00:00:21.029> mean<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.080> unity<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.500> well<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> game

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I mean what unity is well as a game

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.980 
I mean what unity is well as a game
engine<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> whole<00:00:23.850> production<00:00:24.119> tool<00:00:24.720> set

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
engine it's a whole production tool set

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.790 
engine it's a whole production tool set
super<00:00:25.800> polished<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:27.029> sort<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.269> maybe

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
super polished and it's sort of maybe

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.779 
super polished and it's sort of maybe
levels<00:00:28.800> out<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> difference<00:00:29.670> between

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
levels out of it the difference between

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.519 
levels out of it the difference between
like<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.390> know<00:00:30.510> hardcore<00:00:30.869> production<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
like you know hardcore production and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
like you know hardcore production and
casual<00:00:32.009> production<00:00:32.399> because<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.149> sort<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
casual production because the sort of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.900 
casual production because the sort of
enables<00:00:33.719> very<00:00:34.440> very<00:00:34.680> simple<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.760> mean

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
enables very very simple like I mean

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.420 
enables very very simple like I mean
very<00:00:36.450> efficient<00:00:36.960> production<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.559> casual

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
very efficient production of casual

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.569 
very efficient production of casual
games<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.120> know<00:00:39.239> great<00:00:39.450> art<00:00:39.690> assets

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
games with you know great art assets

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.630 
games with you know great art assets
with<00:00:41.579> complex<00:00:42.000> animations<00:00:42.829> but<00:00:43.829> yet<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
with complex animations but yet to the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.250 
with complex animations but yet to the
ability<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.329> be<00:00:45.450> delivered<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
ability to be delivered like to the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.920 
ability to be delivered like to the
browser<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> mobile<00:00:47.180> devices<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.420> think

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
browser to the mobile devices I think

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.510 
browser to the mobile devices I think
instead<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> via<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.440> somehow<00:00:49.649> sometimes<00:00:50.370> deal

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
instead of via we somehow sometimes deal

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.709 
instead of via we somehow sometimes deal
were<00:00:50.670> sort<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> bridging<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> gap<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> know

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
were sort of bridging the gap you know

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.970 
were sort of bridging the gap you know
between<00:00:51.840> hardcoregay<00:00:52.350> production<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
between hardcoregay production and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
between hardcoregay production and
casual<00:00:53.460> games<00:00:53.640> yeah<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.140> things<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
casual games yeah one of the things that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
casual games yeah one of the things that
you've<00:00:55.739> seen<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.100> enormous<00:00:56.730> growth<00:00:56.969> with

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you've seen is enormous growth with

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.560 
you've seen is enormous growth with
people<00:00:57.600> using<00:00:57.870> unity<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.859> iphone<00:00:59.430> do<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
people using unity for iphone do you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.750 
people using unity for iphone do you
think<00:01:00.780> saying<00:01:01.079> people<00:01:01.350> use<00:01:01.530> unity<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.340> casual

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
think saying people use unity for casual

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.299 
think saying people use unity for casual
games<00:01:02.969> you've<00:01:03.180> been<00:01:03.359> seeing<00:01:03.629> people<00:01:03.930> use

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
games you've been seeing people use

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.740 
games you've been seeing people use
unity<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.729> sorts<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.299> games<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.720> there

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
unity for all sorts of games out there

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
unity for all sorts of games out there
can<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.170> talk<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.799> about<00:01:07.950> how

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
can you talk a little bit about how

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.789 
can you talk a little bit about how
people<00:01:08.909> use<00:01:09.150> unity<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.900> Autodesk<00:01:10.350> products

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
people use unity with Autodesk products

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.550 
people use unity with Autodesk products
sure<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.450> actually<00:01:12.750> all<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.380> mean

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
sure so it's actually all of this I mean

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.070 
sure so it's actually all of this I mean
we<00:01:13.680> somehow<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.900> us

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
we somehow you know so that all of us

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
we somehow you know so that all of us
being<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> market<00:01:16.740> leader<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:17.850> want<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
being the market leader we would want to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
being the market leader we would want to
support<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.450> applications<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.439> well

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
support your applications really well

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.880 
support your applications really well
and<00:01:21.049> so<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> first<00:01:22.320> application<00:01:22.470> we

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and so the first application we

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.160 
and so the first application we
supported<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.759> Maya<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.420> well<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
supported was was Maya really well so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.600 
supported was was Maya really well so
basically<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.040> concept<00:01:26.400> that

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
basically we have this concept that

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
basically we have this concept that
instead<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.090> doing<00:01:27.509> imports<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.110> exports<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
instead of doing imports and exports and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.749 
instead of doing imports and exports and
export<00:01:29.220> steps<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.270> save<00:01:30.540> your<00:01:30.840> art<00:01:31.229> file

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
export steps you just save your art file

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.090 
export steps you just save your art file
initially<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:32.790> later<00:01:33.299> max<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.750> well<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> other

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
initially my later max as well and other

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.380 
initially my later max as well and other
applications<00:01:35.250> including<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.240> your

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
applications including some of your

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
applications including some of your
competitors<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.799> throw<00:01:38.189> those<00:01:38.310> files

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
competitors and you throw those files

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.730 
competitors and you throw those files
into<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.060> project<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.780> unity<00:01:40.170> realizes

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
into your project and unity realizes

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.380 
into your project and unity realizes
that<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.189> know<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.460> there's<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> new<00:01:42.180> folder

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that you know there there's a new folder

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.300 
that you know there there's a new folder
or<00:01:42.659> changed<00:01:42.990> file<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.439> Justin<00:01:43.979> course<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
or changed file and Justin course it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
or changed file and Justin course it
automatically<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.509> lot<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.659> magic<00:01:45.990> goes<00:01:46.110> on

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
automatically and a lot of magic goes on

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.630 
automatically and a lot of magic goes on
behind<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> scenes<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.100> we're<00:01:47.250> using<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.520> lot

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
behind the scenes and we're using a lot

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.130 
behind the scenes and we're using a lot
of<00:01:47.670> clams<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> technology<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
of clams and technology for this but the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.660 
of clams and technology for this but the
result<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.340> my

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
result is that you just you know in my

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.999 
result is that you just you know in my
air<00:01:51.000> max<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.689> hit<00:01:51.990> save<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.770> switch<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
air max you just hit save we switch to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.389 
air max you just hit save we switch to
unity<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.740> model<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
unity and and the the model so the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.340 
unity and and the the model so the
animations<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.000> update<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.020> fly<00:01:58.200> even

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
animations just update on the fly even

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.950 
animations just update on the fly even
when<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.649> know<00:01:59.009> playing<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> game<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.899> two

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
when you know playing the game so two

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
when you know playing the game so two
years<00:02:01.259> ago<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> casual<00:02:02.670> connect

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
years ago when I was a casual connect

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.220 
years ago when I was a casual connect
just<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.630> few<00:02:03.930> dove

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
just a few dove

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.190 
just a few dove
so<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:05.070> starting<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:05.940> about<00:02:06.210> 3d<00:02:06.630> but

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
so really starting to think about 3d but

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.310 
so really starting to think about 3d but
today<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:08.340> through<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.850> conference<00:02:09.840> here

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
today going through the conference here

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.830 
today going through the conference here
everybody<00:02:11.190> seems<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:12.030> uni<00:02:12.330> look

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
everybody seems to be going to uni look

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.870 
everybody seems to be going to uni look
everybody<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> lot<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> yeah<00:02:13.860> could<00:02:14.850> you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
everybody but a lot of yeah could you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.880 
everybody but a lot of yeah could you
talk<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> little<00:02:15.300> bit<00:02:15.660> about<00:02:15.870> how<00:02:16.620> you're

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
talk a little bit about how you're

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.450 
talk a little bit about how you're
seeing<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.640> unity<00:02:18.060> sure<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.960> mean<00:02:19.190> 3d<00:02:20.190> can

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
seeing that at unity sure I mean 3d can

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.700 
seeing that at unity sure I mean 3d can
be<00:02:20.610> kind<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.820> complicated<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:22.350> without<00:02:22.650> a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
be kind of complicated and without a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.140 
be kind of complicated and without a
good<00:02:22.890> production<00:02:23.430> environment<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.000> tool

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
good production environment and tool

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.790 
good production environment and tool
said<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.690> be<00:02:24.840> very<00:02:24.870> complicated<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
said it can be very complicated and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.370 
said it can be very complicated and
expensive<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:27.030> actually<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:27.450> find<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.930> I

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
expensive but actually we find that I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.320 
expensive but actually we find that I
mean<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.070> device<00:02:29.310> are<00:02:29.490> catching<00:02:29.820> up<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.120> mean

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
mean the device are catching up I mean

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.910 
mean the device are catching up I mean
the<00:02:30.450> iphone<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.110> mean<00:02:31.350> though<00:02:31.470> every<00:02:31.890> single

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the iphone I mean though every single

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.890 
the iphone I mean though every single
like<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.490> really<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.910> low-end<00:02:33.330> computer<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
like a really a low-end computer and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.960 
like a really a low-end computer and
connected<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> web<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:35.520> still<00:02:35.670> able<00:02:35.820> to

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
connected to the web it's still able to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.640 
connected to the web it's still able to
you<00:02:36.150> know<00:02:36.270> show<00:02:36.510> some<00:02:36.540> pretty<00:02:36.900> decent<00:02:37.200> 3d

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you know show some pretty decent 3d

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.460 
you know show some pretty decent 3d
graphics<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.690> hardware<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.020> catching<00:02:40.380> up

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
graphics so the hardware is catching up

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.680 
graphics so the hardware is catching up
then<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> tool<00:02:41.580> like<00:02:41.730> unity<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.480> sort<00:02:42.660> of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
then a tool like unity really sort of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.840 
then a tool like unity really sort of
facilitates<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.320> know<00:02:43.470> taking<00:02:43.740> in<00:02:43.980> assets

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
facilitates you know taking in assets

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.730 
facilitates you know taking in assets
from<00:02:44.970> their<00:02:45.180> different<00:02:45.450> applications<00:02:45.990> giving

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
from their different applications giving

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.160 
from their different applications giving
it<00:02:46.830> live<00:02:47.010> without<00:02:47.880> having<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.300> know<00:02:48.420> hardcore

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
it live without having you know hardcore

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.500 
it live without having you know hardcore
engineers<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.740> team<00:02:49.980> right<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.820> scripter<00:02:51.270> or

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
engineers on team right so scripter or

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.970 
engineers on team right so scripter or
somebody<00:02:51.750> from<00:02:51.900> away<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.140> flash<00:02:52.380> backgrounds

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
somebody from away the flash backgrounds

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890 
somebody from away the flash backgrounds
can<00:02:53.070> actually<00:02:53.340> pick<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.610> up<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.880> pretty<00:02:54.630> big

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
can actually pick it up and pretty big

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.350 
can actually pick it up and pretty big
effect<00:02:55.230> efficiently<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.790> create<00:02:57.240> this

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
effect efficiently you know create this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
effect efficiently you know create this
content<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.870> would<00:02:57.960> make<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.290> make

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
content that would make you can make

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.620 
content that would make you can make
those<00:02:58.470> games<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.310> then<00:02:59.460> you<00:02:59.820> know<00:02:59.910> actually<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
those games and then you know actually a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.750 
those games and then you know actually a
lot<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.020> lot<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.400> know<00:03:02.490> flash

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
lot of the lot of the you know flash

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.760 
lot of the lot of the you know flash
games<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.720> are<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:03.870> there<00:03:03.900> right<00:03:04.140> now<00:03:04.200> are

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
games that are out there right now are

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.410 
games that are out there right now are
really<00:03:05.250> produced<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.760> 3d<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.210> then<00:03:06.330> you

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
really produced in 3d and then you

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.700 
really produced in 3d and then you
should<00:03:06.570> have<00:03:06.600> baked<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.020> down<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.380> know<00:03:07.470> into

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
should have baked it down you know into

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.770 
should have baked it down you know into
textures<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:09.030> lot<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.180> infrastructure<00:03:09.390> has

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
textures and a lot of infrastructure has

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.030 
textures and a lot of infrastructure has
to<00:03:09.900> be<00:03:09.990> built<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.380> now<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.560> devices<00:03:10.980> are

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
to be built but now the devices are

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.260 
to be built but now the devices are
catching<00:03:11.370> up<00:03:11.490> so<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:11.820> getting<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.090> fish

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
catching up so it's getting a fish

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.350 
catching up so it's getting a fish
efficient<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.020> run<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.320> games<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.709> 3d

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
efficient just to run the games in 3d

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.310 
efficient just to run the games in 3d
and<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.570> ends<00:03:15.810> up<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.080> know<00:03:16.170> actually

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
and that ends up you know actually

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.340 
and that ends up you know actually
saving<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.920> money<00:03:17.010> is<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.310> pasta<00:03:17.610> mixture

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
saving you money is the pasta mixture
