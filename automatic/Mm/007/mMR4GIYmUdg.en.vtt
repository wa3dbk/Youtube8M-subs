explosion

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.820 

it's<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> pretty<00:03:17.989> simple<00:03:18.409> game<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:18.730> it's<00:03:19.730> uh

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
it's a pretty simple game but it's uh

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.770 
it's a pretty simple game but it's uh
once<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.950> start<00:03:22.250> playing<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.180> can't

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
once you start playing it you can't

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:34.040 
once you start playing it you can't
hardly<00:03:23.959> put<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.349> down

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.670 

and<00:03:34.980> on<00:03:35.910> all<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.300> these<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.690> have<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:37.110> blow<00:03:37.530> up

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
and on all of these you have to blow up

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.610 
and on all of these you have to blow up
a<00:03:37.860> certain<00:03:38.250> percentage<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:40.350> glass

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
a certain percentage of the glass

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.280 
a certain percentage of the glass
structure<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.370> move<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.750> next<00:03:42.990> level

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
structure to move on to the next level

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:54.140 
structure to move on to the next level
it's<00:03:43.980> usually<00:03:44.190> around<00:03:44.640> 90%

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.869 

now<00:03:54.840> right<00:03:55.500> here<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.830> looks<00:03:55.890> kind<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.400> easy<00:03:56.580> but

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
now right here it looks kind of easy but

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.270 
now right here it looks kind of easy but
it's<00:03:57.290> once<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.440> get<00:03:58.620> up<00:03:58.739> into<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.129> higher

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
it's once you get up into the higher

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.729 
it's once you get up into the higher
levels<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.819> gets<00:04:00.000> harder<00:04:00.390> all<00:04:01.379> right<00:04:01.500> here's<00:04:01.680> a

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
levels it gets harder all right here's a

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.229 
levels it gets harder all right here's a
different<00:04:02.010> type<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.400> bomb<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.909> I<00:04:02.940> think<00:04:03.150> it

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
different type of bomb and I think it

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.899 
different type of bomb and I think it
was<00:04:03.330> called<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.690> ghost<00:04:04.080> bomb<00:04:04.379> and<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.790> can

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
was called a ghost bomb and as you can

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.869 
was called a ghost bomb and as you can
see<00:04:06.150> right<00:04:06.390> here<00:04:06.450> on<00:04:07.220> trying<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.280> control<00:04:08.670> it

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
see right here on trying to control it

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.070 
see right here on trying to control it
which<00:04:09.090> is<00:04:09.269> that<00:04:09.299> that's<00:04:09.750> what<00:04:09.930> you're

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
which is that that's what you're

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.559 
which is that that's what you're
supposed<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.470> do<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.760> swipe<00:04:12.329> in<00:04:12.540> the

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
supposed to do is you swipe in the

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:36.300 
supposed to do is you swipe in the
direction<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.319> want<00:04:13.349> it<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.769> go

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.310
