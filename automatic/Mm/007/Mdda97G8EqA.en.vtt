I mainline used loses power if any of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.149 
I mainline used loses power if any of
these<00:01:37.020> should<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> diff<00:01:37.770> eyes<00:01:37.890> running<00:01:38.100> on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
these should go a diff eyes running on

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.640 
these should go a diff eyes running on
batteries<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.729> would<00:01:39.390> lose<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.689> my<00:01:39.810> tongue<00:01:40.079> so

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
batteries I would lose all my tongue so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.410 
batteries I would lose all my tongue so
I<00:01:40.680> don't<00:01:40.799> want<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.970> these<00:01:42.119> are

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
I don't want to do that now these are

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.700 
I don't want to do that now these are
running<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.689> batteries<00:01:43.110> mostly<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.530> i'll

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
running on batteries mostly because i'll

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.170 
running on batteries mostly because i'll
have<00:01:43.829> enough<00:01:44.009> adapters<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.490> run<00:01:44.729> them<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:44.970> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
have enough adapters to run them all and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
have enough adapters to run them all and
if<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.079> these<00:01:46.170> should<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.560> down<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.189> just

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
if one of these should go down I just

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.730 
if one of these should go down I just
lose<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:47.939> effects<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.750> still<00:01:48.960> play<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.619> do

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
lose my effects I can still play just do

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.770 
lose my effects I can still play just do
it<00:01:49.770> without<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> effects<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.600> lose

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it without the effects but if I lose

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.230 
it without the effects but if I lose
these<00:01:52.130> then<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.820> anything<00:01:54.030> going

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
these then I don't get anything going

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.490
