Point<00:00:11.969> North<00:00:12.330> Carolina<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:13.290> want<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> talk<00:00:14.130> a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
Point North Carolina I want to talk a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.070 
Point North Carolina I want to talk a
little<00:00:14.400> bit<00:00:14.670> today<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:14.969> golfer's<00:00:15.929> elbow

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
little bit today about golfer's elbow

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.820 
little bit today about golfer's elbow
and<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.400> imbalance<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.750> often<00:00:19.200> see<00:00:19.230> in

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
and the imbalance that we often see in

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.670 
and the imbalance that we often see in
the<00:00:20.100> forearm<00:00:20.520> muscle<00:00:21.000> group<00:00:21.240> many<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.289> us<00:00:22.500> are

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the forearm muscle group many of us are

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.609 
the forearm muscle group many of us are
walking<00:00:23.010> around<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.820> stronger<00:00:24.619> forearm

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
walking around with stronger forearm

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.730 
walking around with stronger forearm
flexor<00:00:26.160> muscles<00:00:26.580> than<00:00:27.210> our<00:00:27.660> extensor<00:00:28.289> muscles

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
flexor muscles than our extensor muscles

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.679 
flexor muscles than our extensor muscles
and<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.429> reason<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.359> we're

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
and the reason for this is that we're

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.810 
and the reason for this is that we're
constantly<00:00:31.080> throughout<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> day<00:00:31.920> grabbing

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
constantly throughout the day grabbing

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.539 
constantly throughout the day grabbing
things<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.510> using<00:00:33.720> those<00:00:33.989> flexor<00:00:34.500> muscles<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:35.549 
things and using those flexor muscles we

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:36.799 
things and using those flexor muscles we
don't<00:00:35.699> really<00:00:35.909> do<00:00:36.059> too<00:00:36.089> much<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.720> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
don't really do too much for the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.530 
don't really do too much for the
extensors<00:00:37.440> against<00:00:38.129> resistance<00:00:38.729> so<00:00:39.510> that

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
extensors against resistance so that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180 
extensors against resistance so that
imbalance<00:00:40.080> develops

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
imbalance develops

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.450 
imbalance develops
now<00:00:41.729> that<00:00:41.970> imbalance<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.470> an<00:00:43.739> effect<00:00:44.129> on

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
now that imbalance can have an effect on

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.689 
now that imbalance can have an effect on
your<00:00:44.909> wrists<00:00:45.479> and<00:00:45.629> your<00:00:46.110> elbow<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:47.489> you're

your wrists and your elbow and if you're

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.670 
your wrists and your elbow and if you're
dealing<00:00:48.330> with<00:00:48.360> tendonitis<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.290> elbow

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
dealing with tendonitis or elbow

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.789 
dealing with tendonitis or elbow
problems<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.729> could<00:00:50.970> be<00:00:51.119> a<00:00:51.150> cause<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.869> good

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
problems this could be a cause a good

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.130 
problems this could be a cause a good
exercise<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.909> to<00:00:54.659> get<00:00:54.900> balance

rotate<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> palms<00:01:26.700> over<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> back

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
rotate the palms over so that the back

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.140 
rotate the palms over so that the back

of the arm is resting on the thigh and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.670 
of the arm is resting on the thigh and
do<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> same<00:01:31.230> thing<00:01:31.650> 15<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.760> 20<00:01:33.060> times<00:01:33.680> then

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
do the same thing 15 to 20 times then

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280 
do the same thing 15 to 20 times then
you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.040> also<00:01:35.310> incorporate<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.450> rotational

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you can also incorporate a rotational

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.700 
you can also incorporate a rotational
forearm<00:01:38.280> exercise<00:01:38.909> where<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.290> from<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
forearm exercise where you going from a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.290 
forearm exercise where you going from a
palms<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.480> palms<00:01:42.870> down<00:01:43.290> position<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.760> 15

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
palms up to a palms down position do 15

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.380 
palms up to a palms down position do 15
to<00:01:45.480> 20<00:01:45.780> reps<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:47.070> should<00:01:47.370> help<00:01:47.580> improve

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to 20 reps and that should help improve

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.180 
to 20 reps and that should help improve
the<00:01:48.570> strength<00:01:48.900> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> forearm<00:01:49.740> muscle

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
the strength of the forearm muscle

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.190 
the strength of the forearm muscle
groups<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> give<00:01:51.060> balance<00:01:51.510> back<00:01:51.750> into<00:01:52.080> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
groups and to give balance back into the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.740 
groups and to give balance back into the
forearm<00:01:52.590> muscle<00:01:53.010> groups<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:54.360> can

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
forearm muscle groups so that you can

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.500 
forearm muscle groups so that you can
combat<00:01:55.290> things<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.979> golfer's<00:01:56.550> elbow<00:01:56.700> plus

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
combat things like golfer's elbow plus

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.690 
combat things like golfer's elbow plus
just<00:01:57.990> get<00:01:58.140> more<00:01:58.380> strength<00:01:58.830> for<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.490> golf

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
just get more strength for the golf

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.120 
just get more strength for the golf
swing<00:01:59.940> in<00:02:00.330> general<00:02:00.780> better<00:02:01.470> your<00:02:01.680> body<00:02:01.830> into
