basic and similar that even after a
first<00:01:59.549> listen<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.329> get<00:02:00.509> kind<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.840> bored

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
I mean it's generally a good thing when

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.690 
I mean it's generally a good thing when
an<00:02:06.180> album<00:02:06.509> flows<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.409> cohesive<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.580> as

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
an album flows and is cohesive but as

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.160 
an album flows and is cohesive but as

not much to be said either the whole
album<00:02:23.269> is<00:02:23.629> pretty<00:02:23.900> much<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.379> clubbing

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
album is pretty much just clubbing

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.289

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
and they don't really bring any

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.970 
and they don't really bring any
compelling<00:02:31.970> concepts<00:02:32.690> or<00:02:33.019> put<00:02:33.319> any<00:02:33.530> different

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
spins on any of this content and I found

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.289 
spins on any of this content and I found
that<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.980> guest<00:02:37.220> appearances<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.060> album

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
that the guest appearances on this album

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.990 
that the guest appearances on this album
suffered<00:02:39.110> because<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.739> all<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.580> guests

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
suffered because of that all the guests

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.910 
suffered because of that all the guests
were<00:02:41.060> pretty<00:02:41.510> much<00:02:41.629> limited<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.200> spinning

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
were pretty much limited to spinning

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.949 
were pretty much limited to spinning
about<00:02:43.129> this<00:02:43.340> same<00:02:43.640> old<00:02:43.670> typical<00:02:44.420> content

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
about this same old typical content

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.569 
about this same old typical content
because<00:02:45.410> that's<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.829> overall<00:02:46.250> theme<00:02:46.519> of

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
because that's just the overall theme of

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.460 
because that's just the overall theme of
this<00:02:46.849> album<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.510> don't<00:02:47.750> really<00:02:47.959> blame<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
this album so I don't really blame the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
that song so I think that track was the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.309 
that song so I think that track was the
best<00:03:09.530> spot<00:03:09.799> on<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.069> entire<00:03:10.370> album<00:03:10.700> also<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:12.140> B

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319
