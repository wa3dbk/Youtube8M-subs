00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
like apple headphones because I think

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.350 
like apple headphones because I think
there<00:03:06.799> are<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.280> know<00:03:07.310> kind<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.730> bad<00:03:07.880> quality

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
them out these are I don't think Apple

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.190

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
disappointed because I thought that it

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.810 
disappointed because I thought that it
would<00:04:00.320> come<00:04:00.380> with<00:04:00.740> the<00:04:00.920> screen<00:04:01.310> protectors

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
would come with the screen protectors

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.270 
would come with the screen protectors
too<00:04:01.970> because<00:04:02.270> I<00:04:02.480> saw<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.960> few<00:04:03.200> cologne<00:04:03.860> videos

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
too because I saw a few cologne videos

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.130 
too because I saw a few cologne videos
and<00:04:04.490> they<00:04:04.550> actually<00:04:04.820> came<00:04:04.970> with<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.390> screen

and they actually came with the screen

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.710 
and they actually came with the screen
protectors<00:04:06.650> but<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:06.920> guess<00:04:07.480> Apple<00:04:08.480> didn't

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
protectors but I guess Apple didn't

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.270 
protectors but I guess Apple didn't
really<00:04:08.900> do<00:04:09.050> that<00:04:09.080> for<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.500> real<00:04:09.620> product<00:04:10.070> so
