yet I'm just going to be going over some

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.109 
yet I'm just going to be going over some
ground<00:00:28.500> rules<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.099> basic<00:00:29.550> things<00:00:29.760> about<00:00:29.939> what

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
we'll be doing so if this level looks
familiar<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.320> should<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:34.920> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
much of a main point aside from to build

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
much of a main point aside from to build
up<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.760> split<00:01:03.120> apart<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.019> continue<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
up to split apart and to continue that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.340 
up to split apart and to continue that
process<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.040> building<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.990> start<00:01:07.170> off

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
process of building so to start off

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.480 
process of building so to start off
we're<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> same

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
we're all going to be in the same

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
faction yes we're gonna have factions

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.800 
faction yes we're gonna have factions
because<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.460> thought<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.180> would<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.450> nifty

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
because I thought that would be a nifty

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.980 
because I thought that would be a nifty
little<00:01:12.840> idea<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.180> said<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.659> will<00:01:15.810> all

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
little idea but like I said we will all

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.050 
little idea but like I said we will all
be<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.680> same<00:01:16.830> faction<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.520> sorts<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.939> will

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
be in the same faction of sorts we will

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.539 
be in the same faction of sorts we will
build<00:01:18.240> together<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.130> not<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.369> concur

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
build together we will not really concur

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
build together we will not really concur
together<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.299> will<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.509> together<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:22.380> we

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
together but we will be together then we

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.469 
together but we will be together then we
will<00:01:22.890> split<00:01:23.040> apart<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.700> being<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> three

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
will split apart we being the three

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.710 
will split apart we being the three
admins<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.409> normal<00:01:25.920> server<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.630> after<00:01:27.630> we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
admins of the normal server and after we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.050 
admins of the normal server and after we
do<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.979> we<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.220> go<00:01:29.640> through<00:01:29.670> many

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
do that we will go through many

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
do that we will go through many
tribulations<00:01:30.479> against<00:01:31.409> each<00:01:31.530> other<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.860> with

tribulations against each other or with
each<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.460> either<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.240> make<00:01:33.390> the

like multiple chat rooms where we can

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.790

the<00:03:38.530> main<00:03:38.709> rules<00:03:38.980> are<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.760> can't<00:03:39.970> be<00:03:40.180> a

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
the main rules are you can't be a

the main rules are you can't be a
complete<00:03:40.690> dick<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.560> need<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:42.040> our<00:03:42.790> and

complete dick and you need to our and
there<00:03:43.239> will<00:03:43.330> be<00:03:43.420> absolutely<00:03:43.540> no<00:03:43.870> spawning<00:03:44.290> in

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
there will be absolutely no spawning in

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.670 
there will be absolutely no spawning in
the<00:03:45.310> case<00:03:45.520> of<00:03:45.760> well<00:03:46.300> we<00:03:46.720> will<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:47.020> be<00:03:47.050> using<00:03:47.500> a

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
the case of well we will all be using a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.270 
the case of well we will all be using a
standard<00:03:48.190> clients<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:50.350> case<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.800> this

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
standard clients and in the case of this

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.770 
standard clients and in the case of this
not<00:03:51.520> being<00:03:51.730> vanilla<00:03:52.120> that's<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.600> entire

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
not being vanilla that's the entire

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.180 
not being vanilla that's the entire
reason<00:03:52.840> why<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.320> series<00:03:53.739> isn't<00:03:53.920> called

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
reason why this series isn't called

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.830 
reason why this series isn't called
vanilla<00:03:54.520> adventure<00:03:55.090> mode<00:03:55.239> because<00:03:55.480> that's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
vanilla adventure mode because that's

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.120 
vanilla adventure mode because that's
what<00:03:55.959> i<00:03:55.989> was<00:03:56.110> going<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.380> originally<00:03:56.830> call<00:03:56.980> it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
what i was going to originally call it

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.940 
what i was going to originally call it
was<00:03:57.430> because<00:03:57.850> there<00:03:58.300> are<00:03:58.600> quite<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.200> few<00:03:59.320> really

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
was because there are quite a few really

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.440 
was because there are quite a few really
good<00:04:00.100> multiplayer<00:04:00.580> mods<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.090> are<00:04:01.239> coming

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
good multiplayer mods that are coming

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.780

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
around now that a mod called spout is

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.979 
around now that a mod called spout is
