00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.979
 now my dear friends 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.900
 welcome to the lady tricks today 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.360
 I brought a trick to help 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.030
 eliminate those unsightly bags that 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.520
 we have under the eyes many times 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.189
 for sleeping badly because we are sick 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.320
 because we stay up late or just 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.330
 we work orally with you too 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.119
 let's take advantage of today's resource 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.650
 to be delaying the aging of 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.890
 the skin which of those magical elements 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.590
 then nothing more and nothing less than the potato 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.330
 in my country I called everything I wanted 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.400
 tell them about the properties that you have 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.800
 this humble tuber using it with use 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.570
 topic or the benefits that 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.390
 we can get using it 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.820
 directly on our skin the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.590
 will kill among other things is known by 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.800
 its anti-inflammatory powers 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.180
 that's why we're going to use it for the stock market 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.270
 the eyes 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.430
 is used as a scar for the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.950
 acne and pimples and burns 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.460
 solar either on the face elsewhere 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.230
 of the body 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.080
 the potato also has effects 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.750
 So emollients soften 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.760
 the inflamed areas reaffirm and 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.680
 soften the skin that's why we 're going 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.920
 to use also as a mask 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.810
 facial 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 some of its ingredients like 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.490
 vitamin C and calcium allow to generate 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.310
 collagen and elastin more easily and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.500
 so a better cell relationship also 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.080
 has antibacterial properties what 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.520
 It can be a gentle exfoliant for 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.770
 the skin 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.189
 good apart from the small potato 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.880
 We are also going to use a grater and I use 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.119
 this 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.289
 on the one hand fine if you do not have at home 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.289
 you can find it in any 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.970
 hardware store or in a Chinese itself 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.920
 let's do it today until I had said 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.670
 we use the radiator for the thin part and 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.310
 let's completely scratch the word 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.470
 and little by little you are floating the starch is 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.189
 the drum that is so good to regenerate 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.189
 the cells 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.530
 in the end 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.640
 barradas 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.299
 and we are going to make two small balls 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.760
 these are the ones that we are going to put in the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.780
 eyes 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.780
 the rest 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.750
 let's apply it on the face 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.739
 this rod it is advisable that the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.900
 apply slightly raised to the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.150
 head back because of the texture 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.569
 of the potato because it can be is that 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.470
 we like it later when we apply 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:08.220
 in the face then we put the balls of 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.819
 the banana in the eyes and we lay down 15 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.720
 20 minutes to rest too 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.670
 we can use a towel and put it to 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.010
 that we like this once spent the 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.220
 recommended time then we remove the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.260
 mask with fresh water we can never 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.030
 cold nor with hot water because the water 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.180
 extremely cold or extremely 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.819
 hot can damage the capillaries 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.560
 trick per week then once or twice already 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.540
 you will see that you will be very happy 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.040
 from the first application you go to 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.400
 feel like the skin contracts 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.230
 the face stays firmer the same with 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.510
 this trick of the potatoes will keep 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.480
 a clear and hydrated skin and 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.939
 desinflamada especially avoiding to go 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.319
 speaking the signs of aging 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.319
 thank you very much and see you soon
