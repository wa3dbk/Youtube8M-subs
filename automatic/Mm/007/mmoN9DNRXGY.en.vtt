that one book that's been sitting on my

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.860 
that one book that's been sitting on my
shelf<00:04:59.800> for<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.430> couple<00:05:00.700> of<00:05:00.760> years<00:05:01.090> but<00:05:01.570> every

shelf for a couple of years but every

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.690 
shelf for a couple of years but every
time<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.140> glanced<00:05:02.470> over<00:05:02.650> I'm<00:05:02.980> like<00:05:03.100> why<00:05:03.340> haven't

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
time I glanced over I'm like why haven't

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.250 
time I glanced over I'm like why haven't
I<00:05:03.760> read<00:05:03.940> this<00:05:04.090> yet<00:05:04.300> it's<00:05:04.510> just<00:05:04.570> like<00:05:04.870> it's<00:05:05.080> just

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
I read this yet it's just like it's just

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.290 
I read this yet it's just like it's just
been<00:05:05.410> calling<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.130> me<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.490> I<00:05:06.850> don't<00:05:06.910> know<00:05:07.150> why

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
been calling to me and I don't know why

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.730 
been calling to me and I don't know why
I<00:05:07.330> haven't<00:05:07.690> picked<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:07.930> up<00:05:08.020> yet<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:08.410> I'm<00:05:08.560> really

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
I haven't picked it up yet so I'm really

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.470 
I haven't picked it up yet so I'm really
really<00:05:08.920> excited<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.460> get<00:05:09.550> into<00:05:09.760> it<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:10.150> haven't

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
really excited to get into it I haven't

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.610 
really excited to get into it I haven't
heard<00:05:10.600> too<00:05:10.630> much<00:05:10.990> about<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:11.380> but<00:05:11.470> I<00:05:11.530> think

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
heard too much about it but I think

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.710 
heard too much about it but I think
there's<00:05:12.280> been<00:05:12.460> kind<00:05:12.730> of<00:05:12.850> mixed<00:05:13.270> feelings

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
there's been kind of mixed feelings

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.840 
there's been kind of mixed feelings
about<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:14.200> I'm<00:05:14.410> not<00:05:14.590> entirely<00:05:14.860> sure<00:05:14.980> but<00:05:15.100> just

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
about it I'm not entirely sure but just

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.940 
about it I'm not entirely sure but just
I'm<00:05:16.240> really<00:05:16.660> excited<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.230> main<00:05:17.410> character<00:05:17.800> is

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
I'm really excited the main character is

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.010 
I'm really excited the main character is
a<00:05:17.980> vampire<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.820> then<00:05:19.000> she<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.300> stabbed<00:05:19.630> by<00:05:19.810> a

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
a vampire and then she is stabbed by a

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.690 
a vampire and then she is stabbed by a
unicorn<00:05:20.740> horn<00:05:20.920> and<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.220> think<00:05:21.400> that<00:05:21.490> kind<00:05:21.670> of

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
unicorn horn and I think that kind of

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.000 
unicorn horn and I think that kind of
reverses<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:22.960> effects<00:05:23.290> like<00:05:23.530> she's<00:05:23.740> slowly

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
reverses the effects like she's slowly

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.280 
reverses the effects like she's slowly
turning<00:05:24.490> human<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.120> developing<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.840> conscious

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
turning human and developing a conscious

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.170 
turning human and developing a conscious
and<00:05:26.620> stuff<00:05:27.160> like<00:05:27.310> that<00:05:27.460> so<00:05:27.700> it's<00:05:27.940> gonna<00:05:28.060> be

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
and stuff like that so it's gonna be

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.180 
and stuff like that so it's gonna be
really<00:05:28.390> interesting<00:05:28.570> I'm<00:05:29.350> really<00:05:29.950> looking

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
really interesting I'm really looking

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.950 
really interesting I'm really looking
