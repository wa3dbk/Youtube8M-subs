00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.320
 fish to find apprentices us 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.879
 of course we call on all 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680
 hotel schools in the region 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.660
 Parisian 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.699
 we are very very very demanding 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.829
 so integrates young people spend 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.050
 interviews they have an interview with me 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.210
 then an interview with the drh and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.670
 then we do a little synthesis 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.769
 and the best are taken what we 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.200
 are the best motivated 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.430
 especially what actually chooses one 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.630
 is not going to lie about it is in relation to your 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.060
 notes and your involvement in the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.390
 training that is more than you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 involve the more you work meyer is going 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.430
 to be the house in which you go 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.689
 to be placed that's how it is 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.950
 works and teisseire it works no 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.130
 we expected them to learn 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.560
 it's a very beneficial moat because 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.030
 the employee is on the ground so when 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.100
 he's at school on school benches 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.540
 when we talk to him about something he 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.310
 yes and it also allows him to have a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560
 experience because he is learning at school 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 put the cutlery in a certain way 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.380
 set up a swimming table but in 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.659
 the company there may be 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.220
 some variations today we 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.700
 is on an alternation of three months 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.649
 three months 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.380
 it allows us to carry out our missions to 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.479
 well on the other hand what to do 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.520
 very careful is not losing the thread 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.689
 that is, it's always keeping in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.280
 contact know what happens when I 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.720
 am for three months at school there 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.759
 is not a week that pass I pass 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.350
 by the hotel and it's exactly the same 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.030
 when one is in business ie 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.920
 we will have work done for 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.210
 school we know that when we have 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.049
 apprentices we know they have a period 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.880
 at school such period 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.230
 in the restaurant so it's up to us 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 two 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.440
 to see it reflected in our dishes 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.590
 nor of course yes you to arrange the bar 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.090
 we are a profession that needs them 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.769
 two young people who needs staff 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.239
 so I think if we want to 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.730
 to work we will find we make 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.709
 Contacts have been sent a book 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.260
 the foundations of our future network so we 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.209
 will have the ferrandi network later on 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.440
 spoke about our school but beyond 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.640
 of the ferrandi network i 'm going to have my 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.260
 professional network that I will have the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.340
 climb through the periods of different 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.360
 people I would have been led to 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.599
 meet during training 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.430
 and that's very important in my age 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.819
 I must give I must give give 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.799
 good 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.799
 it's up to us to follow up
