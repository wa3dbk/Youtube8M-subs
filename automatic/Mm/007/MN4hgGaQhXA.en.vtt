00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.290
 great effect 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 it was the same as the gray-gray kitchen 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.830
 chefs are me as simple ingredients 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.180
 great set 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.610

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.920
 kg of mussels and 500 grams of pass 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.280
 tomato 20 a clove of the two cloves of garlic 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.100

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.340
 toast salt pepper oil and a 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.710
 glass of good white wine has today 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.230
 a recipe directly from Tuscany 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.440
 some mussels alla livornese any 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.790
 which I did not want April, yes 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.290
 they open by themselves then we cook them 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.610
 very simple search tomato 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.560
 let's say that the most difficult operation 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.140
 she did it he did it today he has 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.399
 worked to clean the mussels you need 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.660
 treat it well around clean but that 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:01.989
 show what the things go a 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:10.569
 simple operation made just the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:13.149
 let's open up, let's add sir 

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.829
 his days tells me how little I 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.420
 because I opened the bottle not named 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.959
 also tasted here we have already turned on 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.119
 if we are here I say a bit like a journey 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:26.770
 lice well we cover 9 let's own a 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.479
 take it completely as you normally do 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.159
 does when you cook things because 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.020
 we end the culture within the 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.649
 tomato sauce that we're going to cook 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.599
 so let's start with that era right away 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.599
 indeed it is perfect 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:50.170
 we do old oil while we do it 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.549
 which consular we prepare immediately 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:02:03.409
 peroncino we also leave the seeds like that 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:07.729
 from the star becomes this these these 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:15.860
 limits do not exaggerate for then director 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:18.200
 burn here I have a little 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.570
 I would say that here we are almost have a 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:30.860
 moment we do work well in wine but 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:33.340
 already ready I would say that we can put the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.340
 past 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.720
 let's fix up just because clearly 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.459
 things are already tasty and tasty 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.909
 so don't overdo them 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.360
 here we let cook about ten 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:03:04.030
 minutes 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:07.720
 this point we want mussels, yes, that one 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.489
 we put nothing unfortunately almost perfect 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.569
 meanwhile that these ten minutes of 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:23.739
 culture of good health we begin ad 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:27.849
 use parsley we say that perfect 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.430
 capogrosso we want here better than us 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.560
 at this point we are the last five 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.489
 minutes 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.129
 we finish by adding the mussels 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:46.290
 tomato 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:50.700
 let's see who listens add a little 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.010
 he is doing but not what he needed to do 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.230
 a dinner is 4 people 4 slices one 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:02.069
 head but she eats it we add it 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.069
 you could have the parsley as well 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:13.049
 here we can love the flame a little 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:18.650
 we see a 5 cooking points holding ho 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.650
 mixed all in suu kyi points 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:29.430
 look here respected to give colors 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:31.440
 red green parsley show come 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.810
 what we do we study this prices 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.800
 many disturbs me a little 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:41.539
 we never prepare the dish 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:48.590
 as usual eats drink ok perfect 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:53.099
 then I like it so much in two 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:57.300
 perfect the dish takes off 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:59.370
 when the very poverty comes off the 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.710
 ticket guide an omelette ever 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.710
 not even good 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.260
 here is enough we put them from the tripi her 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.949
 there is a very simple and this is it 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.990
 let's put it in part so what it says can 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.900
 okay okay 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.900
 at this point 8 we hope
