00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hi everyone welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.390
 the licks web video 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.719
 today I want to show you a little one 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.790
 program a little game that I made to 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.590
 times of the first year of university 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.670
 immediately after examining 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.670
 programming 1 the game I called it mine 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.920
 that is to say it was very much the idea of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.410
 very simple young indeed it was 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.020
 simulated there was a lot like the idea was 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.950
 very similar to that of 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.840
 famous pac man in practice yes 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.730
 the user had to check for a 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.550
 character inside the maze e 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.510
 eat all the dots all the dots 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.250
 present trying to avoid i 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.280
 ghosts if we want to call them i 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.220
 enemies that in fact were moving 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.220
 inside the maze 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.440
 ok the program is very simple indeed 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.970
 he plans it when he did 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.460
 This program I did not have many I was alone 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.100
 the programming basics 1 did not have 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.390
 many other knowledge has however the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.190
 maze made it through matrix with 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.990
 these characters within each one 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.290
 of these characters represents a piece 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.060
 of labyrinth and when it comes 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.520
 followed the program all this a 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.580
 this part is transformed precisely 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.550
 in 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.910
 the maze game ok, however 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.430
 the game play is simple though and 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.830
 maybe very very long and to explain 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.000
 in everything in the video so I leave you the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.560
 link to download the executable the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.050
 source code within the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.710
 description of the video in such a way that 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.330
 who wants it takes 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.119
 create such a thing or who 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.140
 want to study this program can 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.409
 download it and visionary quietly 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.470
 but the program is beautiful, it's very simple 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.360
 there are only there is a switch there are 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.159
 of the functions I remember taking 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.840
 from the internet like that of the various gods 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.180
 sounds that are inside the game 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.690
 I remember that I am not mistaken 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.610
 this this this part is not me 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.490
 memory allowed me precisely to 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.670
 to run the program automatically 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.700
 that is, in practice I pressing for example 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.110
 direction over my my cursor is there 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.230
 my character moved 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.700
 he was always going to the direction 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.260
 same direction until he found 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.970
 an obstacle to doing this has 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.040
 used if I'm not mistaken this 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.520
 function here I don't remember so yes 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.520
 should check 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.650
 to do this precisely this thing 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.850
 anyway except a couple of things 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.630
 the rest is really a lot 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.430
 simple 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.730
 here for example used this 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.209
 here the bit that in practice gives me 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.560
 gave ifad sounds and produces sounds 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.390
 when for example here when he arrived 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.030
 in the end it produces a cross 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.260
 certain sound goes beyond these 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.020
 functions where the rest is very much 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.560
 simple for example is all structured 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.170
 on one with a switch i 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.239
 take a keyboard input the direction 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.680
 which was in this variable god e 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:26.840
 then that is, there are all the cases if the case 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.550
 of the wd the new above is the first thing 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.620
 that I make his position speed 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.620
 previous then effect of the controls 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.100
 and therefore I modify precisely I go to 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.890
 change from time to time 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.160
 position of my cursor cursor 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.610
 exactly the structure is this then 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.630
 very long to explain everything 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.270
 a video anyway 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.530
 ok this is how these were 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.220
 various screens now see 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.830
 running the game directly ok 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.160
 this was the first screen is the 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.510
 produced by there my name the version 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.610
 optimized for windows but this because 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.890
 there is just an intro that I made to press 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.200
 a button to continue but here the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.870
 game rules then you are 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.970
 This year we are this business here and 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.880
 you can move in the maze using i 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.510
 directional keys w above left 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.210
 say between them below to stop you enough 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.890
 press the space bar the bar 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.770
 Your goal is to take over 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.990
 these are possible dots so as to 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.580
 increase your score when you arrive 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.080
 at the heart the game finishes the score 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.060
 will be equal to the number of continuous ones that if 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.460
 I can eat are very careful 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.730
 don't let the various smiles get caught 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.530
 here dark in the labyrinth 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.120
 these are your enemies and weeks 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.410
 in the game it ends automatically good 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.610
 fun rather presses for 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.090
 to continue 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.440
 ok this and very simple maze here 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.670
 there is the score press a key to 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.530
 start playing 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.980
 these are the enemies, this is us 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.480
 this is the end of the maze ok without 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.370
 reasoning obtained w 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.110
 now arguing over when it arrived 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.750
 when I encounter an obstacle of dust 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.970
 in this case there is the wall mine 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.230
 cursor is my cursor remains still 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:18.290
 between change direction precisely I 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.880
 try to take all of these 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.880
 these children without making me eat 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.720
 ok you were eaten women friend ha 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.540
 lost press any key to continue the 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.790
 game is finished score wearing for 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.900
 continue thank you for playing here 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:39.080
 in exchange an old blog soon ok 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.760
 oh well anyway this is the game a lot 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.000
 simple 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.280
 I wanted to show I can also arrive 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.380
 at the heart, that is, at the end of the labyrinth 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.590
 without taking without eating all the 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.960
 dots so it's a lot much more 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.710
 quickly 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.710
 ok but here it is 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.230
 ok 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.180
 the music is slightly different though 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.330
 you managed to get to the end is 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.210
 good score of course 47 because 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.850
 I got nothing 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.150
 ok however the idea was very very 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:23.460
 nice to be one of my first 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.870
 in my first programs that is to say mi 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.660
 say several satisfactions because 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.750
 precisely we were friends for a few days 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.750
 doing so was also a nice thing 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.860
 a nice way to practice once 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.830
 taken the exam 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:43.280
 oh well for today it's all I hope you are 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:43.280
 liked the next video
