 Dnepropetrovsk and for sure we are not today 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.950

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.700

 on the deed stadium fans up 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.080
 the latter hoped for the arrival of the Dnieper and 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.610
 vigorously debated the latest weather events 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.830
 what are they about and injuring they could fly 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.050
 right there for your carbon weather was 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.390
 gorgeous weather why not a team 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.700
 many times trying to fly well, not they 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.160
 blame the city ​​that the fog should play 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.650
 just simply means pie he is very 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.890
 bus that no she too is followed by guys 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.830
 buses already a month two puncture 1 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.710
 port puncture with electricity 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.330
 Dnepropetrovsk but they had a day 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.970
 ride here by bus there on on 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.560
 catamaran on any means and we 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:09.750
 arrived we do not need this technical 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:11.760
 defeats nobody and we came today not 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.970
 due to the fact that we count there 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.440
 technical victory contingency 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.000
 discussed and in the Black Sea team 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.680
 Grigorchuk was shocked 456 kilometers 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.630
 I don’t remember my past or 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.450
 last season Barcelona to Milan 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.700
 when was this volcano over europe 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.060
 covered a thousand kilometers by bus 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.910
 but why should we correct 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.160
 some other people's mistakes and someone's sins in 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.830
 organization of the delivery team 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.400
 and the game I was really ny so you go 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.790
 carelessness of the Dnieper yesterday flying here 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.580
 and of course not failed a and 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.740
 sticker for kuwait and but i am i honestly i 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.200
 just from the couch and she can't can 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.660
 believe and all the team allowed itself 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.280
 such a course I would even say 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.050
 Seeing the guys talking there 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.290
 linnet of horse that can tell 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.920
 Well, of course they probably hurt that so 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.920
 it turned out but 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.049
 can't say anything because we 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.310
 also waited for a good game 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.019
 interesting only a day later on 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.060
 the official site of the Dnieper appeared 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.710
 Interview with Andrey Statsenko General Director 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.200
 claimed to leave tuesday on 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.270
 the team did not have time to get to the train 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.310
 in Odessa on the bus was dangerous because 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.260
 difficult weather conditions during 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.840
 fly out on Wednesday from Dnepropetrovsk and 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.520
 To land in Odessa, too, prevented the fog 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.440
 but if i save you my personal 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.750
 opinion then I think it is not force majeure 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.950
 circumstances all arrived all on the ground 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.630
 and the arbitrators and the inspector say so and all 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.390
 on places someone wanted that one who 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.790
 I came to know that the match came about 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.470
 25 thousand fans of the novel grigorchuk decided 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.480
 conduct an open training session 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.860
 Alexey Antonov even performed with 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.860
 fans club anthem 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.530
 what to do with a no-show is not pro soon decide 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.260
 control and disciplinary committee 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.490
 but in 2007 when due to fog in 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.570
 Lugansk could not land 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.940
 Poltava Vorskla 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.560
 I don’t give a match to the guests 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.560
 counted a technical defeat
