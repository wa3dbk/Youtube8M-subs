 make your own equipment for the minecraft 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.279
 because I said 0.6 zero point and also 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.869
 it serves for minecraft then then 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.359
 I would say if you want to put 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.330
 I started moving it but this tutorial 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.730
 it's for brands because he said good 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.090
 we are going to need this application that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.739
 llama mc skin this application is not in 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.019
 the beach history the routine the meeting 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.360
 it's just with the description of the video 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.469
 I'll leave you a link where you can 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 download by mediafire good between the 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.850
 application and this will appear 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 interface pretty much like that you give it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 who says create new to whom 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.170
 also that this thing is worth 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.449
 it will disappear if you give it a name 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.119
 and they give him create I give him cancel because 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 here I have a test skin is worth as 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.050
 come here I was creating some 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.720
 moments be here then good 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.970
 if you see me I enter the face 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.940
 You can start editing here 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.260
 as you will see that all colors are 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.350
 if they want to change the color they only give 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.420
 there and then also here he chooses the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.790
 color that you want is worth 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.310
 put some lenses like this one alone or 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.740
 glasses as you want to say it only 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.470
 touch the second letter is smaller 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.030
 that is here and here yes yes if they want 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.190
 Well, how will everything appear? 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.950
 this blank is because here they are added 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.230
 the objects those vouchers are already going to see them 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.140
 I will teach if you read here as you see 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.270
 they are removed are like objects that 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.250
 he adds that option is worth as we see 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.410
 there I have created more or less I the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.420
 skin then as the days for 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.460
 create it you just touch the part 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.080
 let's say you want to avoid 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.570
 head come here playing the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.000
 head and this will appear like this and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.650
 they touch this head here and they 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.540
 the face will appear then 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.080
 change the hair of that just select 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.550
 a color they are touching as well as you 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.530
 want to be worth 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.380
 as you can see because I am showing you more 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.540
 or less I as it is worth and to change the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.160
 hair color but to change the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.020
 color in everything also have it that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.890
 put this here and all that is worth 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.950
 do not 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.630
 ok if not if I was born here here when 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.090
 you leave does not appear them in case they come out 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.830
 and they give it to him again and he's going to change them 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.750
 the hair color 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.540
 here in case it has not changed because 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.100
 I have it in blue hair then 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.459
 If I want to change it and if I have to 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.459
 give here 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.560
 ok I do not know if you will understand me 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.120
 we hope if it does not appear they turn to 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.410
 leave and when they enter they will appear 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.780
 ok to add icons like the back 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.180
 here, I only draw the icon that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.000
 because as you want and see and 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.290
 would make sense or its who creates 2d and 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.720
 they just leave and they'll have one thing like that 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.310
 you only what they leave will need 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.819
 the blog launcher fear that I have had 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.349
 which is the past they go to sd card and then 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.349
 that application is going to create a 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.780
 folder called ms skins inside of that 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.370
 folder will leave this this month and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.890
 normal and this is the write that we just 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.420
 to create then we leave the blog 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.920
 launcher 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.140
 but 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.030
 let's see if it opened I hope I 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.030
 I apologized if it's about opening my friends 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.770
 look how you see it took a little bit hopefully 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.770
 you will not lose much in opening 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.489
 It's worth as you see, it opened and good 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.970
 what to do when it is 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.260
 in the launcher blog touch the key 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.980
 go open to this and I have two 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.190
 blog launcher options 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.930
 and everything will appear to you and you 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.549
 they give what interests us that says 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.890
 enable the skin 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.129
 ok then they give you there they go here 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.080
 turned on and touched it will appear something 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.440
 more or less like that they give to who says 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.920
 select 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.390
 and here they look for the ms skin folder 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.390
 as you see here it is and we give it to me 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.340
 it says test the skin that we made worth 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.920
 there will charge them and made them element 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.450
 you give it back and you leave vouchers 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.610
 I'll wait here to upload the blog 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.210
 launcher because you already know that I'm loaded 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.210
 little slow 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.720
 I will not have been 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.430
 good if you see the space 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.430
 what does not open them, I only think 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.110
 they have to go back in here but 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.110
 here and I have to go blue 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.840
 everything is worth 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.150
 ok as you see here I am and we can 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.440
 enter the mode quickly to 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.920
 teach them I will enter this mode of 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.660
 textures 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.200
 it just seemed like the time is already 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.200
 works 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.560
 and then I hope that it provokes it in third 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.880
 it's worth how they see here the function 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.880
 listeria 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.910
 so then nothing guys that would be all 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.160
 and if you have not done well bugbear to 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.750
 cut and nothing just a little problem but 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.140
 they saw that we hope to return to 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.140
 to show 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.509
 and then how did they see if he is the one 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.509
 works 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:54.370
 as you can see there is the video 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.410
 bye
