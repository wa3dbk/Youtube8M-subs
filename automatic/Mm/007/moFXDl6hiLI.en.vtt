00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
let's see how this stuff works

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
let's see how this stuff works
well<00:00:29.490> vinegar<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.060> cheap<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.660> can

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
well vinegar is it's cheap so you can

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.630 
well vinegar is it's cheap so you can
just<00:00:30.929> pretty<00:00:31.140> much<00:00:31.260> soak<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.769> down<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.520> other

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
just pretty much soak it down the other

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920 
just pretty much soak it down the other
nice<00:00:32.820> thing<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.360> not<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.750> really

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
nice thing is it's not going to really

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.780 
nice thing is it's not going to really
do<00:00:34.050> any<00:00:34.170> damage<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.590> anything<00:00:35.040> we're<00:00:35.640> just

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
do any damage to anything we're just

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.389 
do any damage to anything we're just
going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.079> vinegar<00:00:37.079> eyes<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.829> soaked

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
going to vinegar eyes it get it soaked

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.700 
going to vinegar eyes it get it soaked
you<00:00:39.239> kind<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.510> try<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:40.020> work<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you kind of try to just work it in to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
you kind of try to just work it in to
the<00:00:40.890> sticker<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.879> works<00:00:42.180> better<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the sticker this works better on the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.270 
the sticker this works better on the
paper<00:00:42.870> stickers<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.590> does<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:43.800> plastic

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
paper stickers and it does not plastic

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.590 
paper stickers and it does not plastic
stick<00:00:44.460> because<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> plastic<00:00:45.390> sticker

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
stick because this is a plastic sticker

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
stick because this is a plastic sticker
so<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.930> might<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.260> dig<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> few

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so we might have to dig at it a few

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.209 
so we might have to dig at it a few
times<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.390> off<00:00:48.710> I'm<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.920> soak<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
times to get it off I'm going to soak it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
times to get it off I'm going to soak it
for<00:00:50.430> about<00:00:50.550> five<00:00:50.850> minutes<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.239> keep<00:00:51.600> putting

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
for about five minutes just keep putting

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.590 
for about five minutes just keep putting
the<00:00:51.960> vinegar<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
the vinegar on it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.939 
the vinegar on it
all<00:00:54.600> right<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.840> keeping<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> soaked<00:00:55.440> down<00:00:55.710> I'm

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
all right so keeping it soaked down I'm

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.250 
all right so keeping it soaked down I'm
going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> use<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> razor<00:00:56.579> blade<00:00:57.079> if<00:00:58.079> you're

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
going to use a razor blade if you're

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.420 
going to use a razor blade if you're
gonna<00:00:58.350> use<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> razor<00:00:58.710> blade<00:00:58.859> I'd<00:00:59.039> recommend

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
gonna use a razor blade I'd recommend

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.709 
gonna use a razor blade I'd recommend
getting<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> handle<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.329> otherwise

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
getting one with a handle on otherwise

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
getting one with a handle on otherwise
you<00:01:00.840> may<00:01:00.960> cut<00:01:01.199> yourself<00:01:01.609> another<00:01:02.609> option

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
you may cut yourself another option

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.369 
you may cut yourself another option
would<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> plastic<00:01:03.930> painter's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
would be like a plastic painter's

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.520 
would be like a plastic painter's
palette<00:01:04.680> knife<00:01:05.630> which<00:01:06.630> would<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.840> less<00:01:07.020> sharp

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
palette knife which would be less sharp

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.660 
palette knife which would be less sharp
probably<00:01:07.950> less<00:01:08.100> effective

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
probably less effective

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
probably less effective
so<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> vinegar<00:01:09.600> gets<00:01:10.170> rid<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.650> glue

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
so the vinegar gets rid of all the glue

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.950 
so the vinegar gets rid of all the glue
the<00:01:11.670> razor<00:01:11.880> blade<00:01:12.150> takes<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> sticker<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:14.960> and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the razor blade takes the sticker up and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.630 
the razor blade takes the sticker up and
it<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> magic

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:30.200 

easy<00:01:20.640> peasy

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.380 

that's<00:01:31.210> all<00:01:31.390> there<00:01:31.510> is<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:34.090> there<00:01:34.300> you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
that's all there is to it and there you

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.740 
that's all there is to it and there you
go

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
go

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.690 
go
all<00:01:34.840> done<00:01:35.140> clean<00:01:35.680> as<00:01:36.040> if<00:01:36.160> it<00:01:36.280> was<00:01:36.400> never<00:01:36.550> there

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
all done clean as if it was never there

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.970 
all done clean as if it was never there
in<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.850> first<00:01:36.910> place<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:38.230> vinegar<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.590> really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
in the first place the vinegar is really

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.420 
in the first place the vinegar is really
good<00:01:39.130> at<00:01:39.280> loosening<00:01:39.700> up<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:40.120> old<00:01:41.430> sticker
