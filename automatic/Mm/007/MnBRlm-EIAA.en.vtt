00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
rate is 105 and there I go so it's gonna

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.849 
rate is 105 and there I go so it's gonna
bump<00:00:16.350> me<00:00:16.470> up<00:00:16.500> slowly<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:18.359> actual<00:00:18.990> distance

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
bump me up slowly to the actual distance

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.070

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
a heart rate grip here and then a strap

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
a heart rate grip here and then a strap
too<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.050> rage<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.100> impressive

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
little programs right there on the side

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.430 
little programs right there on the side
so<00:00:52.399> we<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:54.270> our<00:00:54.390> energy<00:00:54.930> power

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
so we are going to use our energy power

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.119 
so we are going to use our energy power
saving<00:00:55.980> mode<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.859> and<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:58.980> gonna

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
saving mode like so and I'm gonna

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.569 
saving mode like so and I'm gonna
actually<00:00:59.460> stop<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.940> real<00:01:00.120> quick<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.660> guys

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and show you some other things this is a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:13.560 
and show you some other things this is a
fold-up<00:01:05.330> it<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.780 

reduces<00:01:14.570> stress<00:01:14.990> on<00:01:15.320> joints<00:01:15.560> by<00:01:15.830> 30<00:01:16.100> percent

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
reduces stress on joints by 30 percent

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.390 
reduces stress on joints by 30 percent
compared<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.750> running<00:01:18.170> outside<00:01:18.320> it's<00:01:19.130> really

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
compared to running outside it's really

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:38.319 
compared to running outside it's really
easy<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.670> fold<00:01:19.820> up

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.700 

also<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> inside<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.320> see<00:01:40.469> there's<00:01:40.649> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
also on the inside you can see there's a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.980 
also on the inside you can see there's a
circle<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.179> through<00:01:42.390> there<00:01:42.539> there's<00:01:42.929> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
circle get see through there there's a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
circle get see through there there's a
circle<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.039> that's<00:01:44.189> what<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.429> actual<00:01:44.549> shocks

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
circle so that's what the actual shocks

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.330 
circle so that's what the actual shocks
are<00:01:45.179> I<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.469> is<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> shock<00:01:47.070> looks

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
are I mean this is what the shock looks

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.950 
are I mean this is what the shock looks
like<00:01:47.549> right<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.219> squeeze<00:01:50.219> it

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
like right here you squeeze it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.620 
like right here you squeeze it
that<00:01:51.960> reduces<00:01:52.319> 30%<00:01:53.119> great<00:01:54.119> outside<00:01:54.450> then

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that reduces 30% great outside then

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.499 
that reduces 30% great outside then
we're<00:01:54.750> gonna<00:01:54.840> let<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.049> down

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.740 

and<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:03.840> my<00:02:03.990> demonstration
