00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.049
 another video of me I'm the maz 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.469
 and you watch the last play over 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.049
 determinism and the free will 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.969
 what happens when a dice drops one 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.420
 random number is between 1 and 6 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.420
 above 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.550
 wrong the number is again random yet 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.260
 does she have a well-defined one 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.119
 statistical probability sure 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.350
 Show experiments that you roughly 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.510
 a probability of one 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.880
 Sixth per litter is still coming 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.390
 6 100 do not throw exactly 100 throw one 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.940
 4 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.980
 although a cube is the pattern example for 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.510
 it will be random experiments 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.450
 result by unbelievably many 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.950
 smallest factors influenced 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.629
 different room temperature throw 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.610
 speed impact angle and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.289
 tiny bumps in the cube 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.120
 for a result that was not predicted 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.379
 can be 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.809
 that is now but not that it also 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.969
 By chance you could do every little one 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.620
 Factor you could calculate the trajectory 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.280
 determine before and the result of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.660
 litter would be predictable just because something 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 Unpredictable does not mean that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.129
 that it is also accidental and mine 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.150
 Today's topic, it is very important that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.159
 you understand that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.320
 because our world is just the same 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.150
 already built up factors such as a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.770
 single overtaking car can to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.869
 lead for kilometers of traffic jams 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.110
 but the really interesting aspect 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.040
 lies with much smaller things 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 for hundreds of years 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.460
 some researchers say and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.020
 philosophers all this in our world 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.310
 down to the smallest particles in 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.119
 permanent interaction with each other 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 stand 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.829
 every atom move and change into 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.390
 dependency on others and this one 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.250
 gigantic connection could 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.979
 theoretically eternal 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 every action evokes a reaction 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.000
 which could be calculated exactly 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.009
 and there this reaction again for more 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.450
 could lead to reactions to it 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.899
 if you could calculate all that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.799
 to see infinitely into the future 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.600
 of course that's practically impossible 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.189
 and it has not been proven yet 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 that every action is a predictable one 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.090
 reaction still causes for this 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.430
 thought to a surprising 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.170
 consequence if the condition of one 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.490
 Particle alone through the past 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.950
 and the interaction with others 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.710
 everything is predetermined 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.750
 and follows fixed paths and if the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.239
 world works so why should it 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.220
 then be different with the brain if 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.959
 according to the principle of causal 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 The world's closed-mindedness only 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.400
 physical phenomena are the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.470
 current research seems to be exactly that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.680
 confirm and the logical consequence 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.780
 it is scary thoughts as well 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.310
 would then be subject to the laws of nature 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.040
 and only from the states of the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.620
 dependent on the past and we would have 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.970
 no free will this approach 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.640
 designates the science as 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.540
 but determinism to define it is 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.870
 not so easy 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.280
 roughly one could describe him like that 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.170
 accepted now just exists beside 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.780
 our world also has another world 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.060
 which is an exact copy of ours 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.980
 would be a deterministic system 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.140
 This still completely in 1000 years 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.180
 identical to ours from exactly that 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.890
 this a constellation of particles 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.209
 only one possible development 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.110
 gives 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.959
 but as soon as the smallest differences 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.560
 occur eg by quantum physics speaks 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.879
 One of the deadlines in the world 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.250
 currently represented some leading 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.569
 researcher such as wolf singer the director 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.209
 of the max planck institute for 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.489
 brain research exactly this theory of 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.780
 free will is just an illusion of 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.930
 everything in our world through the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.489
 laws of nature predestined supported 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.450
 For this view has some years 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.270
 through impressive experiments 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.670
 more in 1979, the scientist found 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.379
 benjamin lives in trying that out 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.610
 the brain acts already several 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.170
 a hundred milliseconds 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.670
 before the test persons turn 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.190
 ever aware of an action 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.870
 decides to prepare the probands 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.670
 saw a point at a very fast 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.080
 rushing clock over and over 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.450
 should be at any time 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.220
 Raise the number of your arm 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.989
 thought to have made the decision 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.489
 later differed noticeably from 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.970
 actual time of the first 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.590
 impulses of the brain to lift the arm 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.420
 For example, today's attempts by 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.670
 professor doctor john dylan haynes am 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.380
 max planck institut became the result 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.060
 even further refines the 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.860
 test persons was the choice here 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.569
 between two buttons in her right 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.970
 and left left and that 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.410
 results surprised a lot more in 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.269
 brain was already five to ten 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.890
 seconds before the candidate was aware of it 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.590
 For an action decided exactly this 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.180
 So the researchers were able to prepare 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.130
 already seconds ahead of the conscious 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.900
 decision predict which of the 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.410
 Both possibilities of the proband choose 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.139
 would 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.460
 They were able to do so from the brain activities 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.410
 derive intentions 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.050
 even before the test person 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.000
 at all had the conclusion of the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.070
 The appointment is as obvious as it is 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.289
 scary at the moment we are 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.030
 believe us something is to decide 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.860
 Actual decision long ago 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.960
 like 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.240
 to put it succinctly, we do not do anything 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.860
 we want but we want what we want 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.450
 do 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.520
 the conscious will to something arises 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.130
 So only after the action already 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.840
 is initiated that I have everything 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.490
 apparently after but up to 50 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.250
 milliseconds before the offense is still over 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.630
 a veto if and to what extent 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.430
 knowledge for the free sake 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.400
 refute is not ascertainable 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.080
 so far the explanations are missing 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.760
 would be just as possible that the brain 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.900
 free decides and our awareness 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.760
 this decision as later 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.550
 processed justifies and 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.110
 controlled and just this fact 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.599
 that the relationship between brain and 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.830
 Consciousness is still completely unclear 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.340
 Still hope for a free one 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.630
 sake 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.370
 nobody knows how consciousness arises 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.170
 and so it could be at least that 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.000
 besides the physical world also one 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.220
 spiritual exists the laws of nature 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.220
 is not subject and therefore 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.630
 a free will allows if these 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.670
 world now by a divine spark 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.230
 of life or just out 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.490
 scientifically not yet explainable 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.290
 is created is there 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.880
 incidental 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.040
 another approach without one 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.290
 spiritual world would be enough for 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.060
 For example, quantum physics is shot 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.740
 lets a photo play on a double 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.600
 not predict in advance 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.190
 which columns will fly the 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.560
 Quantum physics seems from today's perspective 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.470
 actually random and unpredictable 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.000
 as well as radioactivity 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.580
 thought experiment by schrödinger 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.960
 cat illustrates that in this 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.460
 picture a cat together with one 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.090
 radioactive atoms in a box 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.280
 blocked 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.780
 the atom decomposes into a poison 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.570
 released that cat 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.980
 instantly kills as an observer of 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.870
 but you do not have any outside 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.120
 possibility to predict if and when 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.130
 the atom decays the radioactive 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.780
 do not disintegrate after predictable 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.850
 Conditions are therefore not deterministic 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.900
 happens 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.300
 we can not say with certainty 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.250
 what a world we live what we live 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.260
 but it can be said that life is in the 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.540
 not only believe in the free will 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.310
 is easier and happier but 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.440
 that our belief in it also makes us one 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.240
 better people makes your attempts 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.070
 have shown that people who do not at 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.280
 to believe in a free will less 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.590
 helpful and unmotivated are those 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.180
 conclusion is so easy as long as us 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.620
 nobody should prove otherwise 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.690
 We assume that we have a free one 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.090
 will have as much as ours 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.320
 Society already does 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.150
 If you liked it I would 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.860
 very happy about your thumbs up 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.150
 next friday will be here too 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.210
 again a real last think 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.860
 this time on the topic of big data that should 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.750
 you have to look at each other because these 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.120
 Technology will be your life on many 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.460
 change 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.460
 and at least that is already today 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.229
 surely that's what it was before 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.940
 so far from me I am the maz hope 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.530
 that your opinion on the topic there and me 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.530
 say goodbye to the next video
