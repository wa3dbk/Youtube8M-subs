more<00:00:27.470> you<00:00:27.740> can<00:00:27.890> grow<00:00:28.039> less<00:00:28.310> it<00:00:28.640> grows<00:00:29.300> well<00:00:29.509> in

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
more you can grow less it grows well in

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.669

pots

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
pots

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.109 
pots
it<00:00:30.890> just<00:00:31.099> doesn't<00:00:31.339> like<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.579> heat<00:00:31.789> too<00:00:31.970> well

once<00:00:32.360> it<00:00:32.509> really<00:00:32.780> starts<00:00:33.020> getting<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.320> heat

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
once it really starts getting the heat

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.319 
once it really starts getting the heat
it<00:00:33.620> starts<00:00:33.890> bolting<00:00:34.310> one<00:00:34.880> of<00:00:34.970> the<00:00:35.030> ways<00:00:35.150> you

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
it starts bolting one of the ways you

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.880 
it starts bolting one of the ways you
can<00:00:35.510> keep<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.870> from<00:00:36.020> doing<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.500> try<00:00:36.829> to

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
can keep it from doing that is try to

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.979 
can keep it from doing that is try to
plant<00:00:37.160> it<00:00:37.310> in<00:00:37.399> a<00:00:37.460> place<00:00:38.149> that<00:00:38.329> gets<00:00:38.390> more<00:00:38.629> shade

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989
