00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.100 

the<00:02:07.970> biolite<00:02:08.450> stove<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:10.420> now<00:02:11.420> it's

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
the biolite stove like that now it's

the biolite stove like that now it's
going<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.320> take<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.800> few<00:02:12.830> minutes<00:02:13.280> for<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.580> to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
going to take in a few minutes for it to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.110 
going to take in a few minutes for it to
heat<00:02:13.940> up<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.930> if<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.800> want<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.100> add<00:02:16.250> wood<00:02:16.610> adding

gonna have some hot spots and it takes a

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.070 
gonna have some hot spots and it takes a
little<00:04:54.040> while<00:04:54.220> to<00:04:54.550> get<00:04:54.970> used<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.330> using<00:04:55.480> it<00:04:55.780> but

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
little while to get used to using it but

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.930 
little while to get used to using it but
again<00:04:56.230> you<00:04:57.040> know<00:04:57.130> one<00:04:57.460> of<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.640> things<00:04:57.700> that's

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
again you know one of the things that's

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.820 
again you know one of the things that's
kind<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.270> nice<00:04:58.420> is<00:04:58.780> it's<00:04:59.020> very<00:04:59.080> easy<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.680> add

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
kind of nice is it's very easy to add

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.120 
kind of nice is it's very easy to add
wood<00:05:00.630> all<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.690> need<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.080> do<00:05:02.200> is<00:05:02.410> just<00:05:02.710> flip<00:05:02.890> this

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
wood all I need to do is just flip this

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.930 
wood all I need to do is just flip this
top<00:05:03.340> open

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
top open

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.640 
top open
I<00:05:05.640> can<00:05:06.640> drop<00:05:06.850> some<00:05:07.570> wood<00:05:07.780> in<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.110> can<00:05:08.260> also<00:05:08.440> use

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
I can drop some wood in I can also use

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.800 
I can drop some wood in I can also use
longer<00:05:09.370> pieces<00:05:09.730> of<00:05:10.030> wood<00:05:10.210> than<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:10.450> typically

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
longer pieces of wood than I typically

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.470 
longer pieces of wood than I typically
could<00:05:11.110> because<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:12.310> grill<00:05:12.760> sits<00:05:13.060> up<00:05:13.210> fairly

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
could because this grill sits up fairly

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:23.130 
could because this grill sits up fairly
high<00:05:19.380> then<00:05:20.380> I'm<00:05:20.740> gonna<00:05:20.890> flip<00:05:21.130> this<00:05:21.310> shut<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.990> I

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
high then I'm gonna flip this shut and I

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.510 
high then I'm gonna flip this shut and I
think<00:05:23.500> as<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.830> get<00:05:24.040> a<00:05:24.070> little<00:05:24.280> bit<00:05:24.400> more

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
think as I get a little bit more

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.740 
think as I get a little bit more
experience<00:05:25.030> with<00:05:25.180> it<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:25.420> can<00:05:25.570> probably

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
experience with it I can probably

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.650 
experience with it I can probably
control<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.560> heat<00:05:26.830> on<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.550> girl<00:05:27.790> top<00:05:28.060> by

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
control the heat on the girl top by

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.840 
control the heat on the girl top by
opening<00:05:29.080> and<00:05:29.230> closing<00:05:29.260> that<00:05:29.830> this<00:05:30.280> vent<00:05:32.850> and

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
opening and closing that this vent and

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.150 
opening and closing that this vent and
as<00:05:33.970> with<00:05:34.180> all<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.360> iolite<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.440> with<00:05:35.620> as<00:05:35.770> as
