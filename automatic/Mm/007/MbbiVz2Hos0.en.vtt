00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
bags are made out of I made a lot of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.729 
bags are made out of I made a lot of
them<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.790> case<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.270> actually<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:40.320> room

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
them just in case I actually have room

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
them just in case I actually have room
for<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.040> tree<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.670> don't<00:00:41.940> actually<00:00:42.360> this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
for a tree which I don't actually this

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.920 
for a tree which I don't actually this
year<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.219> cut<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.250> enough<00:00:44.760> pieces<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:45.510> six

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
year I cut out enough pieces to make six

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
year I cut out enough pieces to make six
hummingbirds<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> cut<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.000> little

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
hummingbirds and then I cut a little

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.560 
hummingbirds and then I cut a little
piece<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.920> very<00:00:49.920> light<00:00:50.250> wire<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.030> 22

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
piece of very light wire this is 22

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.040 
piece of very light wire this is 22
gauge<00:00:52.460> galvanized<00:00:53.460> steel<00:00:53.760> wire<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.719> cut

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
gauge galvanized steel wire and I cut

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.319 
gauge galvanized steel wire and I cut
that<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.430> long<00:00:56.640> enough<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.149> go

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that so this is just long enough to go

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
that so this is just long enough to go
from<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> beak<00:00:57.989> all<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.100> way<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.430> across<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
from the beak all the way up across the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.029 
from the beak all the way up across the
top<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.600> head<00:01:00.809> make<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> little<00:01:01.379> loop<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
top of the head make a little loop so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.770 
top of the head make a little loop so
that<00:01:02.190> you'll<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.340> something<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.910> actually

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
that you'll have something to actually

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.590 
that you'll have something to actually
tie<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> string<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> hanger<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.090> then

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
tie a string or a hanger to and then

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.870 
tie a string or a hanger to and then
down<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> end<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> tail<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.130> taped<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
down to the end of the tail I taped it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.429 
down to the end of the tail I taped it
on<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.720> hummingbird<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
on to the back of the hummingbird with a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.859 
on to the back of the hummingbird with a
beak<00:01:10.740> hanging<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.939> front<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.360> course<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
beak hanging out in front of course and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
beak hanging out in front of course and
then<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.740> made<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> very<00:01:14.280> small<00:01:14.640> ball<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
then I made a very small ball of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.230 
then I made a very small ball of
aluminum<00:01:16.049> foil<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.030> size

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
aluminum foil just just the right size

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
aluminum foil just just the right size
for<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.600> head<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:19.979> done<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
for the head and when that was done I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.020 
for the head and when that was done I
made<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> larger<00:01:21.240> piece<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> side<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
made a larger piece to go on the side to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.859 
made a larger piece to go on the side to
make<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> body<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:25.880> rather<00:01:26.880> loosely<00:01:27.330> taped<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
make the body I rather loosely taped the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.569 
make the body I rather loosely taped the
two<00:01:28.049> pieces<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.979> since<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.430> weren't

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
two pieces on there since we weren't

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.460 
two pieces on there since we weren't
using<00:01:29.939> aluminum<00:01:30.420> foil<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.869> don't<00:01:31.079> need<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> get

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
using aluminum foil we don't need to get

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.749 
using aluminum foil we don't need to get
really<00:01:31.710> carried<00:01:32.009> away<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> tape

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
really carried away with the tape

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.760 
really carried away with the tape
because<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.270> doesn't<00:01:33.600> lose<00:01:34.079> its<00:01:34.140> shape<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
because it doesn't lose its shape the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.249 
because it doesn't lose its shape the
way<00:01:34.890> crumpled<00:01:35.340> paper<00:01:35.549> would<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.079> just

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
way crumpled paper would and then I just

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.350 
way crumpled paper would and then I just
turned<00:01:37.530> him<00:01:37.680> over<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.250> made<00:01:38.700> two<00:01:38.939> more<00:01:39.119> pieces

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
turned him over and made two more pieces

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
turned him over and made two more pieces
one<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.079> head<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> body<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
one for the head and one for the body so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.429 
one for the head and one for the body so
that<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> flow<00:01:42.240> hummingbird<00:01:42.810> looks

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that we have a flow hummingbird looks

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.920 
that we have a flow hummingbird looks
something<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.810> we

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
something like this now and now what we

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.450 
something like this now and now what we
need<00:01:46.110> our<00:01:46.350> wings

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
need our wings

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.319 
need our wings
in<00:01:47.850> order<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> get<00:01:48.390> those<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> turn

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
in order to get those on we want to turn

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.010 
in order to get those on we want to turn
them<00:01:51.540> over<00:01:51.750> onto<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
them over onto the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.750 
them over onto the
so<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.170> we<00:01:54.230> can<00:01:54.350> see<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.650> back<00:01:54.920> very<00:01:55.490> lightly

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
so that we can see is back very lightly

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.960 
so that we can see is back very lightly
taped<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.480> pieces<00:01:56.990> on<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.440> that<00:01:57.590> we<00:01:57.710> can

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
taped the pieces on so that we can

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.490 
taped the pieces on so that we can
pretty<00:01:58.970> much<00:01:59.030> see<00:01:59.780> that<00:01:59.900> we<00:01:59.990> like<00:02:00.170> where<00:02:00.380> they

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
pretty much see that we like where they

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500 
pretty much see that we like where they
are<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.130> then<00:02:01.370> go<00:02:01.400> ahead<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.000> take<00:02:02.150> them<00:02:02.300> on<00:02:02.450> a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
are and then go ahead and take them on a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.560 
are and then go ahead and take them on a
little<00:02:02.720> bit<00:02:02.900> more<00:02:03.080> sturdily<00:02:04.210> now<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.300> just

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
little bit more sturdily now we just

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.980 
little bit more sturdily now we just
need<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.960> make<00:02:06.140> some<00:02:06.400> coils<00:02:07.400> of<00:02:07.750> aluminum<00:02:08.750> foil

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
need to make some coils of aluminum foil

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.290 
need to make some coils of aluminum foil
to<00:02:09.260> make<00:02:09.380> some<00:02:09.619> bones<00:02:09.860> for<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.250> wings<00:02:10.520> they

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
to make some bones for the wings they

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.150 
to make some bones for the wings they
just<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.840> be<00:02:12.020> long<00:02:12.320> enough<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:12.770> they<00:02:12.980> go

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
just have to be long enough so they go

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.280 
just have to be long enough so they go
from<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.670> body<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.270> tip<00:02:14.570> of<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.780> wing<00:02:15.050> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
from the body to the tip of the wing and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.620 
from the body to the tip of the wing and
they're<00:02:16.040> going<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.490> be<00:02:16.700> taped<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
they're going to be taped on the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.720 
they're going to be taped on the
underside<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.650> wing<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.400> will<00:02:19.550> give<00:02:19.700> a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
underside of the wing this will give a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.520 
underside of the wing this will give a
better<00:02:20.120> shape<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:20.780> going<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.020> reinforce

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
better shape and it's going to reinforce

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.430 
better shape and it's going to reinforce
the<00:02:21.710> wing<00:02:21.860> too<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.630> got<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.690> little<00:02:23.960> bit<00:02:24.230> sloppy

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the wing too I got a little bit sloppy

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.370 
the wing too I got a little bit sloppy
when<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:24.980> was<00:02:25.310> taping<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.450> bones<00:02:26.810> on<00:02:27.140> one<00:02:27.350> of

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
when I was taping the bones on one of

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.620 
when I was taping the bones on one of
the<00:02:27.590> wings<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.010> had<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.400> recut<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.060> scallops

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
the wings so I had to recut the scallops

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.180 
the wings so I had to recut the scallops
so<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.260> probably<00:02:30.500> want<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.710> be<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.890> little<00:02:31.100> bit

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
so you probably want to be a little bit

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.310 
so you probably want to be a little bit
more<00:02:31.340> careful<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:32.000> did<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.210> little<00:02:32.750> bit<00:02:33.080> better

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
more careful I did a little bit better

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.770 
more careful I did a little bit better
job<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.040> second<00:02:34.460> one<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:35.360> going<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.660> be

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
job on the second one it's going to be

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.350 
job on the second one it's going to be
all<00:02:35.960> covered<00:02:36.200> up<00:02:36.500> with<00:02:36.800> paper<00:02:37.550> mache<00:02:37.790> clay<00:02:38.300> so

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
all covered up with paper mache clay so

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.850 
all covered up with paper mache clay so
it<00:02:38.600> really<00:02:38.930> doesn't<00:02:39.260> matter<00:02:39.380> all<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.680> much

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
it really doesn't matter all that much

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.670 
it really doesn't matter all that much
but<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.730> wondered<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.810> minute<00:02:42.050> because<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.440> went

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
but I wondered a minute because I went

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.020 
but I wondered a minute because I went
to<00:02:42.710> all<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.250> trouble<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.640> cut<00:02:43.880> those

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
to all that trouble to cut those

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.600 
to all that trouble to cut those
scallops<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.600> decided<00:02:44.930> oh<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.350> better<00:02:45.890> try<00:02:46.490> to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
scallops I decided oh I better try to

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.700 
scallops I decided oh I better try to
save<00:02:46.880> them<00:02:47.090> if<00:02:47.210> I<00:02:47.330> could

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
save them if I could

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.230 
save them if I could
now<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.770> only<00:02:48.980> thing<00:02:49.100> left<00:02:49.490> is<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.880> add<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
now the only thing left is to add the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.890 
now the only thing left is to add the
tail<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:51.350> cut<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.190> tail<00:02:52.430> out<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:53.060> brown

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
tail I cut the tail out of the brown

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.280 
tail I cut the tail out of the brown
paper<00:02:54.820> from<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.970> paper<00:02:56.150> sack<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:56.990> should

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
paper from the paper sack and I should

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.410 
paper from the paper sack and I should
have<00:02:57.440> used<00:02:57.680> light<00:02:58.010> cardboard<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.910> I'll<00:02:59.240> show

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
have used light cardboard and I'll show

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.940 
have used light cardboard and I'll show
you<00:02:59.450> why<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.840> little<00:03:00.170> bit<00:03:00.290> later<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.650> might

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
you why a little bit later you might

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.820 
you why a little bit later you might
want<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.250> go<00:03:01.400> ahead<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.570> take<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.290> advice

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
want to go ahead and take that advice

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.040 
want to go ahead and take that advice
before<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.550> cut<00:03:04.730> all<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.970> pieces<00:03:05.000> out<00:03:05.510> it

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
before you cut all the pieces out it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.260 
before you cut all the pieces out it
doesn't<00:03:06.470> matter<00:03:06.680> really<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.580> still<00:03:08.000> worked

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
doesn't matter really it still worked

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.760 
doesn't matter really it still worked
but<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.690> would<00:03:08.810> have<00:03:08.900> been<00:03:09.020> a<00:03:09.050> lot<00:03:09.260> easier<00:03:09.650> if

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
but it would have been a lot easier if

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.920 
but it would have been a lot easier if
the<00:03:09.890> tail<00:03:10.100> had<00:03:10.340> been<00:03:10.550> made

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the tail had been made

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.710 
the tail had been made
heavier<00:03:11.319> stock<00:03:11.680> now<00:03:12.459> I'm<00:03:12.640> almost<00:03:12.939> ready<00:03:13.390> to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
add about a quarter of a cup of wet low

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.940 
add about a quarter of a cup of wet low
fire<00:03:34.329> pottery<00:03:34.810> clay<00:03:35.109> just<00:03:35.379> because<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.560> happen

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
fire pottery clay just because I happen

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.860 
fire pottery clay just because I happen
to<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.189> some<00:03:36.489> around<00:03:36.879> I<00:03:37.209> like<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.599> way<00:03:37.750> it

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
to have some around I like the way it

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.899 
to have some around I like the way it
makes<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.200> feel<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:38.859> it's<00:03:39.280> totally<00:03:39.760> not

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
makes it feel but it's totally not

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.210 
makes it feel but it's totally not
necessary<00:03:40.120> but<00:03:41.049> if<00:03:41.140> you're<00:03:41.290> wondering<00:03:41.500> why<00:03:41.920> my

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
necessary but if you're wondering why my

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.830 
necessary but if you're wondering why my
clay<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.700> little<00:03:42.909> bit<00:03:43.030> gray<00:03:43.329> instead<00:03:43.720> of

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
clay is a little bit gray instead of

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.099 
clay is a little bit gray instead of
white<00:03:44.019> that's<00:03:44.319> why<00:03:45.450> go<00:03:46.450> ahead<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.870> put<00:03:47.079> a

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
white that's why go ahead and put a

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.430 
white that's why go ahead and put a
really<00:03:47.500> thin<00:03:47.920> layer<00:03:48.159> of<00:03:48.700> paper<00:03:49.659> mache<00:03:49.900> clay

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
really thin layer of paper mache clay

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.759 
really thin layer of paper mache clay
over<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.099> wings<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:52.180> body<00:03:52.440> do<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.470> little

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
over the wings and the body do a little

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.770 
over the wings and the body do a little
bit<00:03:53.889> of<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.129> time<00:03:54.430> if<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.940> can<00:03:55.269> because<00:03:55.629> you're

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
bit of a time if you can because you're

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.539 
bit of a time if you can because you're
going<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:55.989> need<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.200> little<00:03:56.439> bit<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.709> detailing

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
going to need a little bit of detailing

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.089 
going to need a little bit of detailing
I'm<00:03:58.090> hurried<00:03:58.810> through<00:03:59.200> this<00:03:59.379> because<00:03:59.769> I<00:03:59.799> was

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
I'm hurried through this because I was

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.020 
I'm hurried through this because I was
hoping<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.939> be<00:04:01.090> able<00:04:01.359> to<00:04:01.540> make<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.109> project<00:04:02.409> that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
hoping to be able to make a project that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.449 
hoping to be able to make a project that
was<00:04:04.030> fast<00:04:04.780> enough<00:04:05.109> so<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.560> if<00:04:05.889> you<00:04:06.010> wanted<00:04:06.400> to

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
was fast enough so that if you wanted to

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.599 
was fast enough so that if you wanted to
make<00:04:06.700> 30<00:04:07.030> or<00:04:07.209> 40<00:04:07.569> of<00:04:07.599> them<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.049> could<00:04:08.349> but<00:04:09.310> if

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
make 30 or 40 of them you could but if

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.149 
make 30 or 40 of them you could but if
you're<00:04:09.819> only<00:04:10.000> making<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.569> few<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.799> can<00:04:11.980> make

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
you're only making a few you can make

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.640 
you're only making a few you can make
much<00:04:12.430> better<00:04:12.480> details<00:04:13.480> if<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.780> dampen<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
much better details if you dampen the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.039 
much better details if you dampen the
knife<00:04:14.859> just<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.519> little<00:04:15.760> bit<00:04:15.940> because<00:04:16.750> it'll

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
knife just a little bit because it'll

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.969 
knife just a little bit because it'll
get<00:04:17.260> much<00:04:17.410> nicer<00:04:18.030> cleaner<00:04:19.030> lines<00:04:19.449> a<00:04:19.979> little

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
get much nicer cleaner lines a little

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.770 
get much nicer cleaner lines a little
bit<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.400> paper<00:04:21.609> mache<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.240> going<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.570> just

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
bit of the paper mache is going to just

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.010 
bit of the paper mache is going to just
naturally<00:04:23.349> stick<00:04:23.830> out<00:04:24.010> over<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.729> end<00:04:25.060> of<00:04:25.449> your

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
naturally stick out over the end of your

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.020 
naturally stick out over the end of your
feathers<00:04:26.590> making<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.159> really<00:04:27.370> really<00:04:27.699> thin

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
feathers making a really really thin

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.460 
feathers making a really really thin
line<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.659> I<00:04:29.289> just<00:04:29.320> went<00:04:29.650> ahead

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
line and I just went ahead

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.530 
line and I just went ahead
went<00:04:31.040> back<00:04:31.220> over<00:04:31.250> that<00:04:31.730> and<00:04:31.940> removed<00:04:32.330> the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
went back over that and removed the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.450 
went back over that and removed the
excess<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.820> use<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.030> knife<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:36.460> redefine

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
excess and use the knife to redefine

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.430 
excess and use the knife to redefine
those<00:04:37.700> scallops<00:04:38.270> along<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.720> edges<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.110> the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
those scallops along the edges of the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.290 
those scallops along the edges of the
wings<00:04:41.410> because<00:04:42.410> I<00:04:42.590> used<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.760> light<00:04:43.970> paper

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
wings because I used the the light paper

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.680 
wings because I used the the light paper
I<00:04:44.660> only<00:04:45.260> put<00:04:45.680> clay<00:04:45.980> on<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.340> bottom<00:04:46.790> of<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.360> of

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
I only put clay on the bottom of the of

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.900 
I only put clay on the bottom of the of
the<00:04:47.900> tail<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.830> first<00:04:49.070> time<00:04:49.280> because<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.790> was

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
the tail the first time because it was

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.140 
the tail the first time because it was
too<00:04:50.150> flimsy<00:04:51.010> there's<00:04:52.010> no<00:04:52.190> reinforcement<00:04:52.490> like

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
too flimsy there's no reinforcement like

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.930 
too flimsy there's no reinforcement like
the<00:04:53.450> wings<00:04:53.900> have<00:04:54.170> so<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.530> had<00:04:54.920> to<00:04:55.100> do<00:04:55.310> just<00:04:55.340> the

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
the wings have so I had to do just the

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.480 
the wings have so I had to do just the
bottom<00:04:56.300> then<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:56.990> let<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.230> dry<00:04:57.350> and<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.130> went<00:04:58.310> back

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
bottom then I let it dry and I went back

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.210 
bottom then I let it dry and I went back
over<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:59.000> did<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.240> top<00:04:59.450> if<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.110> use<00:05:00.530> like

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
over and did the top if you use like

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.370 
over and did the top if you use like
cardboard<00:05:01.730> like<00:05:01.790> firmly<00:05:02.530> like<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.590> cardboard

cereal box or something and you wouldn't

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.060 
cereal box or something and you wouldn't
need<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.690> do<00:05:07.930> that<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.230> can<00:05:08.560> do<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.830> all<00:05:08.920> at

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
need to do that you can do it all at

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.450 
need to do that you can do it all at
once<00:05:09.250> I<00:05:09.690> went<00:05:10.690> ahead<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:11.020> let<00:05:11.320> my<00:05:11.590> hummingbird

more than that and that made it dry
enough<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:30.070> I<00:05:30.160> can<00:05:30.310> go<00:05:30.460> back<00:05:30.670> and<00:05:30.850> finish

the tail after that it needs obviously

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.670

ideas<00:06:05.760> wasn't<00:06:06.760> being<00:06:07.450> real<00:06:07.660> picky<00:06:07.990> about<00:06:08.020> it

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
ideas wasn't being real picky about it

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.670 
ideas wasn't being real picky about it
but<00:06:08.650> I<00:06:08.680> think<00:06:08.800> he<00:06:09.010> came<00:06:09.190> out<00:06:09.400> okay<00:06:09.820> again<00:06:10.680> it's

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
but I think he came out okay again it's

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.650 
but I think he came out okay again it's
not<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.890> piece<00:06:12.160> of<00:06:12.190> art<00:06:12.460> or<00:06:12.610> anything<00:06:13.030> because<00:06:13.480> I

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
not a piece of art or anything because I

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.800 
not a piece of art or anything because I
was<00:06:14.170> trying<00:06:14.740> to<00:06:14.890> make<00:06:15.070> it<00:06:15.220> quickly<00:06:15.730> but<00:06:16.720> you

was trying to make it quickly but you

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.330 
was trying to make it quickly but you
certainly<00:06:17.020> could<00:06:17.410> if<00:06:17.650> you<00:06:17.830> happen<00:06:18.220> to<00:06:18.250> be

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
certainly could if you happen to be

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.220

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
careful and get those colors the way

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.470

they<00:06:23.410> should<00:06:23.470> be<00:06:23.650> and<00:06:23.980> then<00:06:24.550> I<00:06:24.730> wanted<00:06:25.270> a

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
they should be and then I wanted a

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.600 
they should be and then I wanted a
little<00:06:25.930> bit<00:06:26.110> of<00:06:26.170> iridescent<00:06:26.800> because

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
little bit of iridescent because

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.160 
little bit of iridescent because
hummingbirds<00:06:28.270> without<00:06:28.630> it<00:06:28.810> just<00:06:28.990> seemed<00:06:29.140> kind

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
hummingbirds without it just seemed kind

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.770 
hummingbirds without it just seemed kind
of<00:06:29.410> silly<00:06:29.940> metallic<00:06:30.940> paint<00:06:31.240> would<00:06:31.480> have<00:06:31.600> been

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
of silly metallic paint would have been

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.590 
of silly metallic paint would have been
perfect<00:06:32.320> but<00:06:32.410> I<00:06:32.560> didn't<00:06:32.920> have<00:06:33.100> any<00:06:33.340> so<00:06:34.000> I<00:06:34.030> used

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
perfect but I didn't have any so I used

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.190 
perfect but I didn't have any so I used
some<00:06:34.750> metallic<00:06:35.710> wax<00:06:36.340> that<00:06:36.820> I<00:06:36.850> had<00:06:37.690> on<00:06:38.140> hand

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
some metallic wax that I had on hand

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.530 
some metallic wax that I had on hand
probably<00:06:39.040> for<00:06:39.220> three<00:06:39.370> or<00:06:39.520> four<00:06:39.730> years<00:06:40.000> I<00:06:40.240> have

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
probably for three or four years I have

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.140 
probably for three or four years I have
no<00:06:40.810> idea<00:06:41.170> where<00:06:41.350> I<00:06:41.380> got<00:06:41.620> these<00:06:41.880> but<00:06:42.880> it<00:06:42.970> seemed

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
no idea where I got these but it seemed

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.980 
no idea where I got these but it seemed
to<00:06:43.270> work<00:06:43.390> okay

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
to work okay

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.190 
to work okay
I<00:06:44.020> still<00:06:44.860> think<00:06:45.040> though<00:06:45.250> that<00:06:45.460> metallic<00:06:45.880> paint

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
I still think though that metallic paint

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.590 
I still think though that metallic paint
would<00:06:46.560> have<00:06:46.650> worked<00:06:46.830> better<00:06:47.150> so<00:06:48.150> he's<00:06:48.360> all

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
would have worked better so he's all

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.660 
would have worked better so he's all
done<00:06:48.870> and<00:06:49.290> took<00:06:49.560> a<00:06:49.590> few<00:06:49.860> hours<00:06:49.920> and<00:06:50.520> I<00:06:50.610> think

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
done and took a few hours and I think

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.950 
done and took a few hours and I think
he's<00:06:50.910> kind<00:06:51.120> of<00:06:51.210> fun<00:06:51.390> it<00:06:51.540> could<00:06:51.660> have<00:06:51.780> done<00:06:51.930> a

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
he's kind of fun it could have done a

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.630 
he's kind of fun it could have done a
whole<00:06:52.260> lot<00:06:52.500> of<00:06:52.530> them<00:06:52.770> if<00:06:52.950> I'd<00:06:53.100> really<00:06:53.370> been<00:06:53.520> in
