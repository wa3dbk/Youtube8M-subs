the Texas rig is also the Carolina rig
so<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> demonstrate<00:00:42.140> how<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> do

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
so we're going to demonstrate how to do

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
so we're going to demonstrate how to do
the<00:00:43.410> Texas<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.370> got<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.090> fishing

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the Texas right here so got my fishing

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.459 
the Texas right here so got my fishing
line<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:48.020> I've<00:00:49.020> got<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:50.219> your<00:00:51.469> standard

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
line here I've got just your standard

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.220 
line here I've got just your standard
hook<00:00:52.890> here<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.920> also<00:00:56.219> need<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
hook here and then you also need a

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.349 
hook here and then you also need a
bullet<00:00:58.230> weight<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.879> call<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.180> bolt

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
bullet weight it's what I call it bolt

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
bullet weight it's what I call it bolt
way<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:00.600> look<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.199> bullet<00:01:01.469> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
way they look just like a bullet this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.350 
way they look just like a bullet this
here<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:03.320> half<00:01:04.320> ounce<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:05.150> eighth<00:01:06.150> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
here is half ounce you can get eighth of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.230 
here is half ounce you can get eighth of
an<00:01:06.450> ounce<00:01:06.799> all<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.979> way<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.460> about<00:01:08.939> half

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
an ounce all the way up to about half

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.030 
an ounce all the way up to about half
ounce<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.260> purpose<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> bass

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
ounce for this purpose of the bass

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.450 
ounce for this purpose of the bass
fishing<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:11.549> probably<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:11.880> unique<00:01:13.460> you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
fishing that's probably all unique you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700 
fishing that's probably all unique you
can<00:01:14.610> also<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:15.090> weighted<00:01:15.479> hooks<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.290> here<00:01:16.590> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
can also get weighted hooks this here is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.390 
can also get weighted hooks this here is
a<00:01:17.659> hook<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:19.170> already<00:01:19.380> has<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.220> can

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
a hook that actually already has you can

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.039 
a hook that actually already has you can
see<00:01:20.580> already<00:01:20.700> has<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> weight<00:01:21.299> built<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.840> on

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
see already has the weight built in on

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.480 
see already has the weight built in on
it<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.960> don't<00:01:25.470> particularly<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> use

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
it I I don't particularly like to use

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.830 
it I I don't particularly like to use
these<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.119> find<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> weight<00:01:27.810> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
these because I find that the weight is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
these because I find that the weight is
off<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.619> usually<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.880> know<00:01:32.970> I

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
off a little bit usually you know I

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.280 
off a little bit usually you know I
usually<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> add<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.110> bit<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
usually have to add a little bit of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.020 
usually have to add a little bit of
weight<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.619> these<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.250> about<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> package<00:01:35.909> of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
weight to these here about a package of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
weight to these here about a package of
these<00:01:36.180> years<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.840> they're<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.860> not

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
these years you can see they're just not

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.190 
these years you can see they're just not
quite<00:01:38.220> enough<00:01:38.280> weight<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.939> tie<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:40.049> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
quite enough weight to tie with what you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.690 
quite enough weight to tie with what you
want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> worm<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> water

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
want to have the worm do it in the water

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
want to have the worm do it in the water
so<00:01:43.670> anyway<00:01:44.670> here's<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> end<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> line<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
off is just take your bullet weight and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.889 
off is just take your bullet weight and
you're<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> want<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.689> with

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
you're going to want to put it in with

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.690 
you're going to want to put it in with
the<00:01:51.930> nose<00:01:52.290> first

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.630 

on<00:01:57.700> here<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.630> like<00:02:01.870> that<00:02:02.290> push<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.310> through

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
on here just like that push it through

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.360 
on here just like that push it through
pull<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.410> your<00:02:05.590> weight<00:02:05.800> is<00:02:05.980> just<00:02:06.010> going<00:02:06.280> to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
pull so your weight is just going to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.960 
pull so your weight is just going to
kind<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.640> freely<00:02:07.979> move<00:02:08.979> about<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.310> line<00:02:09.640> like

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
kind of freely move about the line like

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.840 
kind of freely move about the line like
that<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.700> all<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.000> way<00:02:13.120> down<00:02:13.360> here<00:02:14.850> and

water<00:05:23.620> you<00:05:24.550> can<00:05:24.670> see<00:05:24.880> he's<00:05:25.470> fairly<00:05:26.470> straight

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
water you can see he's fairly straight

didn't<00:05:27.460> do<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.550> great<00:05:27.730> job<00:05:27.820> with<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.240> but<00:05:28.450> he's

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
didn't do a great job with it but he's

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.700 
didn't do a great job with it but he's
fairly<00:05:28.780> straight<00:05:29.230> right<00:05:29.440> there<00:05:31.560> that's<00:05:32.560> what

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
fairly straight right there that's what

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.870 
fairly straight right there that's what
