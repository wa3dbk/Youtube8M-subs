locks extensions I was so tempted just

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.830 
locks extensions I was so tempted just

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
now to cut my hair but I thought no I

now to cut my hair but I thought no I
should<00:00:13.349> film<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.950> video<00:00:14.219> first<00:00:14.759> because<00:00:15.450> how

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
should film this video first because how

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.519 
should film this video first because how
my<00:00:16.170> hair<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.949> kind<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.490> why<00:00:18.180> they<00:00:19.140> blend<00:00:19.410> so

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
my hair is is kind of why they blend so

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.890 
my hair is is kind of why they blend so
well<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.130> if<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.340> cut<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.090> length<00:00:21.300> they

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
well so if I cut it to one length they

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.450 
well so if I cut it to one length they
wouldn't<00:00:22.199> blend<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:22.529> well<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.189> did<00:00:23.340> this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
wouldn't blend as well if I did this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.080 
wouldn't blend as well if I did this

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it just wouldn't wouldn't really work

that is not intentional not this march t
march<00:00:33.870> previous<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.460> last<00:00:35.940> time<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.690> had

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
march previous was the last time I had

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.709 
march previous was the last time I had
my<00:00:37.200> hair<00:00:37.680> bleached<00:00:38.070> by<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.969> first<00:00:39.210> person<00:00:39.600> who

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
my hair bleached by the first person who

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.139 
my hair bleached by the first person who
used<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> bleached<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.500> hair<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.850> just

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
used to bleached my hair and it was just

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
used to bleached my hair and it was just
so<00:00:42.420> harsh<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.079> my<00:00:43.200> hair<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.250> started

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
so harsh on my hair that it started

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.250 
so harsh on my hair that it started
breaking<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> time<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> had<00:00:46.110> these

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
breaking it at the time I had these

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.369 
breaking it at the time I had these
little<00:00:46.620> Tufts<00:00:46.980> my<00:00:47.460> hair<00:00:47.640> has<00:00:47.760> grown<00:00:47.960> out<00:00:48.960> since

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
little Tufts my hair has grown out since

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.920 
little Tufts my hair has grown out since
then<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.800> has<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.190> snapped<00:00:50.610> off<00:00:50.850> at<00:00:51.600> any

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
then and has not snapped off at any

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.709 
then and has not snapped off at any
higher<00:00:52.199> length<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> shows<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.059> new

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
higher length so it shows that the new

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
higher length so it shows that the new
bleach<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.170> use<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.910> doing<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> has

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
bleach I use and what I was doing it has

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.849 
bleach I use and what I was doing it has
made<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> difference<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.559> wear<00:00:58.710> my

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
made a difference when I wear my

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.680 
made a difference when I wear my
extensions<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.609> usually<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.359> hair<00:01:00.660> down

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
extensions I usually put my hair down

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.330 
extensions I usually put my hair down
the<00:01:00.899> middle<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.289> bring<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.590> forward<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:02.280> I

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the middle and bring it forward or I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.969 
the middle and bring it forward or I
sweep<00:01:03.149> my<00:01:03.180> hair<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> side<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> don't

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
sweep my hair or to the side so I don't

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.620 
sweep my hair or to the side so I don't
have<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> worry<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> back<00:01:06.360> look

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630

have to worry about how the back look
and<00:01:06.930> back<00:01:07.710> looks<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.360> sure<00:01:09.860> my

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860

and back looks because I'm not sure my
hair<00:01:11.070> looks<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.549> great<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.390> just

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
how I hide that I have done an

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.039 
how I hide that I have done an
installation<00:01:16.049> video<00:01:16.350> showing<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
installation video showing how I do the

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.630 
installation video showing how I do the
standard<00:01:19.049> steps<00:01:19.320> as<00:01:19.650> my<00:01:19.799> hair<00:01:19.979> got<00:01:20.070> longer<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
standard steps as my hair got longer I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.910 
standard steps as my hair got longer I
then<00:01:20.850> did<00:01:21.060> change<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> put<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> extensions

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
then did change how I put the extensions

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.640 
then did change how I put the extensions
in<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.460> that's<00:01:24.000> how<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:25.020> first<00:01:25.229> step<00:01:25.530> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
in and that's how I do my first step of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.520 
in and that's how I do my first step of
the<00:01:25.950> superior<00:01:26.400> set<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:28.290> made<00:01:28.500> sure

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the superior set so I have made sure

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.069 
the superior set so I have made sure
I've<00:01:28.920> brushed<00:01:29.159> my<00:01:29.880> hair<00:01:30.180> fruit<00:01:30.720> I've<00:01:30.900> also

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
I've brushed my hair fruit I've also
brushed<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.650> extensions<00:01:32.130> through<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.939> use

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
brushed my extensions through and I use

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.819 
brushed my extensions through and I use
a<00:01:33.180> tangle<00:01:33.659> teezer<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.500> quite<00:01:34.680> like

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
a tangle teezer just so it's quite like

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.999 
a tangle teezer just so it's quite like
gentle<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.570> extensions<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.829> are

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
gentle we are the extensions they are

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.660 
gentle we are the extensions they are
really<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.939> thick<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.320> first<00:01:40.710> step<00:01:41.400> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
really really thick so the first step is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.690 
really really thick so the first step is
the<00:01:42.479> set<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.990> changed<00:01:43.680> from<00:01:43.920> how<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> originally

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the set I changed from how I originally

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.749 
the set I changed from how I originally
put<00:01:45.090> them<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.890> grow<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.399> our

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
put them in so we want to grow all our

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.530 
put them in so we want to grow all our
hair<00:01:48.409> go<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.329> loads<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.780> pulling<00:01:52.140> down

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540
