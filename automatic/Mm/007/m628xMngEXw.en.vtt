00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that if you look at the cover and you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.510

they<00:01:26.460> understand<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.080> gets<00:01:28.229> warmer

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
a certain lifestyle I mean you know

a certain lifestyle I mean you know
obviously<00:05:20.340> these<00:05:20.880> pictures<00:05:21.300> are<00:05:21.720> doing<00:05:22.710> just

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
obviously these pictures are doing just

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.800

more than making you hungry and I think

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
like you are above the rest of the world

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.150 
like you are above the rest of the world
in<00:05:33.600> some<00:05:33.810> way<00:05:33.960> I<00:05:33.990> know<00:05:34.260> that<00:05:34.470> sounds<00:05:34.710> silly<00:05:34.860> but

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
in some way I know that sounds silly but

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.600 
in some way I know that sounds silly but
you<00:05:35.280> know<00:05:35.370> if<00:05:35.430> you<00:05:35.550> look<00:05:35.670> at<00:05:35.850> some<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.390> more

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
you know if you look at some of the more

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.070 
you know if you look at some of the more
the<00:05:38.610> word<00:05:38.730> populists<00:05:39.300> food<00:05:39.570> magazines

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
the word populists food magazines

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.690 
the word populists food magazines
whether<00:05:40.260> it's<00:05:40.470> rachael<00:05:40.830> ray<00:05:40.980> or<00:05:41.190> Paula<00:05:41.400> Deen's

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
whether it's rachael ray or Paula Deen's

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.100 
whether it's rachael ray or Paula Deen's
magazine<00:05:42.270> I<00:05:42.300> mean<00:05:42.480> there's<00:05:42.600> nothing<00:05:42.720> in<00:05:42.990> there

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
magazine I mean there's nothing in there

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.810 
magazine I mean there's nothing in there
that<00:05:43.170> resembles<00:05:43.920> these<00:05:44.100> kind<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.430> pictures

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
that resembles these kind of pictures

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.160 
that resembles these kind of pictures
and<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.060> think<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.360> reason<00:05:45.510> for<00:05:45.870> that<00:05:45.900> is<00:05:46.140> that

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
and I think the reason for that is that

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.900 
and I think the reason for that is that
most<00:05:46.650> working<00:05:47.070> people<00:05:47.100> just<00:05:47.610> want<00:05:47.700> to<00:05:47.820> get

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
most working people just want to get

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.950 
most working people just want to get
home<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.210> make<00:05:48.330> dinner<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.660> they're<00:05:48.840> not

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
home and make dinner and they're not

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.670 
home and make dinner and they're not
looking<00:05:49.320> for<00:05:49.650> this<00:05:50.600> sort<00:05:51.600> of<00:05:51.750> escape<00:05:52.320> to

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
looking for this sort of escape to

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.840 
looking for this sort of escape to
another<00:05:52.770> world<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.430> think<00:05:53.580> people<00:05:53.670> who

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
another world and I think people who

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.020 
another world and I think people who
read<00:05:54.000> gourmet<00:05:54.390> are<00:05:54.540> sort<00:05:54.810> of<00:05:54.900> trying<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:56.040> enter

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
read gourmet are sort of trying to enter

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.210 
read gourmet are sort of trying to enter
a<00:05:57.060> different<00:05:57.300> sphere<00:05:58.050> of<00:05:58.080> existence<00:05:58.440> sort<00:05:59.130> of

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
a different sphere of existence sort of

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.250 
a different sphere of existence sort of
trying<00:05:59.460> to<00:05:59.580> elevate<00:05:59.970> themselves<00:06:00.450> in<00:06:00.900> some<00:06:01.110> way

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
trying to elevate themselves in some way

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.470 
trying to elevate themselves in some way
and<00:06:01.470> I<00:06:01.860> think<00:06:02.070> that's<00:06:02.220> part<00:06:02.490> of<00:06:02.580> hormuz<00:06:03.120> appeal

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
and I think that's part of hormuz appeal

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.030 
and I think that's part of hormuz appeal
I<00:06:03.510> think<00:06:03.810> that's<00:06:03.930> why<00:06:04.080> refresh<00:06:04.650> was<00:06:04.920> the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
I think that's why refresh was the

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.930 
I think that's why refresh was the
editor-in-chief<00:06:05.400> because<00:06:06.210> she<00:06:06.390> has<00:06:06.540> such<00:06:06.690> a

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
editor-in-chief because she has such a

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.760 
editor-in-chief because she has such a
pedigree<00:06:08.940> and<00:06:09.210> I<00:06:09.330> think<00:06:09.660> that<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:10.620> know

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
pedigree and I think that you know

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.500 
pedigree and I think that you know
gourmet<00:06:11.190> is<00:06:11.250> a<00:06:11.340> lot<00:06:11.490> like<00:06:11.670> The<00:06:11.790> New<00:06:11.940> Yorker<00:06:12.330> in

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
gourmet is a lot like The New Yorker in

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.870 
gourmet is a lot like The New Yorker in
the<00:06:13.020> sense<00:06:13.260> that<00:06:13.380> I<00:06:13.920> think<00:06:14.340> people<00:06:14.520> who<00:06:14.730> read

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
the sense that I think people who read

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.460 
the sense that I think people who read
it<00:06:15.030> feel<00:06:15.300> like<00:06:15.420> it<00:06:15.540> elevates<00:06:15.960> them<00:06:16.170> in<00:06:16.290> some

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
it feel like it elevates them in some

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.760 
it feel like it elevates them in some
way<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:16.650> I<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.010> you<00:06:17.490> know<00:06:17.550> as<00:06:17.730> much<00:06:17.850> as<00:06:17.910> I<00:06:18.150> I

way and I and you know as much as I I

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.750 
way and I and you know as much as I I
personally<00:06:19.770> don't<00:06:20.190> like<00:06:20.310> to<00:06:20.460> think<00:06:20.580> of<00:06:20.670> myself

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
personally don't like to think of myself

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.940 
personally don't like to think of myself
as<00:06:21.120> a<00:06:21.180> snob<00:06:21.480> I<00:06:21.780> often<00:06:22.230> do<00:06:22.530> you<00:06:22.560> feel<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:22.800> little
