just start anywhere and by all means

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.690 
just start anywhere and by all means
please<00:02:51.880> don't<00:02:52.880> start<00:02:53.269> at<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.599> end<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:55.280> if<00:02:55.459> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.610 
where is the right place to start at is
it<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:02.930> perhaps<00:03:03.849> proportions<00:03:04.849> or<00:03:05.860> Anatomy

it with perhaps proportions or Anatomy
unfortunately<00:03:09.620> no<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.760> think<00:03:11.480> all<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.720> these

unfortunately no I think all of these

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.599 
unfortunately no I think all of these
places<00:03:12.410> are<00:03:12.889> wrong<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.989> was<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.410> recommend

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
places are wrong if I was to recommend

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.059 
places are wrong if I was to recommend
one<00:03:16.609> place<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.299> start<00:03:17.600> at<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:18.200> very<00:03:18.230> best

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
one place to start at the very best

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.580 
one place to start at the very best
place<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:20.030> wouldn't<00:03:20.450> even<00:03:20.540> be<00:03:20.750> part<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.440> the

human<00:03:21.920> body<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:23.209> home<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:24.010> definitely<00:03:25.010> tell

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
human body and home I definitely tell

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.809 
human body and home I definitely tell
you<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.880> stay<00:03:26.120> away<00:03:26.150> from<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:27.519> instead<00:03:28.519> I

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
you to stay away from that instead I

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.289 
you to stay away from that instead I
tell<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.959> start<00:03:30.230> with<00:03:30.440> primitives<00:03:31.299> you

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
tell you to start with primitives you

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.660 
tell you to start with primitives you
know<00:03:32.480> those<00:03:32.690> cool<00:03:33.049> mathematical<00:03:33.920> things<00:03:34.250> like

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
know those cool mathematical things like

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.550 
know those cool mathematical things like
cubes<00:03:35.239> spheres<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.650> cylinders<00:03:38.560> awesome

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
cubes spheres and cylinders awesome

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.280 
cubes spheres and cylinders awesome
right

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.509 

all<00:03:42.819> sarcasm<00:03:43.819> aside<00:03:44.049> there<00:03:45.049> are<00:03:45.319> many<00:03:45.709> many

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
all sarcasm aside there are many many

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.020 
all sarcasm aside there are many many
benefits<00:03:46.640> for<00:03:47.510> starting<00:03:48.019> out<00:03:48.200> here<00:03:48.700> first<00:03:49.700> it

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
benefits for starting out here first it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.929 
benefits for starting out here first it
will<00:03:50.180> get<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.569> thinking<00:03:51.110> and<00:03:51.319> drawing<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.250> 3d

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
will get you thinking and drawing in 3d

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.250 
will get you thinking and drawing in 3d
because<00:03:53.769> even<00:03:54.769> though<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.129> canvas<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:56.000> 2d<00:03:56.599> the

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
because even though the canvas is 2d the

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.420 
because even though the canvas is 2d the
thing<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:57.860> are<00:03:58.010> drawing<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.849> still<00:03:59.269> 3d

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
thing that you are drawing is still 3d

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
thus if your mind isn't thinking in

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.640 
thus if your mind isn't thinking in
those<00:04:04.040> terms<00:04:04.549> then<00:04:04.970> your<00:04:05.599> drawings<00:04:06.200> are<00:04:06.319> going

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
those terms then your drawings are going

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.890 
those terms then your drawings are going
to<00:04:06.739> reflect<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.430> they're<00:04:08.239> going<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.659> be

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
to reflect that they're going to be

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.270 
to reflect that they're going to be
two-dimensional<00:04:09.680> flat<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.549> boring<00:04:12.280> second

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
it will teach you about space and volume

before you even start drawing I can
almost<00:04:33.710> guarantee<00:04:34.160> your<00:04:35.030> end<00:04:35.300> result<00:04:35.840> will

almost guarantee your end result will

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.120 
almost guarantee your end result will
look<00:04:36.289> better<00:04:37.060> why<00:04:38.080> because<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.110> division<00:04:40.010> of

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
look better why because that division of

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.370 
look better why because that division of
space<00:04:40.400> will<00:04:41.150> let<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.419> focus<00:04:41.660> on<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.960> small

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
space will let you focus on a small

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.740 
space will let you focus on a small
aspect<00:04:42.979> of<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.460> picture<00:04:43.880> rather<00:04:44.389> than<00:04:44.539> the

aspect of the picture rather than the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.339 
aspect of the picture rather than the
whole<00:04:45.580> third<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.910> just<00:04:47.510> easier<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.020> draw

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
whole third it's just easier to draw

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.700 
whole third it's just easier to draw
primitives<00:04:48.979> than<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:49.580> is<00:04:49.729> humans<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.710> that

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
primitives than it is humans and that

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.270 
primitives than it is humans and that
alone<00:04:52.280> makes<00:04:52.669> it<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:53.030> better<00:04:53.300> starting<00:04:53.840> point

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
alone makes it a better starting point
