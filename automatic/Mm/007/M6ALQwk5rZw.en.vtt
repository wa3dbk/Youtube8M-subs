leader on the ground makes a decision
this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.509> where<00:00:15.719> they<00:00:15.809> want<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.920> go

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this is where they want to do they go

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.769 
this is where they want to do they go
ahead<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.310> set<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> houses<00:00:18.180> up<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.630> then

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
ahead and set the houses up and then

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.810 
ahead and set the houses up and then
they<00:00:19.170> execute<00:00:19.920> their<00:00:20.070> operations

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.050 

so<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.850> inside<00:00:27.600> right<00:00:27.930> now<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> Italian<00:00:28.890> COC<00:00:29.820> or

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
phosphorus you have a loom that's the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.280 
phosphorus you have a loom that's the
flares<00:01:10.800> that<00:01:11.120> basically<00:01:12.120> pop<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.930> it'll<00:01:13.080> do

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
flares that basically pop what it'll do

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.080 
flares that basically pop what it'll do
is<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:13.650> light<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.810> an<00:01:15.930> entire

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
is it will light up you know an entire

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
is it will light up you know an entire
area<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.990> mean<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.260> you<00:01:19.710> can

area like this I mean you can you can

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710 
area like this I mean you can you can
see<00:01:20.010> a<00:01:20.040> huge<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.210> turning<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
see a huge it's like turning on the
