00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:10.940
 hello everyone today we will be flashing 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.940
 android 4 2 2 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.920
 Similarly, in principle, all Chinese are sewn 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.550
 Now let's look at 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.869
 but here's a Chinese model 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.240
 fitch tees one mini 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.240
 this is a copy of personally sevan 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:41.690
 we need flash tool for firmware 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.449
 is it there that software through what you will sew 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:52.219
 and necessary 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:53.390
 the firmware itself we still need the phone itself 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.329
 and 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.329
 and beating the cable 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.299
 To start, go to the flashlight folder 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 we start flashtool 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.020
 so we need to sing the file open the skate 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.020
 showing 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:37.659
 here the file will be in the folder 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:44.159
 with our software we see mtk 6572 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:47.729
 android sketch has text resolution and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.729
 click open 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:02:02.200
 we see a list of what we will sew 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:07.200
 road recovery system cache and then 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 then go to the boot device 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.580
 click and click on the button up 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:19.760
 volume and press the power button 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.510
 wait until the unit will go into the mode 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.510
 fastboot 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.170
 Gridin logged in 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.530
 Next, connect the micro usb cable to 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.530
 the apparatus 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.130
 no longer 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.240
 I wrote it 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.069
 you did say 2000 there 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.520
 but there would come a question I only 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.520
 not the same 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.819
 I 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.150
 minutes 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.060
 my 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:31.580
 so then we have to do wipe 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.680
 delete all memory 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.519
 clear all the memory you need to go to 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.269
 In this case, the recovery in this Chinese 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.900
 you must first go to the folder we clamp 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:51.620
 button increase sound up and 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.620
 press the power button hold 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.660
 go to the recovery button up 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:11.160
 have chosen 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:16.200
 press the button down wait click on 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:20.040
 power button and drown recovery 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:28.500
 we need to do wipe data factory 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:35.060
 reset button up descend remove 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.060
 all memory button up 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:57.130
 next do like we delete everything after 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.130
 what can I download? 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.280
 the phone restarts 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:16.250
 all these seven 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:20.080
 zastavochku refreshed all was well

 Komono 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.230
 perhaps it will be necessary the principle given 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:33.020
 case used for any chinese 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:35.390
