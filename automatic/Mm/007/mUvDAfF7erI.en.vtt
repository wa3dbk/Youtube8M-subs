how it came out the factory pre-molded

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.620 
how it came out the factory pre-molded

do rust and mud and dust are probably

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.540 
do rust and mud and dust are probably
best<00:03:13.550> in<00:03:13.760> them<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.269> that'll<00:03:15.019> torn<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:16.400> or

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
best in them and that'll torn that or

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.090 
best in them and that'll torn that or
torn<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.060> edges<00:03:17.360> down<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.600> bit<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.110> it'll<00:03:18.890> put

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
torn the edges down a bit and it'll put

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.580

a bit of fit wear and tear on it even

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.350 
a bit of fit wear and tear on it even
further<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:23.660> that's<00:03:23.900> that's<00:03:24.500> how<00:03:25.360> it

and<00:03:32.900> let<00:03:33.080> us<00:03:33.110> say<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:34.010> trucks<00:03:34.310> need

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
and let us say that the trucks need

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.740 
and let us say that the trucks need
paint<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.030> open

king<00:04:23.820> tag<00:04:24.090> so<00:04:24.360> I'll<00:04:24.450> probably<00:04:24.690> do<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:25.169> one

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
king tag so I'll probably do it as one

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.500 
king tag so I'll probably do it as one
of<00:04:25.380> those<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:28.710> that's<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:30.540> our<00:04:30.979> paint<00:04:31.979> job

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
of those so that's for our paint job

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.969 
of those so that's for our paint job
using<00:04:33.919> three<00:04:35.270> one<00:04:36.270> two<00:04:36.540> three<00:04:36.570> different<00:04:37.410> home

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
so it's not working as bad as it did in

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 
it's been repaired on the top as I said

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.659 
it's been repaired on the top as I said
that<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.020> villain<00:05:03.289> didn't<00:05:03.500> figures<00:05:03.800> they

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
that the villain didn't figures they

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.429 
that the villain didn't figures they
just<00:05:04.909> loosely<00:05:05.180> put<00:05:05.569> in<00:05:06.069> that<00:05:07.069> all<00:05:07.280> painted<00:05:07.699> up

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:08.439 
just loosely put in that all painted up

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.689 
just loosely put in that all painted up
detailed<00:05:09.439> you<00:05:09.530> can<00:05:09.560> see<00:05:09.860> he's<00:05:10.009> got<00:05:10.189> the<00:05:10.400> flare

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
detailed you can see he's got the flare

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.119 
detailed you can see he's got the flare
pistol<00:05:10.879> in<00:05:11.120> his<00:05:11.210> hand<00:05:11.270> there<00:05:11.919> which<00:05:12.919> he's

broken<00:05:13.430> down<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:14.060> he's<00:05:14.750> in<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:14.990> process<00:05:15.409> of

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
broken down and he's in the process of

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.559 
broken down and he's in the process of
putting<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.800> carriage<00:05:16.189> in<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.430> so<00:05:17.419> he'll

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
putting the carriage in it so he'll

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.839

two figures if I do after open the two

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
front hatches up the two figures we'll

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.980 
front hatches up the two figures we'll
all<00:05:39.979> stripped<00:05:40.389> the<00:05:41.389> turning<00:05:41.840> of<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:41.990> turret

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
all stripped the turning of the turret

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
these Jerry Jerry comes these old rooms

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.529 
these Jerry Jerry comes these old rooms
positioned<00:05:48.439> in<00:05:48.560> such<00:05:48.590> a<00:05:48.800> way<00:05:49.099> that<00:05:49.360> that's<00:05:50.360> the

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
positioned in such a way that that's the

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.119 
positioned in such a way that that's the
best<00:05:50.750> place<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.110> can<00:05:51.259> put<00:05:51.289> them<00:05:51.620> without<00:05:51.800> them

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:52.129 
best place I can put them without them

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.390 
best place I can put them without them
interfering<00:05:52.819> with<00:05:53.509> the<00:05:53.629> turret<00:05:53.839> rotation<00:05:54.400> so

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
interfering with the turret rotation so

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.790 
interfering with the turret rotation so
that's<00:05:55.669> how<00:05:55.909> they'll<00:05:56.120> probably<00:05:56.419> sit<00:05:56.900> when<00:05:57.770> I

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
that's how they'll probably sit when I

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.829 
that's how they'll probably sit when I
permanently<00:05:58.400> fix<00:05:58.610> them<00:05:58.789> on<00:05:58.940> I'll<00:05:59.629> probably

00:05:59.829 --> 00:05:59.839 
permanently fix them on I'll probably

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.059 
permanently fix them on I'll probably
just<00:06:00.069> tie<00:06:01.069> them<00:06:01.279> on<00:06:01.430> with<00:06:02.060> some<00:06:02.240> scale<00:06:02.569> rock

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:03.069 
just tie them on with some scale rock

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:04.990 
just tie them on with some scale rock
because<00:06:04.069> that's<00:06:04.250> probably<00:06:04.430> what<00:06:04.729> they<00:06:04.849> did

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
because that's probably what they did

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.550 
because that's probably what they did
just<00:06:05.240> tie<00:06:06.050> them<00:06:06.199> off<00:06:06.490> and<00:06:07.490> as<00:06:07.580> I<00:06:07.669> said<00:06:07.940> I'm

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
just tie them off and as I said I'm

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.159 
just tie them off and as I said I'm
probably<00:06:09.560> going<00:06:09.800> to<00:06:09.889> invest<00:06:10.250> in<00:06:10.400> some<00:06:10.610> thick

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
probably going to invest in some thick

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.019 
probably going to invest in some thick
weathering<00:06:12.169> powders<00:06:12.860> and<00:06:13.009> weathering<00:06:13.699> pins

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:14.029 
weathering powders and weathering pins

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.079 
weathering powders and weathering pins
to<00:06:14.240> put<00:06:14.419> the<00:06:14.509> rust<00:06:14.690> and<00:06:14.960> fake<00:06:15.860> wood<00:06:16.159> and<00:06:16.909> stuff

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.089 
to put the rust and fake wood and stuff

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:30.870 
to put the rust and fake wood and stuff
like<00:06:17.270> that

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.450 

[Applause]

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.450 

so<00:06:38.460> there's<00:06:39.289> the<00:06:40.289> main<00:06:40.499> big<00:06:40.770> job<00:06:41.069> the<00:06:41.249> paint

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
so there's the main big job the paint

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.749 
so there's the main big job the paint
job<00:06:41.669> but<00:06:41.849> to<00:06:41.939> doom<00:06:42.089> now<00:06:42.740> so<00:06:43.740> it's<00:06:43.979> just<00:06:44.219> the

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
job but to doom now so it's just the

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.909 
job but to doom now so it's just the
best<00:06:44.939> part<00:06:45.270> which<00:06:45.990> i<00:06:46.169> think<00:06:46.229> is<00:06:46.439> the<00:06:46.469> best<00:06:46.680> part

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
best part which i think is the best part

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.749 
best part which i think is the best part
is<00:06:47.069> to<00:06:47.159> accessorize<00:06:47.639> it<00:06:48.529> so<00:06:49.529> he's<00:06:50.399> waiting<00:06:50.610> for

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
is to accessorize it so he's waiting for

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.379 
is to accessorize it so he's waiting for
small<00:06:51.149> bits<00:06:51.330> and<00:06:51.419> pieces<00:06:51.719> to<00:06:51.990> come<00:06:53.119> and<00:06:54.119> that

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
small bits and pieces to come and that

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.559 
small bits and pieces to come and that
would<00:06:54.509> be<00:06:54.599> video<00:06:55.309> number<00:06:56.309> we<00:06:56.849> are<00:06:56.969> now<00:06:57.119> this

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:57.569 
would be video number we are now this

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.229 
would be video number we are now this
will<00:06:57.930> be<00:06:58.020> video
