 minority sport this when so 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.239
 come a team like the villarreal is 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.910
 very good when with things like these 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.379
 like the villarreal that comes here makes 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.010
 what is it when it grows more like 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.010
 as a sport 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.720

 then Spanish seeing strong when 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.170
 very good I think a pretty 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.479
 experience I learned a little and to be able 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.250
 get on the tatami and give us some 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.140
 classes and being able to hit him a bit has been 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.140
 pretty well received 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.040
