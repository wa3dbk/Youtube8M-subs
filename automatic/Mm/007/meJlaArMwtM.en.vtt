00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.299
 the sun has already been hidden in the city 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.090

 Great stores while Carlos and Lorena 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 they say the wet sidewalks after a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 afternoon of fun and streaks his footsteps 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.189
 resonate between the buildings according to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.890
 they are walking through the abandoned streets 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.620
 the puddles on the floor reflect how 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 dead eyes the glare of the lanterns 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.920
 crackling was amazing when 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.110
 they came to boot us in a boat you saw like 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.670
 I threw my last and then flash 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.960

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.510
 we 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.910
 and we escaped suddenly you killed a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.160
 enemy because he had approached 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:00.410
 katarina of pure luck with returned 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.789
 to charge after leaving the cybercafÃ© 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.580
 Carlos accompanied his girlfriend Lorraine the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.020
 door of your house as usual 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.600
 after staying talking a good 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.460
 Lorraine says goodbye explaining that 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
 That night he must stay at home taking care of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.660
 to his little brothers 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.730
 I have to enter Carlos my parents 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.170
 they are going to dinner and I have to stay 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.229
 to take care of my brothers 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.380
 and if there are carlos or illusions 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.170
 you know I can not make you pass yes 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.070
 I already know pretty later I'll call you if yes 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.869
 I love you too when returning 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.630
 Carlos decides to take a shortcut by the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.299
 path of the old stone bridge the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 night the tiles have fallen squarely 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.100
 Frosts are lost in the thick fog 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.110
 while a desolate wind speaks to them 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.270
 the wolves in their language 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.210
 it might be so cold all of a sudden 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.600
 the ungainly figure of Carlos is drawn 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.410
 above the bridge he suddenly wants 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.410
 listen to something 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.920
 Blood was hovering uncertainly Frosting 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.930
 the head by the railing of the bridge their 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.080
 eye can see a silhouette at 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.709
 banks of the river is a woman dressed 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.709
 long 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.470
 Carlos' eyes remain fixed on 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.800
 the strange figure can not believe what 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 is slowly looking at the eyes 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.190
 bright of the woman turn to give 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.300
 with yours 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.310
 Carlos remains as hypnotized only the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.780
 heartbreaking voice that promises to prepare your 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.780
 brain makes it come back to itself 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.910
 Carlos fled in terror in search of a 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.450
 any door that protects you from 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.450
 spectrum
