00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.570 
question Lance let's talk about the lids
and<00:04:24.780> see<00:04:24.930> how<00:04:25.050> these<00:04:25.260> wings<00:04:25.530> work<00:04:25.800> we're

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
and see how these wings work we're

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.130 
and see how these wings work we're
pretty<00:04:26.790> proud<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.180> these<00:04:27.300> we<00:04:27.750> call<00:04:27.930> them<00:04:28.050> or

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
pretty proud of these we call them or

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.990 
pretty proud of these we call them or
cut<00:04:28.350> them<00:04:28.380> hide<00:04:29.160> your<00:04:29.310> lift<00:04:29.490> overheads

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
cut them hide your lift overheads

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.090 
cut them hide your lift overheads
they're<00:04:30.750> aluminum<00:04:31.020> frame<00:04:31.500> with<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.800> ABS

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
they're aluminum frame with the ABS

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.340 
they're aluminum frame with the ABS
shell<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.630> wire<00:04:33.810> mesh<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:34.260> you

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
shell and the in the wire mesh so you

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.200 
shell and the in the wire mesh so you
can<00:04:34.500> still<00:04:34.740> attach<00:04:34.950> any<00:04:35.250> type<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.550> vegetation

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
can still attach any type of vegetation

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.600 
can still attach any type of vegetation
or<00:04:36.600> camouflage<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.500> want<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.070> but<00:04:38.580> really

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
or camouflage you want to it but really

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.490 
or camouflage you want to it but really
what<00:04:38.940> makes<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.270> work<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.960> C<00:04:40.169> shaped

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
what makes it work is the C shaped

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.830 
what makes it work is the C shaped
armature<00:04:41.220> here<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.790> we've<00:04:41.940> attached<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
armature here that we've attached the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.470 
armature here that we've attached the
hydraulic<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.250> what<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.640> allows<00:04:45.240> this

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
hydraulic to and what that allows this

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.670 
hydraulic to and what that allows this
overhead<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.169> do<00:04:46.350> is<00:04:46.740> rotate<00:04:47.690> 270<00:04:48.690> degrees<00:04:49.080> so

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
overhead to do is rotate 270 degrees so

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.010 
overhead to do is rotate 270 degrees so
you<00:04:49.770> can<00:04:50.070> bring<00:04:50.490> them<00:04:50.610> down<00:04:51.330> into<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.720> hunting

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
you can bring them down into a hunting

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.860 
you can bring them down into a hunting
position<00:04:52.590> we've<00:04:53.220> got<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.630> unique<00:04:54.630> magnetic

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
position we've got a unique magnetic

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.940 
position we've got a unique magnetic
catch<00:04:55.470> that's

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
catch that's

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.310 
catch that's
these<00:04:56.310> are<00:04:56.460> adjusting<00:04:56.850> enjoy<00:04:57.120> yeah<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:58.170> then

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
these are adjusting enjoy yeah and then

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.860 
these are adjusting enjoy yeah and then
all<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.650> have<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.920> do<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.250> break<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:00.060> contact

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
all you have to do is break that contact

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.350 
all you have to do is break that contact
so<00:05:01.710> just<00:05:01.950> touch<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.670> goes<00:05:02.820> watch<00:05:03.150> it

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
so just touch it and it goes watch it

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.200 
so just touch it and it goes watch it
hands-free<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:04.650> we<00:05:05.130> like<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:05.880> take<00:05:06.060> our

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
hands-free so we like to just take our

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.630 
hands-free so we like to just take our
guns<00:05:06.390> and<00:05:06.600> push<00:05:07.350> up<00:05:07.530> on<00:05:07.710> them<00:05:07.890> yeah<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.520> is

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640
