00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.860 

in<00:00:01.250> this<00:00:01.730> video<00:00:02.060> I'm<00:00:02.450> going<00:00:02.600> to<00:00:02.690> talk<00:00:02.840> about

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870 
in this video I'm going to talk about

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.280 
in this video I'm going to talk about
the<00:00:03.260> brainstem<00:00:04.299> brain<00:00:05.979> stem<00:00:07.810> and<00:00:08.810> we<00:00:08.930> briefly

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
the brainstem brain stem and we briefly

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.750 
the brainstem brain stem and we briefly
discussed<00:00:09.380> the<00:00:09.890> brain<00:00:10.070> stem<00:00:10.310> when<00:00:10.550> we<00:00:10.670> are

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
discussed the brain stem when we are

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.040 
discussed the brain stem when we are
talking<00:00:11.090> about<00:00:11.120> the<00:00:11.390> structure<00:00:11.690> of<00:00:11.840> the

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
talking about the structure of the

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.870 
talking about the structure of the
nervous<00:00:12.200> system<00:00:12.380> as<00:00:12.740> a<00:00:12.770> whole<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.550> recall<00:00:13.820> that

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
nervous system as a whole so recall that

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.029 
nervous system as a whole so recall that
the<00:00:14.150> brainstem<00:00:14.660> is<00:00:14.720> right<00:00:15.080> around<00:00:15.230> here<00:00:15.830> and

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
the brainstem is right around here and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.100 
the brainstem is right around here and
if<00:00:16.219> we<00:00:16.279> look<00:00:16.460> at<00:00:16.550> our<00:00:16.609> larger<00:00:17.210> drawing<00:00:17.780> of<00:00:18.020> the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
if we look at our larger drawing of the

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.450 
if we look at our larger drawing of the
central<00:00:18.470> nervous<00:00:18.590> system<00:00:18.770> this<00:00:19.250> is<00:00:19.430> the

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
central nervous system this is the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.520 
central nervous system this is the
brainstem<00:00:20.000> right<00:00:20.240> here<00:00:20.510> and<00:00:20.780> the<00:00:21.140> brainstem

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
brainstem right here and the brainstem

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.350 
brainstem right here and the brainstem
connects<00:00:21.980> basically<00:00:22.430> all<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.910> parts<00:00:23.150> of<00:00:23.270> the

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
connects basically all the parts of the

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.359 
connects basically all the parts of the
nervous<00:00:23.539> system<00:00:23.720> together<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.920> brainstem

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
nervous system together so the brainstem

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.120 
nervous system together so the brainstem
connects<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.030> cerebrum<00:00:26.720> on<00:00:26.990> top<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:27.710> it

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
connects the cerebrum on top and it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.700 
connects the cerebrum on top and it
connects<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.610> spinal<00:00:29.060> cord<00:00:29.420> below<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:30.289> it

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
connects the spinal cord below and it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.710 
connects the spinal cord below and it
connects<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.190> cerebellum<00:00:31.940> which<00:00:32.419> is<00:00:32.570> behind

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
connects the cerebellum which is behind

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.960 
connects the cerebellum which is behind
the<00:00:32.930> brainstem<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.100> brainstem<00:00:34.579> also

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
the brainstem the brainstem also

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.870 
the brainstem the brainstem also
connects<00:00:35.329> most<00:00:35.810> of<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.440> cranial<00:00:37.070> nerves

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
connects most of the cranial nerves

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.960 
connects most of the cranial nerves
you<00:00:38.510> just<00:00:38.660> write<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.020> over<00:00:39.079> here<00:00:39.970> cranial

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
you just write that over here cranial

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.630 
you just write that over here cranial
nerves<00:00:41.500> so<00:00:42.500> here's<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.770> different<00:00:42.920> image<00:00:43.430> of

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
nerves so here's a different image of

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.850 
nerves so here's a different image of
the<00:00:43.790> brain<00:00:44.030> looking<00:00:44.600> at<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.870> from<00:00:44.989> below<00:00:45.230> so

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
the brain looking at it from below so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.590 
the brain looking at it from below so
here's<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.219> cerebrum<00:00:46.880> here's<00:00:47.329> the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
here's the cerebrum here's the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.020 
here's the cerebrum here's the
cerebellum<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.500> here's<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.100> brainstem<00:00:49.640> and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
cerebellum and here's the brainstem and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.940 
cerebellum and here's the brainstem and
all<00:00:50.329> these<00:00:50.540> little<00:00:50.780> stringy<00:00:51.260> things<00:00:51.590> coming

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
all these little stringy things coming

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.010 
all these little stringy things coming
out<00:00:52.040> are<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.399> cranial<00:00:52.969> nerves<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.629> most<00:00:53.870> of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
out are the cranial nerves and most of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.780 
out are the cranial nerves and most of
them<00:00:54.170> are<00:00:54.290> coming<00:00:54.410> out<00:00:54.649> of<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.829> brainstem<00:00:55.280> so

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
them are coming out of the brainstem so

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.459 
them are coming out of the brainstem so
we'll<00:00:55.940> come<00:00:56.120> back<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:56.450> in<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.780> minute<00:00:56.930> but

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
we'll come back to that in a minute but

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.260 
we'll come back to that in a minute but
basically<00:00:57.890> because<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.610> brainstem<00:00:59.090> is

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
basically because the brainstem is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.880 
basically because the brainstem is
connecting<00:00:59.750> all<00:00:59.960> these<00:01:00.200> other<00:01:00.379> parts<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
connecting all these other parts of the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.190 
connecting all these other parts of the
nervous<00:01:01.039> system<00:01:01.190> together<00:01:01.789> its<00:01:02.390> Anatomy<00:01:02.960> is

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
nervous system together its Anatomy is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.890 
nervous system together its Anatomy is
complex<00:01:03.829> there's<00:01:04.399> a<00:01:04.519> lot<00:01:04.850> going<00:01:05.239> on<00:01:05.360> in<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
complex there's a lot going on in the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.450 
complex there's a lot going on in the
brainstem<00:01:06.380> even<00:01:06.860> though<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.190> fairly

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
brainstem even though it's a fairly

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.490 
brainstem even though it's a fairly
small<00:01:07.610> structure<00:01:08.540> it's<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.140> little

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
small structure it's just this little

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500 
small structure it's just this little
guy<00:01:09.619> right<00:01:09.920> here<00:01:10.280> but<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:10.760> does<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:10.909> lot<00:01:11.180> of

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
guy right here but it does a lot of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.270 
guy right here but it does a lot of
things<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.350> let's<00:01:12.560> take<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.740> look<00:01:12.920> at<00:01:13.070> some

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
things so let's take a look at some

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.430 
things so let's take a look at some
sections<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:14.180> look<00:01:14.299> inside<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.960> brain<00:01:15.140> stem

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
sections to look inside the brain stem

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.010 
sections to look inside the brain stem
so<00:01:15.890> recall<00:01:16.159> that<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:16.549> top<00:01:16.909> part<00:01:17.210> up<00:01:17.420> here<00:01:17.450> is

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
so recall that this top part up here is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.140 
so recall that this top part up here is
called<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.619> midbrain<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.549> middle<00:01:19.850> part<00:01:20.060> is

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
called the midbrain this middle part is

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.510 
called the midbrain this middle part is
called<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.510> pons<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:21.710> lower<00:01:22.070> part<00:01:22.340> is

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
called the pons in this lower part is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.250 
called the pons in this lower part is
called<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.880> medulla<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:23.720> now<00:01:23.869> let's<00:01:24.080> take

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
called the medulla so now let's take

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260 
called the medulla so now let's take
some<00:01:24.460> sections<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:25.640> let's<00:01:25.820> pretend<00:01:25.970> we're

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
some sections so let's pretend we're

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.420 
some sections so let's pretend we're
cutting<00:01:26.750> through<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.290> midbrain<00:01:27.650> right<00:01:28.040> here

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
cutting through the midbrain right here

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.950 
cutting through the midbrain right here
and<00:01:28.610> we're<00:01:29.000> going<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.180> look<00:01:29.299> at<00:01:29.509> it<00:01:29.630> from<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
and we're going to look at it from the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.440 
and we're going to look at it from the
top<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.650> over<00:01:30.950> here<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.460> would<00:01:31.640> be<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.820> section

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
top so over here this would be a section

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.880 
top so over here this would be a section
of<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.659> midbrain<00:01:33.970> midbrain<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.740> when<00:01:36.740> we're

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
of the midbrain midbrain and when we're

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.410 
of the midbrain midbrain and when we're
looking<00:01:37.159> down<00:01:37.189> on<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.549> from<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.820> top<00:01:38.060> it's

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
looking down on it from the top it's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.090 
looking down on it from the top it's
kind<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.720> got<00:01:38.840> these<00:01:38.990> big<00:01:39.259> parts<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.890> stick

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
kind of got these big parts that stick

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.740 
kind of got these big parts that stick
out<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.400> front<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.210> some<00:01:41.600> little

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
out the front of it and some little

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.450 
out the front of it and some little
bumps<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.409> back<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.040> don't<00:01:43.280> worry<00:01:43.430> about

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
bumps on the back and don't worry about

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.310 
bumps on the back and don't worry about
the<00:01:43.700> names<00:01:43.880> of<00:01:44.090> any<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.299> those<00:01:44.479> right<00:01:44.750> now<00:01:44.780> and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
the names of any of those right now and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.230 
the names of any of those right now and
then<00:01:45.710> if<00:01:45.799> we<00:01:45.920> take<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.159> section<00:01:46.820> through<00:01:47.060> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
then if we take a section through the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.630 
then if we take a section through the
pons<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.200> if<00:01:48.320> we<00:01:48.439> cut<00:01:48.680> through<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.009> pons<00:01:49.220> like

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
pons so if we cut through the pons like

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.580 
pons so if we cut through the pons like
this<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.360> we<00:01:50.450> look<00:01:50.630> down<00:01:50.659> at<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.020> pons<00:01:51.259> from

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
this and we look down at the pons from

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.499 
this and we look down at the pons from
the<00:01:51.710> top<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.310> would<00:01:52.520> be<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.850> view<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.420> a

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
the top this would be a view of a

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.240 
the top this would be a view of a
section<00:01:53.900> of<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.110> pons<00:01:54.350> let<00:01:54.829> me<00:01:54.920> just<00:01:55.100> write

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
section of the pons let me just write

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.969 
section of the pons let me just write
that<00:01:55.540> ponds<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:56.869> it's<00:01:57.140> got<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:57.409> really<00:01:57.649> big

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
that ponds and it's got this really big

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.069 
that ponds and it's got this really big
part<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.520> sticks<00:01:58.759> out<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:58.970> front<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.600> then

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
part that sticks out the front and then

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.719 
part that sticks out the front and then
let's<00:02:00.320> take<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.530> section<00:02:00.860> here<00:02:01.310> through<00:02:01.610> the

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
let's take a section here through the

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.429 
let's take a section here through the
medulla<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.420> let's<00:02:02.899> cut<00:02:03.140> through<00:02:03.290> the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
medulla and let's cut through the

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.289 
medulla and let's cut through the
medulla<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.009> look<00:02:04.189> at<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.460> from<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.759> top<00:02:04.790> and

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
medulla and look at it from the top and

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.389 
medulla and look at it from the top and
that<00:02:05.450> would<00:02:05.630> be<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.930> guy<00:02:06.020> right<00:02:06.170> here<00:02:06.920> so

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
that would be this guy right here so

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.959 
that would be this guy right here so
this<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.850> medulla<00:02:09.069> medulla<00:02:10.069> or<00:02:10.279> medulla<00:02:10.849> I

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:10.969 
this is the medulla medulla or medulla I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.699 
this is the medulla medulla or medulla I
hear<00:02:11.209> people<00:02:11.480> say<00:02:11.659> it<00:02:11.779> both<00:02:11.930> ways<00:02:12.169> and<00:02:12.499> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
hear people say it both ways and the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.410 
hear people say it both ways and the
medulla<00:02:12.980> has<00:02:13.219> kind<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.609> different<00:02:13.730> shape

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
medulla has kind of a different shape

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.420 
medulla has kind of a different shape
so<00:02:14.599> each<00:02:14.840> each<00:02:15.109> one<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.590> these<00:02:15.709> three<00:02:16.069> main

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
so each each one of these three main

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.039 
so each each one of these three main
divisions<00:02:16.939> of<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.090> brainstem<00:02:17.540> has<00:02:17.719> a<00:02:17.750> little

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
divisions of the brainstem has a little

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.289 
divisions of the brainstem has a little
bit<00:02:18.109> of<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.290> different<00:02:18.650> shape<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.519> inside<00:02:20.060> of

bit of a different shape the inside of
the<00:02:20.359> brainstem<00:02:20.840> has<00:02:21.109> some<00:02:21.319> similarities<00:02:22.040> to

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
the brainstem has some similarities to

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.459 
the brainstem has some similarities to
the<00:02:22.310> spinal<00:02:22.609> cord<00:02:22.760> particularly<00:02:23.750> down<00:02:23.959> low<00:02:24.230> in

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
the spinal cord most of the gray matter

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.819 
the spinal cord most of the gray matter
of<00:02:31.159> the<00:02:31.430> brainstem<00:02:32.329> is<00:02:32.599> on<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.870> inside<00:02:33.049> and

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
of the brainstem is on the inside and

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.709 
of the brainstem is on the inside and
most<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.760> white<00:02:34.969> matter<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.569> brain

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:35.719 
most of the white matter of the brain

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.080 
most of the white matter of the brain
stem<00:02:36.139> is<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.439> the<00:02:36.560> outside<00:02:36.980> but<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:37.879> a<00:02:37.939> lot

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
stem is on the outside but it's a lot

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.849 
stem is on the outside but it's a lot
more<00:02:38.239> mixed<00:02:38.719> together<00:02:39.049> than<00:02:39.379> it<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.769> the

leaving the brainstem through cranial
nerves<00:07:05.889> to<00:07:06.069> perform<00:07:06.430> motor<00:07:06.729> functions<00:07:07.330> and

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 
nerves to perform motor functions and

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.330 
nerves to perform motor functions and
then<00:07:07.990> in<00:07:08.110> this<00:07:08.259> drawing<00:07:08.529> they're<00:07:08.919> showing

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
then in this drawing they're showing

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.489 
then in this drawing they're showing
sensory<00:07:10.180> information<00:07:10.389> coming<00:07:10.840> in<00:07:11.319> through

now<00:07:17.319> these<00:07:17.529> cranial<00:07:17.860> nerves<00:07:18.340> are<00:07:18.550> mostly

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:18.909 
now these cranial nerves are mostly

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:21.300 
now these cranial nerves are mostly
performing<00:07:19.539> these<00:07:19.659> functions<00:07:19.800> in<00:07:20.800> the<00:07:20.889> head

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
performing these functions in the head

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.230 
performing these functions in the head
and<00:07:21.610> the<00:07:21.699> neck

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
and the neck

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.059 
and the neck
let<00:07:22.389> me<00:07:22.479> just<00:07:22.719> mark<00:07:22.960> that<00:07:23.229> in<00:07:23.409> on<00:07:23.560> our<00:07:23.680> person

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:24.069 
let me just mark that in on our person

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.159 
let me just mark that in on our person
over<00:07:24.279> here<00:07:24.310> but<00:07:24.909> there<00:07:25.060> are<00:07:25.090> a<00:07:25.240> few<00:07:25.629> cranial

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:26.169 
over here but there are a few cranial

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.290 
over here but there are a few cranial
nerves<00:07:26.409> that<00:07:26.740> actually<00:07:27.219> travel<00:07:28.029> from<00:07:28.210> the

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.300 
nerves that actually travel from the

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.089 
nerves that actually travel from the
brainstem<00:07:28.779> all<00:07:29.020> the<00:07:29.139> way<00:07:29.229> down<00:07:29.439> into<00:07:29.710> the<00:07:29.889> body

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:30.099 
brainstem all the way down into the body

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.969 
brainstem all the way down into the body
and<00:07:30.430> perform<00:07:31.120> functions<00:07:31.990> in<00:07:32.259> the<00:07:32.379> trunk<00:07:32.710> and

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979 
and perform functions in the trunk and

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:35.459 
and perform functions in the trunk and
in<00:07:33.099> the<00:07:33.219> limbs<00:07:33.490> some<00:07:34.270> examples<00:07:34.839> of<00:07:35.080> cranial

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:35.469 
in the limbs some examples of cranial

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:37.980 
in the limbs some examples of cranial
nerve<00:07:35.650> functions<00:07:36.159> include<00:07:36.689> sensation<00:07:37.689> of<00:07:37.839> the

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
nerve functions include sensation of the

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.519 
nerve functions include sensation of the
face<00:07:38.259> and<00:07:38.589> movements<00:07:39.490> of<00:07:39.610> the<00:07:39.729> eyes<00:07:39.930> face<00:07:40.930> jaw

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:41.529 
face and movements of the eyes face jaw

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:43.559 
face and movements of the eyes face jaw
and<00:07:41.860> throat<00:07:42.219> in<00:07:42.639> addition<00:07:43.210> to<00:07:43.270> influencing

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:43.569 
and throat in addition to influencing

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:46.110 
and throat in addition to influencing
organs<00:07:44.229> like<00:07:44.409> the<00:07:44.469> heart<00:07:44.620> and<00:07:45.129> the<00:07:45.490> intestines

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 
organs like the heart and the intestines

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.059 
organs like the heart and the intestines
so<00:07:46.870> there's<00:07:47.050> a<00:07:47.110> lot<00:07:47.319> going<00:07:47.349> on<00:07:47.770> with<00:07:47.979> the

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:48.069 
so there's a lot going on with the

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.429 
so there's a lot going on with the
brainstem<00:07:48.550> and<00:07:48.849> I<00:07:48.879> think<00:07:49.089> I'll<00:07:49.210> stop<00:07:49.479> here<00:07:49.930> and

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:50.439 
brainstem and I think I'll stop here and

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:52.110 
brainstem and I think I'll stop here and
in<00:07:50.589> later<00:07:50.830> videos<00:07:51.189> we<00:07:51.400> can<00:07:51.550> spend<00:07:51.759> some<00:07:51.849> more

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 
in later videos we can spend some more

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.790 
in later videos we can spend some more
time<00:07:52.180> going<00:07:52.689> into<00:07:52.900> some<00:07:53.050> of<00:07:53.080> the<00:07:53.199> details<00:07:53.589> of

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 
time going into some of the details of

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.990 
time going into some of the details of
the<00:07:53.919> different<00:07:54.250> structures<00:07:54.520> and<00:07:54.729> the

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 
the different structures and the

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.459 
the different structures and the
different<00:07:55.330> functions<00:07:55.719> of<00:07:55.839> the<00:07:55.900> brain<00:07:56.169> stem

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:56.469 
different functions of the brain stem

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:58.800 
different functions of the brain stem
but<00:07:56.979> I<00:07:57.039> just<00:07:57.219> want<00:07:57.399> to<00:07:57.490> introduce<00:07:57.639> it<00:07:58.180> and<00:07:58.419> give

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810 
but I just want to introduce it and give

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.179 
but I just want to introduce it and give
you<00:07:58.930> a<00:07:58.960> feel<00:07:59.259> for<00:07:59.289> all<00:07:59.649> the<00:07:59.830> different<00:08:00.159> things

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:00.189 
you a feel for all the different things

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:02.849 
you a feel for all the different things
it<00:08:00.610> does
