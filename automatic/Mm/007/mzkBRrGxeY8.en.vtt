made a decision someone looked at a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.610 
made a decision someone looked at a
microbe<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.719> thought<00:00:42.899> he<00:00:43.320> could<00:00:43.350> use<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
microbe and thought he could use a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350 
microbe and thought he could use a
longer<00:00:43.890> flagella<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.850> pair<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> pincers

of<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.570> ocean<00:00:48.860> then<00:00:49.860> someone<00:00:50.370> decided<00:00:50.399> he

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of the ocean then someone decided he

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
of the ocean then someone decided he
should<00:00:50.969> hit<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.329> beach<00:00:53.690> land<00:00:54.690> creatures<00:00:55.260> were

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
should hit the beach land creatures were

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.410 
should hit the beach land creatures were
born<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.370> homeland<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> dicey

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
born but my homeland is a dicey

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.130 
born but my homeland is a dicey
proposition

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
proposition

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.440 
proposition
so<00:00:59.770> someone<00:01:00.309> looked<00:01:00.460> at<00:01:00.520> our<00:01:00.640> hero<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.239> said

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
so someone looked at our hero and said

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.880 
so someone looked at our hero and said
he<00:01:01.780> needs<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:02.110> be<00:01:02.200> able<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.530> defend<00:01:02.649> himself

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
he needs to be able to defend himself

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.280 
he needs to be able to defend himself
and<00:01:04.050> voila<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.240> saying<00:01:07.390> goes<00:01:07.570> if<00:01:08.110> you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
and voila as the saying goes if you

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.649 
and voila as the saying goes if you
can't<00:01:08.560> beat<00:01:08.800> them<00:01:08.830> eat<00:01:09.820> them<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:13.150> survival

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
can't beat them eat them but survival

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.630 
can't beat them eat them but survival
depends<00:01:14.020> on<00:01:14.080> numbers<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.920> someone<00:01:15.280> made<00:01:15.490> our

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
depends on numbers so someone made our

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.460 
depends on numbers so someone made our
little<00:01:15.880> champs<00:01:16.180> irresistible<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.350> the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
little champs irresistible to the

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.560 
little champs irresistible to the
opposite<00:01:17.890> sex<00:01:19.650> now<00:01:20.650> we're<00:01:21.070> talking<00:01:21.580> or<00:01:22.060> mating

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
opposite sex now we're talking or mating

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.160 
opposite sex now we're talking or mating
as<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.020> case<00:01:23.200> may<00:01:23.350> be

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
as the case may be

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530 
as the case may be
of<00:01:25.680> course<00:01:25.979> our<00:01:26.220> strength<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.759> numbers<00:01:26.790> but

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
of course our strength in numbers but

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:36.450 
of course our strength in numbers but
their<00:01:27.720> strength<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.170> shop<00:01:28.500> weaponry<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.520 

ironically<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:37.700> led<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:37.940> what<00:01:38.150> we<00:01:38.270> call

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
ironically this led to what we call

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.550 
ironically this led to what we call
civilization<00:01:40.330> but<00:01:41.330> civilization<00:01:41.750> meant<00:01:42.380> more

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
civilization but civilization meant more

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.670 
civilization but civilization meant more
competition<00:01:43.310> for<00:01:43.460> just<00:01:43.760> about<00:01:43.880> everything

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
competition for just about everything

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.110 
competition for just about everything
happily<00:01:45.680> someone<00:01:46.040> pulled<00:01:46.280> our<00:01:46.430> species<00:01:46.820> aside

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
happily someone pulled our species aside

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.090 
happily someone pulled our species aside
and<00:01:47.300> said<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:47.960> guys<00:01:48.140> need<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.410> chill<00:01:48.500> out<00:01:48.920> and

unify this planet so they did they built

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.400 
unify this planet so they did they built
starships<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.150> they<00:01:59.540> set<00:01:59.840> out<00:01:59.870> to<00:02:00.140> conquer

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
starships and they set out to conquer

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.850 
starships and they set out to conquer
the<00:02:00.710> galaxy

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
the galaxy

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.130 
the galaxy
but<00:02:03.490> what<00:02:03.670> they<00:02:03.850> never<00:02:04.120> realized
