00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.230
 the bowker jigsaws are 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.869
 suitable for jobs that require 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 precision or special curvatures in 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.770
 Wood sheets or metal parts are 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.110
 ideal for intermittent jobs like 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.390
 the manufacture of furniture works in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.690
 vulcan hita or terminations in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.600
 agglomerated these jigsaws have a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.790
 Cut oscillation control which 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.430
 facilitates work by moving the blade 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.650
 with a pendular movement they also have 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.079
 a trigger with ignition interlock 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.800
 which allows the continuous use of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 jigsaw includes a base of support 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.070
 adjustable with ability to lean 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.160
 up to 45 degrees for cuts in vittel is 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.310
 important to note that the axes of these 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.100
 Jigsaws are mounted 100% on 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.920
 bearings which makes them much more 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 efficient and durable than those that are 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.520
 mounted on bushings a jig saw 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.130
 like this one 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.310
 ideal for works in plates of 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.380
 wood up to 65 millimeters and in 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.530
 metal sheets up to 6 mm 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.770
 instead a jig saw like this 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.439
 of much greater power is ideal for 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.530
 works on wooden boards up to 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.189
 80 millimeters and can make cuts in 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.959
 metal sheets up to 8 millimeters 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.920
 all saws have a handle 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:50.709
 ergonomic non-slip and 4 positions 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.760
 of pendular movement protective of the 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:59.220
 Quick-fit insert sheet 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.770
 allen key aluminum base 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.740
 parallel stop 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.709
 vacuum cleaner adapter 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.010
 and also has double insulation 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.400
 electric and to be even easier its 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.800
 work some models have a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.739
 practice looks laser and led light for good 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.069
 illuminate the cutting area or project your 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.170
 address make sure you use the sheet 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.500
 suitable according to the type of material 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.920
 cut when you buy the sheet, look at the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.769
 type of connection they have there are two 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.480
 types of grip the baker saws have 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.940
 this type 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.599
 It is very important that the cutting blade 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.280
 is well attached to the tool a 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.209
 once the leaf is anchored 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.220
 try pulling it once and then 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.530
 perform a functional test at 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.530
 empty before beginning the work 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.280
 when cutting metal do not forget to use a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.160
 suitable lubricant on the blade 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.620
 cut by scattering it over it or over 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.950
 the material that you are cutting if the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.560
 sierra bounces or jumps while 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.420
 making the cut change the sheet by 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.930
 one of finest teeth 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.190
 do not forget to use your glasses 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.670
 safety and your gloves during the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.670
 work 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.530
 never use this tool under the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.760
 rain and verify that always the 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.980
 connection is in optimal 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.319
 terms 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.099
 do not forget to always clean your 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.500
 tools once used with this 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.720
 type of saws in particular you should 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.659
 pay special attention to not 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.560
 misaligns the laser sight if this reaches 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.200
 occur 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.470
 do not forget to visit your technical service

 this tool either saws 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:11.849
 keys or coals you must visit your
