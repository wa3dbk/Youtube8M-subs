 sailing in small boats that flow 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.339

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.149
 create a new world and let's see to see 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.920
 Let's see what's in here guys 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.920
 what is the impressiveness of this seed 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.280
 what happened to me a subscriber so good 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.280
 You appear in a forest, it's cool 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.969
 and sheep out there there are dogs over here 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.750
 appears next to an advanced scale 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.810
 okay that's pretty cool you're next 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.840
 of some pumpkins important to mention 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.429
 and nothing guys 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.719
 if we move 200 blocks towards z 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:42.890
 accept 2 100 500 or so let's go 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.319
 to a site of the best so we're going to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.659
 go guys going to freak out because it's something 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.780
 amazing the creation of these parts 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.000
 of this world so as soon as I get in the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.240
 gender you will see what I was talking about 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.760
 you see very well that there is a stronghold worth 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.570
 but you see there is a stain 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.470
 there is a consort mashup of stronghold 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.380
 Well, it can be good, you can understand 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.010
 but that is mother of god guys is 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.930
 continued all the time the same thing 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.020
 burrada de chicks most of the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.590
 generation that is side by side 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.470
 and as you can see if carcaixent what happens is 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.420
 that the trunks there are many break 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.540
 therefore you have to explore in 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.340
 masses at incredible speeds so that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.870
 to be able to collect everything there is not 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.570
 paula is that they break with the creation 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.780
 of the map so here you see there was 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.600
 bread and boys and gas and as you see here 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.120
 there are already more parts and more parts and more 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.880
 parts and good to tell you that there 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.030
 pretty weird generation around here in 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.940
 typical plan flying paths on the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.500
 Nava lakes or trunks broken by all 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.989
 parts that you have to pick up in time 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.390
 record because if not the blunders and good 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.360
 what about having a stronghold here next 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.519
 it's something incredible but it's that this is not 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.140
 it ends far from here, so 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.840
 let's go around here around here 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.560

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.500
