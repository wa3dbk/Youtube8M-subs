00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
place in the deep south which could be

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.810 
place in the deep south which could be
very<00:01:57.840> very<00:01:58.229> cool<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.280> could<00:01:59.610> mean

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
very very cool because that could mean

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.760
