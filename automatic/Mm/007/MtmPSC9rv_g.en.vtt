00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.410
 hello today will not need 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.360
 to wait for the rain off the sun 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.119
 to see a rainbow since you're going 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.980
 create it in a cake with me go 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.539
 you have looked at the ingredients and we are 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.560
 found immediately in the kitchen for 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.560
 do some magic finally 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.780
 first step I started by separate 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.780
 the whites of the egg yolks 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.290
 I wish the egg yolks with the 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.530
 sugar until the mixture 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.530
 whitens 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.600
 and lukewarm water 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.410
 I mix the flour with the yeast and 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.979
 I will add all the flour in my 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.979
 preparation I ride the whites in snow 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.830
 the joust one end of the whites in the 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.830
 preparation to relax them 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.860
 I divide the dough into four we tried 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.030
 to have the same proportions and I have 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.830
 now colored each with a 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.830
 different color in red 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.920
 antwerp in blue 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.290
 and in zone 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.680
 I'm my role is now I'm going 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.730
 put a spoon of each paw 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.020
 one after the other 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.220
 but before ending 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.270
 preheat to 170 ° so we really put 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.270
 the dough in the center 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.500
 I advise you to take dyes 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.940
 which are a bit powerful so some 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.709
 powdered dyes or dyes 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.209
 angel for the simple and very good 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.840
 reason it takes colors well 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.280
 pétantes 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.050
 and yes by baking the colors has 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.730
 for a long time it does not read so if you want 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.959
 really bright colors all 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.090
 bleaching investment really 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.400
 nice, all you have left is 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.060
 bake this wonder for 35 to 40 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.530
 minutes of cooking 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.170
 it only remains to cut out the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.970
 wonder that is stupid uncooled to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.530
 very quickly of art this roulette for 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.530
