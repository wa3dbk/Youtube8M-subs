okay next we have file guides they come
in<00:00:10.410> four<00:00:10.740> degrees<00:00:11.719> let's<00:00:12.719> take<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.139> two

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
in four degrees let's take the two

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.589 
in four degrees let's take the two
degree<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.769> example<00:00:14.000> this<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.179> our<00:00:15.330> pro

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
we have three types of files okay we

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:47.709 
we have three types of files okay we
call<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.739> cut<00:00:39.110> 11<00:00:40.430> okay<00:00:43.430> cut<00:00:44.430> 14<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.300> medium

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
call this a cut 11 okay cut 14 or medium

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.090 
call this a cut 11 okay cut 14 or medium
cut<00:00:48.719> 16<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.800> fine<00:00:51.050> okay<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
cut 16 or fine okay and what that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.439 
cut 16 or fine okay and what that
indicates<00:00:54.410> 11<00:00:55.410> 14<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.280> 16<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.329> my

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
indicates 11 14 and 16 the one in my

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.250 
indicates 11 14 and 16 the one in my
hand<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.500> were<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.859> take<00:00:59.780> if<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.870> were<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
hand if we were to take if we were to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.429 
hand if we were to take if we were to
measure<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.460> exactly<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.449> centimeter<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
measure out exactly one centimeter and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.399 
measure out exactly one centimeter and
count<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.010> teeth<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.869> centimeter

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
count the teeth in that one centimeter

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.740 
count the teeth in that one centimeter
we<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.340> 16<00:01:08.850> teeth<00:01:09.240> per<00:01:09.960> centimeter

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
we would have 16 teeth per centimeter

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
we would have 16 teeth per centimeter
obviously<00:01:12.750> 14<00:01:13.290> teeth<00:01:13.560> per<00:01:13.799> centimeter<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.729> 11

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
obviously 14 teeth per centimeter and 11

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.039 
obviously 14 teeth per centimeter and 11
teeth<00:01:18.240> per<00:01:18.450> centimeter

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
teeth per centimeter

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
teeth per centimeter
obviously<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> coarsest<00:01:22.759> all<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
obviously the coarsest all of the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.690 
obviously the coarsest all of the
shorter<00:01:24.600> files<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:25.170> exclusively<00:01:25.920> used<00:01:26.310> on

files are not used on file guides due to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.429 
files are not used on file guides due to
the<00:01:31.890> shape<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> sidecut<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:34.290> the

it's<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.160> important<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.940> get<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it's really important to get get the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.399 
it's really important to get get the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
filings out of the file this increases

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.520 
filings out of the file this increases
the<00:02:04.530> longevity<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:05.130> your<00:02:05.869> of<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:06.930> files<00:02:07.290> and

the longevity of your of your files and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.710 
the longevity of your of your files and
also<00:02:07.680> prevents<00:02:08.250> them<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.600> skipping<00:02:09.600> or
