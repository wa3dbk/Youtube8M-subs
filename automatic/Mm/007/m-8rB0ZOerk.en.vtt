00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.560
 in our certain series of terms 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.320
 and regularities the total itself 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.210
 to deal with extrapolations than with 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.220
 the calculator with broken numbers 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.380
 Of course, something is quite something 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.080
 this is essentially the so-called 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.090
 biggest message in common and that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.189
 smallest common motorists and 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.770
 this complex we want now 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.590
 Just a little more precise 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.390
 watch and then on the basis of a series 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.129
 from examples so piece by piece at us 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.950
 the conceptual protection approach 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.730
 work because that is actually one 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.000
 with an essential requirement for 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.579
 working with breaks for the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.649
 subtraction of the eponymous break 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.440
 especially for that too 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.870
 compare five fractions and for that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.310
 open fractions resp 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.310
 broken little cross between 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 common parts and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 common goal 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:43.770
 it clearly goes in the direction of larger 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.170
 common part or in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.690
 direction least common 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.660
 many times these abbreviations are yes 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.820
 certainly already met 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.490
 and if you read it again or 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.450
 something comes back to our memory 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.610
 would like to share this 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.060
 or together four times the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.920
 ultimately in the largest common tyler 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.160
 or in the smallest common 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 four times end us again piece for 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.070
 piece based on some very simple 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.680
 visualize examples 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.230
 There are numbers that multiply the division 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.380
 numbers are that should be clear 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.380
 neo x we ​​take as a small example 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:45.920
 the common part of the numbers 18 and 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.880
 24 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:54.600
 let's say that first now 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.970
 be presented before it task 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.230
 It is better to do it locally 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.230
 small table work 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.700
 here had the part of 18 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.100
 or under it scribe 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.950
 detail hope 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.940
 24 so think about what numbers now 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.990
 all part on 518 are under know 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.450
 start immediately 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:35.550
 the once the 2 the 34 not five not 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.740
 the 67 do not be careful not no and that 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.830
 continue accordingly, for example 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.520
 betrayed himself and maybe times 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.180
 hint at the back so make appropriate 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.170
 we would be styler 4 324 for the 24 so 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:56.760
 the 1 the 2 the 34 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:04.620
 the five not you six years not 89 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:07.140
 not the twelve we n24 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.100
 Already now, please see this one 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.910
 table and think about which parts 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.310
 Now these two numbers really have 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.540
 together 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.530
 and if you can release the table 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.450
 determine 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:33.870
 aha the six has both the 18 as 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:39.210
 tyler as well as the 24 so common 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:44.790
 In the past, the 236 use everything 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:51.300
 others only give us time 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:53.820
 the six is ​​one of the biggest in this case 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.760
 common share forever now it 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.680
 conclude larger sheet joint 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:04.169
 Tyler I stick with this abbreviation 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.180
 sprechers as completely from 18 and 24 would be 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.590
 In this case , it could also do so 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.400
 from 18 and 24 to show it against 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.249
 which be 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.549
 I would speak now 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:20.869
 the six largest common parts of 

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:22.959
 both would be the 6 a contrary 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:25.999
 example, you could now very easily 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:28.249
 position by taking only a little I take 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:31.129
 now there are 18 on and for example 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:34.099
 the 25 when I was imagining 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:39.619
 werth tyler 25 I am going very fast 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:42.169
 to the result that only the 1 the question 

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:47.449
 would be my thing would be 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:50.119
 the 18 totally alien to the 25 yes 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.129
 So if such a division is not 

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:54.349
 can be found from over 1 speaks 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:57.459
 one also uses the term 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:01.399
 Partly foreign provided one to such 

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:03.169
 simple example now it will 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.899
 Of course airbus evaluated that 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:09.259
 actually guiding the senses 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:12.409
 agreed yet and I give yet 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.119
 Actually, we really want it now 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:17.029
 just reach it 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:20.659
 how cheap the biggest common tyler 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:23.779
 and then how cheap the smallest 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:26.299
 common multi-driver how justified that 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.099
 and then have to say which 

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:30.589
 I can relate between these 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.689
 you two were to make it what good is it 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:35.509
 I still really need that and 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:37.279
 if so what do i need for that 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.009
 and I have to be sure of that 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:43.869
 control so much we go now 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.869
 these purely practical steps over
