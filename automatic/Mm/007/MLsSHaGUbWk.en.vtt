00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
alright if you're unfamiliar with the

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.969 
alright if you're unfamiliar with the
game<00:01:13.540> mechanics<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.170> may<00:01:14.290> think<00:01:14.350> I'm<00:01:14.770> either

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
game mechanics you may think I'm either

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.190 
game mechanics you may think I'm either
really<00:01:15.280> shitty<00:01:15.759> or<00:01:16.030> really<00:01:16.390> drunk<00:01:16.810> when<00:01:17.079> I'm

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
really shitty or really drunk when I'm

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.639 
really shitty or really drunk when I'm
driving<00:01:17.380> this<00:01:17.970> however<00:01:18.970> I'm<00:01:19.329> just<00:01:19.630> doing<00:01:20.200> the

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
driving this however I'm just doing the

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.740 
driving this however I'm just doing the
snaking<00:01:21.310> technique

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
snaking technique

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.430 
snaking technique
if<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.980> send<00:01:24.310> your<00:01:24.430> acceleration<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.720> max<00:01:26.110> and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
if you send your acceleration to max and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.530 
if you send your acceleration to max and
alternate<00:01:27.310> between<00:01:27.430> swerving<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.450> left

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
alternate between swerving to the left

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.410 
alternate between swerving to the left
and<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.050> right<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:30.430> every<00:01:30.760> time<00:01:30.790> you<00:01:31.180> change

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
and the right then every time you change

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.990 
and the right then every time you change
direction<00:01:31.960> you'll<00:01:32.800> accelerate<00:01:33.520> out<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.880> it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
direction you'll accelerate out of it

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.180 
direction you'll accelerate out of it
because<00:01:34.570> that's<00:01:34.900> what<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.470> game<00:01:35.620> does<00:01:35.920> when

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
because that's what the game does when

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.800 
because that's what the game does when
you<00:01:36.280> have<00:01:36.400> my<00:01:36.580> acceleration<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.510> go<00:01:37.630> out<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
you have my acceleration and go out the

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.770 
you have my acceleration and go out the
slide<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.430> if<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.580> just<00:01:39.700> alternate<00:01:40.240> that<00:01:40.450> you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
slide so if you just alternate that you

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.830 
slide so if you just alternate that you
can<00:01:41.020> gain<00:01:41.470> speed<00:01:42.210> some<00:01:43.210> people<00:01:43.450> think<00:01:43.630> it's

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
can gain speed some people think it's

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.140 
can gain speed some people think it's
cheap<00:01:44.290> whatever<00:01:45.250> it's<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.760> game<00:01:45.940> we're

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
cheap whatever it's in the game we're

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:55.970 
cheap whatever it's in the game we're
going<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.360> use<00:01:46.479> it

also<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.560> leave<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.920> course<00:03:32.190> alot<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.730> stop

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
also you leave the course alot to stop

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.660 
also you leave the course alot to stop
that

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
that

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.449 
that
that's<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.540> same<00:03:35.780> interval<00:03:36.740> as<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:37.010> silence

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
that's the same interval as the silence

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:46.050 
that's the same interval as the silence
jumps<00:03:37.849> as<00:03:37.940> well<00:03:38.120> if<00:03:38.240> you'll<00:03:38.330> remember<00:03:38.480> those

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.809 

so<00:03:46.959> yet<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.380> will<00:03:47.500> go<00:03:47.680> into<00:03:47.830> slides<00:03:48.250> all<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
so yet you will go into slides all the

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.120 
so yet you will go into slides all the
time<00:03:49.030> with<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.360> if<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.959> are<00:03:50.230> boosting<00:03:50.920> at

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
time with this if you are boosting at

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.720 
time with this if you are boosting at
all<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:53.290> hit<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.800> controls<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.280> get<00:03:54.520> wall

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
all and you hit the controls to get wall

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.550 
all and you hit the controls to get wall
then<00:03:55.390> you're<00:03:55.569> going<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.870> go<00:03:56.020> into<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.260> slide

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
then you're going to go into a slide

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.740 
then you're going to go into a slide
essentially<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.340> correcting<00:03:58.180> out<00:03:58.330> of<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.599> is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
essentially and correcting out of it is

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.910 
essentially and correcting out of it is
absolutely<00:03:59.290> bitch

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.830 

you<00:04:02.430> basically<00:04:02.610> just<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.270> hold<00:04:03.630> your

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
you basically just have to hold your

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.710 
you basically just have to hold your
line<00:04:04.080> for<00:04:04.620> what<00:04:05.280> about<00:04:05.760> half<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.180> second<00:04:06.569> or<00:04:06.690> so

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
line for what about half a second or so

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.360 
line for what about half a second or so
or<00:04:07.110> else<00:04:07.140> you're<00:04:07.590> just<00:04:07.770> going<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:07.950> continue<00:04:08.040> to

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
or else you're just going to continue to

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:44.159 
or else you're just going to continue to
slide<00:04:08.670> if<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.030> correct<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.420> too<00:04:09.599> early

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.980 

okay<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:44.949> is<00:04:45.069> the<00:04:45.219> third<00:04:45.430> course<00:04:45.810> sand<00:04:46.810> ocean

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
okay this is the third course sand ocean

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.779 
okay this is the third course sand ocean
and<00:04:47.409> we're<00:04:47.620> going<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:47.860> start<00:04:48.310> this<00:04:48.460> one<00:04:48.639> with

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
and we're going to start this one with

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.820 
and we're going to start this one with
an<00:04:48.909> old<00:04:49.029> classic<00:04:49.830> killing<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.949> rival<00:04:52.830> unlike

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
an old classic killing the rival unlike

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.820 
an old classic killing the rival unlike
with<00:04:54.039> X<00:04:54.689> this<00:04:55.689> Grand<00:04:56.020> Prix<00:04:56.259> is<00:04:56.349> actually

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
with X this Grand Prix is actually

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.879 
with X this Grand Prix is actually
remarkably<00:04:57.370> fair<00:04:57.819> all<00:04:58.719> the<00:04:59.110> vehicles<00:04:59.620> that

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
remarkably fair all the vehicles that

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.679 
remarkably fair all the vehicles that
you're<00:05:00.069> racing<00:05:00.580> against<00:05:00.969> don't<00:05:01.300> have<00:05:01.509> any

you're racing against don't have any
sort<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.199> ridiculous<00:05:02.740> supercar<00:05:03.699> advantage

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
sort of ridiculous supercar advantage

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.709 
sort of ridiculous supercar advantage
the<00:05:05.259> rival<00:05:05.740> is<00:05:05.979> a<00:05:06.520> bit<00:05:06.909> better<00:05:07.120> than<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.599> other

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
the rival is a bit better than the other

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.860 
the rival is a bit better than the other
ones<00:05:07.990> but<00:05:08.349> he's<00:05:08.620> still<00:05:09.009> beatable<00:05:09.969> unlike<00:05:10.689> the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
ones but he's still beatable unlike the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.110 
ones but he's still beatable unlike the

which we'll see later are a huge part
for<00:05:52.350> this<00:05:52.500> car<00:05:52.880> you<00:05:53.880> hit<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.210> wall<00:05:54.390> you're

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
for this car you hit the wall you're

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.960 
for this car you hit the wall you're
still<00:05:55.170> sliding<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:55.950> before<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.310> can<00:05:56.670> get<00:05:56.760> out

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
still sliding and before you can get out

still sliding and before you can get out
of<00:05:57.000> it<00:05:57.180> you<00:05:57.330> get<00:05:57.450> the<00:05:57.600> other<00:05:57.720> one<00:05:57.930> so<00:05:58.140> you<00:05:58.200> just

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
of it you get the other one so you just

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.000 
of it you get the other one so you just
end<00:05:58.530> up<00:05:58.620> in<00:05:58.920> balling<00:05:59.310> back<00:05:59.490> and<00:05:59.730> forth<00:06:00.830> this<00:06:01.830> is

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
end up in balling back and forth this is

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.830 
end up in balling back and forth this is
a<00:06:02.070> huge<00:06:02.370> problem<00:06:02.670> in<00:06:03.000> the<00:06:03.090> next<00:06:03.360> level<00:06:03.630> the

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
a huge problem in the next level the

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:15.580 
a huge problem in the next level the
same

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.590 

what<00:06:16.250> I<00:06:16.400> was<00:06:16.550> saying<00:06:16.790> with<00:06:16.940> this<00:06:17.120> one<00:06:17.330> being

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
what I was saying with this one being

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.480 
what I was saying with this one being
more<00:06:18.020> fair<00:06:18.440> than<00:06:18.580> f0x<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.870> computers<00:06:21.530> cannot

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
more fair than f0x the computers cannot

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.360 
more fair than f0x the computers cannot
die<00:06:22.880> without<00:06:23.270> getting<00:06:23.660> attacked<00:06:23.930> on<00:06:24.140> f0x<00:06:24.740> if

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
die without getting attacked on f0x if

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.970 
die without getting attacked on f0x if
you<00:06:25.490> look<00:06:25.640> on<00:06:25.790> the<00:06:25.910> left<00:06:26.050> you'll<00:06:27.050> see<00:06:27.140> that<00:06:27.500> the

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
you look on the left you'll see that the

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.100 
you look on the left you'll see that the
people's<00:06:28.610> fortunes<00:06:28.910> are<00:06:29.330> flashing<00:06:29.810> still

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
people's fortunes are flashing still

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.140 
people's fortunes are flashing still
which<00:06:30.800> means<00:06:31.070> that<00:06:31.190> they<00:06:31.430> have<00:06:31.460> actually

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
which means that they have actually

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.610 
which means that they have actually
taken<00:06:32.390> damage<00:06:34.360> so<00:06:35.360> the<00:06:35.480> computer<00:06:35.780> will<00:06:36.140> often

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
taken damage so the computer will often

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.470 
taken damage so the computer will often
boost<00:06:36.890> itself<00:06:37.370> to<00:06:37.520> death<00:06:37.700> in<00:06:37.880> this<00:06:38.060> which<00:06:38.270> is

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
boost itself to death in this which is

boost itself to death in this which is
much<00:06:39.020> more<00:06:39.290> fair<00:06:39.590> than<00:06:39.620> f-zero<00:06:40.400> x

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:53.469 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:55.510 

services<00:06:54.469> that<00:06:54.620> are<00:06:54.800> flat<00:06:55.069> like<00:06:55.189> this<00:06:55.340> are

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
services that are flat like this are

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.180 
services that are flat like this are
also<00:06:55.639> very<00:06:55.969> difficult<00:06:56.479> to<00:06:56.569> navigate

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
also very difficult to navigate

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.330 
also very difficult to navigate
easier<00:06:58.670> to<00:06:58.970> slide<00:06:59.390> awful<00:06:59.810> it's<00:06:59.960> just<00:07:00.260> not<00:07:01.040> a

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
easier to slide awful it's just not a

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.450 
easier to slide awful it's just not a
flat<00:07:01.730> surface<00:07:02.500> and<00:07:03.500> I<00:07:03.710> like<00:07:03.860> dying<00:07:04.100> at<00:07:04.340> the

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
flat surface and I like dying at the

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.920 
flat surface and I like dying at the
other

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.899 

actually<00:07:07.930> did<00:07:08.349> die<00:07:08.529> on<00:07:08.800> a<00:07:08.830> run<00:07:09.099> prior<00:07:09.400> which<00:07:09.759> I

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:09.909 
actually did die on a run prior which I

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.510 
actually did die on a run prior which I
will<00:07:10.059> show<00:07:10.089> in<00:07:10.389> a<00:07:10.449> second<00:07:11.069> you<00:07:12.069> only<00:07:12.249> get<00:07:12.490> one

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
will show in a second you only get one

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.589 
will show in a second you only get one
extra<00:07:13.449> life<00:07:13.839> on<00:07:14.110> master<00:07:14.620> in<00:07:14.710> this<00:07:14.830> game<00:07:15.599> so

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:16.599 
extra life on master in this game so

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:18.269 
extra life on master in this game so
when<00:07:16.809> I<00:07:16.839> die<00:07:16.960> I'm<00:07:17.319> probably<00:07:17.620> going<00:07:17.860> to<00:07:17.949> put<00:07:18.159> it

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:18.279 
when I die I'm probably going to put it

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:20.790 
when I die I'm probably going to put it
at<00:07:18.460> the<00:07:18.490> end<00:07:18.610> of<00:07:18.789> the<00:07:18.909> video<00:07:19.089> usually<00:07:19.629> also<00:07:20.589> I

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
at the end of the video usually also I

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.320 
at the end of the video usually also I
killed<00:07:21.069> black<00:07:21.249> shadow<00:07:21.550> and<00:07:21.849> went<00:07:21.999> up<00:07:22.120> to<00:07:22.270> a

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
killed black shadow and went up to a

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.659 
killed black shadow and went up to a
first<00:07:22.509> place<00:07:22.809> even<00:07:23.409> though<00:07:23.469> I<00:07:23.499> finished<00:07:23.889> 13<00:07:24.400> I

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669 
first place even though I finished 13 I

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:30.210 
first place even though I finished 13 I
find<00:07:25.240> that<00:07:25.270> entertaining

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:30.220 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.320 

just<00:07:31.030> a<00:07:31.120> dumb<00:07:31.450> death<00:07:31.780> whatever<00:07:32.290> I<00:07:33.090> don't<00:07:34.090> think

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 
just a dumb death whatever I don't think

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.170 
just a dumb death whatever I don't think
I<00:07:34.360> explained<00:07:34.870> it<00:07:34.960> in<00:07:35.050> the<00:07:35.170> previous<00:07:35.530> video<00:07:35.740> you

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
I explained it in the previous video you

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.600 
I explained it in the previous video you
can<00:07:37.180> get<00:07:37.720> an<00:07:37.870> extra<00:07:38.080> life<00:07:38.560> for<00:07:38.980> killing<00:07:39.160> five

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
can get an extra life for killing five

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.320 
can get an extra life for killing five
people<00:07:39.640> in<00:07:40.180> race<00:07:40.680> which<00:07:41.680> is<00:07:41.980> a<00:07:42.460> good<00:07:43.060> strategy

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.330 
people in race which is a good strategy

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.720 
people in race which is a good strategy
but<00:07:43.810> with<00:07:44.170> this<00:07:44.380> vehicle<00:07:44.620> it's<00:07:45.070> not<00:07:45.400> plausible

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.730 
but with this vehicle it's not plausible

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.910 
but with this vehicle it's not plausible
because<00:07:46.210> you'll<00:07:46.450> just<00:07:46.660> go<00:07:47.110> into<00:07:47.380> a<00:07:47.410> side<00:07:47.680> when

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:47.920 
because you'll just go into a side when

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:56.610 
because you'll just go into a side when
you<00:07:48.010> try<00:07:48.160> to<00:07:48.190> attack<00:07:48.550> usually

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:56.620 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.680 

you
