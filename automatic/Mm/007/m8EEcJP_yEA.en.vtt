you don't want to eat okay whether it's
by<00:01:50.070> choice<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.610> necessity<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.540> doesn't

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
by choice or necessity it really doesn't

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.980 
by choice or necessity it really doesn't
matter<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.460> afterwards<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:54.090> feel<00:01:54.420> maybe<00:01:54.750> not

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
matter and afterwards you feel maybe not

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.020 
matter and afterwards you feel maybe not
the<00:01:55.170> best<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> mindset<00:01:56.880> of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the best and you get in the mindset of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.359 
the best and you get in the mindset of
oh<00:01:57.390> well<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.200> over<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:58.560> I'm<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.189> gonna

week and I'll start again on Monday

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.070 
week and I'll start again on Monday
basically<00:02:10.729> what<00:02:10.940> you're<00:02:11.060> doing<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.599> taking<00:02:11.780> an

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
basically what you're doing is taking an

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.949 
basically what you're doing is taking an
all-or-nothing<00:02:12.800> approach<00:02:13.810> there's<00:02:14.810> two

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
all-or-nothing approach there's two

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.660 
all-or-nothing approach there's two
reasons<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.680> isn't<00:02:16.160> really<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.430> good<00:02:16.610> idea

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
reasons this isn't really a good idea

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.390 
reasons this isn't really a good idea
number<00:02:17.420> one<00:02:17.750> because<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.379> more<00:02:18.680> crappy<00:02:19.069> food

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
number one because the more crappy food

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.759 
number one because the more crappy food
you<00:02:19.610> eat<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.330> worst<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.840> are<00:02:20.930> going<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.470> feel

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
you eat the worst you are going to feel

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.369 
you eat the worst you are going to feel
the<00:02:22.670> second<00:02:23.120> reason<00:02:23.239> is<00:02:23.629> because<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.170> going

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
the second reason is because it's going

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.440 
the second reason is because it's going
to<00:02:24.440> be<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.800> much<00:02:25.040> harder<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.910> get<00:02:26.060> back<00:02:26.239> on

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
to be that much harder to get back on

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.390 
to be that much harder to get back on
the<00:02:26.510> raw<00:02:26.870> white<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.319> after<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.860> choose<00:02:28.190> to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the raw white and after you choose to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400 
the raw white and after you choose to
take<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.670> all-or-nothing<00:02:28.910> approach<00:02:29.410> you'll

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
take the all-or-nothing approach you'll

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.020 
take the all-or-nothing approach you'll
know<00:02:30.680> if<00:02:31.069> you've<00:02:31.250> fallen<00:02:31.489> into<00:02:31.849> this<00:02:31.970> trap

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
know if you've fallen into this trap

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.360 
know if you've fallen into this trap
because<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.200> will<00:02:33.379> have<00:02:33.410> looked<00:02:33.799> back<00:02:34.040> and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
because you will have looked back and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.360 
because you will have looked back and
realized<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:35.120> one<00:02:35.599> meal<00:02:35.870> snowballs<00:02:36.739> into<00:02:37.129> a

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
realized that one meal snowballs into a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.820 
realized that one meal snowballs into a
week<00:02:37.819> or<00:02:38.060> more<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.299> eating<00:02:38.780> foods<00:02:39.049> it<00:02:39.560> didn't

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
week or more of eating foods it didn't

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.350 
week or more of eating foods it didn't
make<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.040> feel<00:02:40.250> good<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.209> feel

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
make you feel good and then you feel

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.960 
make you feel good and then you feel
helpless<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.260> feel<00:02:42.470> like<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.650> failure<00:02:42.980> not

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
helpless and you feel like a failure not

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.910 
helpless and you feel like a failure not
only<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.239> but<00:02:44.420> oftentimes<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.290> don't<00:02:45.560> see<00:02:45.890> a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
only that but oftentimes you don't see a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.190 
only that but oftentimes you don't see a
way<00:02:46.280> out<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.849> you<00:02:47.360> don't<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.930> same

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
way out of it you don't have that same

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.380 
way out of it you don't have that same
Drive<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.769> don't<00:02:48.920> have<00:02:49.069> that<00:02:49.220> same<00:02:49.519> vision<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
Drive you don't have that same vision to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.330 
Drive you don't have that same vision to
live<00:02:50.599> and<00:02:50.810> eat<00:02:50.900> healthfully<00:02:51.560> after<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.099> get

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
live and eat healthfully after you get

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.150 
live and eat healthfully after you get
into<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.700> All<00:02:53.000> or<00:02:53.180> Nothing<00:02:53.239> trap<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.709> second

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
into that All or Nothing trap the second

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.860 
into that All or Nothing trap the second
way<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.519> react<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.030> situation<00:02:56.060> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
way you can react to the situation and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.360 
way you can react to the situation and
this<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.260> obviously<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.950> one<00:02:58.129> that<00:02:58.340> I

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
this is obviously the one that I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.330 
this is obviously the one that I
recommend<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.930> know<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.099> made<00:03:01.310> a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
recommend is to know that you made a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.699 
recommend is to know that you made a
choice<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.700> eat<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.060> food<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.900> own<00:03:03.170> your

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
choice to eat that food to own your

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.759 
choice to eat that food to own your
