so as you can see this is a 9.7 inch
screen<00:00:08.820> compared<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> 10.1<00:00:10.349> inch<00:00:10.559> screen

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
screen compared to a 10.1 inch screen

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.270 
screen compared to a 10.1 inch screen
it's<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.370> course<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.820> lot<00:00:12.440> wider<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.799> not<00:00:14.070> as

it's of course a lot wider and not as

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.490 
it's of course a lot wider and not as
high<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.000> almost<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:15.480> high<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.900> what's

high but almost as high and what's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.019 
high but almost as high and what's
interesting<00:00:16.619> about<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.250> also<00:00:17.520> compared

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
interesting about this is also compared

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.769 
interesting about this is also compared
to<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> 101<00:00:19.310> titanium<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.449> an

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
to the 101 titanium is that we have an

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.970 
to the 101 titanium is that we have an
HD<00:00:22.289> screen<00:00:22.619> like<00:00:23.279> NN<00:00:23.820> apple<00:00:24.240> ipad<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.170> 2k<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.669 
also in the 97 platinum there's also 2k
screen<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.970> clearly<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.720> color

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
screen and can clearly see the color

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860 
screen and can clearly see the color
differences<00:00:32.219> between<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.730> three<00:00:33.180> or<00:00:33.420> between

differences between the three or between

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.069 
differences between the three or between
the<00:00:34.050> two<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> middle<00:00:35.130> always<00:00:35.809> since<00:00:36.809> there

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the two in the middle always since there

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.229 
the two in the middle always since there
is<00:00:37.290> really<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> different<00:00:38.070> kind<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.340> em<00:00:38.850> display

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
is really a different kind of em display

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.330 
is really a different kind of em display
in<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.350> feels<00:00:40.530> quite<00:00:40.860> nice<00:00:41.070> it's

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
in here so this feels quite nice it's

not as high end as the 97 and platinum
but<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.160> also<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.610> beautiful<00:00:45.320> plastic

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

actually there is no ports on the bottom

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.400 
actually there is no ports on the bottom
but<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:55.500> some<00:00:56.960> key<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
but we have actually some key see on the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.200 
but we have actually some key see on the
side<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.399> an<00:00:59.520> ostrich<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.000> then

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
side which are in on an ostrich and then

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.939 
side which are in on an ostrich and then
volume<00:01:00.510> rocker<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:03.090> top<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
volume rocker on the top there is a

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.100 
volume rocker on the top there is a
power<00:01:04.949> plug<00:01:05.250> micro<00:01:05.670> USB<00:01:06.000> micro<00:01:06.570> HDMI

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
power plug micro USB micro HDMI

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.510 
power plug micro USB micro HDMI
microphone<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:09.740> janna<00:01:10.740> power<00:01:10.979> plug<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
microphone and janna power plug so I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.179 
microphone and janna power plug so I
think<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.630> applied<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.960> thing<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
think they applied the thing in the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.670 
think they applied the thing in the
wrong<00:01:14.780> spot<00:01:15.780> since<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.320> should<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
wrong spot since there should be a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.219 
wrong spot since there should be a
headphone<00:01:17.310> port<00:01:17.549> also<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.020> have

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
headphone port also and then we have

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.469 
headphone port also and then we have
actually<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> said<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.729> camera<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> front

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
actually as I said a camera on the front

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
actually as I said a camera on the front
and<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:21.900> let's<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:23.130> how<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and the back let's just see how that

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.170 
and the back let's just see how that
works<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.330> back<00:01:24.570> camera<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.619> quick

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
works the back camera is one quick

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.550 
works the back camera is one quick
and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.900> also<00:01:27.930> hear<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.770> phone<00:01:29.310> camera

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
and then we also hear a phone camera

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
and then we also hear a phone camera
here<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.980> can<00:01:32.160> see<00:01:32.190> this<00:01:32.730> is<00:01:32.880> also<00:01:33.060> totally

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
here so you can see this is also totally

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
here so you can see this is also totally
okay<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.620> can<00:01:37.770> also<00:01:37.920> check<00:01:38.190> out

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
okay and then we can also check out

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.070 
okay and then we can also check out
maybe<00:01:38.550> some<00:01:38.880> gaming<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.450> there's<00:01:39.630> any<00:01:39.810> games

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
maybe some gaming if there's any games

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.480 
maybe some gaming if there's any games
installed<00:01:42.500> but<00:01:43.500> there's<00:01:43.770> actually<00:01:43.890> no<00:01:44.250> games

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
installed but there's actually no games

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
installed but there's actually no games
installed<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.030> let's<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.450> go<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
installed so let's just go to the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.969 
installed so let's just go to the
browser<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.750> good<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:49.080> me<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.260> come<00:01:49.770> along

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
browser it's good for me to come along

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.280 
browser it's good for me to come along
with<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.940> guys<00:01:51.150> is<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.720> community

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
with the with you guys is the community

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.140 
with the with you guys is the community
and<00:01:52.680> then<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.760> actually<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
and then you can see that actually the

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.480 
and then you can see that actually the
keyboard<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.750> also<00:01:55.080> totally<00:01:55.290> finest<00:01:56.160> can<00:01:56.340> also

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
keyboard is also totally finest can also

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.609 
keyboard is also totally finest can also
flip<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.060> screen<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.750> device<00:01:58.260> but<00:01:58.470> also

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
flip the screen and the device but also

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.730 
flip the screen and the device but also
off<00:01:58.979> limits<00:01:59.160> quite<00:01:59.880> quickly<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.500> it

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
off limits quite quickly and with you it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.460 
off limits quite quickly and with you it
does<00:02:02.280> matter<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.820> which<00:02:03.330> direction<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.229> this
