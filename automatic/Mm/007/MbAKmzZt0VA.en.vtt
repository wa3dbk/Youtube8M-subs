00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.220
 now 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.120
 i will teach you how to run a disk on 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.309
 computer 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.750
 usually from smack of cedis tones like 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.759
 disk drive starts 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.309
 automatically 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.969
 but sometimes there are situations when a disk 

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:20.970
 you need to run them manually 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.849
 for this fight you need to do 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.880
 the next path namely the bottom left 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.669
 desktop corner is the start button 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.790
 clicking it should select the item 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.170
 rub my computer 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.090
 which will appear in the opened window 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.510
 in which we now see on the screen 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600
 As a rule, this item is now located 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.590
 either in the first one arrived in the second 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.530
 gearbox 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.960
 after opening 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.490
 tell start buttons 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.230
 the open window among all where SLE 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.940
 you must select the drive that 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.850
 is responsible for the drive need to clarify what 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.240
 the disk does not fit it serves to read 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.659
 ordinary wheels 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.670
 cried and drives goal etc 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.720
 may be called differently 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.320
 project and and went on and on folders 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.410
 those in this window also do not serve 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.990
 for opening discs therefore for 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.970
 order to run the disk 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.910
 necessary in this case is used 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.510
 drive leader e 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.420
 for example 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.900
 on the icon this drives is depicted 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.630
 disk sign cisco icon 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.060
 when you click on it a record appears 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.360
 window 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 which is all available on 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 disk files 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 when you press 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 but now we will press 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.440
 necessary 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 disk icon 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.830
 I saw the files 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.830
 which is on disk 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 push 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.890
 so we see 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.340
 these files and when you click on any of 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.069
 of these files 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.620
 in this case we have files in format 1 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.620
 take care and body 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.129

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.189

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.449
 but years with an empty rate 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.449

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.889
 she who earlier when watching the movie was

 and when the movie will be launched 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.189
 so I should have a title 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.899

 how could you not do 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.159
 if the disk contains folders and not 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.019

 need and folders 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.270
 here pay attention that the saga on disk could 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.270
 be very different 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.009
 on this our district 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.559
 can finish 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.609
 and then remember that the base should 

00:04:48.609 --> 00:04:50.169
