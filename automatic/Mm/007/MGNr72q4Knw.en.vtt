00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
alkaline water with this little guy

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.919 
alkaline water with this little guy
because<00:00:14.070> that's<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.400> basic<00:00:14.820> when<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> suck

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
even me but what is it about this that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.779 
even me but what is it about this that
makes<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:25.019> alkaline<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.189> let's<00:00:26.400> find<00:00:26.550> out

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
makes it alkaline so let's find out

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.359 
makes it alkaline so let's find out
there's<00:00:27.240> four<00:00:27.510> key<00:00:27.750> minerals<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.619> that

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
there's four key minerals in this that

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.040 
there's four key minerals in this that
get<00:00:29.640> absorbed<00:00:30.000> into<00:00:30.240> your<00:00:30.359> body<00:00:30.570> after

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
get absorbed into your body after

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.100 
get absorbed into your body after
digestion<00:00:31.470> which<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.460> magnesium<00:00:33.239> calcium

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
digestion which is magnesium calcium

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.850 
digestion which is magnesium calcium
sodium<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.340> potassium<00:00:36.020> those<00:00:37.020> four<00:00:37.290> alkaline

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
sodium and potassium those four alkaline

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.830 
sodium and potassium those four alkaline
forming<00:00:38.100> minerals<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:39.030> absorbed<00:00:39.420> into<00:00:39.719> your

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
forming minerals get absorbed into your

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100 
forming minerals get absorbed into your
bloodstream<00:00:40.280> urine<00:00:41.280> saliva<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.510> create<00:00:43.020> an

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
bloodstream urine saliva and create an

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.690 
bloodstream urine saliva and create an
outline<00:00:43.530> effect<00:00:43.860> all<00:00:44.040> throughout<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> body

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
outline effect all throughout the body

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.200 
outline effect all throughout the body
