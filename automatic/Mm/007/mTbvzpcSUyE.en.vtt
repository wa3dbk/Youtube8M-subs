00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.760

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.340
 the phone as already mentioned is 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.340
 a quad-core 1.3 processor 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.980
 this one has a ram giga 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.500

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.530
 internal storage and support 32 in 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.960
 the by means of micro sd 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.980
 its interface as you can see is the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.230
 Interface 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.380
 this 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:50.720
 wii motion 2.0 from huawei which we can 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.720
 see who fits 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.260
 as you can see 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:05.210
 the model name of the phone sorry 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:08.670
 the four quad core 1.3 shandong and the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.240
 phone memory 4 gigas we grow in 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.220
 540 x 960 Android version 4.2 points 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.320
 two 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.650
 the version of the we the moon have 2.0 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.740
 base version goes baseband and in the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.440
 channel 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.180
 here also shows us other 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.720
 although we can see 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.730
 I like interface very much for the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.240
 access that you have to them for example in 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.530
 this case the weather as you can see 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.520
 we have direct access to climate 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.470
 here our images if we give them 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.890
 will ask us to select a folder or 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.110
 choose a photo here our contacts 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.660
 that we can add Chinese or 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.350
 music player when the 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.430
 music player 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.430
 how can you see 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.509
 here we are not raising our music and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.659
 in the notification bar like I say 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.659
 in shape 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.879
 when we block the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.099
 device being in music we would have 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.549
 played the clock we appear with the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.549
 producer 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.989
 but as you can see 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.860
 I do not know how to reproduce, we can pass on 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.550
 overtake him 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.550
 irreproachable and everything 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:43.100
 here for example in these if we give 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.100
 add will put our contacts 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.939
 here the camera 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.939
 I show you working 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.849
 how can you see 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.790
 we treat the function to 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.090
 well that not what it is being a bear 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.090
 flash 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.660
 and here this if we give less in this 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:18.760
 here we do not see the options 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.760
 I think the smile and things like that 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.040
 another interesting thing is the possibility 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.500
 to change issues in this case as 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.300
 can see we can choose a theme 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.260
 different 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.260
 let's apply 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.330
 and we change our whole subject as 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.440
 You can see here to change our theme 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.610
 completely so much and with a background and 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.260
 lock screen as you can see 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.790
 now on the screen what you already have 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.860
 here the camera and our candadito for 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.890
 to unlock 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.380
 our climate also change as they can 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.440
 see here 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.370
 change 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.530
 and there are also other topics for example 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.530
 this encaste that is darker 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.950
 let's apply it 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.169
 As you can see we are with the 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.160
 different interface completely 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.160
 different 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.040
 in which we already had by phone 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.920
 something that I tell you very well that the 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.210
 screen reacts very well to gestures 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:47.039
 tactile gestures 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.780
 this two points from one of tc here 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.960
 we automatically what comes 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.139
 doing our file manager 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.389
 rompo denver marks us ties 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.389
 in local and tangent display 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.600
 and this 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.280
 the applications that it already brings as a 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.840
 clock to the camera gallery music etc 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.370
 another interesting thing is that it already brings 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.390
 pre-installed 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.610
 what is twitter and facebook and an office 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.500
 this is so that we do not have to 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.070
 download them even if you ask us 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.070
 update it 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.729
 and something that I did not show you in a video of 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:37.460
 Reservoir is everything you have here back 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:41.509
 brings a secondary microphone to 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.069
 recording the camera a led flash of a 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:46.699
 side of this side has what come 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:49.069
 being the volume lock buttons 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.940
 up and down in the bottom 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:54.390
 we have to be saying 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.680
 input the charger and the microphone 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.320
 abide in the world that is the entrance of 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.920
 hearing aid and on this side we do not have 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.920
 absolutely 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.500
 good would this 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.379
 all for the moment 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.460
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:18.310
 and see you 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.120
 in the next video 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.120
 see you later
