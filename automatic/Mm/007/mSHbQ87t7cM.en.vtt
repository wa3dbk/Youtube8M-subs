 who did not want to open their mouths

 to take a bath is good because 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.530
 that there are many children who do not 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.390

 how to do 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.320
 they want to put the dead and then because 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.360

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.480
 you're going to put her on that part of the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.910
