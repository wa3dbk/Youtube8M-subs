00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
switches right here I got them all over

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.700 
switches right here I got them all over
the<00:00:22.560> place<00:00:22.730> yellow<00:00:23.730> wire<00:00:24.050> right<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.410> mine

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
switches are tricked that sends the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
switches are tricked that sends the
current<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> solenoid<00:00:48.690> telling<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
current to the solenoid telling the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.240 
current to the solenoid telling the

solenoid to crank the engine so I'm
going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> tell<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.940> how<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> rewire<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
going to tell you how to rewire with the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.639 
going to tell you how to rewire with the
stock<00:00:56.010> wiring<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.000> ignition<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> don't

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
stock wiring and ignition so you don't

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.260 
stock wiring and ignition so you don't
have<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.039> fearlesses<00:00:59.550> for<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.149> 'less

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
have to do fearlesses for your 'less

now<00:01:03.270> I'm<00:01:03.570> leaving<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:04.530> safety<00:01:05.159> switch<00:01:05.460> on

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
now I'm leaving one safety switch on

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.050

if I fall off so I'm actually going to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.320 
if I fall off so I'm actually going to
run<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> wire<00:01:14.420> through<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.360> fall<00:01:19.049> off

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
run a wire through this so if I fall off

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.810 
run a wire through this so if I fall off
it<00:01:21.330> kills<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> engine<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.520> want

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it kills the engine but if I don't want

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.060 
it kills the engine but if I don't want
it<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.420> work<00:01:24.810> I'll<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.320> flick<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> switch<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it to work I'll just flick a switch and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.660 
it to work I'll just flick a switch and
it<00:01:26.189> won't<00:01:26.340> turn<00:01:26.460> off

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it won't turn off

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.219 
it won't turn off
also<00:01:27.180> having<00:01:27.330> another<00:01:27.600> kill<00:01:27.810> switch<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.110> on

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
also having another kill switch up on

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.719 
also having another kill switch up on
the<00:01:28.290> steering<00:01:28.530> wheel<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.400> probably<00:01:29.640> gonna

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the steering wheel and I probably gonna

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.179 
the steering wheel and I probably gonna
have<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> kill<00:01:30.299> switch

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
have that as a kill switch

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.530 
have that as a kill switch
cuz<00:01:32.189> kill<00:01:32.549> switches<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.150> kill<00:01:33.329> switches

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
cuz kill switches the more kill switches

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.219 
cuz kill switches the more kill switches
the<00:01:33.780> better

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the better

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.830 
the better
well<00:01:34.590> sometimes<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.640> confusing<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.299> think

is<00:02:47.790> cut<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.209> yellow<00:02:48.480> wire<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.140> cut<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.920> where

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
is cut this yellow wire and cut it where

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.760 
is cut this yellow wire and cut it where
it<00:02:50.160> comes<00:02:50.280> out<00:02:50.520> of<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> cylinder<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.770> just

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
it comes out of the cylinder and just

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.220 
it comes out of the cylinder and just
tie<00:02:52.950> them<00:02:53.100> together<00:02:53.270> I'm<00:02:54.270> gonna<00:02:54.750> put<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> nut

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
tie them together I'm gonna put a nut

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.270 
tie them together I'm gonna put a nut
there<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> just<00:02:55.590> want<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.800> show<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.070> tied

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
there I just want to show you I tied

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.220 
there I just want to show you I tied
them<00:02:56.370> together<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:57.350> then<00:02:59.989> that's<00:03:00.989> pretty

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
them together and then that's pretty

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.220 
them together and then that's pretty
much<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:02.100> there's<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.910> ground<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.690> goes<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
much it there's a ground that goes to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.910 
much it there's a ground that goes to
your<00:03:04.400> ignition<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.580> redid<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:07.080> cut

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
your ignition that I redid I just cut

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.690 
your ignition that I redid I just cut
cut<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.880> tied<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.020> then<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
cut it and tied it in and then the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.340 
cut it and tied it in and then the
charging<00:03:12.120> system<00:03:12.300> that's<00:03:12.750> all<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.080> have<00:03:13.200> to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
charging system that's all you have to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.870 
charging system that's all you have to
do<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.800> make<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:13.980> work<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.430> then<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.730> could

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
do to make it work and then you could

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.060 
do to make it work and then you could
cut<00:03:15.060> all<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.540> stuff<00:03:15.900> out<00:03:16.110> because<00:03:16.620> all<00:03:16.890> that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
cut all that stuff out because all that

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.060 
cut all that stuff out because all that
else<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.730> -<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> ground<00:03:18.709> with<00:03:19.709> all<00:03:19.739> these

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
else is - it is a ground with all these

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.380 
else is - it is a ground with all these
fancy<00:03:20.250> wires<00:03:20.580> that<00:03:20.760> go<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.940> all<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.180> switches

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
fancy wires that go to all the switches

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.520 
fancy wires that go to all the switches
that<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.720> don't<00:03:21.959> know<00:03:22.049> where<00:03:22.200> they<00:03:22.350> go<00:03:22.500> to

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
that I don't know where they go to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.740 
that I don't know where they go to
Timbuktu<00:03:23.150> seems<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.269> they'll<00:03:24.420> run<00:03:24.630> into

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
Timbuktu seems like they'll run into

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.990 
Timbuktu seems like they'll run into
each<00:03:24.959> other<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.410> goes<00:03:25.620> back<00:03:25.799> into<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.190> one

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
each other and goes back into that one

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.800 
each other and goes back into that one
wire<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.480> goes<00:03:27.540> into<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:29.540> charging<00:03:30.540> system

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
wire that goes into that charging system

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.539 
wire that goes into that charging system
goes<00:03:30.989> up<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.830> then<00:03:31.890> goes<00:03:32.220> down<00:03:32.519> I

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
goes up to this and then goes down I

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.400 
goes up to this and then goes down I
don't<00:03:32.940> know<00:03:33.000> what<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> point<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.780> -<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
don't know what the point of that is - I

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.750 
don't know what the point of that is - I
don't<00:03:34.590> know<00:03:34.769> if<00:03:34.830> it's<00:03:34.920> like<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.040> regulator<00:03:35.580> or

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
don't know if it's like a regulator or

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.400 
don't know if it's like a regulator or
something<00:03:36.090> like<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.420> why<00:03:36.959> they<00:03:37.260> just

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
something like that I why they just

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.470 
something like that I why they just
don't<00:03:37.530> run<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.980> battery<00:03:38.600> but<00:03:39.600> um<00:03:41.420> I'm<00:03:42.420> sure

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
don't run to the battery but um I'm sure

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.509 
don't run to the battery but um I'm sure
you<00:03:42.870> guys<00:03:43.019> how<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.380> works<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:44.010> show<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.340> that

and there you go you pretty much have a
three<00:05:16.160> wire<00:05:16.370> running<00:05:16.760> system<00:05:16.970> now<00:05:17.870> I

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
three wire running system now I

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.960 
three wire running system now I
understand<00:05:18.530> it's<00:05:18.740> still<00:05:19.040> a<00:05:19.340> little<00:05:19.610> bit<00:05:19.790> more

fronts idea with the push button but I

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.960 
fronts idea with the push button but I
don't<00:05:35.450> like<00:05:35.570> push-button<00:05:35.930> switches<00:05:36.290> and<00:05:36.970> it

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
don't like push-button switches and it

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.120 
don't like push-button switches and it
seemed<00:05:38.240> like<00:05:38.390> that<00:05:38.540> was<00:05:38.600> not<00:05:39.170> that's<00:05:39.470> cool<00:05:39.770> I
