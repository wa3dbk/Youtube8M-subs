 Many of my commitments is to write 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.960
 Not a stick of those for beginners 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.230
 Because there is an attack 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.210

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.340
 3 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.910
 First 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.910
 The basic ward is installed just like when you eat . 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.359
 Or is not the right time to the general ward now I eat here two or 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.200

 If you install here, now you can see below 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:21.049
 Straight to this one when installed just eat that much because the memories are not of a show 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.790
 Then, now the ward 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:31.869
 There's only one. So it's the second lantern. 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.869
 If you tell us from this location, it will be TEK. 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.800
 Do not be 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:45.630
 Yeah , to fly Langton. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.680
 In this case probably I would not have thought riryeogo me I'm the one way nalryeot not renteon 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:54.689
 Because I have lots of sleeping, I can not stand the lantern . 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.250
 I do not know how to do it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.250
 Listen carefully . 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.270
 They'll find them too. 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.560
 I cut school one destination to the gang that Paul added 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.440
 First 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.440
 Good night and Shinjid 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.489
 Ignore me and Gamb 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.520
 You can see it going right this way . 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.490
 Yes then 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.080
 If you know to ignore it, just go back 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:41.550
 You see it clipped on Friday . Why did you click here? 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:44.180
 This Cuba has been hungry all the time, 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.180
 So here 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.740
 So you're ready to blow this skill. 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:58.740
 Will fall directly change this skill 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:01.410
 Well, luckily, now, Zarben and Shin Jid are both Airborne to lose . 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.440
 Taken from an app on state 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.520
 Now it's Zarban . 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.370
 I am sentenced to death because I am young. 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.420
 Ah little more ah 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.410
 I'll tie you in. 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.410
 He's shooting this way. 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.069
 Honestly, it's Mito National Palace. 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.069
 One more time. 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:37.290
 Gospel lethality write well no no ambition Palace 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:42.950
 I walked in here. It took two people . 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:45.700
 In fact, I have not been able to get any artifacts. 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.700
 I wrote this. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.510
 The empire wrote, and then these two are slow. 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.890
 And one additional approaches still galril themselves because the rest of the wall 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.099
 It is. 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.720
 You just think you blocked a few just four entrances. 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.720
 I read it right here. 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:11.000
 4 The space that I can enter . 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.180
 always 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.810
 Palace of the seed dew is off the recipe for turning the most significant in this sense 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.810
 You can call me. 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.130
 I was trying to cut off 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.920
 We're on this side . I'm trying to buy this way. 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.920
 Let 's do it 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.320
 At this moment 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.870
 From here 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:50.580
 It's a long shot and it 's getting pretty crowded right now. 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.099
 Ideal Location 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.099
 Here it is known and appeared 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.320
 character 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:04.360
 From here 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.680
 In fact, this segment is the third most likely route to escape 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:13.090
 Gang Pro I've run away all the time. 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:17.680
 Because I could not get g and I was going to die again anyway 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:20.260
 The kids do not go too far and Campron ran like this. 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.650
 This is the location of its first rap 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.650
 g 4 Since the regime is this way 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.530
 In this direction 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.530
 Still Lime Gifts 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:42.639
 So I Kilmer 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:44.640
 4 But what is not a cloth, 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.410
 A little 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.850
 I just showed you a good video so I explained it, so what I took 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.840
 Only in 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.840
