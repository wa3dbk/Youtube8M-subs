 end of the paperwork it's not 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:24.460
 serious we take advantage and taqwa manor the 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.869
 is coming to an end and that's when 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.009
 that batman takes him by the collar and he 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.090
 said and this enigma you know her 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.619
 illogical overboard it really 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.730
 the sense of sharing is clear we have 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.809
 a lot of luck to have it at gotham 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.329
 I have so much to know who is 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.809

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.160
 Batman 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.260
 how is it not, but it's just that he 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.910
 does justice himself believe himself to 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.530
 above the laws but you're too right 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.430
 but it's clear that I never had 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.720
 seen that from this angle but it's 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.190
 completely abused yes good it's not no 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.120
 the more we waited but it happens 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.200
 step people on the street and does this 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.770
 what he wants what you saw his 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.329

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.640

 the world is true that's true 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.820
 it's smaller it takes less space 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.590
 and more discreet passed by no 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.880
 the more the guy rolls in the wrong direction 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.649
