00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
want to put on this application of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.270 
want to put on this application of
crankshaft<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.090> okay<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:10.380> does<00:01:10.650> include

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
crankshaft in here okay it does include

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.820 
crankshaft in here okay it does include
a<00:01:11.460> no<00:01:11.610> hole<00:01:11.820> balance<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.260> recommend<00:01:13.590> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
a no hole balance so we do recommend you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
a no hole balance so we do recommend you
provide<00:01:14.280> us<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.610> bob<00:01:14.880> weight<00:01:15.120> or<00:01:15.300> somewhat

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
provide us with a bob weight or somewhat

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.620 
provide us with a bob weight or somewhat
close<00:01:16.620> of<00:01:16.800> an<00:01:16.890> idea<00:01:17.160> of<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> bob<00:01:17.520> weight<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
close of an idea of a bob weight so the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.530 
close of an idea of a bob weight so the
counter<00:01:18.930> weights<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:19.230> close<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.190> your
