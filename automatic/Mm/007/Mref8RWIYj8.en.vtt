00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello everyone and today I would like to 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.460
 tell you and show probably the most 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.300
 drug game in recent months 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.099
 this is a true mushroom picker a 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 today you have to feel yourself 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.990
 this mushroom pickers who loves 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.689
 collect hallucinogenic mushrooms but not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.650
 it is worth thinking that it will be easy colorful 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.210
 graphics are great special effects will help 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.789
 immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the game 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.390
 I want to note that the game is built on 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:38.190
 The unity3d engine of the fourth version 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.500
 and the version is about it so if the author 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.300
 tried that he could squeeze out of it 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.070
 engine pretty good picture 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.550
 Well, now as if not too cuts 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.840
 eyes and quite nice to eyes like 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.449
 see I already collected 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.390
 two mushrooms more precisely three because here 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.699
 the counter goes from zero 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.910
 I collected my fourth mushroom and now I 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.519
 I want to collect fully 15 mushrooms yes 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.530
 here the goal is to collect 15 hallucinogenic 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.689
 mushrooms to say so 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.780
 to be high I want to say that here 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.670
 can pass through the trees well this 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.590
 as I already know a little why this is so 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.320
 It happened because of not 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 heavily load the system because if 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.829
 would the author have done that through these 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.369
 the trees could not pass and did 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.420
 their physical objects it would be very 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.290
 strongly reflected on 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.290
 performance 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.509
 and since the game is not optimized 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.840
 at least she is recording at least without recording 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.799
 shows me about 12 fps then i think 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.369
 that together with trees as objects this 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.159
 it would be worse but oh well I won't 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.479
 get distracted by trees and want you 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.689
 show the actual gameplay of this game 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.240
 I want to note that the game is available immediately on 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.719
 two languages ​​Russian and English 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.860
 so the games as it were focused not 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.140
 only to the Russian audience but also to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:20.360
 English English so to speak 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:23.810
 audience and how do you see me already here 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.700
 Pretty not sickly stomps but I 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.530
 still have to collect these 15 mushrooms 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.960
 it is rather difficult to do because 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.990
 that i don't like all sorts of games like find 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.980
 everything is there because I'm pretty 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.620
 not an attentive person and can miss 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.810
 any thing out of sight so 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:51.440
 say so so also want to say 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.010
 that the game is built like the basis of this 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.739
 games the first game of developers and more precisely 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.870
 not the first first more or less serious 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.850
 the game is slender dark forest 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:09.880
 and th th th th th th th th th Yeol I was already 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.890
 does it stumble already only 10 mushrooms 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:19.250
 no mushrooms themselves and i'm pretty 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.930
 so dashing nehilo stomps so left 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.610
 collect only some five 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.610
 wow mushrooms 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.360
 it remains to collect 4 mushrooms and this too 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.030
 and praise 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.049
 I myself do not understand how I am in this condition 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.690
 I manage to find these mushrooms here 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:49.940
 although I myself already said pretty 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.489
 I am not an attentive person in the morning 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.320
 socks can not find here to mushrooms in 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.320
 with such a condition or 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.010
 as you see here there is some 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:11.959
 the area for which you can go that is 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:14.570
 field forest field so here it is field and over there 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.419
 forest I do not advise go beyond 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.959
 forests because in this field at all 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.049
 there is nothing and you will just spend 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.319
 its 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:33.300
 Of course, precious time since not 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:36.000
 it only remains to find 3 mushrooms, then I 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:43.400
 now I will try to survive all of myself 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.400
 and somehow find these unfortunate mushrooms 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.490
 Of course it's hard to imagine what can 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.530
 happen to a man if he eats 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.379
 15 inedible mushrooms at once 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:00.210
 Well, as you can see, this is happening right now 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:06.240
 so in my opinion I am our yes I have found one more 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.039
 mushroom yes damn is such a number that I still 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.490
 there is one mushroom under me all the time 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.159
 flies 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.310
 but these are just hallucinations to 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:17.520
 Unfortunately, I understood how to find the skin 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.770
 pretty easy this this last 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.150
 two mushrooms 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.139
 you just had to go a little 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.979
 stopped passed stopped now 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:36.150
 feeling like i'm driving through a tunnel and 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:37.830
 the light at the end of the tunnel I see hooray 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.259
 Actually it starts to bother because 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.699
 that mushrooms here are hard to find 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:46.529
 see but the game is pretty funny 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.440
 especially if you play not one but with 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:52.080
 my friend and who will first find there 15 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.490
 Mushrooms that get for example chocolate 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:02.069
 it will be pretty interesting to play 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:05.840
 and as far as I know here 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:09.990
 there is some easter egg that is on 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:15.659
 Now this area here is the fox 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:17.610
 skull and on all sorts of stories bikes this 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.550
 the skull belongs to one mushroom picker 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.080
 who went for these hallucinogenic 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.569
 mushrooms and never returned 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.460
 bikes such bikes 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:32.250
 i'm already wandering around for a few minutes 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.940
 the forest and I can not find the last two 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.340
 mushroom 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:43.710
 maybe it will be here somewhere i am not 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:51.780
 I know no, most likely this is all 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:55.070
 terminals, although I think that you can still 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:07:00.210
 try to find these two mushroom twist 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:03.810
 what am I alone as a sucker? 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.450
 the game is now almost pass by and 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.890
 say wall 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:12.810
 I found 14 flu is pretty 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.740
 cool now I have such a mapping 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:20.480
 goes on screen like another mushroom 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:26.760

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:28.920
