00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
to happen I just really thought that

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.210 
to happen I just really thought that
that<00:02:21.880> was<00:02:22.060> just<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.599> one-off<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.560> know<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.040> when

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
that was just a one-off you know so when

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.750 
that was just a one-off you know so when
they<00:02:24.340> came<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.730> second<00:02:25.150> time<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:26.680> was<00:02:27.549> just

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
they came the second time I was just

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.309 
they came the second time I was just
impressed<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.269> they<00:02:28.480> were<00:02:28.630> able<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.959> keep<00:02:29.140> it

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
impressed that they were able to keep it

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.240 
impressed that they were able to keep it
