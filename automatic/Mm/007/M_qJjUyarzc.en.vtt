00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
what's up boom all right so i'll just

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.740 
what's up boom all right so i'll just
show<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.259> little<00:00:04.589> demonstration<00:00:05.490> i<00:00:06.089> got

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
show you this little demonstration i got

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.540 
show you this little demonstration i got
the<00:00:06.839> ball<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.170> up<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.470> down<00:00:07.529> here<00:00:08.189> on<00:00:08.429> this

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the ball going up and down here on this

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.620 
the ball going up and down here on this
diving<00:00:08.820> board<00:00:09.179> as<00:00:09.360> i<00:00:10.230> will<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.530> animate<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.040> and

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
diving board as i will to animate it and

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.410 
diving board as i will to animate it and
this<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:12.660> as<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.980> note<00:00:14.190> i<00:00:14.490> have<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.880> switch

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
this here as you note i have to switch

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.870 
this here as you note i have to switch
between<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.900> two<00:00:15.960> i<00:00:16.260> select<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> ball<00:00:17.160> make

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
between the two i select the ball make

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.420 
between the two i select the ball make
it<00:00:18.060> bounce<00:00:18.300> side<00:00:18.750> animate<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.350> y<00:00:19.890> translate

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
it bounce side animate the y translate

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.929 
it bounce side animate the y translate
and<00:00:20.580> then<00:00:21.480> over<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.320> i<00:00:23.189> would<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.850> to

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and then over here on i would have to

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.089 
and then over here on i would have to
come<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.359> curvature<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.410> i<00:00:25.500> got<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> bin

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
come to curvature and i got like a bin

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
come to curvature and i got like a bin
deformation<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.570> i<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.840> make<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.230> ball

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
deformation so i can make the ball

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.400 
deformation so i can make the ball
bounced<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.279> curvature<00:00:29.789> as<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.539> hits<00:00:30.720> but

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
bounced on the curvature as it hits but

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.330 
bounced on the curvature as it hits but
the<00:00:31.529> problem<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> keep

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the problem is I have to keep

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.160 
the problem is I have to keep
alternating<00:00:32.850> between<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.270> two<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
alternating between the two so what I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.880 
alternating between the two so what I
did<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.500> my<00:00:34.620> animation<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.370> had<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.610> rig<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.030> so

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
did for my animation I had to rig it so

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.549 
did for my animation I had to rig it so
as<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> ball<00:00:38.280> bounces<00:00:38.730> along<00:00:39.290> here<00:00:41.149> I<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:43.410> can

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
as the ball bounces along here I you can

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.080 
as the ball bounces along here I you can
see<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.010> there's<00:00:44.340> i<00:00:44.550> created<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
see here that there's i created a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
see here that there's i created a
balance<00:00:45.420> attribute<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:46.050> add<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.350> attribute<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
balance attribute i add an attribute and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.799 
balance attribute i add an attribute and
then<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.309> rigged<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:49.460> made<00:00:50.460> an<00:00:50.579> expression<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
then I rigged I made an expression to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.850 
then I rigged I made an expression to
make<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.920> bounce<00:00:53.960> influence<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.110> board<00:00:55.320> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
make this bounce influence the board so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
make this bounce influence the board so
as<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.430> edited<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> numbers

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
as I edited as you can see the numbers

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.069 
as I edited as you can see the numbers
change<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.879> kind<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.120> grayed<00:01:00.750> out<00:01:00.780> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
change there it's kind of grayed out so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.020 
change there it's kind of grayed out so
i<00:01:01.109> might<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.320> show<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.800> youtube<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
i might not show up on youtube but it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.850 
i might not show up on youtube but it
the<00:01:03.329> numbers<00:01:03.660> change<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.530> i<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.739> just

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the numbers change there so i can just

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.500 
the numbers change there so i can just
kind<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.430> edit<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> bounce<00:01:07.700> along<00:01:08.700> edit

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
kind of like edit the bounce along edit

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.630 
kind of like edit the bounce along edit
the<00:01:09.600> bounce<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.619> note<00:01:10.890> i<00:01:11.130> don't

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the bounce here and as you note i don't

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.440 
the bounce here and as you note i don't
even<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.200> be<00:01:13.200> selectable<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.369> i<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:15.330> just

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
even have to be selectable so i can just

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.570 
even have to be selectable so i can just
open<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> that's<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> many

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
open it up and that's one of the many

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.030 
open it up and that's one of the many
little<00:01:17.970> tiny<00:01:18.240> things<00:01:18.509> i<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.409> stuff<00:01:19.710> here

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
little tiny things i do this stuff here

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
little tiny things i do this stuff here
is<00:01:21.290> very<00:01:22.290> very<00:01:22.560> easy<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> other

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
is very very easy to do but the other

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.880 
is very very easy to do but the other
stuff<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.360> i<00:01:24.509> did<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.619> incredibly

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
stuff that i did is actually incredibly

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.530 
stuff that i did is actually incredibly
complex<00:01:26.630> i'm<00:01:27.630> actually<00:01:27.840> made<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> machine

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
complex i'm actually made it a machine

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.840 
complex i'm actually made it a machine
let<00:01:30.540> me<00:01:30.689> open<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.979> real<00:01:32.220> fast<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.759> i'll

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
let me open it up real fast and i'll

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:43.240 
let me open it up real fast and i'll
show<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:34.310> workshop<00:01:35.509> scenes<00:01:37.100> are<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.560 

alright<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.759> miss<00:01:45.000> go<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
alright so I got this miss go to the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
alright so I got this miss go to the
workshop<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.380> i<00:01:46.890> created<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.340> control

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
workshop here and i created a control

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.840 
workshop here and i created a control
and<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.659> i<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:50.189> rotate

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and all i have to do here is just rotate

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.130 
and all i have to do here is just rotate
the<00:01:51.030> control<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.680> where's<00:01:53.610> mine<00:01:53.820> rotate<00:01:54.360> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the control and where's mine rotate it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.630 
the control and where's mine rotate it's
not<00:01:55.229> rotating<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.070> i'll<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.430> do<00:01:56.549> it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
not rotating all right i'll just do it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.420 
not rotating all right i'll just do it
here<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.659> i<00:01:57.810> rotate<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.740> everything<00:01:59.250> else

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
here so as i rotate it everything else

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.149 
here so as i rotate it everything else
moves<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.110> i<00:02:01.110> had<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> rig<00:02:01.530> each<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> those

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
moves and i had to rig each one of those

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.870 
moves and i had to rig each one of those
setups<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.820> order<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.880> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
setups in order to make it do that so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
setups in order to make it do that so
this<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.450> stuff<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:07.020> really<00:02:07.439> really

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
this kind of stuff is really really

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.510 
this kind of stuff is really really
really<00:02:08.129> complex<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.379> too<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.400> only

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
really complex to do too but it's only

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.940 
really complex to do too but it's only
so<00:02:11.640> an<00:02:12.180> animator<00:02:12.569> can<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:12.959> grab<00:02:13.170> this

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
so an animator can just grab this

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.490 
so an animator can just grab this
and<00:02:14.099> rotated<00:02:15.410> I'm<00:02:16.410> not<00:02:16.590> crazy<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:18.269> all<00:02:19.230> that

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and rotated I'm not crazy and all that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.710 
and rotated I'm not crazy and all that
work<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:20.069> just<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.790> animator<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.360> go<00:02:21.480> oh

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
work just just so the animator can go oh

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.650 
work just just so the animator can go oh
you<00:02:21.959> know<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.379> wanted<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.040> spend<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.940> fast<00:02:24.300> or

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
you know I wanted to spend this fast or

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.369 
you know I wanted to spend this fast or
that<00:02:24.690> fast<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.940> know<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.810> was<00:02:28.050> given<00:02:28.290> an

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
that fast and you know if I was given an

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.250 
that fast and you know if I was given an
assignment<00:02:28.650> i<00:02:29.069> would<00:02:29.730> i<00:02:30.150> would<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:31.019> probably

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
assignment i would i would have probably

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.500 
assignment i would i would have probably
animated<00:02:31.920> as<00:02:32.099> myself<00:02:32.310> just<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:32.880> it's<00:02:33.209> so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
animated as myself just because it's so

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.750 
animated as myself just because it's so
easy<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.560> all<00:02:34.709> i<00:02:34.769> do<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.010> i<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.220> rotate

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
easy because all i do is i just rotate

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.880 
easy because all i do is i just rotate
that<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.420> make<00:02:36.450> all<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.989> do<00:02:37.680> what<00:02:37.830> i

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
that just to make all that do what i

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.030 
that just to make all that do what i
wanted<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.220> do<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.150> uh<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.690> guess<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.830> know<00:02:40.920> if

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
wanted to do but uh I guess you know if

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.430 
wanted to do but uh I guess you know if
it's<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.280> other<00:02:41.459> scenes<00:02:41.880> with<00:02:42.840> other<00:02:42.989> items

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
it's in other scenes with other items

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.759 
it's in other scenes with other items
such<00:02:43.890> as<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.540> had<00:02:45.560> animations<00:02:46.560> like

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
such as this that had animations like

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.949 
such as this that had animations like
this<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.489> would<00:02:47.610> there<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.209> many<00:02:48.540> many<00:02:48.750> of

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
this then it would there be many many of

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.289 
this then it would there be many many of
these<00:02:49.110> little<00:02:49.410> circles<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:50.730> would<00:02:50.940> do<00:02:51.090> these

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
these little circles that would do these

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.710 
these little circles that would do these
kind<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.630> things<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.860> that's<00:02:53.250> what<00:02:53.459> I'm<00:02:53.579> doing

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
kind of things so that's what I'm doing

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.250 
kind of things so that's what I'm doing
and<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.900> Austin<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.410> think<00:02:56.040> so
