00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.340 
have but all mine season is pretty good
I<00:00:30.679> was<00:00:31.679> thinking<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.579> maybe<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.450> would<00:00:33.510> make

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I was thinking that maybe I would make

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.389 
I was thinking that maybe I would make
like<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> race<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.700> division<00:00:36.120> 1<00:00:36.329> series<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.399> I'm

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
like a race to division 1 series but I'm

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.670 
like a race to division 1 series but I'm
actually<00:00:38.700> still<00:00:39.360> already<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.170> Division<00:00:40.649> two

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
actually still already in Division two

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.200 
actually still already in Division two
so<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:42.079> don't<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.760> won't<00:00:45.030> be

minimum<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> base<00:01:45.869> case<00:01:46.110> scenario<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
minimum so in the base case scenario you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.050

get one broad contract for around 150 so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.490 
get one broad contract for around 150 so
instead<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.119> doing<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.740> what<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.280> is

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
instead of doing that what you can do is

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.380 
instead of doing that what you can do is
go<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> store<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:02.719> just<00:02:03.719> buy<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.380> bronze<00:02:04.770> pack
