didn't last long ten thousand case / 15
/<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> pasta<00:00:17.250> too<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:19.070> also<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.250> wolf<00:00:20.520> 09<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
/ so I pasta too and also I'm wolf 09 I

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.130 
/ so I pasta too and also I'm wolf 09 I
boost<00:00:22.460> now<00:00:23.460> I'll<00:00:24.150> crack<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.660> open<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
boost now I'll crack the one open that

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.859 
boost now I'll crack the one open that
had<00:00:25.529> no<00:00:25.710> boost<00:00:27.349> this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> rear<00:00:29.189> housing

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
had no boost this is the rear housing

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.150 
had no boost this is the rear housing
seems<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> me<00:00:31.080> pretty<00:00:31.289> good<00:00:31.529> Nick<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.040> no

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
seems to me pretty good Nick there is no

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.220 
seems to me pretty good Nick there is no
sign<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.700> any<00:00:33.829> scoring<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.370> inside<00:00:36.230> so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
sign of any scoring on the inside so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.010 
sign of any scoring on the inside so
it's<00:00:37.410> obviously<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.809> compressor<00:00:39.809> wheel<00:00:39.899> on

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
it's obviously the compressor wheel on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's obviously the compressor wheel on
the<00:00:40.110> rear<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.530> fine<00:00:42.320> as<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> front<00:00:44.450> you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the rear is fine as for the front you

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.709 
the rear is fine as for the front you
will<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:46.399> right<00:00:47.399> here<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.789> I'm<00:00:48.149> scoring<00:00:48.450> on

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
will see right here is I'm scoring on

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
will see right here is I'm scoring on
the<00:00:48.750> inside<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:50.000> both<00:00:51.000> sides<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:52.160> which<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the inside on both sides of it which is

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
the inside on both sides of it which is
pretty<00:00:53.340> bad<00:00:54.860> no<00:00:55.860> doubt<00:00:56.239> if<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.660> ad<00:00:58.280> turbine

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
pretty bad no doubt if the ad turbine

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
pretty bad no doubt if the ad turbine
shaft<00:00:59.730> hadn't<00:01:00.329> been<00:01:00.510> balanced<00:01:01.260> correctly<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
shaft hadn't been balanced correctly I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.350 
shaft hadn't been balanced correctly I
wouldn't<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.129> had<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.340> problem<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:05.010> know

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
wouldn't have had this problem you know

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.679 
wouldn't have had this problem you know
after<00:01:06.360> point<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.110> apart<00:01:07.820> I'm<00:01:08.820> left<00:01:09.150> with

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
after point at all apart I'm left with

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.420 
after point at all apart I'm left with
the<00:01:09.840> internals<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:10.680> show<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.070> how

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the internals here I'll show you how

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.390 
the internals here I'll show you how
badly<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.270> bent<00:01:14.600> just<00:01:15.600> by<00:01:16.009> giving<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.220> bit

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
badly this is bent just by giving a bit

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.190 
badly this is bent just by giving a bit
of<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> turn<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.990> sit<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:20.549> know

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.899 

yeah<00:01:26.200> when<00:01:26.409> I<00:01:26.470> got<00:01:26.500> closer<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.159> some<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.820> these

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
yeah when I got closer to some of these

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.330 
yeah when I got closer to some of these
fins<00:01:28.270> on<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.869> turbo<00:01:29.080> you'll<00:01:29.890> see<00:01:30.159> that

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
fins on the turbo you'll see that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.980 
fins on the turbo you'll see that
they've<00:01:30.549> worn<00:01:30.760> away<00:01:30.940> with<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:31.720> this

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
they've worn away with is this

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.120 
they've worn away with is this
particular<00:01:32.200> part<00:01:32.619> you're<00:01:32.800> looking<00:01:32.830> at

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
particular part you're looking at

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.149 
particular part you're looking at
straight<00:01:33.400> ahead<00:01:33.520> now<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.619> fen's<00:01:35.619> themselves

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
straight ahead now the fen's themselves

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.620 
straight ahead now the fen's themselves
have<00:01:36.310> been<00:01:36.430> putting<00:01:36.850> one<00:01:37.000> away<00:01:37.180> by<00:01:37.360> at<00:01:37.420> least

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
have been putting one away by at least

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.469 
have been putting one away by at least
two<00:01:37.960> milk<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.490> gives<00:01:39.729> an<00:01:39.850> indication<00:01:39.970> how

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
two milk so that gives an indication how

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.620 
two milk so that gives an indication how
badly<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:40.990> was<00:01:41.080> bent<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:42.729> unbalanced<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.540> the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
badly it was bent or unbalanced to the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.649 
badly it was bent or unbalanced to the
correct<00:01:45.690> yeah<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:47.800> seems<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.220> be<00:01:48.369> okay<00:01:48.790> it's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
correct yeah that seems to be okay it's

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.219 
correct yeah that seems to be okay it's
not<00:01:49.840> much<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.759> difference<00:01:51.759> here<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.149> stop<00:01:53.110> it

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
not much of a difference here to stop it

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.040 
not much of a difference here to stop it
from<00:01:53.320> boosting<00:01:53.800> but<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.420> evidence<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.810> sort

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
from boosting but the evidence is sort

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.260 
from boosting but the evidence is sort
of<00:01:56.110> on<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.410> rear<00:01:56.590> side<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:57.039> it<00:01:57.160> I'm<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:58.000> only

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
of on the rear side of it I'm the only

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.060 
of on the rear side of it I'm the only
external<00:01:58.750> saw<00:01:59.080> in<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> agency<00:01:59.860> there's<00:02:00.039> a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
external saw in the agency there's a

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.980 
external saw in the agency there's a
buildup<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.520> oil<00:02:00.759> on<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.149> outside<00:02:01.479> I'm<00:02:01.780> dare

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
buildup of oil on the outside I'm dare

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.230 
buildup of oil on the outside I'm dare
say<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.649> inside<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.039> its<00:02:03.340> sales<00:02:04.000> are

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
say that the inside of its sales are

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.430 
say that the inside of its sales are
gone<00:02:05.039> so<00:02:06.039> hence<00:02:06.399> why<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:07.179> no<00:02:07.390> longer<00:02:07.660> boo

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
gone so hence why this is no longer boo

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.540 
gone so hence why this is no longer boo
sufficiently<00:02:09.239> or<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.600> Mara<00:02:10.810> didn't<00:02:11.170> boost

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
sufficiently or that Mara didn't boost

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.430 
sufficiently or that Mara didn't boost
is<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.610> red<00:02:12.970> zero<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.750> boost<00:02:13.959> level<00:02:14.260> so

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
is a red zero on the boost level so

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.720 
is a red zero on the boost level so
therefore<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.750> got<00:02:16.750> me<00:02:16.870> buggin<00:02:17.110> why<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:18.400> didn't

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
therefore it got me buggin why it didn't

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.080 
therefore it got me buggin why it didn't
anyway<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:20.260> get<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.410> gist<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.910> is
