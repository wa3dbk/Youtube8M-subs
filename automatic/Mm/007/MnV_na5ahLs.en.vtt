00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.680
 many of you have heard me 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.800
 invited to work in lenovo and you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.990
 probably such Chinese just thought 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.230
 what is this steve jobs i will tell you by 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.640
 the secret of this but look how cool 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.390
 the thing i'm over design is like a tablet nose 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.730
 tube but I wanted him to work on 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 finger batteries I cut 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.769
 wings 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.369
 But I do not understand very well 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.370
 gadgets i'm more a visionary crater and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.390
 so I give the word to Natasha she is like 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.710
 a specialist will tell you much more 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.750
 hello everyone today on our review 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.750
 lenovo yoga tablet 8 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.820
 lenovo do not cease to invent new 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.440
 formats transformable arrange 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.230
 It feels like a Chinese company 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.120
 there is a whole department controlling availability 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.340
 hinged joints produced 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.560
 there is no production filth it was removed 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.690
 rotating device for revision 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.580
 yoga tablet is similar to the floating magicpad 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.220
 well, or on a very thin tablet 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.260
 inserted in an elegant dock here 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.300
 just unplug it here will not work 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.220
 Yes, and really do not want to put 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.650
 the tablet on the table is convenient for 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.390
 Browsing angle is not enough 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.490
 increase Odessa to watch a movie 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.840
 cranked the lower part and here's to you 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.030
 stable stand 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.369
 I wanted to read a book thanks 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.260
 stunted yoga handles very comfortable 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.570
 keep one hand by the way i come up 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.060
 another way for example in an airplane 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.400
 open the stand hang the tablet on 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.530
 the back in front sitting on a hook 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.170
 it turns out actually entertaining 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.860
 do not want to lower the system and the table 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.310
 I am a warrior under the old carcass of the CIS 5 excellent 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.140
 the decision to keep the tablet first 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.300
 horizontally and your rindo is not very 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.070
 comfortable but rather unaccustomed 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.960
 the fact that in your hands constantly 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.730
 there is a cylindrical volume 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.760
 even metal life in yoga is a lot and ends 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.130
 and the hinge and frame under the display where 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.440
 it is used very sensibly in zones 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.420
 which you will most often touch 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.220
 Essentially plastic in this only back 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.590
 lid way is quite nice to the touch 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.200
 all the buttons and holes are located 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.340
 Traditionally, except for round-up 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.290
 the end of the stand 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.150
 you canâ€™t miss the same size 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.120
 here would be a smaller move and clarity 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.099
 pressing higher assembled tablet perfectly but 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.959
 for its minimum thickness by all 3 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.129
 millimeter means of course 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.230
 the thinnest place 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.150
 if you push hard on the back cover 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.340
 divorce appears on display 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.010
 well, and the stand could open 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.780
 easier thanks to the convenient grip tablet 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.360
 it seems much easier than it is 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.099
 business and quite a considerable weight in 400 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.440
 grams almost not felt 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.750
 stereo placement is best not 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.739
 think of it right below the display and always 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.110
 look at you 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.060
 that's just the sound though loud but low 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.099
 frequencies are missing as a class 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.250
 someone will say that the idea is as old as the world 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.620
 and that sony tablet s already had a thickening to 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.390
 upper bound but there it was rather 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.579
 design element stylization under 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.670
 the magazine is not for convenience 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.220
 display as the name suggests 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.980
 8-inch with a resolution of 1280 by 800 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.200
 dots made by gps technology and 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.810
 covered with some kind of protective glass without 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.299
 proper name being 188 is by 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.129
 today's areotino times a little but 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.799
 overall the picture looks pretty 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.000
 smooth let's say smoother than that 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.880
 first ipad mini 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.099
 wide viewing angles too 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.200
 claims and should fall for working with 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.389
 tablet in the sun in general display 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.209
 good but study in what tablet 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.099
 presented at the end of 2013 I want 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.620
 ask the question why not full hd 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.329
 Well, that he already ran away to the train in general 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.540
 then I myself can give an answer to this 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.430
 question in a nutshell a similar platform 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.889
 hardly you drew higher 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.090
 resolution based on quad 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:04:00.489
 processor mtv-82 15 running on 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.150
 a frequency of 1 2 gigahertz with a graphic 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.669
 power vr sgx544 core with one gigabyte 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.620
 ram and sixteen and phases 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.210
 There is support for micro sd card 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.440
 daily work with a plan 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.540
 this does not deliver any 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.880
 discomfort interface works on 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.250
 surprise smoothly page in browser 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.470
 boot fast and only in the newest 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.360
 and graphically challenging games when 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.910
 using maximum settings 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.190
 graphics observed fps sagging here 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.500
 for example asphalt 8 as you see work 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.480
 imperfectly average performance 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.430
 confirm from synthetic tests 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.950
 but get the video playing without 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.420
 problems and in a variety of formats will be 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.120
 3g versions available 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.430
 but gps chip is everywhere and natasha is closer 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.800
 So what is there at all so stuck here 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.950
 observed that first of all it 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.720
 the platform is not famous for crazy 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.980
 and high speed 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.320
 energy efficiency add it up 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.870
 6000mAh battery shooting 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.060
 hours and we get the most autonomous 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.120
 android tablet today lenovo 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.010
 state 18 hours of work and our tests 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.520
 confirmed something is not too far from 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.800
 truths 17 hours reading 16 hours and the form 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.780
 video and almost 10 hours of play it 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.300
 almost two times more than 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.750
 average tablet on wasps from 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.630
 google android here version 422 is decorated 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.760
 shell elena gross why decorated well 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.800
 if only because I personally light 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.930
 tones are much more imposing black 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.390
 There are you android casemates 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.940
 nice icons nice animations 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.680
 the shell is completely devoid of the application menu 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.390
 and all installed programs at once 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.980
 get on the desktop 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.650
 where you can sort them by 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.510
 Daddies are shorter than the number 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.090
 preset programs moderate 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.720
 office antivirus package before file 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.910
 manager 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.890
 well, my beloved or novarskie see by 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.050
 energy saving you click different 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.760
 buttons and enjoy growing numbers 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.400
 battery life which is true from 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.710
 far from relatives in general the shell is simple 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.380
 in mastering nice external in the next 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.840
 just want 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.400
 see and performance even on average 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.790
 iron all just broken 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.800
 1 and 6 and 5 megapixel cameras 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.960
 frontal can and with the 9th and here is the main 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.060
 despite the autofocus even some 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.710
 settings gives pictures and series I 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.080
 she said she learned to be realistic 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.720
 paint with oil paints easier camera 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.780
 for tablet this is optional Yaga product 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.900
 pleasant and pleasant impression 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.880
 and it works quickly the main thing is long and 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.670
 use it almost always 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.070
 more convenient than a regular tablet and how 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.410
 wish a good friend all the best and 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.020
 full hd screen and higher 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.820
 performance but it would require 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.310
 another platform would decrease 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.890
 autonomy and device most likely 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.670
 would lose its uniqueness and price 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.190
 was higher 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.890
 and so respecting the delicate balance of lenovo yoga 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.380
 tablet will be a great companion for those 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.320
 who is acting and for those who are often on the road 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.030
 be and you are a friend to us like us 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.000
 and subscribe to our channel 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:02.590
 and if we are direct super best friends gave 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.590
 graze this video in the social network 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:09.720
 for now 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.720
 magas 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.010
 agnia 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.510
 but
