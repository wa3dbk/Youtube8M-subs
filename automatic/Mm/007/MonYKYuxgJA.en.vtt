00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.490
 here we are going to do 20,000 km 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:54.550
 in the fruit machu picchu and now it does 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:59.220
 very cold to pass from the pass of 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.850
 Malaga at 4200 meters 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.240
 now there is enough fog 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.810
 a few feet ago I was 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.230
 falling slush then we assume that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.040
 keep asking but we do not see it anymore 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.890
 and we're going to start defending each check 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.720
 and good that we arrived until 2006 reader 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.900
 natural 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.980
 and little by little the roads 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.980
 and dangerous 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 at least in this way improve 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.440
 two 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 good 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.619
 we just commented our ways to 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.860
 the ruins of Machu Picchu the 3 of the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.860
 morning 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:18.130
 like in the hydroelectric we are going to 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.130
 grab ear if we are going to grab the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.020
 train tracks and follow them and have 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.890
 good to go to the tracks 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.890
 and gradually forward 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.420
 to see what time we arrived and at least 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.420
 not long ago still very cold 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.970
 at the wheel 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.160
 Canada 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.590
 two 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.360
 to me 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.460
 the notes that I'm going to like about two 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:17.870
 part time two hours walking 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.210
 we got lost at the beginning and at the end 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.850
 because we did not know very well why 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.910
 way to take 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.000
 we have walked about 8 km 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.850
 pri more or less 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.530
 and quite early and not much is coming 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.280
 good walking people are basically 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.930
 the two 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:43.379
 all the people are boarding by bus 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.920
 and it happens to a lot of people and that 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.580
 You can also do it running 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.580
 good 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.390
 good so far 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.400
 must give advantage that then he will cry 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.400
 neither do you have to 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.400
 encourage and maritime encouragement 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.860
 so much running and we go at the same pace 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.860
 nor is it 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.460
 it is normal to do it by bus on 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.310
 style is the same 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.670
 is this 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.940
 much more healthy fun prove it 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.940
 Andrea 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.949
 we reach more people 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.780
 I have a good time strong human 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.080
 note in which the mother did not appear 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.440
 It looks like shopping center and the subway 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.440
 together 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.500
 all tourists are getting together 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.240
 normal enter through the normal input and 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.240
 everyone is doing link to 30 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.190
 yes 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.460
 it's the fight 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.870
 plus
