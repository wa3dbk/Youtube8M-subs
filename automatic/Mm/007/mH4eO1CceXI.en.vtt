hospital II and I've got the m8000
Warren<00:00:09.030> Lynch<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.630> first<00:00:10.349> thing<00:00:10.530> we

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
Warren Lynch and the first thing we

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.919 
Warren Lynch and the first thing we
needed<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.519> pull<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.450> line<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
needed to do was pull the line out a

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.930 
needed to do was pull the line out a
little<00:00:13.259> bit<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> synthetic<00:00:14.250> line<00:00:14.700> and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
little bit this is a synthetic line and

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.320 
little bit this is a synthetic line and
then<00:00:16.070> we<00:00:17.070> did<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.880> could<00:00:18.060> remove

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
then we did that so that we could remove

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.689 
then we did that so that we could remove
the<00:00:18.539> fairlead<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.070> bracket<00:00:20.430> will<00:00:20.550> go

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the fairlead because the bracket will go

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.689 
the fairlead because the bracket will go
on<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.510> inside<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.289> Fairly<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.519> there's

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
on the inside of the Fairly so there's

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.630 
on the inside of the Fairly so there's
two<00:00:24.119> bolts<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.080> hold<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.590> fairlead<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.099> so

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
two bolts that hold the fairlead on so

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.800 
two bolts that hold the fairlead on so
just<00:00:26.760> remove<00:00:27.060> those<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:29.029> take<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.150> off<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
just remove those and take it off the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.410 
just remove those and take it off the
rope<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.730> that's<00:00:32.730> pretty<00:00:32.940> dirty<00:00:33.239> behind

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
rope and that's pretty dirty behind

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.150 
rope and that's pretty dirty behind
there<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.320> paint<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.829> off<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> little

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
there so I just paint it off a little

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
there so I just paint it off a little
bit<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> wet<00:00:35.910> cloth<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.649> then<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.800> took

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
bit with the wet cloth and then I took

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.660 
bit with the wet cloth and then I took
the<00:00:38.160> bracket<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.670> put<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.629> over<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
the bracket and put it right on over the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.090 
the bracket and put it right on over the
the<00:00:41.670> fairly<00:00:42.030> bolts<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.620> then<00:00:46.620> put<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the fairly bolts and then put the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.360 
the fairly bolts and then put the
fairlead<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.820> over<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.710> inside<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
fairlead on over that and inside the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.650 
fairlead on over that and inside the
same<00:00:50.550> bolts<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.199> before<00:00:56.660> then

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
same bolts that it was on before then

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.740 
same bolts that it was on before then
you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.710> ahead<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.010> put<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.539> nuts<00:01:00.539> back

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you can go ahead and put the nuts back

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:12.580 
you can go ahead and put the nuts back
onto<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> bolts

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.649 

you'll<00:01:13.219> want<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.549> use<00:01:13.609> a<00:01:13.729> wrench<00:01:14.060> on<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.479> back

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
you'll want to use a wrench on the back

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.410 
you'll want to use a wrench on the back
so<00:01:15.049> that<00:01:15.079> the<00:01:15.469> the<00:01:16.340> bolt<00:01:16.579> doesn't<00:01:16.759> turn<00:01:17.149> with

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
so that the the bolt doesn't turn with

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:28.220 
so that the the bolt doesn't turn with
the<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:18.289> nut<00:01:18.469> as<00:01:19.130> you're<00:01:19.399> tightening<00:01:19.549> it

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.630 

then<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.980> put<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.250> hook<00:01:29.880> back<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> line<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
then I put the hook back on the line and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.960 
then I put the hook back on the line and
we<00:01:32.640> attempted<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.390> put<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.700> mounting<00:01:35.700> plate

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we attempted to put the mounting plate

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.670 
we attempted to put the mounting plate
on<00:01:36.150> over<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:38.010> hook<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.360> see

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
on over the the hook but as you can see

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
on over the the hook but as you can see
it<00:01:40.680> didn't<00:01:40.980> quite<00:01:41.070> fit<00:01:41.190> very<00:01:41.820> well<00:01:41.910> with<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it didn't quite fit very well with the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.100 
it didn't quite fit very well with the
hook<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:43.550> fact<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:44.730> didn't<00:01:44.970> fit<00:01:45.090> at<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:45.300> so<00:01:46.020> we

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
hook on fact it didn't fit at all so we

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
hook on fact it didn't fit at all so we
had<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> take<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.560> off<00:01:46.680> take<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.550> hook<00:01:47.700> back

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
had to take it off take the hook back

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.120 
had to take it off take the hook back
off<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:49.520> put<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> line<00:01:50.850> back<00:01:51.210> into<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
off and put the line back into the the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.060 
off and put the line back into the the
fairlead<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:54.200> it's<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.380> easy<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.800> get

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
fairlead and it's really easy to get

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.670 
fairlead and it's really easy to get
this<00:01:56.280> bracket<00:01:57.000> off<00:01:57.120> and<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.050> when<00:01:58.530> you're

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
on the trail you can easily just take

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.850 
on the trail you can easily just take
the<00:02:00.150> license<00:02:00.570> plate<00:02:00.780> off<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.200> put<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.770> hook

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the license plate off and put the hook

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.460 
the license plate off and put the hook
back<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.660> do<00:02:03.870> that<00:02:04.050> while<00:02:04.290> you're

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
back on and you can do that while you're

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.600 
back on and you can do that while you're
waiting<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:04.950> tires<00:02:05.640> tear<00:02:05.940> down<00:02:06.180> and
