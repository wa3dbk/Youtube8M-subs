00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.320 
we're gonna compare with this concealer
because<00:02:02.950> if<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.310> concealer<00:02:03.789> doesn't<00:02:04.240> work

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
because if this concealer doesn't work

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.009 
because if this concealer doesn't work
as<00:02:04.509> well<00:02:04.929> I<00:02:05.110> just<00:02:05.470> prefer<00:02:05.649> using<00:02:06.720> using<00:02:07.720> up<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
as well I just prefer using using up the

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.529 
as well I just prefer using using up the
foundation<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:08.679> have<00:02:08.979> right<00:02:09.940> now<00:02:10.149> because

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
foundation that I have right now because

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.410 
foundation that I have right now because
I<00:02:11.019> bought<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.910> quite<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:12.940> few<00:02:13.030> shades

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
I bought it in quite a few shades

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.960 
I bought it in quite a few shades
lighter<00:02:13.959> than<00:02:14.080> my<00:02:14.410> skin<00:02:14.440> tone<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.280> can't<00:02:15.760> use

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
lighter than my skin tone so I can't use

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.630 
lighter than my skin tone so I can't use
it<00:02:16.150> as<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.299> foundation<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.440> have<00:02:18.280> found<00:02:18.489> that

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
it as a foundation so I have found that

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.560 
it as a foundation so I have found that
ignore<00:02:19.209> destroyed<00:02:19.600> eyes<00:02:19.840> as<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.620> concealer<00:02:21.570> so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
ignore destroyed eyes as a concealer so

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.069 
ignore destroyed eyes as a concealer so
I'm<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:22.870> gonna<00:02:22.959> put<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.410> on<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.920> side<00:02:25.079> and

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
I'm just gonna put that on this side and

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.620 
I'm just gonna put that on this side and
I'm<00:02:26.320> also<00:02:26.590> gonna<00:02:26.890> set<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.730> other<00:02:28.000> side<00:02:28.269> even

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
I'm also gonna set this other side even

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.430 
I'm also gonna set this other side even
though<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:28.900> more<00:02:29.110> than<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.470> drying<00:02:29.829> side

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
though it's more than that drying side

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.650 
though it's more than that drying side
the<00:02:32.440> next<00:02:32.799> one<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.160> little<00:02:33.400> bit<00:02:33.670> more<00:02:34.239> do

within this one so far both of them seem

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.860 
within this one so far both of them seem
to<00:02:38.680> cover<00:02:38.980> pretty<00:02:39.940> much<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.359> same<00:02:40.570> which<00:02:40.840> is

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.600 
even after you said it that's that's the
deal-breaker<00:03:57.910> for<00:03:58.030> me<00:03:58.210> in<00:03:58.420> this<00:03:58.660> one<00:03:59.020> I<00:03:59.610> would

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
deal-breaker for me in this one I would

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.640 
deal-breaker for me in this one I would
not<00:04:00.880> purchase<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.390> again<00:04:01.480> because<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.470> did

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
not purchase it again because it did

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.560 
not purchase it again because it did
Chris<00:04:02.980> really<00:04:03.220> bad<00:04:03.460> it<00:04:03.820> did<00:04:04.030> not<00:04:04.150> even<00:04:04.240> last

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
Chris really bad it did not even last

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.020 
Chris really bad it did not even last
the<00:04:04.750> whole<00:04:05.050> day<00:04:05.290> without<00:04:05.650> creasing<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:06.880> do

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the whole day without creasing so I do

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.060 
the whole day without creasing so I do
not<00:04:07.360> like<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:07.690> concealer<00:04:08.350> I<00:04:08.560> don't

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
recommend it because there are cheaper

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.760 
recommend it because there are cheaper
concealers<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.790> cover<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:14.350> one<00:04:14.500> over<00:04:14.650> here

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.590 
do not recommend the next one it chris
is<00:05:11.680> really<00:05:12.160> bad<00:05:12.340> in<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.730> really<00:05:13.060> short<00:05:13.330> amount

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
is really bad in a really short amount

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.310 
is really bad in a really short amount
of<00:05:13.990> time

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
of time

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.710 
of time
it<00:05:14.860> covers<00:05:15.220> nice<00:05:15.430> but<00:05:15.669> it's<00:05:16.210> just<00:05:16.360> not<00:05:16.570> worth

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
it covers nice but it's just not worth

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.630 
it covers nice but it's just not worth
it<00:05:16.900> because<00:05:17.020> of<00:05:17.169> the<00:05:17.380> creasing<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:17.950> it<00:05:18.340> just

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
it because of the creasing and it just

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.580 
it because of the creasing and it just
it<00:05:19.060> makes<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.450> look<00:05:19.570> bad<00:05:19.780> when<00:05:20.140> your

it makes you look bad when your

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.040 
it makes you look bad when your
concealer<00:05:21.100> is<00:05:21.220> creasing<00:05:21.669> really<00:05:21.910> bad<00:05:22.060> so<00:05:22.780> that

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
concealer is creasing really bad so that

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.670 
concealer is creasing really bad so that
