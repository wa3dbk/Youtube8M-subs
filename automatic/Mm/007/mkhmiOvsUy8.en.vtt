slide and then hit this twice I do an
up-down

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.850 

I<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.659> it's<00:01:26.080> hard<00:01:26.259> to<00:01:26.290> actually<00:01:26.439> do<00:01:26.680> that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
I do it it's hard to actually do that

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.380 
I do it it's hard to actually do that
part<00:01:27.070> slower<00:01:27.369> but<00:01:27.580> let<00:01:27.729> me<00:01:27.820> see<00:01:28.000> how<00:01:28.119> I<00:01:28.150> put

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
part slower but let me see how I put

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.310 
part slower but let me see how I put
this<00:01:28.509> all<00:01:28.689> together<00:01:28.840> let<00:01:29.200> me<00:01:29.259> back<00:01:29.439> this<00:01:29.650> up

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
this all together let me back this up

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:52.940 
this all together let me back this up
okay<00:01:33.420> hands

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.550 

so<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.640> going<00:01:53.820> from<00:01:54.229> two<00:01:56.990> six<00:01:59.270> seven<00:02:00.500> okay<00:02:01.500> so

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so it's going from two six seven okay so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.820 
so it's going from two six seven okay so
when<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:05.100> quick<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.700> open

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
when you do that it's quick it's open

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.809 
when you do that it's quick it's open

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
open a string after you hit this third

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.990 
open a string after you hit this third
note<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:14.040> third<00:02:14.550> string<00:02:14.959> second<00:02:15.959> fret

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
note this third string second fret

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.040 
note this third string second fret
immediately<00:02:18.000> go<00:02:18.150> here<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.450> hit<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:18.720> twice

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.020

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.990 

this<00:02:32.080> whole<00:02:32.890> thing<00:02:33.100> together<00:02:33.490> sounds<00:02:33.850> like

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
this whole thing together sounds like

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:55.820 
this whole thing together sounds like
this

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:10.199 

okay<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:56.890> we<00:02:57.250> get<00:02:57.400> this

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:24.130 

okay<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.129> the<00:03:15.220> entire<00:03:17.110> page<00:03:18.110> oh<00:03:22.959> one<00:03:23.959> more

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
okay that is the entire page oh one more

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.960 
okay that is the entire page oh one more
time<00:03:24.349> clean<00:03:24.650> hopefully<00:03:25.459> about<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.819> right

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
time clean hopefully about the right

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:41.440 
time clean hopefully about the right
speed

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.520 

and<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.810> into<00:03:43.140> what<00:03:43.260> we've<00:03:43.380> already

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
and you go into what we've already

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.750 
and you go into what we've already
covered<00:03:43.830> three<00:03:44.280> times<00:03:44.660> put<00:03:45.660> on<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.900> delay<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
covered three times put on the delay and

00:03:46.760 --> 00:04:03.600 
covered three times put on the delay and
it<00:03:47.760> fills<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.060> all<00:03:48.150> out

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.400 

I<00:04:05.220> think<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:06.310> came<00:04:06.460> out<00:04:06.610> fairly<00:04:07.090> well<00:04:07.240> if<00:04:08.230> it

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
I think that came out fairly well if it

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.540 
I think that came out fairly well if it
was<00:04:08.500> something<00:04:08.680> wasn't<00:04:08.980> clear<00:04:09.160> as<00:04:09.250> always

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
was something wasn't clear as always

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.460 
was something wasn't clear as always
email<00:04:10.210> a<00:04:10.270> question<00:04:10.420> happy<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.140> post<00:04:11.320> a

email a question happy to post a

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.950 
email a question happy to post a
correction<00:04:11.920> etc<00:04:12.490> don't<00:04:13.210> claim<00:04:13.480> for<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.870> be

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
correction etc don't claim for it to be

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.349 
correction etc don't claim for it to be
100%<00:04:14.620> perfect<00:04:15.130> but<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.490> think<00:04:16.030> it's<00:04:16.180> pretty

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
100% perfect but I think it's pretty

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.360 
100% perfect but I think it's pretty
darn<00:04:16.630> close<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.260> it's<00:04:17.500> not<00:04:17.739> too<00:04:17.980> difficult<00:04:18.310> to

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
darn close and it's not too difficult to

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.340 
darn close and it's not too difficult to
play<00:04:18.489> as<00:04:18.670> you<00:04:18.850> can<00:04:19.000> see<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:20.109> couple

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
play as you can see just a couple

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.430 
play as you can see just a couple
strings<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.859> got<00:04:20.980> to<00:04:21.070> skip<00:04:21.280> in<00:04:21.430> there<00:04:22.110> but<00:04:23.110> it

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
strings you got to skip in there but it

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.810 
strings you got to skip in there but it
won't<00:04:23.650> take<00:04:23.830> long<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:24.190> learn<00:04:24.250> this<00:04:24.550> part

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
won't take long to learn this part

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.190 
won't take long to learn this part
actually<00:04:24.970> this<00:04:25.450> part<00:04:25.660> here<00:04:25.960> with<00:04:26.080> the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
actually this part here with the

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.300 
actually this part here with the
strumming<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.620> probably<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.950> little<00:04:27.130> more

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
strumming is probably a little more

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.340 
strumming is probably a little more
difficult<00:04:27.730> for<00:04:27.820> people<00:04:27.940> than<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.780> arpeggios

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
difficult for people than the arpeggios

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.810 
difficult for people than the arpeggios
are<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:30.520> onto<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.240> next<00:04:31.450> tutorial
