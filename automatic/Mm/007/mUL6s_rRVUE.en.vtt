00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 - the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.400
 a microprocessor is the brain of a 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.679
 operator 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.709
 is formed by a microchip that goes 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.119
 placed on an electronic card 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.250
 prepare the chip for installation in 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.939
 the card is a delicate operation and 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 of precision 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.350
 the scientists created the first 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.150
 computer in 1937 but he only knew 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.930
 algebra 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.670
 the first multipurpose computer was created in 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.879
 1946 and it was as big as 20 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.260
 refrigerators in the 50s 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.720
 transistors replaced the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.699
 bulky vacuum tubes after the 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.800
 integrated circuits replaced the 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.519
 transistors but the biggest breakthrough came 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.230
 in 1971 with the microprocessors all 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.019
 the components were in a tiny 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.769
 chip that was what made the 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.769
 personal computer 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.570
 everything starts with a square of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 pottery called substrate on the irÃ¡ 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.090
 the microchip a machine applies to the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.280
 substrate surface a layer of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 flux a chemical agent that leaves it 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.610
 sticky and that will hold the microchip 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.610
 until I 'm soldier 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.460
 In this factory, the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.540
 already made microchips with all 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.540
 circuits in place 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.140
 a microchip is placed on each 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.140
 substratum 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.620
 an infrared light and the machine to 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.620
 place the chip in the right place 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.259
 a sample is taken from the chain of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.130
 assembly to verify the position with 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.130
 a microscope 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.560
 the next step is welding in a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.239
 oven at 365 degrees the heat of the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.100
 tiny drops of tin chip 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.140
 joining it to the substrate 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.180
 then everything is prepared for 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.520
 weld an aluminum cap on each 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.550
 microchip in the box will have two 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.870
 functions protect the zip and dispel the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.870
 heat that this generates 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.590
 two 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.360
 a robotic arm picks up four caps 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.990
 each time and place them on the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.990
 microchips 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.629
 then they go to the oven 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.980
 welding where they will be for an hour 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.980
 at 150 degrees 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.200
 the next step is to create the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.819
 electrical connections that will connect the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.510
 microprocessor with card 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.640
 computer electronics everything starts 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.430
 with tiny cylindrical pieces of 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.829
 tin called columns the tin is 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.900
 electricity conductor a gigantic 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.819
 lattice vibrates the columns through 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.220
 suction until they fall through the holes 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.049
 in the fall they line up vertically 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.049
 so they can bind to the substrate 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.460
 a machine spreads a thick paste 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.600
 adhesive and then paste the columns 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.600
 from the bottom 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.569
 a robotic arm places the chip that 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.230
 carries the substrate on the columns 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.230
 pasted 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.549
 the result is a microchip with a thousand 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.549
 connections 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.769
 to get some connections are used 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.840
 tin balls instead of columns 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.479
 because schools are more robust and 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.639
 reliable they also pass through 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.039
 a suction sieve only that instead 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.870
 of with paste are stuck with flux the 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.970
 same sticky chemical agent that 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.419
 used to place the microchip over 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.419
 the substrate 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.210
 Y 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.210
 two 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.810
 once finished the microchip goes through 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.700
 a water bath and solvents for 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.660
 eliminate any surplus of fluxes 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.660
 or other waste 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.979
 the next stop is the control of 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.030
 quality up to 12 hours in an oven at 140 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.030
 degrees Celsius 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.310
 from here the microprocessor goes to 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.379
 another factory where they released him to a 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.610
 electronic card that afterwards 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.610
 will put in a computer
