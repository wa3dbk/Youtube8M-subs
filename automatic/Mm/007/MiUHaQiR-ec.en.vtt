stuff so yeah I guess it's kind of cool

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.800 
stuff so yeah I guess it's kind of cool
and<00:06:35.460> then<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.150> next<00:06:36.240> time<00:06:36.360> you<00:06:36.510> can<00:06:36.570> just<00:06:36.720> loop

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
and then the next time you can just loop

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.830 
and then the next time you can just loop
it<00:06:36.900> again<00:06:37.790> so<00:06:38.790> that's<00:06:39.150> that's<00:06:39.450> not<00:06:39.600> too<00:06:39.810> bad

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
it again so that's that's not too bad

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.500 
it again so that's that's not too bad
you<00:06:40.140> can<00:06:40.290> do<00:06:40.770> some<00:06:40.950> plays<00:06:41.160> and<00:06:43.910> i<00:06:44.910> think<00:06:45.300> that's

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
you can do some plays and i think that's

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.340 
you can do some plays and i think that's
it<00:06:46.430> yeah<00:06:47.430> that's<00:06:47.790> all<00:06:47.940> the<00:06:48.060> new<00:06:48.180> cards<00:06:48.600> so<00:06:49.290> i

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
it yeah that's all the new cards so i

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.130 
it yeah that's all the new cards so i
guess<00:06:49.500> it's<00:06:49.680> four<00:06:49.860> or<00:06:49.920> five<00:06:50.100> monsters<00:06:50.400> but<00:06:50.880> i

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
guess it's four or five monsters but i

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.390 
guess it's four or five monsters but i
