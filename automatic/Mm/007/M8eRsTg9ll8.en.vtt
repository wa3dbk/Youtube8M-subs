the span length of two by tens that's

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.609 
the span length of two by tens that's
actually<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> fourteen<00:00:26.099> foot<00:00:26.310> span<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.659> they

set of stairs that go down here that set
of<00:00:39.690> stairs

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of stairs

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.620

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
right there on my flashlight is this is

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.020 
right there on my flashlight is this is
a<00:00:48.630> gap<00:00:48.870> that's<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:50.400> that<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.790> is<00:00:51.000> that

a gap that's there what that is is that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.330 
a gap that's there what that is is that
the<00:00:51.210> stair<00:00:51.720> structure<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:53.100> built

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the stair structure was built

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.370 
the stair structure was built
differently<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.240> the<00:00:54.420> actual<00:00:54.660> deck

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
differently from the actual deck

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.530 
differently from the actual deck
structure<00:00:55.680> what's<00:00:56.580> happened<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.060> if<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> look

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
structure what's happened is if you look

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.670 
structure what's happened is if you look
to<00:00:57.630> my<00:00:57.720> flashlight<00:00:58.170> there<00:00:58.350> you'll<00:00:58.530> see

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to my flashlight there you'll see

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.250 
to my flashlight there you'll see
there's<00:00:59.040> no<00:00:59.310> nails<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.240> that<00:01:00.270> joist<00:01:00.660> hanger<00:01:01.080> on

into<00:01:45.389> this<00:01:45.600> inch<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.109> half<00:01:46.139> of<00:01:46.619> two<00:01:47.609> by<00:01:47.759> ten

into this inch and a half of two by ten

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.569 
into this inch and a half of two by ten
but<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.469> should<00:01:49.709> be<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> double<00:01:50.399> ledger

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
but what should be as a double ledger
