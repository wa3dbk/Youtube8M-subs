 ayahuasca soul medicine 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.220
 edited by bible the book has as 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.320
 base an investigation of nothing less than 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.839
 16 years from the foundation table 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.140
 green of which Nestor Berlanda 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.150
 psychiatrist is the president and I the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.610
 solid anthropologist the vice president 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.430
 this foundation here from the city of 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.680
 rosario has been doing studies on 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.860
 the links between society the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.900
 culture the reality and the conscience and 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.670
 within that framework within that 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.920
 context that has to do with the 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.120
 transpersonal psychology with the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.590
 anthropology of consciousness is that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.560
 We focus our studies on 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.880
 expanded states of consciousness within 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.790
 of 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.160
 in that kind of research we 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.680
 we run into a bit of chance with the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.740
 plant called ayahuasca is a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.810
 traditional medicine from the most areas 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.540
 16 years ago in Argentina nobody 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.600
 I had the slightest idea how very few people 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.370
 I had an idea what this plant was about 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.950
 teacher as they are also called many 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.370
 authors and we embarked then on 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.880
 successive trips to the Amazon jungle 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.430
 where we found some shamans 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.770
 especially the gift antonio muÃ±oz a 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.750
 main informant that is shipibo 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.619
 conibo of his ethnic group we began to perform 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.869
 studies with volunteers at the moment 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.440
 We have more than 100 protocols 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.990
 research with one with a survey 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.520
 validated at the international level created 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.560
 by Dr. Rick Strassmann of the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.990
 new mexico university with which 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.850
 aims to objectify a type experience 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.729
 what happens what are the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.909
 effects of ayahuasca on the mind 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.519
 about the brain and about consciousness 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.970
 we highlight the psychotherapeutic potential 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.410
 which it has the ayahuasca course 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.830
 combined with some type of therapy 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.810
 conventional but there are two aspects in the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.810
 that advances opens the unconscious 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.000
 geographical the personal unconscious and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.150
 On the other hand, it also makes clear the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 existence of that unconscious 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.090
 collective that will apply for this 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.580
 Freud's disciple plane even makes 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.190
 very clear the existence of this 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.550
 transpersonal sphere of consciousness is 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.490
 here where the volunteers in addition to 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.450
 resolve long-standing conflicts 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:55.200
 biographical conflicts 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.220
 that would take years 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.350
 conventional psychotherapy 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.380
 until they have been able to solve it in one 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.900
 night of ceremony session and our 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.750
 two professions are psychiatry for a 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.050
 cultural anthropology side by another 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.170
 evidently 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.670
 much of the book is intended to 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.770
 academic public like to wake up 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.170
 consciousness so that it is known that 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.760
 there is another way of understanding the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.860
 some disease that exists another way 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.020
 of learning this is happening 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.660
 this is a cultural diffusion that no longer 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.190
 you can stand the ayahuasca came from the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.650
 Amazon rainforest that is already penetrating 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.620
 in the big cities from everywhere 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.720
 It is not meant for those people 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.720
 for them to inform themselves so that 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.780
 have a little theory in your hand and about 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.220
 everything for people in general and that 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.640
 also the general public that 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.980
 know that there are other 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.700
 realities other levels of consciousness 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.750
 very deep and that maybe still 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.290
 it costs a lot for western science 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.280
 recognize it 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.280
 to me
