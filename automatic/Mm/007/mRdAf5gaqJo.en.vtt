other area basically the fat is removed

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.169 
other area basically the fat is removed
by<00:00:26.500> sucking<00:00:27.130> it<00:00:27.220> out<00:00:27.339> with<00:00:27.609> very<00:00:27.849> small

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
by sucking it out with very small

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.079 
by sucking it out with very small
cannulas<00:00:28.810> after<00:00:29.560> fluids<00:00:29.949> being<00:00:30.160> injected<00:00:30.519> to

cannulas after fluids being injected to

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.630 
cannulas after fluids being injected to
help<00:00:31.240> dissolve<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:32.020> fatty<00:00:32.710> tissue<00:00:33.100> and<00:00:33.460> make

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
help dissolve the fatty tissue and make

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.810 
help dissolve the fatty tissue and make
it<00:00:33.790> easier<00:00:34.210> to<00:00:34.450> remove<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.590> fluid<00:00:35.920> also<00:00:36.280> acts

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
it easier to remove the fluid also acts

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.720 
it easier to remove the fluid also acts
to<00:00:37.180> reduce<00:00:37.840> bruising<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:38.620> swelling<00:00:38.800> after

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
to reduce bruising and swelling after

to reduce bruising and swelling after
the<00:00:39.879> surgery<00:00:40.480> by<00:00:40.809> causing<00:00:41.289> constriction<00:00:41.590> in

the surgery by causing constriction in
the<00:00:42.699> blood<00:00:43.270> vessels<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.530> which<00:00:45.219> errors<00:00:45.579> can<00:00:45.760> be

treated well the most common area is
really<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.609> neck<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.449> it's<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.690> central<00:00:50.170> area

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
of the mini facelift her procedures

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.520 
of the mini facelift her procedures
which<00:01:23.890> are<00:01:24.040> available<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.579> the<00:01:24.640> Aurora

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
which are available on the Aurora

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.539 
which are available on the Aurora
website<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:28.509> facial<00:01:28.920> liposuction<00:01:29.920> as

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
website so with facial liposuction as

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.539 
website so with facial liposuction as
opposed<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.680> lob<00:01:32.680> suction<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.070> other<00:01:33.189> areas<00:01:33.430> of

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
opposed to lob suction to other areas of

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.910 
opposed to lob suction to other areas of
the<00:01:33.700> body<00:01:33.850> there's<00:01:34.180> much<00:01:34.390> less<00:01:34.659> fat<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.439> so

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
the body there's much less fat and so

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.969 
the body there's much less fat and so
traditionally<00:01:36.820> less<00:01:37.450> fat<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:37.899> removed<00:01:38.320> so<00:01:38.500> you

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
traditionally less fat is removed so you

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.230 
traditionally less fat is removed so you
can<00:01:39.100> make<00:01:39.250> really<00:01:39.490> very<00:01:39.759> dramatic

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
can make really very dramatic

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.660 
can make really very dramatic
improvements<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.170> neck<00:01:41.439> into<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.890> gel<00:01:42.159> by

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
improvements to the neck into the gel by

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.760 
improvements to the neck into the gel by
removing<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.329> know<00:01:43.450> four<00:01:43.720> or<00:01:43.840> five<00:01:44.079> mils<00:01:44.439> of

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
removing you know four or five mils of

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.850 
removing you know four or five mils of
fat<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.670> interestingly<00:01:46.290> often<00:01:47.290> we<00:01:47.409> will<00:01:47.590> use

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
fat and interestingly often we will use

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.340 
fat and interestingly often we will use
the<00:01:48.070> fatty<00:01:48.280> tissue<00:01:48.579> removed<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.840> build<00:01:50.110> up

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
the fatty tissue removed to build up

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.350 
the fatty tissue removed to build up
other<00:01:50.560> areas<00:01:51.040> so<00:01:51.430> we<00:01:51.549> might<00:01:51.729> want<00:01:51.969> to<00:01:52.030> remove

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
other areas so we might want to remove

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.179 
other areas so we might want to remove
fatty<00:01:52.659> tissue<00:01:52.990> from<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.320> neck<00:01:53.619> from<00:01:54.100> the

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
fatty tissue from the neck from the

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.340 
fatty tissue from the neck from the
jowls<00:01:54.670> but<00:01:54.969> we<00:01:55.570> might<00:01:55.750> need<00:01:55.899> more<00:01:55.960> fatty

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
jowls but we might need more fatty

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.340 
jowls but we might need more fatty
tissue<00:01:56.710> more<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.520> substance<00:01:58.210> in<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.780> lines

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
tissue more and substance in the lines

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.469 
tissue more and substance in the lines
coming<00:01:59.710> down<00:01:59.829> from<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.310> side<00:02:00.549> of<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.820> nose<00:02:01.030> to

coming down from the side of the nose to

main<00:02:04.780> difference<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:05.530> we<00:02:05.740> tend<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.070> use<00:02:06.310> very

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
main difference is we tend to use very

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.060 
main difference is we tend to use very
fine<00:02:07.090> cannulas<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.440> very<00:02:08.680> thin<00:02:09.130> cannulas<00:02:11.070> to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
fine cannulas so very thin cannulas to

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.470 
fine cannulas so very thin cannulas to
remove<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.490> fat<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.970> the

remove the fat in the
the<00:02:13.540> face<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.440> much<00:02:14.650> more<00:02:14.890> delicate<00:02:15.099> area

the face it's a much more delicate area
and<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.599> tend<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.870> use<00:02:17.050> much<00:02:17.319> finer<00:02:18.030> thinner

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and so we tend to use much finer thinner
