want I quit and they said okay go ahead
and<00:01:40.979> quit<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.270> awkward

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and quit so that's a really awkward

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.410 
and quit so that's a really awkward
situation<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> didn't<00:01:45.299> really

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
situation but then it didn't really

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.469 
situation but then it didn't really
materialize<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.640> marvel<00:01:47.970> panel<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.329> least

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
materialize it the marvel panel at least

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660
