00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:04.175
 Let's now go to "Unlikely Scenes" and everyone plays! 

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:11.456
 You out there wrote several suggestions of scenes for us 

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:16.761
 and I'm going to read these suggestions and they make whatever ideas they have. 

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:22.783
 Like, for example ... 'Worst catfish in a cat's stew' 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.368
 Oh the steak ... Oh the steak ... 

00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:31.174
 Meow! [Bell] 

00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:39.632
 Ah, this meat is very good ... Oh! 

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:45.354
 Watch it, it's going to burn! Its not meat, kitty ... [bell] 

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.739
 - How much did you give? - You gave 1.50 ... 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.758
 No, no, no ... I'll pay. [Bell] 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.871
 "Here's your barbecue, ma'am. - Thanks. 

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:09.332
 What have you been looking at? 

00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:13.295
 It's just that I've never seen cannibalism, eh. [Bell] 

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:24.826
 You will now find out 'what not to do at the airplane check-in'. 

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.505
 Are you going to carry some sharp object, anything? 

00:01:29.505 --> 00:01:33.780
 Let's see ... Tchuc! I will. [Bell] 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.382
 - Better dispatch. Dispatch your hand together? - Yes is better. 

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.573
 - Window, window, give me a window! - Sir, there is no window ... 

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:50.664
 "I do not want a hall, I want a window, a window!" - I've already searched, there's no ... 

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:55.641
 [bell] Window. 

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:11.946
 "No, where are you going?" - [whispers] I see flying people. [Bell] 

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:21.339
 'What if NASA were Brazilian'? 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.970
 Go, rocket! [Bell] 

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:40.118
 Let's start the countdown: One, two, three, four! [Bell] 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.194
 Base! Base! Base! 

00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:54.044
 We can not attend at the moment. Our attendants are busy. [Bell] 

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:56.842
 Leave your message after the signal. 

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:03.967
 Approaching us ... 

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:07.015
 Tch! We seem to land. 

00:03:10.097 --> 00:03:11.757
 [Bell] 

00:03:24.513 --> 00:03:29.363
 Guys, I just got some information, oxygen is missing from the ship, 

00:03:29.363 --> 00:03:31.663
 We need to come up with a plan to get them back, if not ... 

00:03:31.663 --> 00:03:35.497
 Gee, it's Friday, six o'clock, bora. [Bell] 

00:03:43.483 --> 00:03:47.415
 'Unusual ways to paint the nail' 

00:03:52.513 --> 00:03:53.982
 [Bell] 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.376
 - What color you want? - Red. 

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:03.676
 - Tchc! - Aaaah! [Bell] 

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.992
 - Just wait now! - It's beautiful! 

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:20.892
 [Bell] 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.965
 You will now see 'Worst philosophical thoughts in the row of the electric chair' 

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:43.078
 I'm next? [Bell] 

00:04:45.342 --> 00:04:47.616
 Turn the queue over! 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.128
 Oh, let's speed it up, I want to die! [Bell] 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.373
 I will not even mention that I am old and I have preference ... [bell] 

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:26.353
 Since we are in Brazil, the chair is damaged, they are released. 

00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:28.537
 Brigado! [Bell] 

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:31.983
 I've been coming here for six weeks already ... 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:43.840
 'The worst sympathy in the world' 

00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:51.161
 Ha ... Ha ... The frog. 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:55.228
 Wow, I had made sympathy for this joke, it did not work! 

00:05:55.228 --> 00:06:02.707
 [bell] [applause] 

00:06:06.714 --> 00:06:10.954
 Even I have been making this sympathy in all "Unlikely Scenes". 

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.094
 It has not worked. 

00:06:26.568 --> 00:06:32.372
 - Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! - My name is Bond. Magneto Bond.
