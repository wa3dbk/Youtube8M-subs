00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:12.210
 Hello, today I can do everything 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.040
 this is now a knife i think you remember him john 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.120
 urgent order because tomorrow is necessary 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:23.720
 give the knife well, respectively, fit 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:26.580
 so you see the process, I have already begun 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.280
 Division I of this here and here 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.490
 polyethylene in my sewer 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:37.190
 50k tubes 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:41.309
 I think in general, heated the whole thing 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.210
 heated up to lay down can be so 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.930
 to tell 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.379
 Well, unfortunately, the process is a little off 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.260
 because there was no camera at hand here 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.170
 if you see a print from a kick in 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.199
 principle stayed on foam plastic to such 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:06.130
 that's the way i put it 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:08.369
 well and the upper part yes this is laminate 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.350
 which I have left after repair and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.240
 the whole thing you think squeezed a vice 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.310
 no just got kicked shop weighing 90 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 kilogram that is it from here and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.990
 crushed well and successfully as you can see 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.060
 crushed it all 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.960
 Well, so it is simple, I did not have time 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.800
 to spin too thick 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.740
 plastic order probably a half 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:44.530
 millimeter doom but such here they will be 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:48.909
 reliable means further yes very much 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.530
 by the way soft stuff for her he 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.470
 solid but meaning what 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.360
 hard not so much with loads 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.149
 there are china side or some other 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.579
 most means what I will do 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.460
 farther farther I am most likely through 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.100
 some bed sheet with the help of this here 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.780
 here's a bunch of it, I'm not showing everything I 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.239
 I think that it is clear how everything will be 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 pass 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.400
 inserted a flat surface on top 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.019
 material and iron all this gonna 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.920
 ironed smooth 3 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.489
 angles are not side angles sorry for 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.489
 extraneous sounds 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.190
 in general, all this will smooth but 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.349
 then turn on show what happened 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.030
 made you shorter than yourself delusion neither 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.069
 horseradish is not convenient to do it with an iron 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:46.030
 came back and from the stove heated well and here 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.760
 so here Makar all this clamped well and 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:55.810
 Here I got it all over or 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:03:05.680
 less pronounced means now I take off the knife 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:08.980
 and start on these drives to shoot all 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.459
 superfluous shape well and cleaned 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.459
 of course 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:50.270
 the gift is ready 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.889
 here are you got paint snowflakes 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.909
 which I have used truth not yet 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:59.870
 dried up but this paint is more true spray 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.460
 i stayed after i painted 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.669
 a layer of brazier that is this paint 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:10.339
 refractory i think that in principle when 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.919
 good enough drying it will 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:20.240
 serve long in general here such here 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:22.360
 scissors for here it is the knife we saw 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.360
 him 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:33.640
 really very simple view 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.970
 making I think is practical 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.720
 principle on a belt 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:44.100
 I think I will be comfortable here so here I 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:48.220
 it all riveted 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:54.730
 grommet on the side that is when wearing 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:57.570
 it will all look like this 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.570
 here but on a belt 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:07.000
 under the right hand that is, I think it will 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:11.310
 convenient in principle here it is Khan's hook 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.600
 the belt can be narrowed down or vice versa 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.860
 increase 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.790
 also possible with a great desire 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.790
 attach the right one and this one 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.910
 the strap here is certainly not painted 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:27.030
 sailor is tolerable 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:31.930
 as additional touches additional 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:35.070
 design to these can generally be such 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.070
 here you can 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.610
 easy honest no sound simple 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.470
 the very same 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.140
 the only thing I will see if a man 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.480
 will use with them where he will with 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:54.370
 she has no choice favor 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.630
 gift horse you know in general 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.180
 see how this paint will behave 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.150
 if not, it can be solvents 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.700
 or nazhdachki not take it all off but I think 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:09.470
 what will be because the paint 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:14.270
 good serious in general like that then 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:17.600
 what about forging third house third 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.640
 day like a bucket honest well today 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.930
 more or less as something goes wrong 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.700
 it's raining but I still can't 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.370
 continue 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:33.800
 I will try to start tomorrow bye 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:38.740
 These are the rules. Thank you all for 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.740
 view everyone good luck everyone bye
