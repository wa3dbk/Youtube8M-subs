00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
with that so 3 support ends well i

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
with that so 3 support ends well i
mostly<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:27.900> Missy<00:00:28.500> has<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.890> same<00:00:29.279> play

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
mostly because Missy has the same play

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.400 
mostly because Missy has the same play
style<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.510> he's<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> playmaker

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
style as I do so he's like the playmaker

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.740 
style as I do so he's like the playmaker
of<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> team<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.759> almost<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.329> only<00:00:33.390> way

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
of the team and it's almost the only way

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.380 
of the team and it's almost the only way
they<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.050> engage<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.559> fights<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.760> knew

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
they can engage the fights and we knew

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.200 
they can engage the fights and we knew
that<00:00:36.420> he<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.829> play<00:00:37.980> either<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.850> knee

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
carrying the game or knowing that you

carrying the game or knowing that you
had<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.280> early<00:00:59.699> lead<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.000> had<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.270> put<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.510> on

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.819 
had that early lead and had to put it on
your<00:01:00.690> shoulders<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> how<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.680> think

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
your shoulders and how do you think

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
your shoulders and how do you think
Neil's<00:01:02.010> did<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.699> don't<00:01:03.239> necessarily<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.719> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
Neil's did I don't necessarily think I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
Neil's did I don't necessarily think I
carried<00:01:04.260> his<00:01:04.350> game<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.769> think<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:06.030> than

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
carried his game I think I was more than

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
carried his game I think I was more than
the<00:01:07.140> backbone<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.799> comp<00:01:08.040> sort<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.369> i<00:01:08.549> had

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the backbone in this comp sort of i had

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.300 
the backbone in this comp sort of i had
to<00:01:09.140> be<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.380> patient<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.799> every<00:01:10.979> team<00:01:11.130> fight

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
to be really patient in every team fight

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.609 
to be really patient in every team fight
because<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.240> i<00:01:12.450> ever<00:01:12.570> ended<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.380> getting

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
because if if i ever ended up getting

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.280 
because if if i ever ended up getting
cc'd<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:15.000> only<00:01:15.150> way<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:15.420> his<00:01:15.720> him<00:01:16.049> having

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
cc'd the only way out was his him having

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.810 
cc'd the only way out was his him having
Michaels<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:16.950> also<00:01:17.250> three<00:01:17.580> minutes

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
Michaels but that's also three minutes

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.580 
Michaels but that's also three minutes
ed<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> think<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.500> be

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
ed I think so it's like you have to be

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
ed I think so it's like you have to be
really<00:01:19.799> patient<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.369> make<00:01:20.939> sure<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.330> don't<00:01:21.900> end

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
really patient and make sure I don't end

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.310 
really patient and make sure I don't end
up<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.380> position<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:24.020> more<00:01:25.020> taking

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
up in that position so I was more taking

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.800 
up in that position so I was more taking
off<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.799> backseat<00:01:26.189> role<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.580> game

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
off like a backseat role in this game

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.240 
off like a backseat role in this game
meanwhile<00:01:27.810> Neil's<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.259> doing<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> lot<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
meanwhile Neil's was doing a lot of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.350 
meanwhile Neil's was doing a lot of
damage<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:29.939> he<00:01:30.000> played<00:01:30.150> really

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
damage and I think he played really

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.859 
damage and I think he played really
would<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:31.350> well<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.680> game<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.159> i

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
would really well in this game so i

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.810 
would really well in this game so i
would<00:01:33.869> i<00:01:34.049> would<00:01:34.110> probably<00:01:34.770> give<00:01:34.979> him<00:01:35.130> add<00:01:35.369> apps

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
would i would probably give him add apps

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.179 
would i would probably give him add apps
on<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:37.829> draft<00:01:38.070> was

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
on this one but I think our draft was

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.800 
on this one but I think our draft was
really<00:01:38.400> solid<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:38.970> kind<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.540> had<00:01:39.659> this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
really solid so I kind of just had this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.300 
really solid so I kind of just had this
position<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> game<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> didn't<00:01:41.220> really

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
position in the game so I didn't really

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.889 
position in the game so I didn't really
mind<00:01:41.490> having<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.880> either<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.570> had<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> make

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
mind having it either I just had to make

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.929 
mind having it either I just had to make
sure<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.259> alive<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> then<00:01:43.860> killed<00:01:43.939> from

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
sure I was alive and then killed from

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.780 
sure I was alive and then killed from
time<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:46.470> did<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.799> job<00:01:46.829> very<00:01:47.100> well<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.640> I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
time you did your job very well but I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
time you did your job very well but I
have<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.119> ask<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.509> does<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.780> feel<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
have to ask how does it feel like to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.929 
have to ask how does it feel like to
play<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.649> an<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:50.280> decent<00:01:50.430> jungler

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
play with an actually decent jungler

you guys are really well early and then
as<00:02:19.269> we<00:02:19.420> will<00:02:19.540> see<00:02:19.750> here<00:02:19.930> something<00:02:20.409> goes<00:02:20.590> wrong

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
as we will see here something goes wrong

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.309 
as we will see here something goes wrong
at<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.190> at<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.459> dragon<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:22.360> yellow<00:02:23.110> star

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
at the at the dragon so yellow star

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.869 
at the at the dragon so yellow star
walkest<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.769> this<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.099> so<00:02:24.129> we<00:02:24.610> don't<00:02:24.790> have

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
walkest is this one so we don't have

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.809 
walkest is this one so we don't have
cyanide<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.420> we<00:02:25.840> do<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.110> Drake<00:02:26.640> because<00:02:27.640> he's

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
cyanide so we do the Drake because he's

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.300 
cyanide so we do the Drake because he's
known<00:02:27.970> as<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.180> stealer<00:02:28.659> but<00:02:28.690> here<00:02:29.379> we<00:02:29.650> know<00:02:30.040> that

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
known as a stealer but here we know that

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.729 
known as a stealer but here we know that
we<00:02:30.970> have<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.209> show<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.540> way<00:02:31.659> so<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.049> kind<00:02:32.650> of

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
we have to show the way so it's kind of

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.649 
we have to show the way so it's kind of
bad<00:02:32.980> for<00:02:33.040> us<00:02:33.250> who<00:02:33.489> started<00:02:33.790> reckoned<00:02:34.180> with<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
bad for us who started reckoned with the

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.479 
bad for us who started reckoned with the
typical<00:02:35.110> minion<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:35.530> they<00:02:35.739> see<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> wreck<00:02:36.280> is

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
typical minion and they see the wreck is

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.970 
typical minion and they see the wreck is
really<00:02:36.909> bad<00:02:37.090> for<00:02:37.299> us<00:02:37.360> or<00:02:37.629> at<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.870> start<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.680> we

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
really bad for us or at the start so we

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.949 
really bad for us or at the start so we
just<00:02:39.280> need<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.610> cry<00:02:39.819> slowly<00:02:40.180> because<00:02:40.540> what<00:02:40.750> is

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959

alice is just like it's really hard for
us<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.769> seach<00:03:54.099> because<00:03:54.459> if<00:03:54.609> i<00:03:54.730> ever<00:03:54.819> end<00:03:55.090> up

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
us to seach because if i ever end up

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.400 
us to seach because if i ever end up
walking<00:03:55.359> up<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.690> tower<00:03:55.870> dennis<00:03:56.169> areas

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
walking up to the tower dennis areas

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.170 
walking up to the tower dennis areas
like<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.620> free<00:03:56.889> free<00:03:57.519> auto<00:03:57.760> tech<00:03:58.030> with<00:03:58.150> a

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
like a free free auto tech with a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.729 
like a free free auto tech with a
soldier<00:03:58.510> into<00:03:58.750> q<00:03:58.930> into<00:03:59.079> auto<00:03:59.230> attack<00:03:59.470> again

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
soldier into q into auto attack again

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.259 
soldier into q into auto attack again
and<00:03:59.829> we<00:04:00.370> don't<00:04:00.459> really<00:04:00.609> have<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:01.000> much

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
and we don't really have that much

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.390 
and we don't really have that much
sustained<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:01.989> we<00:04:02.889> didn't<00:04:03.099> really<00:04:03.129> feel<00:04:03.340> like

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
sustained so we didn't really feel like

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.650 
sustained so we didn't really feel like
teaching<00:04:03.669> was<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.060> correct<00:04:04.209> move<00:04:04.419> in<00:04:04.569> this

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
teaching was the correct move in this

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.909 
teaching was the correct move in this
game<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.049> at<00:04:05.169> the<00:04:05.260> same<00:04:05.349> time<00:04:05.410> we<00:04:05.709> felt<00:04:05.889> like

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
game and at the same time we felt like

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.409 
game and at the same time we felt like
the<00:04:06.099> early<00:04:06.370> game<00:04:06.489> was<00:04:06.609> like<00:04:06.790> extremely<00:04:07.000> strong

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
the early game was like extremely strong

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.170 
the early game was like extremely strong
so<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:08.379> early<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.620> mid-game<00:04:08.919> so<00:04:09.160> if<00:04:09.310> we<00:04:09.459> just

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
so the early a mid-game so if we just

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.539 
so the early a mid-game so if we just
then<00:04:10.329> ended<00:04:10.720> up<00:04:10.780> getting<00:04:11.049> like<00:04:11.340> equal<00:04:12.340> or<00:04:12.519> a

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
then ended up getting like equal or a

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.640 
then ended up getting like equal or a
head<00:04:12.730> in<00:04:12.879> form<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.269> then<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.169> game<00:04:14.500> got

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
head in form and then the game got

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.229 
head in form and then the game got
longer<00:04:14.889> and<00:04:15.010> we<00:04:15.250> fought<00:04:15.609> forever<00:04:15.849> objective

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
longer and we fought forever objective

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.550 
longer and we fought forever objective
then<00:04:16.359> we<00:04:16.479> would<00:04:16.599> end<00:04:16.750> up<00:04:16.810> winning<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.169> game<00:04:17.289> so

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
then we would end up winning the game so

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.860 
then we would end up winning the game so
yeah<00:04:18.310> we<00:04:18.489> were<00:04:18.849> taking<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> patient<00:04:19.599> approach

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
yeah we were taking the patient approach

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.060 
yeah we were taking the patient approach
I<00:04:20.049> think<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.320> this<00:04:20.409> one<00:04:20.620> meanwhile<00:04:20.890> they<00:04:21.010> were

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
I think in this one meanwhile they were

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.310 
I think in this one meanwhile they were
like<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:22.210> team<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:22.599> had<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.870> do<00:04:22.960> something

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
like the team that had to do something

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.450 
like the team that had to do something
kind<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.710> saw<00:04:23.890> them<00:04:24.039> like<00:04:24.190> grouping

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
kind of so you saw them like grouping

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.080 
kind of so you saw them like grouping
five<00:04:24.669> constantly<00:04:25.120> made<00:04:25.360> meanwhile<00:04:25.719> I<00:04:25.870> will

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
five constantly made meanwhile I will

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.939 
five constantly made meanwhile I will
on<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.210> side<00:04:26.419> length<00:04:26.570> trying<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.020> trade<00:04:27.800> at

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
on a side length trying to trade at

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.370 
on a side length trying to trade at
airport<00:04:28.280> for<00:04:28.610> tier<00:04:29.150> 2<00:04:29.300> 42<00:04:29.780> because<00:04:30.080> we<00:04:30.199> would

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
airport for tier 2 42 because we would

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.780 
airport for tier 2 42 because we would
end<00:04:30.500> up<00:04:30.560> winning<00:04:31.010> in<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.310> sense<00:04:31.610> then

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
end up winning in that sense then

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.550 
end up winning in that sense then
because<00:04:32.060> we<00:04:32.120> had<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.240> better<00:04:32.419> late<00:04:32.600> game<00:04:32.840> yeah<00:04:33.530> I

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
because we had a better late game yeah I

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.870 
because we had a better late game yeah I
agree<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:34.130> only<00:04:34.280> way<00:04:34.430> they<00:04:34.550> could<00:04:34.669> come<00:04:34.850> back

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
agree the only way they could come back

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.020 
agree the only way they could come back
is<00:04:35.210> just<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.800> flanking<00:04:36.800> us<00:04:36.949> from<00:04:37.370> other<00:04:37.699> sides

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
is just a flanking us from other sides

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.510 
is just a flanking us from other sides
because<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.449> have<00:04:38.660> any<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:39.530> great<00:04:39.860> follow-up<00:04:40.160> and

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
because I have any a great follow-up and

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.550 
because I have any a great follow-up and
then<00:04:41.000> we<00:04:41.270> just<00:04:41.419> have<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:41.750> farm<00:04:42.050> for<00:04:42.350> late<00:04:42.530> and

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
then we just have to farm for late and

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.800 
then we just have to farm for late and
then<00:04:42.860> we<00:04:43.130> we<00:04:43.550> would<00:04:43.760> just<00:04:43.970> end<00:04:44.180> up<00:04:44.300> ended<00:04:44.780> up

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
then we we would just end up ended up

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.710 
then we we would just end up ended up
winning<00:04:44.960> we<00:04:45.889> just<00:04:46.100> have<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.340> play<00:04:46.760> slowly<00:04:47.000> take
