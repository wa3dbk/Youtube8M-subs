the<00:00:58.979> cage<00:00:59.159> using<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.610> like<00:00:59.879> prying<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.720> open

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
the cage using that like prying it open

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.479 
the cage using that like prying it open
with<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.229> stick<00:01:01.470> but<00:01:02.040> that's<00:01:02.220> still

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
with the stick but that's still

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
with the stick but that's still
ridiculously<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.710> beyond<00:01:04.710> illogical<00:01:06.439> so

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
ridiculously just beyond illogical so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.080
