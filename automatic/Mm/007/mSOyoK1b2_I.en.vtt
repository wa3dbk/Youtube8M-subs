00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:11.882
The world's best have gathered here.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:21.422
To win the honor of being champion.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.160
It all comes down to one night.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.899
To one place, they gather to win.

00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:45.779
Sato: To tell the truth, I don't know if MAX will even be here next year.

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.694
Without a Japanese champion, MAX might not survive.

00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:23.672
Hinata: I'll definitely defeat Dida.

00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:30.004
I hope to win by KO and prove that I'm the best in Japan.

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:35.291
HIROYA: I was naive. It gets real from now.

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:43.763
The fights will get real, and whether or not 

00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:46.895
I can show my stuff will determine my future as well as the future of MAX.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:50.635
Kubo: Hiroya is desperate.

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:55.004
He'll be betting it all on this fight.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:59.004
Instead of tightening my guard, I'll trade punches and get a KO.

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:03.314
Yamamoto: It's a different sport except you hit people and they fall down.

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:04.957
That's the same.

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:07.796
It depends on how hungry you are to get the KO.

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:12.521
It all comes down to this.

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.486
Nagashima: I'm the only one who can build the new MAX.

00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:23.632
Building a new MAX. Bringing new fans. Carrying MAX into a new era.

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:26.917
I'm Jienotsu and that's my job.

00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:58.600
Petrosyan: No champion has ever won twice in a row, right?

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.578
I'll be the first and become a legendary champion!

00:03:08.462 --> 00:03:10.080
Time moves on.

00:03:10.496 --> 00:03:15.755
Sato: If I don't win this year, I'll never win.

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:22.126
I'll make it happen and win the glory, or I'll end up a "crownless champion".

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:25.140
That's what I'm up against this year.

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.571
So, MAX Never Stop.
