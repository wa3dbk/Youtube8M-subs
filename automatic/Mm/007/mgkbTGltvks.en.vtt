 hello to all many of you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.870
 you asked for a video for teenagers 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.549
 or for girls who are starting to 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.859
 makeup and you want a look ultra 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.619
 cool but effective because this video is 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.670
 for you the skin in adolescence 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.340
 is subject to hormonal changes 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.499
 ends so you can feel very 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.390
 dry or very oily if you have oily skin 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.189
 and with a tendency to shine, I recommend you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.599
 that you use film and script that will match 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.640
 the skin tone and it's going to leave 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.010
 perfectly matte if yours is a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.050
 dry skin uses our drink fresh bibi 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.110

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.640
 get an immediate good face effect 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.680
 It is also as easy to apply as a 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.610
 moisturizer you just have to give 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.549

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.549

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.480

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.630
 pores and will aggravate the problem 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.060
 If your problem is dark circles then 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.370

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.970
