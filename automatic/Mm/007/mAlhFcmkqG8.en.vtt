do something about it so this is what we
did<00:00:31.250> this<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> small<00:00:32.759> PCB<00:00:33.829> nothing

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
did this is a small PCB nothing

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
did this is a small PCB nothing
spectacular<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> prototype<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.630> it's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
spectacular this is a prototype so it's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.290 
spectacular this is a prototype so it's
big<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> bulky<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.920> looking<00:00:38.309> ugly<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:39.030> it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
big and bulky and looking ugly but it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.160 
big and bulky and looking ugly but it
has<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.280> microprocessor<00:00:41.280> over<00:00:41.670> there<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
has a microprocessor over there and it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.470 
has a microprocessor over there and it
has<00:00:43.320> an<00:00:43.590> RF<00:00:43.950> interface<00:00:44.399> over<00:00:44.760> there<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
has an RF interface over there and it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.540 
has an RF interface over there and it
has<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.660> nice<00:00:45.870> connector<00:00:46.410> over<00:00:46.649> there<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.399> what

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
has a nice connector over there so what

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
has a nice connector over there so what
we<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.180> easily<00:00:48.629> attach<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
we can do is easily attach it to the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.279 
we can do is easily attach it to the
camera<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.780> switch<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
camera and here we go now we switch on

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.439 
camera and here we go now we switch on
the<00:00:52.320> camera<00:00:54.469> keep<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> has

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the camera keep it here we are so it has

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.290 
the camera keep it here we are so it has
no<00:00:58.140> pictures<00:00:58.590> no<00:00:58.620> videos<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.850> are<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.090> mode

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
no pictures no videos and we are in mode

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.319 
no pictures no videos and we are in mode
3<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.739> look<00:01:02.010> at<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> RF<00:01:02.730> interface<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
3 and if we look at the RF interface you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.530 
3 and if we look at the RF interface you
see<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.140> LED<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.860> blinking<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:06.360> it's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
see that there's LED is blinking so it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.469 
see that there's LED is blinking so it's
mating<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:06.990> reconnection<00:01:07.820> ok<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.450> comes

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
mating for reconnection ok so here comes

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.590 
mating for reconnection ok so here comes
the<00:01:09.720> second<00:01:10.140> part<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> remote

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the second part this is a remote

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.859 
the second part this is a remote
controller<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.729> this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.880> also<00:01:15.090> buggies<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
controller and this is also buggies is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.320 
controller and this is also buggies is
also<00:01:16.409> ugly<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.340> haven't<00:01:17.610> had<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.090> time<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
also ugly but I haven't had the time to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.380 
also ugly but I haven't had the time to
finish<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.990> work<00:01:19.920> yet<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.820> promise<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
finish this work yet and I promise I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
finish this work yet and I promise I
will<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> lot<00:01:22.049> smaller<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.000> because<00:01:24.000> i'm

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
will do it a lot smaller and because i'm

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.240 
will do it a lot smaller and because i'm
lazy<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.020> i<00:01:25.110> haven't<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> time<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.950> look

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
cameras either in between this led has

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.469 
cameras either in between this led has
changed<00:01:43.950> from<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.189> blinking<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.909> live<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
changed from a blinking one to live to a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510 
changed from a blinking one to live to a
steady<00:01:45.840> illuminated<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.710> which<00:01:46.979> means<00:01:47.250> we

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
steady illuminated one which means we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.920 
steady illuminated one which means we
now<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:48.060> an<00:01:48.329> RF<00:01:48.720> connection<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.869> we

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
now have an RF connection so what can we

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.830 
now have an RF connection so what can we
do<00:01:52.170> with<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.970> no<00:01:54.240> Zaher<00:01:54.689> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
do with it now so we have no Zaher of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.620 
do with it now so we have no Zaher of
connection<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.159> camera's<00:01:56.610> ready<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.509> we

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
connection and the camera's ready so we

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.709 
connection and the camera's ready so we
can<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:58.049> take<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.619> remote<00:01:58.920> controller<00:01:59.719> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
can all take the remote controller and
