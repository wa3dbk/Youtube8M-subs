00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.549 

we<00:00:40.489> made<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.700> true<00:00:41.059> long-tube<00:00:41.570> inch<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.079> 7/8

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
we made a true long-tube inch and 7/8

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.770 
we made a true long-tube inch and 7/8
header<00:00:42.800> to<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.070> 3<00:00:43.399> inch<00:00:43.520> collector<00:00:43.940> then<00:00:44.480> it

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
header to a 3 inch collector then it

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.720 
header to a 3 inch collector then it
exits<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.350> collector<00:00:45.710> either<00:00:45.920> into<00:00:46.250> off-road

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
exits to collector either into off-road

of 3-inch resonators then the exhaust

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.619 
of 3-inch resonators then the exhaust
exits<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.680> collector<00:00:55.100> goes<00:00:55.579> into<00:00:55.940> our<00:00:56.120> x<00:00:56.360> pipe

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
exits the collector goes into our x pipe

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.140
