00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.910
 the multi-grain bread is made with 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.450
 numerous ingredients such as seeds 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.639
 soy buckwheat flax and my son is 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.590
 Protective grid prevents elements 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.560
 strangers accidentally fall to the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.099
 recipient that receives about 600 kilos of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.919
 flour the crushed ingredients in a 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.070
 mill are kept in these 36 huge 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.070
 deposits 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.070
 you start mixing the ingredients 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.410
 these troughs serve to ferment 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.350
 the yeast a process that takes three 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 hours the fermentation makes the dough 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 grow considerably 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.930
 this huge mixer stir the dough 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.590
 for about 8 minutes 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 do not 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.580
 when it is homogeneous, the content 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.500
 empty in a wide bowl the dough 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.500
 weighs 1000 kilos almost a ton 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.039
 the mass moves to a platform that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.039
 it's on the separator 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.829
 at the bottom of the machine a small 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.810
 opening lets the dough come out two 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:30.020
 mechanical arms cut the dough in two 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.850
 equal pieces and 192 pieces are formed 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.469
 per minute 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.560
 then the dough falls to a ribbon 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.560
 conveyor 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.359
 here the pieces of dough become 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.600
 balls that can work with greater 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.600
 ease 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.680
 the dough balls are covered with flour 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.470
 so they do not stick during your 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.870
 transport and while they are molded 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.810
 here the dough balls come out and go to 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.070
 mold during transport the dough 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.070
 let the yeast act 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.910
 then the dough is folded and rolled up 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.040
 machine can hold three per second 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.040
 and a total of 11,500 per hour 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.870
 the dough is rolled to the exact size and 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.870
 falls in the baking molds 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.209
 here we see the making of breads for 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.340
 hot dog these balls must turn to 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.000
 adequate size and ferment before 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.000
 be molded 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.960
 here the loaves for hot dogs are molded 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.550
 pieces of dough should not be touched 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.990
 each other so they fall apart with a 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.450
 small mechanical fat 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.260
 Now let's go back to bread production 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.260
 of several grains 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.579
 deposited at the bottom of the molds 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.489
 pieces of dough are owed during a 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.980
 hour at 42 degrees centigrade and a 70 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.950
 percent of moisture baking then 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.950
 for 20 minutes at 255 degrees 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.210
 when they are cooked the loaves acquire 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.210
 an appetizing golden color 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.470
 a vacuum system takes out the loaves of bread 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.090
 their molds and they are deposited in a 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.090
 conveyor to cool 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.430
 a guidance system deals with 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.120
 transport the breads to various 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.459
 sectors of the bakery 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.069
 when they are cold the loaves go to the 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.200
 slicer that cuts them into 65 slices 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.299
 per minute with 2 steel blades 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.040
 meters wide and 40 centimeters 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.390
 long 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.569
 these blades are changed every two 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.569
 weeks 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.250
 65 loaves per minute packaged sliced 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.380
 now they are ready for your dispatch have 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.270
 spent about 5 and a half hours between 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.470
 preparation of the dry flour and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.470
 base of the baked bread
