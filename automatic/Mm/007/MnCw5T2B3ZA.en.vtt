spending sprees they could go gambling
and<00:01:12.530> one<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.520> learned<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> cope

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and one way that I have learned to cope

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.810 
and one way that I have learned to cope
with<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.840> I've<00:01:16.500> actually<00:01:16.770> opened<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.580> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
with this is I've actually opened up a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
name so he can't access it now he does

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.649 
name so he can't access it now he does
have<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> debit<00:01:25.229> card<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.580> keep<00:01:27.299> money<00:01:27.570> in

will transfer it in there but of course

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
will transfer it in there but of course
this<00:01:33.600> gives<00:01:33.840> me<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.409> bit<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> control

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
well guess what all he had to do 24/7

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.920 
well guess what all he had to do 24/7
was<00:03:49.600> be<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:50.170> everybody's<00:03:50.830> face<00:03:51.100> at<00:03:51.340> home<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.540> I

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
I wish I had gone to that appointment

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.380 
I wish I had gone to that appointment
because<00:03:56.050> I<00:03:56.410> never<00:03:56.710> would<00:03:57.010> have<00:03:57.040> let<00:03:57.280> her<00:03:57.490> take

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
because I never would have let her take

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.430 
because I never would have let her take
him<00:03:58.570> off<00:03:58.870> he<00:03:59.440> needs<00:03:59.740> to<00:04:00.070> be<00:04:00.190> scheduled<00:04:00.730> and

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
him off he needs to be scheduled and

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.110 
him off he needs to be scheduled and
scheduling<00:04:02.440> helps<00:04:02.770> him<00:04:02.950> sleep<00:04:03.160> helps<00:04:03.670> him<00:04:03.880> eat

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
scheduling helps him sleep helps him eat

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.540 
scheduling helps him sleep helps him eat
at<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.450> same<00:04:04.480> time<00:04:04.960> which<00:04:05.710> i<00:04:05.890> think<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.280> all

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
at the same time which i think is all

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.220 
at the same time which i think is all
important<00:04:07.150> for<00:04:07.450> leveling<00:04:08.320> his<00:04:08.530> moods<00:04:10.230> another
