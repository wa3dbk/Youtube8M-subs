the<00:02:13.750> look<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> gradient<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:18.959> like<00:02:19.959> the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
the look with the gradient I like the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.930 
the look with the gradient I like the
way<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.290> looks<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:21.310> can<00:02:21.400> also<00:02:21.519> change<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
way that looks we can also change the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.160 
way that looks we can also change the
blend<00:02:22.150> mode<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.569> see<00:02:23.110> how<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.350> fills

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.660 

it's<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.740> little<00:02:30.950> bit<00:02:31.069> intense<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.460> I'm<00:02:31.550> gonna

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
it's a little bit intense so I'm gonna

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.050 
it's a little bit intense so I'm gonna
dial<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:32.000> down<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:34.459> I'm<00:02:34.520> pretty<00:02:34.640> happy<00:02:34.880> with

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
dial that down so I'm pretty happy with

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.250 
dial that down so I'm pretty happy with
the<00:02:35.180> way<00:02:35.209> this<00:02:35.480> video<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.810> looking<00:02:36.080> right<00:02:36.200> now
