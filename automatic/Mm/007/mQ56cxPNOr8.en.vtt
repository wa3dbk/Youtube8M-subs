um<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.400> didn't<00:04:27.090> resize<00:04:27.510> this<00:04:27.950> when<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:28.980> was

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
um I didn't resize this when I was

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.100 
um I didn't resize this when I was
speaking<00:04:29.610> with<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.940> guys<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.330> hold<00:04:30.570> fast<00:04:30.780> gear

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
speaking with the guys I hold fast gear

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.650 
speaking with the guys I hold fast gear
they<00:04:31.530> asked<00:04:31.710> me<00:04:31.800> how<00:04:31.860> tall<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.130> was<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.700> told<00:04:33.570> them

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
they asked me how tall I was I told them

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.690 
they asked me how tall I was I told them
I<00:04:33.750> was<00:04:33.870> 59<00:04:34.080> they<00:04:34.680> sent<00:04:34.920> it<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.100> me<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.400> way<00:04:35.640> so

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
I was 59 they sent it to me this way so

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.510 
I was 59 they sent it to me this way so
I<00:04:35.910> have<00:04:36.120> not<00:04:36.330> adjusted<00:04:36.540> it<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:38.010> that's

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
I have not adjusted it so that's

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.610 
I have not adjusted it so that's
probably<00:04:38.790> why<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.150> hooks<00:04:39.630> are<00:04:39.900> sort<00:04:40.560> of

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
probably why the hooks are sort of

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.230 
probably why the hooks are sort of
behind<00:04:40.980> me<00:04:41.160> because<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.520> didn't<00:04:41.820> adjust<00:04:42.060> it

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
behind me because I didn't adjust it

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.230 
behind me because I didn't adjust it
anymore<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:43.800> hooks<00:04:44.040> are<00:04:44.190> designed<00:04:44.520> and<00:04:45.060> you

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
anymore the hooks are designed and you

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.080 
anymore the hooks are designed and you
can<00:04:45.360> actually<00:04:45.510> take<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.080> camera<00:04:46.470> leash<00:04:46.650> or

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
can actually take the camera leash or

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.820 
can actually take the camera leash or
something<00:04:48.090> else<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.540> actually<00:04:48.930> attach<00:04:49.350> more

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
something else and actually attach more

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.430 
something else and actually attach more
accessories<00:04:50.640> or<00:04:51.000> more<00:04:51.330> cameras<00:04:51.960> or<00:04:52.170> whatever

they<00:05:43.170> probably<00:05:43.530> use<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.040> thicker<00:05:44.250> heavier

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
they probably use the thicker heavier

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.530 
they probably use the thicker heavier
leather<00:05:46.200> for<00:05:46.410> this<00:05:46.620> because<00:05:47.430> of<00:05:47.700> its<00:05:48.150> used

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
leather for this because of its used

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.180 
leather for this because of its used
because<00:05:48.720> of<00:05:48.990> its<00:05:49.110> purpose<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:49.710> need<00:05:49.890> that<00:05:50.010> to

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
because of its purpose you need that to

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.770 
because of its purpose you need that to
be<00:05:50.310> as<00:05:50.430> strong<00:05:50.670> as<00:05:50.820> possible<00:05:50.970> to<00:05:51.330> holding<00:05:51.600> two

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.320 
be as strong as possible to holding two
cameras<00:05:52.200> or<00:05:52.350> more<00:05:52.620> so<00:05:53.310> I'm<00:05:53.880> not<00:05:53.940> going<00:05:54.240> to

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
fault them on that it does hurt a little

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.880 
fault them on that it does hurt a little
bit<00:05:56.880> keep<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.270> in<00:05:57.360> mind<00:05:57.540> if<00:05:58.290> you<00:05:58.560> find<00:05:58.800> that

it<00:05:59.040> hurts<00:05:59.280> you<00:05:59.550> you<00:06:00.000> can<00:06:00.150> easily<00:06:00.360> solve<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.960> by

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
it hurts you you can easily solve it by

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.080 
it hurts you you can easily solve it by
just<00:06:01.080> buying<00:06:01.920> some<00:06:02.130> black<00:06:02.370> fabric<00:06:02.670> and

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
just buying some black fabric and

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.850 
just buying some black fabric and
wrapping<00:06:03.480> it<00:06:03.570> around<00:06:03.630> and<00:06:04.140> maybe<00:06:04.260> taping<00:06:04.770> it

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
wrapping it around and maybe taping it

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.860 
wrapping it around and maybe taping it
or<00:06:04.950> sewing<00:06:05.340> it<00:06:05.460> around<00:06:05.790> where<00:06:06.510> it<00:06:06.630> hits<00:06:06.780> your

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
or sewing it around where it hits your

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.420 
or sewing it around where it hits your
armpit<00:06:07.290> and<00:06:07.380> then<00:06:07.650> you're<00:06:07.770> gonna<00:06:07.860> soften<00:06:08.190> that

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
armpit and then you're gonna soften that

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.870 
armpit and then you're gonna soften that
a<00:06:08.490> little<00:06:08.760> bit<00:06:09.110> for<00:06:10.110> me<00:06:10.260> it<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:11.310> don't<00:06:11.670> shoot

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
event that often but when I do I'm gonna

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.560 
event that often but when I do I'm gonna
be<00:06:14.370> using<00:06:14.520> this<00:06:14.790> because<00:06:15.150> it<00:06:15.330> worked

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
be using this because it worked

little bit I did unhook the cameras so

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.340 
little bit I did unhook the cameras so
that<00:06:32.970> they're<00:06:33.510> not<00:06:33.540> hanging<00:06:33.840> off<00:06:34.050> me<00:06:34.200> while

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:41.619 
left the harness on I get to remove it
it<00:06:38.629> was<00:06:38.870> perfectly<00:06:39.590> comfortable<00:06:40.479> with<00:06:41.479> and

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
without the cameras for the most part so

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.929
