00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
system Explorer on the oculus rift so

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:26.920 
system Explorer on the oculus rift so
let's<00:00:14.969> jump<00:00:15.179> in

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930

you to show different locations of

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.319 
you to show different locations of
things

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.380 
probably the third week of April pretty
much<00:02:33.020> playing<00:02:33.380> any<00:02:33.590> any<00:02:34.430> solar<00:02:34.730> system<00:02:35.150> thing

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
much playing any any solar system thing

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.500 
much playing any any solar system thing
that<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.540> can<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.459> tell<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.819> this<00:02:38.000> this

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
that I can and I tell you this this

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.840 
that I can and I tell you this this
one's<00:02:38.750> really<00:02:39.080> good<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.160> way<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.610> feels

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
one's really good the way that it feels

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.309 
one's really good the way that it feels
and<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.209> way<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.569> looks

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.369 

if<00:02:48.890> star<00:02:49.249> citizen<00:02:49.870> functions<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:50.959> this

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
if star citizen functions like this

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.199 
if star citizen functions like this
which<00:02:51.680> I'm<00:02:51.890> almost<00:02:52.459> certain<00:02:52.760> it'll<00:02:52.999> function

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
which I'm almost certain it'll function

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:06.390 
which I'm almost certain it'll function
better<00:02:53.739> it'll<00:02:54.739> be<00:02:54.859> really<00:02:55.159> good

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.930 

so<00:03:07.400> i<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:08.120> bought<00:03:08.300> a<00:03:08.330> gtx<00:03:09.050> 780<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.700> games

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
so i just bought a gtx 780 and the games

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:31.630 
so i just bought a gtx 780 and the games
run<00:03:14.270> so<00:03:14.480> much<00:03:14.600> better<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.920> pretty<00:03:31.160> much<00:03:31.220> hold

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
run so much better you pretty much hold

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.400 
run so much better you pretty much hold
a<00:03:33.070> solid<00:03:34.070> 60<00:03:34.430> frames<00:03:34.700> on<00:03:34.910> anything<00:03:38.410> where's

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
a solid 60 frames on anything where's

00:03:39.410 --> 00:04:01.500

exploring<00:04:10.360> on<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.540> oculus<00:04:10.689> rift<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:13.290> it's

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
exploring on the oculus rift is it's

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.960 
exploring on the oculus rift is it's
very<00:04:14.530> natural<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:18.010> seems<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.519> be<00:04:18.639> enough

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970
