00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
why I'm calling for Congress to pass

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.650 
why I'm calling for Congress to pass
pago<00:02:34.920> legislation<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.120> bill<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.570> will

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
pago legislation like a bill that will

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.390 
pago legislation like a bill that will
be<00:02:36.810> introduced<00:02:37.230> by<00:02:37.290> Congressman<00:02:37.950> Baron<00:02:38.250> Hill

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
be introduced by Congressman Baron Hill

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.150 
be introduced by Congressman Baron Hill
so<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> government<00:02:39.330> acts<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.470> same<00:02:40.710> way<00:02:40.770> any

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
so the government acts the same way any

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.610 
so the government acts the same way any
responsible<00:02:41.760> family<00:02:42.000> does<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.510> setting<00:02:43.380> its

responsible family does in setting its
budget<00:02:44.070> second<00:02:45.060> will<00:02:45.510> create<00:02:45.780> new<00:02:45.810> incentives

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
budget second will create new incentives

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.350 
budget second will create new incentives
to<00:02:46.650> reduce<00:02:46.950> wasteful<00:02:47.400> spending<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.910> to

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
to reduce wasteful spending and to

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.660 
to reduce wasteful spending and to
invest<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.840> what<00:02:48.990> works<00:02:49.340> we<00:02:50.340> don't<00:02:50.430> want

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
invest in what works we don't want

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.760 
invest in what works we don't want
agencies<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.210> protect<00:02:51.570> bloated<00:02:51.900> budgets<00:02:52.230> we

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
agencies to protect bloated budgets we

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.880 
agencies to protect bloated budgets we
want<00:02:53.040> them<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.280> promote<00:02:53.610> effective<00:02:54.210> programs

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
want them to promote effective programs

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.890 
want them to promote effective programs
so<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.980> idea<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.310> simple<00:02:56.720> agencies<00:02:57.720> that

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
so the idea is simple agencies that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.870 
so the idea is simple agencies that
identify<00:02:58.410> savings<00:02:58.920> will<00:02:59.160> get<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.550> keep<00:02:59.730> a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
identify savings will get to keep a

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.970 
identify savings will get to keep a
portion<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.360> those<00:03:00.480> savings<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:01.440> invest<00:03:01.470> in

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
portion of those savings to invest in

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.430 
portion of those savings to invest in
programs<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.550> work<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.750> result<00:03:04.110> will<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.320> a

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
programs that work the result will be a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.410 
programs that work the result will be a
smaller<00:03:04.860> budget<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.850> more<00:03:06.060> effective

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
smaller budget and a more effective

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.890 
smaller budget and a more effective
government<00:03:07.700> third<00:03:08.700> we'll<00:03:09.450> look<00:03:09.600> for<00:03:09.810> ideas

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
government third we'll look for ideas

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.650 
government third we'll look for ideas
from<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.440> bottom<00:03:10.740> up<00:03:11.000> after<00:03:12.000> all<00:03:12.150> Americans

across<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> country<00:03:13.110> know<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.190> best

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
across the country know that the best

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.970 
across the country know that the best
ideas<00:03:14.850> often<00:03:15.060> come<00:03:15.780> from<00:03:15.810> workers<00:03:16.200> not<00:03:16.770> just

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
ideas often come from workers not just

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.740 
ideas often come from workers not just
management<00:03:17.490> and<00:03:18.240> that's<00:03:18.390> why<00:03:18.570> we'll

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
management and that's why we'll

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.540 
management and that's why we'll
establish<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.290> process<00:03:19.560> through<00:03:20.070> which<00:03:20.100> every

for how their agency can save money and
perform<00:03:25.620> better<00:03:25.800> we'll<00:03:26.790> put<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.060> suggestions

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
perform better we'll put the suggestions

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.990 
perform better we'll put the suggestions
that<00:03:27.720> work<00:03:28.020> into<00:03:28.380> practice<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.010> later<00:03:29.760> this
