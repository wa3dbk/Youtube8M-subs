load<00:00:01.469> up<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:02.120> bell<00:00:03.120> ringing<00:00:03.470> pretty<00:00:04.470> much<00:00:04.589> in

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
load up the bell ringing pretty much in

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.030 
load up the bell ringing pretty much in

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
sync with the TCS FL for takaya which

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.190 
sync with the TCS FL for takaya which
I've<00:00:11.250> mounted<00:00:11.460> just<00:00:12.300> down<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.750> side<00:00:12.960> down

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I've mounted just down in the side down

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.609 
I've mounted just down in the side down
here<00:00:13.500> alongside<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.130> mayor<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:15.660> inside<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
here alongside the mayor and inside the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.640 
here alongside the mayor and inside the
boiler<00:00:16.859> courses<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.670> tsunami<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
boiler courses the tsunami and the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.589 
boiler courses the tsunami and the
motors<00:00:20.039> working<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.900> bell<00:00:22.800> rope<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:26.599> can

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
motors working the the bell rope I can

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:37.040 
motors working the the bell rope I can
work<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.439> off<00:00:28.619> f1<00:00:34.370> f1<00:00:35.809> reducing<00:00:36.809> press

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
work that just off f1 f1 reducing press

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.389 
work that just off f1 f1 reducing press
so<00:00:37.770> that's<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.760> now<00:00:39.059> working<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:40.770> sound

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
so that's that's now working the sound

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.110 
so that's that's now working the sound
from<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.730> tsunami<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.480> program<00:00:42.989> tsunami

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
from the tsunami of program tsunami

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.080 
from the tsunami of program tsunami
sound<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.010> bell<00:00:47.219> ring<00:00:47.670> rate<00:00:47.879> of

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
sound there and the bell ring rate of

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.400 
sound there and the bell ring rate of
programmed<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.559> decoder<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.360> dim<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.629> set<00:00:52.260> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
programmed the decoder in dim and set it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.400 
programmed the decoder in dim and set it
at<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> value<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.250> two<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.930> ring<00:00:55.170> rate

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
at a value of two to get that ring rate

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
at a value of two to get that ring rate
just<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:55.949> right<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.910> back<00:00:57.090> on

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
just about right there so we go back on

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.200 
just about right there so we go back on
again

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.700 

that's<00:01:05.210> pretty<00:01:05.930> neat<00:01:06.140> that's<00:01:06.409> gonna<00:01:06.530> be

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
that's pretty neat that's gonna be

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.550 
that's pretty neat that's gonna be
pretty<00:01:06.830> good<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:07.250> maybe<00:01:08.210> I'm<00:01:08.450> like<00:01:09.320> trying

pretty good and I maybe I'm like trying

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:23.290 
pretty good and I maybe I'm like trying
to<00:01:09.680> do<00:01:09.979> a<00:01:10.010> bit<00:01:10.130> all<00:01:10.250> right

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.430

unique<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.849> model<00:03:01.780> railroading<00:03:02.170> but<00:03:02.470> it

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
unique in the model railroading but it

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.619 
unique in the model railroading but it
can<00:03:02.739> be<00:03:02.860> done<00:03:02.890> it's<00:03:03.760> pretty<00:03:04.060> simple<00:03:04.269> there's

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
can be done it's pretty simple there's

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.059 
can be done it's pretty simple there's
the<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.280> motor<00:03:06.550> underneath<00:03:06.940> they're

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
the is the motor underneath they're

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.000 
the is the motor underneath they're
turning<00:03:09.069> around<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.489> near<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.819> can<00:03:09.940> see<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
turning around the near you can see and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.900 
turning around the near you can see and
this<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:13.300> main<00:03:13.599> motor<00:03:13.900> just<00:03:14.290> clears<00:03:14.910> just

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
this this main motor just clears just

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.180 
this this main motor just clears just
clears<00:03:16.239> that<00:03:16.510> I've<00:03:16.630> got<00:03:16.810> those<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.319> marker

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
clears that I've got those the marker

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.410 
clears that I've got those the marker
lamps<00:03:18.489> resistor<00:03:19.269> order<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.569> connect<00:03:20.410> up<00:03:20.560> here

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
lamps resistor order to connect up here

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.940 
lamps resistor order to connect up here
so<00:03:22.420> this<00:03:22.599> is<00:03:22.630> just<00:03:22.840> in<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.110> testing<00:03:23.530> stage<00:03:23.620> on

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
so this is just in the testing stage on

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:34.039 
so this is just in the testing stage on
the<00:03:23.980> workbench<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:28.230> love<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.260> bill<00:03:29.620> moving

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.750 

yeah<00:03:35.049> can<00:03:35.349> you<00:03:35.380> get<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.739> middle<00:03:35.860> okay

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
yeah can you get in the middle okay

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.199 
yeah can you get in the middle okay
they're<00:03:37.750> up<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.500> does<00:03:38.650> work<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:39.209> little

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
they're up to so it does work a little

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.530
