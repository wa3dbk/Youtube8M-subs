00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.040
 Mr. Paz wonderful 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.319
 Name was exactly per view of the Plattling 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.259
 one can wreak havoc in Beijing over Thorenz can run between cloud runs 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.509
 Spring is also open to the older side 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.529
 Video of a percent 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.769
 great stress artist whose name unfortunately was canceled then was 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.489
 it is quite illustrated 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.759
 what this control actually mainly to the mediation of 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.499
 interpreted 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:32.090
 you have to know that percent is certainly an argument for or 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:34.700
 against this von Forbach 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.069
 good taxes 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.940
 yes in practice 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.979
 Corner 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.839
 to educate a bit for blacksmith and understandable book you have in one 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.330
 tested the innkeeper live 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.080
 right in the evening 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.440
 the Doberman I supervised the location of our camera project 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.400
 and saw what I can say that is the real first time succeed 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.440
 were possible 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.400
 with these wheels and most popular game though he goes through the basic function 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.260
 work relatively simple 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.910
 but so for example so that next to percent exactly smell on him 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.150
 how often these times the pitch buff cheek than I would like 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.460
 These Wiesbaden policies like Kurt Neudert again then in section 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 One thing, of course, one or two times more on it while not at it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.380
 Often need to click this patch insulation boards on it 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.120
 Changes in the percent say so shift at this summit 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.580
 how is the squad need » 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.010
 Kempten made by 1 0% next time, of course, some percent wait until too 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.020
 the Texthäppchen their view very nice if you are all titles 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.420
 notorious 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.670
 can become defective 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.610
 however, it is here for each SOB 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.190
 that is not always clear is about the first board has and 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.570
 which is not while getting this typical problem for this and how that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.990
 shakes Amy defect his promoter later persists when two 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.590
 Games are running 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.429
 Melin Aubin effects still switch 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.859
 Since you have not directly their attitude from the account for a long time on the i the fact 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.480
 who put together in Sanaa a story with program tractors 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.280
 1 per cent, yes, there has been this attitude 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.689
 should you know how to put that is to say then clicked on year 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.299
 the opponent from this series got the value and not the other way round but that is 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.639
 actually set by default 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.169
 at least it was percent after Dr 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:22.439
 classic installation as it does not matter if the anatomy fight out 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.739
 you promptly turned on the effect and then made a mistake 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:26.860
 and percent 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.139
 because somewhere else stands and then stops 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.359
 Planning and would have been I would rather have rarely with anyway 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.409
 defective works 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.099
 but these Svindal the Maltese currently said this effect with substances Schenk 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.260
 put so to speak, three different effects on this percent 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.709
 to those 3% or have Grasser and want to show the most significant 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.779
 Concert halls as certified did not even have a way 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.749
 and now such policies must, in the end, be a room 2 percent 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:57.469
 Two things to note, two top clubs commit underdog but too 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.449
 can 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.869
 he offered this is because of the 9 effect because handling owed it 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:03.729
 a light that 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.949
 so even more I still have to do the theme of the strip over this 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:08.359
 Fit story 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.130
 important also that is the effect France to 5 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.110
 that in principle the same when you remove where that is an advantage that i have 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.839
 go to this factor 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.189
 It is clear that one can but his rules 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.419
 Corresponds to the classic, unique position of colors, forms of celebrations 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.699
 that means we can turn on its effect, however 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.829
 creates want to set, so to speak 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.269
 Percent the lady percent speed the shares of Eastman Kodak Christmas 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.659
 much spotted and then, of course, about the case of more Egeler 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.870
 the effect of failure really exciting so 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.729
 his assistant, so to speak, to taxes 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.199
 I am a bit complicated and opaque 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.949
 yes it is in tractor meetings that has nothing to do with the account but now 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.789
 it will, of course, accurately portray that 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:56.819
 Year comparison once briefly together thus Peter Fox might be 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.129
 really percent 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.959
 findig for a long time still so disunited and very moderate 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.969
 you see it takes about as big a device and around 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.579
 and has a bit of a rustic character 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.769
 around 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.370
 the just actual, in contrast to me, is quite clear 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.389
 to a greater extent to 4 4 percent 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.409
 that adapt from 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.550
 Pitch Bend and the direct access, so to speak, on the consistency DZ 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.360
 since furnished and less actually on this quality label friend and it 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.529
 is the Java distracts 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:29.530
 or the effects so those 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.570
 around the tractor-pulling now just the broken engines fly 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.080
 our look Saxon 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.949
 Of course we also got the same one Peter Fox is in total of 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.379
 the division much less clearly shown it becomes clear 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.490
 but the tve-ladies 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.590
 Percent that the roar inside the track works that way 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.650
 Traktor Kontrol first warning sign mode so it takes over in the second 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.009
 So the grip on accessing the track by track is definitely the defense 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.330
 Peter Fox that time per module Giggs 2 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.430
 the faster one 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.810
 works for a room with effects and what additional percent devices 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.659
 uses lead 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.669
 who are the word processor for the Life Remakes then surely that is the one 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.419
 Tractor control clear down front on the case 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.979
 otherwise it has already been said that nobody will come 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.500
 complete mix console but just a supplement very important that percent 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.860
 It works buzzing with psoriasis is an acquisition for someone who only 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.009
 works with the controller Cologne dpa with the computer and a controller 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:37.300
 Cologne 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.300
 otherwise the working group has to be said around 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.860
 Anyone who does not have a name check now has the action tag on the case 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.899
 think of this device around once with sprays not for me personally 

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.089
 I do not think that Peter Fox is necessary 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:56.019
 of it is an interesting device definitely there you have to just that 

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:59.679
 Anyone who has ever once ventured to be clear about what he did with these 

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:00.310
 devices 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.659
 really hires in the body then look at a mix habit again 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.180
 Pam for those who want to buy a new computer 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.530
 an external mixer maybe has a markup or even 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.469
 that's the eleven percent of the latter are traveling 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:18.270
 for the SP a Dream Netafim to the 1 tractor Kontrol x1 definitely Rheine 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.379
 Percent good and one possible if relatively cheap to be missing 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.720
 for sure, just attach safe captain I'll stay I'm her 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.699
 Matias will be presenting a technological for these finals 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.629
 something 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:34.369
 he can Moser
