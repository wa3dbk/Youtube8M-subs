00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.550
 hi everyone I'm rock and give them the 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.680
 welcome this new great video 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.880
 online point in this fortune I bring you 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.280
 a plis that I have been asked for 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.110
 enough time and it's like being able to spend 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.730
 vehicles from story to mold mode 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.380
 so here I bring you this version 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.989
 which obviously works for the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.550
 update 1.15 but we do not know if it's going 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.770
 to work on more updates 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.230
 forward then the only thing we have 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.149
 what to do is already in a session 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.250
 let's say that you publish we can be in a 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.329
 session by invitation we are here what 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.660
 only thing that we are going to do is press 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.850
 start and we're going to land management and 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.740
 abandon gta online here the only thing that 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.200
 let's just say where 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.820
 are our main characters and is 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.100
 the time in which we will seek 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.340
 vehicle that we are going to switch to mode 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.180
 online then keep in mind that 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.710
 unfortunately with all 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.810
 arrangements that rockstar has made to this 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.940
 clichÃ© we can no longer pass the vehicles 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.390
 that we want we only have some 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.910
 options that are sea vehicles 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.549
 with the starboard vehicle the vehicle 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.960
 of France, that is, all of these 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.090
 usually people like 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.770
 we can also go to space soccer 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.030
 we can also pass the new and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.210
 any vehicle 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.840
 but that is not a luxury vehicle 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.880
 unfortunately with all the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.680
 updates that rockstar has made 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.960
 Well, let's say that this restriction 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.450
 do not play any luxury vehicle 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.130
 none of the ls either then 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.479
 have the very ones in mind before passing 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.729
 the vehicle so they will not lose 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.380
 because when trying time and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.090
 then already once we have the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 vehicle that we want here I'm going to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.899
 do in this opportunity with the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.520
 maicon vehicle I know a lot 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.280
 People like obviously too 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.840
 we can get in the store but here 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.550
 we can get it totally free 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.470
 without any problem and we did not delay 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.330
 nothing, I'm just carrying the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.550
 vehicle until it was up to the saints 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.050
 I built closer by in general the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.909
 people like to come here that is the most 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.039
 central and the only thing we are going to do is 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.560
 park before entering and we will 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.360
 save a new game is simply 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.009
 we take out our cell phone we keep a 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.869
 new game if you do not want to overwrite 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.850
 what you have simply create 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.060
 a me here I already have one that I believe and 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.769
 then I will keep it here and once 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.470
 that we keep going to go to games 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.840
 let's go later to go where it says load 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.640
 game and we will load the one that we just 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.810
 of unmolding it is very important that 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.910
 let's load this one 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.170
 and save so that when you return 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.450
 to load it, obviously, already 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.700
 appear in front of the tall 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.319
 costs and with the vehicle that we already 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.209
 we want to go as I told you can 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.250
 be any vehicle that is neither of 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.840
 neither of those of ls then 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.239
 simply everyone that we want and what 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.489
 we have there and we keep in front of the 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.650
 high costs then we charge and already 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.930
 we can continue with the good clicks already 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.489
 once you have paid for the game 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.349
 obviously we will be in front of 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.420
 joint jumps is the only thing we're going to 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.610
 do is enter the high costs 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.530
 here we simply obviously wait 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.140
 figueres the vehicle and what we are going to 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.850
 to do is go play a game but not 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.650
 a game for the invitation an assignment 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.900
 by invitation but we will go to 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.850
 select gta online and we will 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.099
 select play gta online in a 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.720
 session ahead it is very important that 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.910
 do this if it is not it will not work 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.980
 the good this crisis that we can not 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.630
 to do alone and that also takes a long time 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.220
 little time then we can spend 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.140
 several vehicles and suddenly you 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.549
 they want to have all the vehicles of the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.349
 players or just some vehicle 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.239
 that you find on a street 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.770
 obviously it can happen quickly and 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.540
 very easy 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.580
 if he wants to pass him it is necessary to create the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.010
 crane can not be stored in the garage 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.050
 but they can play with their friends for a while 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.700
 just be there having fun 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.650
 several people with space soccer 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.630
 obviously circling the map of 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.670
 good online gta once we arrived 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.650
 here to the session we are going to press 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.030
 quickly start and let's go to the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.830
 eBookstore or shop 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.420
 playstation according to the console that you 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.950
 have this is very important that what 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.140
 do fast because obviously they are already 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.220
 in a public session and there are several 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.260
 people who are playing and 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.060
 possibly they can eliminate them or 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.830
 can they kill I'm just arrived 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.540
 Here to store course of play 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.670
 station and the only thing we have to do 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.010
 is to wait for the prices of 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.990
 the cards of these money that 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.330
 rockstar wants to sell us but not 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.250
 obviously we are going to buy this good 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.190
 then we wait and we will go back 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.570
 the here when we return is when we 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.280
 we realize if we did well not what 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.470
 we clicked then simply 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.720
 we wait a moment and when we come back 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.120
 what's going to happen is that we're going to be 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.380
 inside the vehicle and we will be 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.270
 within the high costs 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.310
 many times we appear within the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.050
 high costs we sometimes appear 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.070
 out then so that they have it in 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.750
 simply count 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.790
 according to the vehicle that you have 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.310
 chosen or simply because it is matter 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.590
 of milk that automatically makes it 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.840
 sometimes we appear inside or 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.150
 outside then as they realize 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.430
 then here it already appears and within the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.380
 holy costs and here we simply have 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.270
 than waiting for the English vehicle to 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.460
 and here again we can do what 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.080
 we want to simply pay you or 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.000
 buy some improvement you know that 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.160
 were we these improvements depends on your 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.440
 level in the multiplayer and also it 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.240
 have unlocked several things or not in 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.550
 the races then simply you 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.560
 we buy the locator the insurance to 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.330
 all risk and we no longer have to go back 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.400
 if in case they come to kill us here 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.930
 in this public session , we can already 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.550
 recover our vehicle and not 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.770
 we will have to do then again 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.150
 from the beginning because as given 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.760
 account I do not know if you notice here is the 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.040
 h roque plaque that reads in two ways 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.350
 here and entering my garage here 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.240
 we are going to register the plate that I have 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.100
 personalized so that they realize that 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.350
 it was indeed the vehicle that I brought 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.210
 the from the story mode then it is 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.460
 the way to pass vehicles of the 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.350

 new way to pass vehicles from
