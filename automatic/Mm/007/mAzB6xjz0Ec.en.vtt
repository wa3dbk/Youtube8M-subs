00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
as saver hemmond hinge method what we do

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.660 
as saver hemmond hinge method what we do
on<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.230> editor<00:02:28.239> install<00:02:29.239> your<00:02:30.130> decal<00:02:31.130> tape<00:02:31.519> it

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
up in the center and then we gonna do

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.160 
up in the center and then we gonna do
like<00:02:35.239> we<00:02:35.390> did<00:02:35.510> last<00:02:35.660> time<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.840> can<00:02:41.989> do<00:02:42.079> it

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
like we did last time you can do it

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.810 
like we did last time you can do it
either<00:02:42.260> way
