reviewing<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.670> arm<00:00:28.360> in<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.779> game<00:00:28.930> crossfire

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
reviewing the arm in the game crossfire

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.720 
reviewing the arm in the game crossfire
um<00:00:30.990> basically<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.529> arm<00:00:32.710> is<00:00:32.950> like<00:00:33.250> a<00:00:33.280> one<00:00:33.520> shot

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
um basically the arm is like a one shot

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.570 
um basically the arm is like a one shot
kill<00:00:33.790> sniper<00:00:34.210> it's<00:00:34.750> really<00:00:34.989> famous<00:00:35.290> for<00:00:36.250> being

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
kill sniper it's really famous for being

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.670 
kill sniper it's really famous for being
a<00:00:36.790> one<00:00:36.970> shot<00:00:37.150> kill<00:00:37.210> sniper<00:00:37.629> for<00:00:38.140> being<00:00:38.350> heavy

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
a one shot kill sniper for being heavy

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.320 
a one shot kill sniper for being heavy
and<00:00:39.420> fairly<00:00:40.420> slow<00:00:40.660> firing<00:00:41.410> rate<00:00:41.590> but<00:00:42.309> one<00:00:43.059> shot

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
and fairly slow firing rate but one shot

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.150 
and fairly slow firing rate but one shot
kill<00:00:43.570> if<00:00:43.840> you<00:00:44.110> can<00:00:44.290> aim<00:00:44.470> then<00:00:44.860> you're<00:00:45.040> gonna

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
kill if you can aim then you're gonna

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.590 
kill if you can aim then you're gonna
own<00:00:45.370> with<00:00:45.580> it<00:00:45.989> um<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:48.070> fire<00:00:48.340> rate<00:00:48.699> is<00:00:48.940> pretty

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
own with it um the fire rate is pretty

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.310 
own with it um the fire rate is pretty
slow<00:00:49.989> it's<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.800> slowest<00:00:51.220> of<00:00:51.309> all<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.610> snipers

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
slow it's the slowest of all the snipers

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.060 
slow it's the slowest of all the snipers
dragunov<00:00:53.489> m700<00:00:54.489> and<00:00:54.670> PS<00:00:55.210> GL<00:00:55.660> fire<00:00:56.110> faster<00:00:56.739> than

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
dragunov m700 and PS GL fire faster than

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.569 
dragunov m700 and PS GL fire faster than
the<00:00:57.370> arm<00:00:57.880> so<00:00:58.719> if<00:00:59.020> you're<00:00:59.170> looking<00:00:59.350> for<00:00:59.590> firing

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
the arm so if you're looking for firing

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.000 
the arm so if you're looking for firing
rate<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.149> you<00:01:01.329> can't<00:01:01.570> really<00:01:01.750> aim<00:01:02.140> as<00:01:02.620> well

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
rate and you can't really aim as well

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.710 
rate and you can't really aim as well
you're<00:01:03.850> gonna<00:01:03.969> want<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.300> go<00:01:04.449> for<00:01:04.629> another

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
you're gonna want to go for another

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.050 
you're gonna want to go for another
sniper<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.560> stay<00:01:06.039> away<00:01:06.220> from<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.520> on<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
sniper and stay away from the on the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.310 
sniper and stay away from the on the
accuracy<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:11.080> like<00:01:12.039> epic<00:01:12.940> win<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:13.630> is<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.170> most

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
accuracy is like epic win it is the most

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.480 
accuracy is like epic win it is the most
accurate<00:01:14.680> gun<00:01:15.130> in<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.340> game<00:01:15.490> definitely

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
accurate gun in the game definitely

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.830 
accurate gun in the game definitely
obviously<00:01:18.490> because<00:01:18.700> it's<00:01:18.880> like<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.119> sniper<00:01:19.420> but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
obviously because it's like a sniper but

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.630 
obviously because it's like a sniper but
it<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.920> also<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.399> most<00:01:21.520> accurate<00:01:21.880> sniper<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
it is also the most accurate sniper the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.410 
it is also the most accurate sniper the
reload<00:01:25.030> rate<00:01:25.270> is<00:01:25.450> quite<00:01:25.900> slow<00:01:26.290> it's<00:01:27.010> not

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
reload rate is quite slow it's not

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.670 
reload rate is quite slow it's not
amazing<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.900> it's<00:01:29.860> not<00:01:30.220> like<00:01:30.850> epic<00:01:31.659> fail<00:01:31.930> but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
amazing and it's not like epic fail but

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.340 
amazing and it's not like epic fail but
you<00:01:33.340> know<00:01:33.490> if<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.210> was<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.360> little<00:01:34.659> faster<00:01:35.110> it'd

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
you know if it was a little faster it'd

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.749 
you know if it was a little faster it'd
be<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.530> hell<00:01:35.799> of<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:36.009> lot<00:01:36.159> more<00:01:36.189> useful<00:01:38.759> power

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
be a hell of a lot more useful power

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.749 
be a hell of a lot more useful power
it's<00:01:40.390> one<00:01:40.750> shot<00:01:40.990> kill<00:01:41.229> um<00:01:41.549> pretty<00:01:42.549> much

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
it's one shot kill um pretty much

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.240 
it's one shot kill um pretty much
anywhere<00:01:43.240> except<00:01:44.229> for<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.500> like<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.830> hands

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
anywhere except for the like the hands

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.310 
anywhere except for the like the hands
and<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.430> feet<00:01:45.490> or<00:01:45.850> like<00:01:46.390> lower<00:01:46.659> legs<00:01:46.990> or<00:01:47.290> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
and the feet or like lower legs or the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.620 
and the feet or like lower legs or the
forearms<00:01:48.009> if<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.640> hit<00:01:48.790> him<00:01:48.880> there<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.090> think<00:01:49.509> it

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
forearms if you hit him there I think it

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.999 
forearms if you hit him there I think it
usually<00:01:50.079> does<00:01:50.290> 86<00:01:50.979> damage<00:01:51.400> so<00:01:52.229> still<00:01:53.229> quite<00:01:53.979> a

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
usually does 86 damage so still quite a

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.719 
usually does 86 damage so still quite a
lot<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.400> damage<00:01:54.610> for<00:01:54.970> one<00:01:55.030> shot<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:57.310> looks<00:01:57.520> good

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
lot of damage for one shot it looks good

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.370 
lot of damage for one shot it looks good
in<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:57.939> game<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.210> quite<00:01:58.689> like<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.049> way<00:01:59.170> across

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
in this game I quite like the way across

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.859 
in this game I quite like the way across
fire<00:01:59.710> did<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.040> they<00:02:00.189> did<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.700> really<00:02:01.240> nicely<00:02:01.960> and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
fire did it they did a really nicely and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:12.110 
fire did it they did a really nicely and
totally<00:02:04.869> like<00:02:05.140> caught<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.220> image<00:02:06.579> I<00:02:06.700> manam

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.680 

Oh<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:13.709> my<00:02:13.920> old<00:02:14.099> review<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.489> said<00:02:14.970> don't<00:02:15.450> run

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
Oh in my old review I said don't run

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.869 
Oh in my old review I said don't run
around<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:16.049> no<00:02:16.260> scope<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.040> because<00:02:17.310> it's

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
around a no scope with it because it's

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.180 
around a no scope with it because it's
really<00:02:18.090> inaccurate<00:02:18.510> at<00:02:18.900> no<00:02:19.049> scoping<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.159> I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
really inaccurate at no scoping so I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.520 
really inaccurate at no scoping so I
wouldn't<00:02:20.670> do<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.360> if<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.019> can<00:02:22.200> quick

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
wouldn't do that but if you can quick

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.039 
wouldn't do that but if you can quick
scope<00:02:22.799> well<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.519> it's<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.330> totally<00:02:24.599> beast

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
scope well then it's like totally beast

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.250 
scope well then it's like totally beast
at<00:02:25.290> close<00:02:25.500> range<00:02:25.830> cuz<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.750> figured<00:02:27.750> out<00:02:27.870> by

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
at close range cuz like I figured out by

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.869 
at close range cuz like I figured out by
just<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.799> running<00:02:29.220> around<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.760> like

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
just like running around in like

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.580 
just like running around in like
quickscoping<00:02:30.629> people<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.349> pretty

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
quickscoping people that is pretty

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.170 
quickscoping people that is pretty
awesome<00:02:31.799> um<00:02:33.739> overall<00:02:34.739> I'd<00:02:35.040> probably<00:02:35.340> give<00:02:36.060> it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
awesome um overall I'd probably give it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.830 
awesome um overall I'd probably give it
an<00:02:36.269> FS<00:02:36.659> r<00:02:36.840> rating<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:39.440> 4.2<00:02:41.269> 4.5<00:02:42.269> somewhere

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
an FS r rating of like 4.2 4.5 somewhere

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.680 
an FS r rating of like 4.2 4.5 somewhere
in<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.079> out<00:02:43.379> of<00:02:43.590> 5<00:02:43.739> because<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.730> one
