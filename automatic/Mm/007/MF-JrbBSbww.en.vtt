United<00:02:23.590> States<00:02:23.740> from<00:02:23.950> some<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.310> them<00:02:24.430> like

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
United States from some of them like

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.460 
United States from some of them like
margarita<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.180> right<00:02:25.870> afterwards<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.350> too

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
margarita for right afterwards not too

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.410 
margarita for right afterwards not too
long<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.800> Mexico<00:02:27.250> should<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.210> some

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
I think throughout the world fighter who

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.280 
I think throughout the world fighter who
does<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.150> jeopardizes<00:02:34.630> another<00:02:34.930> fighters

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
does that jeopardizes another fighters

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.390 
does that jeopardizes another fighters
like<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:36.100> should<00:02:36.340> be<00:02:36.370> banned<00:02:36.700> from<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.060> sport

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
like it should be banned from the sport

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.730 
like it should be banned from the sport
