00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
straight textured one the reason for

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.099 
straight textured one the reason for
doing<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.510> lot<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> time

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
doing this is because a lot of the time

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.960 
doing this is because a lot of the time
when<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.740> kinky<00:00:20.160> straight<00:00:20.430> texture

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
when you get a kinky straight texture

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.109 
when you get a kinky straight texture
for<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> manufacturer<00:00:22.039> they<00:00:23.039> tend<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.939> look

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
for a manufacturer they tend to look

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.420 
for a manufacturer they tend to look
very<00:00:24.199> crinkle<00:00:25.199> they<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.859> krint<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
very crinkle they have that krint a

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.970 
very crinkle they have that krint a
zigzag<00:00:26.970> look<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:28.260> method<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.830> I'm<00:00:28.949> going

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
zigzag look this method that I'm going

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.490

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
important stage is to braid the hair now

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.100 
important stage is to braid the hair now
this<00:00:44.940> needs<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:45.960> small

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
this needs to be in very very small

braids very small and very tight braids

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
braids very small and very tight braids
you<00:00:48.780> need<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> braid<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.590> close<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> root

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
you need to braid as close to the root

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.110 
you need to braid as close to the root
as<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.000> possibly<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> avoid<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
as you possibly can so to avoid that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.360 
as you possibly can so to avoid that
straight<00:00:54.120> silky<00:00:54.690> roots<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.230> textured<00:00:56.070> end

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
straight silky roots and textured end

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.060 
straight silky roots and textured end
look<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.940> then<00:00:57.690> also<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.140> need<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> braid<00:00:58.800> as

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
look and then also you need to braid as

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.310 
look and then also you need to braid as
close<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> end<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.600> hair<00:01:00.750> as<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> can

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
close to the end of the hair as you can

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.799 
close to the end of the hair as you can
and<00:01:01.620> secure<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.789> small<00:01:03.090> rubber<00:01:03.329> bands

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and secure with some small rubber bands

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.440 
and secure with some small rubber bands
the<00:01:04.409> closer<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> end<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the closer to the end you can get the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.550 
the closer to the end you can get the
better<00:01:06.630> then<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> won't<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.380> those

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
better then you won't have those

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.490 
better then you won't have those
straight<00:01:08.070> silky<00:01:08.640> ends<00:01:09.060> now<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> next<00:01:10.409> thing

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
straight silky ends now the next thing

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.010 
straight silky ends now the next thing
you're<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> need<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.909> home<00:01:12.240> perm<00:01:12.630> kits

you're going to need is a home perm kits

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.670 
you're going to need is a home perm kits
now<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.860> used<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:15.439> perm<00:01:16.439> kit

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
now the one that I used was a perm kit

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
now the one that I used was a perm kit
for<00:01:16.860> color-treated<00:01:17.100> hair<00:01:17.250> I've<00:01:17.759> got<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.030> from

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
for color-treated hair I've got it from

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.200 
for color-treated hair I've got it from
boots<00:01:18.450> I'm<00:01:18.810> pretty<00:01:19.619> sure<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:19.979> 399<00:01:20.880> but

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
boots I'm pretty sure it was 399 but

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.969 
boots I'm pretty sure it was 399 but
you'd<00:01:21.330> probably<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.170> double

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you'd probably have to go and double

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
you'd probably have to go and double
check<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:24.330> these<00:01:24.570> they're<00:01:24.900> very<00:01:25.049> easy

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
check that with these they're very easy

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.219 
check that with these they're very easy
to<00:01:25.500> use<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:25.860> follow<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> instructions

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
to use you just follow the instructions

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
to use you just follow the instructions
you<00:01:28.229> apply<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> solution<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> hair<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you apply the solution to the hair you

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.899 
you apply the solution to the hair you
check<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> after<00:01:31.229> 5<00:01:31.650> minutes<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.430> it's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
check it after 5 minutes to see if it's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.929 
check it after 5 minutes to see if it's
taken<00:01:33.479> form<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> hasn't<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.759> can

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
taken form if it hasn't then you can

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
taken form if it hasn't then you can
just<00:01:36.150> replay<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.750> section<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> checked

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
just replay the section that you checked

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
just replay the section that you checked
and<00:01:38.070> leave<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.820> another<00:01:39.270> 5<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.689> 10

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and leave it on for another 5 to 10

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.370 
and leave it on for another 5 to 10
minutes

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
minutes

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.940 
minutes
once<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.909> rinsed<00:01:42.780> out<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.350> solution

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
once you have rinsed out the solution

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
once you have rinsed out the solution
and<00:01:44.070> neutralized<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.210> you'll<00:01:45.360> find<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and neutralized it what you'll find is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
and neutralized it what you'll find is
you've<00:01:46.170> got<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.780> kinky<00:01:48.780> wavy<00:01:49.680> texture<00:01:50.159> but

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
you've got a very kinky wavy texture but

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.120 
you've got a very kinky wavy texture but
then<00:01:51.420> once<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.049> start<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.500> brush<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.950> out

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
then once you start to brush that out

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.420 
then once you start to brush that out
you'll<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.740> more

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you'll see that you now have a more

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.719 
you'll see that you now have a more
realistic<00:01:57.380> kinky<00:01:58.380> straight<00:01:58.710> blown<00:01:59.399> out

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
realistic kinky straight blown out

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.480 
realistic kinky straight blown out
texture<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.540> hair<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.890> you're<00:02:02.040> left<00:02:02.280> with

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
texture of hair so what you're left with

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.730 
texture of hair so what you're left with
is<00:02:02.640> something<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.509> looks<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.960> lot<00:02:04.229> more<00:02:04.469> like

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
is something that looks a lot more like

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.850 
is something that looks a lot more like
natural<00:02:05.130> afro<00:02:06.090> hair<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:07.049> has<00:02:07.140> been<00:02:07.170> blow-dry

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
natural afro hair that has been blow-dry

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.260 
natural afro hair that has been blow-dry
straight<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.640> won't<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.000> those

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
straight and you won't have those

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.250 
straight and you won't have those
telltale<00:02:09.709> zigzag<00:02:10.709> cream

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
telltale zigzag cream

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.600 
telltale zigzag cream
that<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.739> lot<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.400> them<00:02:12.610> tend<00:02:12.879> to<00:02:12.970> have<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:14.620> really

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
that a lot of them tend to have I really

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.630 
that a lot of them tend to have I really
like<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.329> effect<00:02:17.049> that<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.650> has<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:18.310> find

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
like the effect that this has I find

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.339 
like the effect that this has I find
that<00:02:18.879> it<00:02:19.030> gives<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.390> much<00:02:19.540> more<00:02:19.599> natural<00:02:20.230> effect

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
that it gives a much more natural effect

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.860 
that it gives a much more natural effect
I<00:02:20.829> have<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.430> lot<00:02:21.640> more<00:02:21.670> control<00:02:22.120> over<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.659> hair

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
I have a lot more control over the hair

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.750 
I have a lot more control over the hair
as<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.290> can<00:02:23.470> braid<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.769> right<00:02:24.159> down<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
as I can braid it right down to the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.880 
as I can braid it right down to the
roots<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.299> therefore<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.200> don't<00:02:26.409> have<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
roots and therefore I don't have the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.330 
roots and therefore I don't have the
give<00:02:27.400> away<00:02:27.640> straight<00:02:28.480> roots<00:02:28.870> which<00:02:29.340> basically

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
give away straight roots which basically

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.770 
give away straight roots which basically
don't<00:02:30.549> look<00:02:30.730> very<00:02:30.760> good<00:02:31.090> with<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.390> kind<00:02:31.690> of

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
don't look very good with this kind of

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.380 
don't look very good with this kind of
texture<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:33.459> other<00:02:33.579> thing<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:33.879> is<00:02:34.180> really

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
texture the other thing that is really

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.600 
texture the other thing that is really
good<00:02:34.690> with<00:02:34.810> using<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.739> method<00:02:36.159> on<00:02:36.250> human

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
good with using this method on human

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.390 
good with using this method on human
hair<00:02:36.819> is<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.239> can<00:02:37.569> style<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:39.099> can

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
hair is that you can style it you can

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.270 
hair is that you can style it you can
flat<00:02:40.359> line<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.079> can<00:02:41.290> curl<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.590> what<00:02:42.159> I've

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
flat line it you can curl it what I've

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.399 
flat line it you can curl it what I've
done<00:02:42.459> here<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.760> I've<00:02:43.030> set<00:02:43.329> it<00:02:43.359> on<00:02:43.750> bendy

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
done here is I've set it on bendy

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.569 
done here is I've set it on bendy
rollers<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.480> by<00:02:46.480> doing<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:47.459> setting<00:02:48.459> the

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
rollers and by doing that setting the

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.229 
rollers and by doing that setting the
hair<00:02:48.760> wet<00:02:49.000> letting<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.049> dry<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.739> then<00:02:51.310> taking

Hanoi needs tweaking but just show you
the<00:03:21.819> hair<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.720> very<00:03:22.930> very<00:03:24.299> soft<00:03:25.299> very<00:03:25.569> easy<00:03:26.079> to

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
the hair is very very soft very easy to

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.520 
the hair is very very soft very easy to
climb<00:03:26.590> through<00:03:27.389> use<00:03:28.389> a<00:03:28.419> wide<00:03:28.690> tooth<00:03:28.959> comb<00:03:29.109> of

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
climb through use a wide tooth comb of

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.159 
climb through use a wide tooth comb of
course<00:03:33.060> put<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.090> few<00:03:34.389> strengthening<00:03:34.959> ends

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
course put a few strengthening ends

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.500 
course put a few strengthening ends
there<00:03:35.650> but<00:03:35.919> I'll<00:03:36.549> probably<00:03:36.760> have<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.150> just

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
there but I'll probably have to just

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.939 
there but I'll probably have to just
trim<00:03:38.049> a<00:03:38.440> little<00:03:38.769> bit<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:41.290> can<00:03:41.319> just<00:03:41.709> see

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
trim a little bit but you can just see

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.559 
trim a little bit but you can just see
the<00:03:42.430> texture<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:44.430> hair<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:45.849> very<00:03:46.269> much

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
the texture of the hair it's very much

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.789 
the texture of the hair it's very much
like<00:03:47.669> blow-dried<00:03:48.669> you<00:03:49.269> know<00:03:49.419> I've<00:03:50.319> literally

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
like blow-dried you know I've literally

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.449 
like blow-dried you know I've literally
just<00:03:50.919> plot<00:03:51.400> this<00:03:51.579> on<00:03:51.760> top<00:03:51.879> of<00:03:52.000> my<00:03:52.150> head<00:03:53.459> it's

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
just plot this on top of my head it's

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.490 
just plot this on top of my head it's
not<00:03:54.730> pinned<00:03:55.269> down<00:03:55.629> or<00:03:55.900> anything<00:03:56.139> at<00:03:56.409> the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
not pinned down or anything at the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.750 
not pinned down or anything at the
moment<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:59.290> yeah<00:03:59.409> so<00:03:59.889> this<00:04:00.099> is<00:04:00.159> what<00:04:00.459> can<00:04:00.609> be

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
moment but yeah so this is what can be

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.080 
moment but yeah so this is what can be
achieved<00:04:01.139> when<00:04:02.139> you<00:04:02.769> do<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.849> yourself<00:04:06.090> this

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
achieved when you do it yourself this

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.189 
achieved when you do it yourself this
method<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:08.139> find<00:04:08.609> as<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:09.729> said<00:04:09.909> before<00:04:10.060> gives<00:04:11.049> me

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
method I find as I said before gives me

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.210 
method I find as I said before gives me
more<00:04:11.379> control<00:04:11.590> over<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.489> tack

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
more control over the tack

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.289 
more control over the tack
the<00:04:14.120> density<00:04:14.780> of<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:16.220> wanna<00:04:16.850> have<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:19.299> also

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
the density of I wanna have it and also

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.690 
the density of I wanna have it and also
it<00:04:20.450> just<00:04:20.630> looks<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.320> think<00:04:21.920> it<00:04:22.310> looks<00:04:22.490> more

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
it just looks I think it looks more

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.640 
it just looks I think it looks more
realistic<00:04:22.940> than<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.420> ones<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.960> the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
realistic than the ones that the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:39.220 
realistic than the ones that the
manufacturers<00:04:25.400> send<00:04:25.670> out<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:38.240> definitely

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
manufacturers send out so definitely

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.260 
manufacturers send out so definitely
