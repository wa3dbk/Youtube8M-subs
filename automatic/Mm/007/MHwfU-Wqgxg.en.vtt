00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.439
 I would like to explain the high paced copy stamp tool 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:05.569
 I think it is an ecopy stamp tool ぇ Name 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.320
 Use the street picture stamp for return exemption 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:10.559
 Well to 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.869
 Say m for the copy 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.489
 I will do additional work 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.800
 Well for example I'm here now 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.920
 There is a movie of 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:21.619
 I am 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.230
 What kind of clothes do you still have at this storefront? 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.000
 thought 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.020
 It is a place 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.939
 Parts of high-priced items in other places 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.120
 Well there is a copy and there is a delay of a minute with this electric wire before 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.809
 It is not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.080
 Then Otsen can match 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.550
 It means that it will disappear again 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.670
 There is work about being over-painted and disappearing before 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.790
 I can not answer 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.040
 Then I want to explain actually 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.300
 Please select the Torchtsu Fixed Asset Tool 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.830
 When this copy stamp tool is selected, it will be on the right of the screen 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.299
 Well this crashed report 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:56.539
 Hint palette 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.650
 You can see that these two have been waiting 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.949
 This is preceded by the medicine I copied 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.239
 Before and after the stamp tool 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.060
 After all the sampling match Tokushima part of this part 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.130
 Take it on 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.260
 I'm going to be an artist like Matsuura City 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.190
 No, I will explain a little 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.910
 It is to use again 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.780
 Double-click on at .movie 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.810
 Show layer panel 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.190
 It seems that I talked to food here 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.030
 I'm the one of the econel, but I still have it 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.580
 The 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.760
 This just makes life bigger 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.540
 It's 65 now, but it's too small, say 13 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.650
 It will be 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.800
 Just as I died 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.440
 Well in this way it is said that the size of Mr. Pula who I use first 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.470
 I will not accept 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.420
 Here 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.409
 The station is just 100 and I want to erase it from the beginning 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.700
 I think 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.500
 Now it's the next one I would like to ask from the people below 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.350
 But 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.880
 It is transparent in this way now 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.270
 I have a salary or a source channel 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.700
 To various 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.440
 The value is set 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.500
 Here first of all the point is 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.630
 Because it is not various things to invest in fixed assets 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.909
 The fine setting of whether to sample that well 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.039
 I have to work 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.059
 First of all in the UK 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.599
 Do you want one 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.319
 Basically the former work so far is a guide dog, but also this amount 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.799
 I would like to originally explain and explain 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.010
 Do you also apply to art? 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.470
 Channel seems to be after rgbaelet green blue 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.989
 is 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.379
 This will also be properly copied or copied 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.019
 It is also possible 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.179
 Also type 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:42.309
 Yes, this is a series of 11 regular customs 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:46.179
 In this case, I would like to explain it with some evidence 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.559
 First of all, the preset advance total number is building. 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:50.420
 In other words 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.510
 Sports that I use the part of mb in this 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.549
 I'm assigning as war so separately 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.969
 I can share it, so I would like to introduce this again 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:01.909
 I think 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.859
 First of all, check that the total number quilting and tomp are selected 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:06.789
 Please 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.499
 High pine sampling 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.500
 In other words, it seems that you want to use this part 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.449
 Breaking house small movement 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.319
 Oshima I use a lot of dishes and my target is rice consumption 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.239
 Because 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.999
 By the way I said this target can be used 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.279
 Left click 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.149
 It's easy if you left click high 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:27.499
 Sample this part now 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:28.869
 Because it was floated 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.649
 In this way 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.249
 I will never go 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.639
 Recently an arrow has appeared on the left of my eyes 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.519
 This is the part of this arrow 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.109
 It is used because it is used for sampling 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.629
 That's why 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.829
 This arrow part is in the book 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.890
 What happens if it gets difficult? 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.899
 Is in 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:49.879
 It seems that you have already made one point 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.709
 I can do it 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.069
 Select the place to sample with the subway 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.689
 I would like to ask you too soon 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.920
 It is a close part that can be played 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.920
 It is necessary to carry such things 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.099
 It is a background curtain, but I never say 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.939
 It seems that the lower one was doing, but it is also doing this 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:12.890
 But also 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.040
 Well on the first floor 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.229
 But if you don't, it's a tournament 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.319
 Several times each time rice sampling, ie whereabouts 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.769
 Look tight 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.670
 I'm just going to check it in an eco-friendly way 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.230
 Well, I just copied the number of winning that I copied 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.370
 So what part was it 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.560
 Will be supported 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.940
 In addition, if you can do it collectively, Ken Mille will not do Ekuru below 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.940
 But it is quite a small task, for example 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.469
 I wrote that the engineer wanted to live there 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.689
 Let's go ahead 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.999
 It is such a word and it can be done while confirming Mark defendant 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:48.550
 I think it sounds good 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.569
 I've got a little ema alternative 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.020
 In the form of eco 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.289
 ajax could 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.520
 In this way, the background is a finished movie 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.770
 I can confirm that it is in bloom 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.770
 Chinami I'm writing a little on the eco-friendly Taiga Continuity 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.509
 Was 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.120
 A certain degree of continuous increase by% 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.840
 x is also part 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.639
 It is the form that I am doing about 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.330
 It is when we choose the continuation 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
 Please have a look like this 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.610
 I've never been there now 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.610
 You can see where the weather is at the worship place 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.009
 I already made a key player with this paint man 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.879
 More than one key frame 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.139
 Time end time is taken 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.720
 I think that I understand that it will be soon, but in other words on the time axis 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.490
 Oh, such an effect that gradually disappears together 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.169
 It is not possible to produce 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.639
 1. Taste also disappears, but all 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.860
 But according to the time axis, it is not 5 seconds now 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.729
 For example, if you take 10 seconds and then Steiner 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.740
 It is such an end, but move 1 frame 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.110
 It is a small size, so it is said to hold such things 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.710
 What 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.500
 I will 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.360
 Of course there are others too ぇ Pick each key frame 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.740
 You can do so, so various directors are you? 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.720
 To 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.339
 Hiroto 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.789
 think
