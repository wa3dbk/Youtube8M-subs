digress<00:01:11.299> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.540> amazing<00:01:13.049> when<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.380> put<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
digress this is amazing when you put it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
digress this is amazing when you put it
on<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.979> skin<00:01:14.340> above<00:01:14.939> your<00:01:15.270> cystic<00:01:15.659> acne<00:01:15.869> it

on the skin above your cystic acne it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.109 
on the skin above your cystic acne it
draws<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.979> moisture<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> skin<00:01:17.970> in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
draws the moisture out of the skin in

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
draws the moisture out of the skin in
fact<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.600> funny<00:01:18.869> thing<00:01:19.350> about<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.770> cleanser

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
fact a funny thing about this cleanser

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.520 
fact a funny thing about this cleanser
is<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.340> some<00:01:20.520> people<00:01:20.549> use<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.420> draw<00:01:22.350> out

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
is that some people use it to draw out

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.710 
is that some people use it to draw out
water<00:01:22.799> weight<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.280> they'll<00:01:23.430> wrap<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:24.060> their

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
water weight so they'll wrap up their

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.359 
water weight so they'll wrap up their
sore<00:01:25.320> they'll<00:01:25.530> cover<00:01:25.680> their<00:01:25.890> skin<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
sore they'll cover their skin in the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
sore they'll cover their skin in the
abilene<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.850> wrap<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.330> saran<00:01:27.869> wrap<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
abilene and wrap it in saran wrap and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
abilene and wrap it in saran wrap and
that<00:01:28.470> will<00:01:28.740> help<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.159> draw<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> water<00:01:30.030> weight

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that will help to draw out water weight

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.999 
that will help to draw out water weight
and<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.930> basically<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> same<00:01:31.710> principle

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and it's basically the same principle

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.490 
and it's basically the same principle
I've<00:01:32.850> done<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:33.990> definitely<00:01:34.320> worked

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
I've done it it has definitely worked

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
I've done it it has definitely worked
for<00:01:34.680> me<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:34.979> draws<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.400> excess<00:01:35.850> moisture

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
for me it just draws the excess moisture

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.850 
for me it just draws the excess moisture
and<00:01:36.450> water<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> skin<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.680> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and water out of the skin that is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
and water out of the skin that is
building<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.460> around<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.240> deep<00:01:39.509> down<00:01:39.720> pimple

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
building up around that deep down pimple
