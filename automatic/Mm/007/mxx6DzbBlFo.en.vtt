00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.609 
and I looked at those patterns that I
thought<00:01:44.149> to<00:01:44.270> myself<00:01:44.450> would<00:01:44.959> be<00:01:44.990> great

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
thought to myself would be great

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.410 
thought to myself would be great
patterns<00:01:46.009> if<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.249> was<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.429> guide<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.029> I<00:01:47.179> needed

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
patterns if I was a guide and I needed

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.599 
patterns if I was a guide and I needed
to<00:01:47.509> tie<00:01:47.719> a<00:01:47.749> really<00:01:48.259> effective<00:01:48.560> pattern<00:01:49.159> in<00:01:49.310> a

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
to tie a really effective pattern in a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.969 
to tie a really effective pattern in a
short<00:01:49.939> amount<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.240> time<00:01:50.299> they<00:01:51.200> all<00:01:51.439> are<00:01:51.619> hosted

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
short amount of time they all are hosted

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.169 
short amount of time they all are hosted
within<00:01:52.249> that<00:01:52.399> page<00:01:52.639> and<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:52.999> absolutely

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
within that page and I absolutely

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.209 
within that page and I absolutely
recommend<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.200> checking<00:01:54.469> out<00:01:54.679> those<00:01:54.889> flies

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
recommend you checking out those flies

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.859 
recommend you checking out those flies
because<00:01:55.700> they're<00:01:55.969> probably<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.389> most<00:01:56.539> used

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
because they're probably the most used

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.949 
because they're probably the most used
ones<00:01:57.079> in<00:01:57.319> my<00:01:57.619> boxes<00:01:58.069> right<00:01:58.249> now<00:01:58.429> I<00:01:58.959> also

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
ones in my boxes right now I also

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.959 
ones in my boxes right now I also
separated<00:02:00.529> the<00:02:00.649> dry<00:02:00.889> fly<00:02:01.159> page<00:02:01.490> before

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
separated the dry fly page before

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.849 
separated the dry fly page before
whenever<00:02:02.419> you<00:02:02.630> clicked<00:02:02.869> on<00:02:02.990> dry<00:02:03.259> flies<00:02:03.590> it

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
whenever you clicked on dry flies it

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.800 
whenever you clicked on dry flies it
would<00:02:04.039> basically<00:02:04.520> list<00:02:04.729> every<00:02:04.880> dry<00:02:05.329> fly<00:02:05.599> that

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
would basically list every dry fly that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.410 
would basically list every dry fly that
I<00:02:05.840> tied<00:02:06.139> but<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.649> realized<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:07.340> for<00:02:07.849> some<00:02:08.090> they

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
I tied but I realized that for some they

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.260 
I tied but I realized that for some they
weren't<00:02:08.690> quite<00:02:08.929> sure<00:02:08.990> exactly<00:02:09.580> which<00:02:10.580> dry<00:02:11.000> fly

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
weren't quite sure exactly which dry fly

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.360 
weren't quite sure exactly which dry fly
went<00:02:11.630> with<00:02:11.750> which<00:02:11.989> specific<00:02:12.530> pattern<00:02:12.890> hence

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
went with which specific pattern hence

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.890 
went with which specific pattern hence
I've<00:02:13.520> broken<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.940> down<00:02:13.970> into<00:02:14.120> mayflies

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
I've broken it down into mayflies

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.250 
I've broken it down into mayflies
caddisflies<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:16.010> miscellaneous<00:02:16.989> I've<00:02:17.989> also

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
caddisflies and miscellaneous I've also

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.470 
caddisflies and miscellaneous I've also
added<00:02:18.530> my<00:02:18.830> from<00:02:19.130> vice<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.489> water<00:02:19.700> series<00:02:20.180> and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
added my from vice the water series and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.630 
added my from vice the water series and
that's<00:02:20.810> its<00:02:20.959> own<00:02:21.020> category<00:02:21.620> now<00:02:21.800> if<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.370> click

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
that's its own category now if you click

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
that take us from the fly tying bench to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.730 
that take us from the fly tying bench to
the<00:02:26.600> water<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.140> we're<00:02:27.230> going<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.380> talk<00:02:27.590> about

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
the water and we're going to talk about

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.120 
the water and we're going to talk about
that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
that

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.520

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
transition from one to the other I've

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.380 
transition from one to the other I've
added<00:02:30.740> a<00:02:30.920> page<00:02:31.070> for<00:02:31.310> carp<00:02:31.610> flies<00:02:31.850> because<00:02:32.150> we

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
added a page for carp flies because we

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.780 
added a page for carp flies because we
all<00:02:32.630> know<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.110> category<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.220> growing

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
all know that category is just growing

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.540 
all know that category is just growing
strong<00:02:35.360> right<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> two<00:02:37.190> final

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
strong right now and then the two final

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.920 
strong right now and then the two final
