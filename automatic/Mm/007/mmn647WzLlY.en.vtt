00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
here try it okay so you think oh yes I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.729 
here try it okay so you think oh yes I
do<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> lot<00:00:39.870> lighter<00:00:40.110> than<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.350> expected

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
do it's a lot lighter than I expected

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.410 
do it's a lot lighter than I expected
and<00:00:41.340> they've<00:00:41.520> written<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> Les<00:00:41.880> Paul<00:00:42.090> it's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and they've written a Les Paul it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.670 
and they've written a Les Paul it's
heavier<00:00:42.690> than<00:00:42.750> last<00:00:42.989> fall<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.530> all

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
heavier than last fall but it is all

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.990 
heavier than last fall but it is all
metal<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> kind<00:00:44.429> of<00:00:44.460> figured<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.789> would<00:00:44.879> be

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
metal so I kind of figured it would be

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110 
metal so I kind of figured it would be
heavier<00:00:45.660> next<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> neck<00:00:46.500> all<00:00:46.769> right<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.160> tie

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
heavier next the neck all right now tie

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.369 
heavier next the neck all right now tie
it<00:00:48.179> all<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> way<00:00:48.449> down<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.839> thinnest<00:00:49.170> neck

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
or yeah kind of I don't know what it

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.780 
or yeah kind of I don't know what it
sounds<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.620> a<00:01:25.710> slower<00:01:25.980> output<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
sounds like it's a slower output and it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.250 
sounds like it's a slower output and it
works<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.240> me<00:01:27.390> perfect<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:27.870> when<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> have

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
works for me perfect so now when I have

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.320 
works for me perfect so now when I have
the<00:01:28.410> switch<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.920> used<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.550> twist<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> time

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
the switch I used to twist all the time

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.820 
the switch I used to twist all the time
through<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> whole<00:01:30.690> show<00:01:30.720> sure<00:01:31.140> full<00:01:31.620> blast

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
through the whole show sure full blast

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.510 
through the whole show sure full blast

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
all my tone stuff with it with the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.080 
all my tone stuff with it with the
switch<00:05:12.610> sure

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
switch sure

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.610 
switch sure
three<00:05:13.270> different<00:05:13.420> volumes<00:05:13.750> do<00:05:14.200> you<00:05:14.290> ever<00:05:14.380> use

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
three different volumes do you ever use

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.220 
three different volumes do you ever use
the<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:15.310> tone<00:05:15.550> knob<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:16.090> dial<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.050> back<00:05:17.080> a

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
the the tone knob to dial it back a

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.440 
the the tone knob to dial it back a
little<00:05:17.380> bit<00:05:17.620> sometimes<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:18.670> you<00:05:19.270> know<00:05:19.390> you

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
little bit sometimes and you know you

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.370 
little bit sometimes and you know you
figured<00:05:19.750> out<00:05:19.840> every<00:05:20.080> show<00:05:20.230> is<00:05:20.350> different

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
figured out every show is different

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.560 
figured out every show is different
every<00:05:20.920> stage<00:05:21.100> is<00:05:21.280> different<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.210> might<00:05:22.390> show

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
every stage is different so I might show

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.810 
every stage is different so I might show
more<00:05:22.870> volume<00:05:23.620> on<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.860> rhythm<00:05:24.130> pickup<00:05:24.370> than

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
more volume on the rhythm pickup than

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.670 
more volume on the rhythm pickup than
normal<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:25.360> so<00:05:25.660> out<00:05:25.900> of<00:05:25.930> curiosity<00:05:26.290> what<00:05:26.590> is

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
normal but so out of curiosity what is

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.990 
normal but so out of curiosity what is
it<00:05:26.800> about<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:27.040> bass<00:05:27.220> drive<00:05:27.490> that<00:05:27.790> you<00:05:27.850> like

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
it about the bass drive that you like

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.590 
it about the bass drive that you like
like<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:29.020> particular<00:05:29.820> bass<00:05:30.820> drive<00:05:31.060> does<00:05:31.480> it

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
like that particular bass drive does it

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.970 
like that particular bass drive does it
do<00:05:31.690> something<00:05:31.900> different<00:05:32.230> than<00:05:32.290> an<00:05:32.440> over<00:05:32.770> like

do something different than an over like
a<00:05:33.010> normal<00:05:33.280> overdrive<00:05:33.580> is<00:05:33.700> it<00:05:33.790> real<00:05:33.970> real<00:05:34.120> real

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
a normal overdrive is it real real real

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.390 
a normal overdrive is it real real real
transparent<00:05:35.440> or<00:05:35.530> something<00:05:35.830> or<00:05:35.950> ghost<00:05:36.250> or

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
is a cleaner sound gotcha but you still

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.330 
is a cleaner sound gotcha but you still
it's<00:05:40.840> still<00:05:40.990> raging<00:05:41.410> you<00:05:41.650> know<00:05:41.770> really<00:05:42.160> great

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
it's still raging you know really great

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.850

not a sound guy mics up a 15 any mics up
to<00:05:44.980> 112<00:05:45.370> so<00:05:46.030> you<00:05:46.120> give<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.240> good<00:05:46.450> bit<00:05:47.020> good<00:05:47.140> exit

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
to 112 so you give a good bit good exit

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.260 
to 112 so you give a good bit good exit
domination<00:05:48.070> sure<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.640> then<00:05:48.850> the<00:05:48.940> compressor

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
domination sure and then the compressor

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.390 
domination sure and then the compressor
I<00:05:49.420> use<00:05:49.690> mostly<00:05:50.230> for<00:05:50.320> over-the-top<00:05:51.040> feedback

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
I use mostly for over-the-top feedback

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.550 
I use mostly for over-the-top feedback
stuff<00:05:51.610> or<00:05:51.850> lead<00:05:52.150> stuff<00:05:52.510> sometimes<00:05:52.990> he's<00:05:53.530> a

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
stuff or lead stuff sometimes he's a

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.100 
stuff or lead stuff sometimes he's a
little<00:05:53.950> bit<00:05:54.070> of<00:05:54.190> delay<00:05:54.570> Octavio<00:05:55.570> I<00:05:55.630> rarely<00:05:55.930> use

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
little bit of delay Octavio I rarely use

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.170 
little bit of delay Octavio I rarely use
hit<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:56.830> once<00:05:57.040> once<00:05:57.490> well<00:05:57.700> I<00:05:57.730> noticed<00:05:58.090> that

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
hit it once once well I noticed that

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.600 
hit it once once well I noticed that
it's<00:05:58.330> not<00:05:58.870> timed<00:05:59.200> on<00:05:59.530> both<00:05:59.830> it's<00:06:00.220> just<00:06:00.400> noise

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
it's not timed on both it's just noise
