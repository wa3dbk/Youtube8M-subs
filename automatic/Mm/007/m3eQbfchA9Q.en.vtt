00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
that is striking absolutely so the work

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.830 
that is striking absolutely so the work
that<00:02:45.570> we<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.050> here<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.470> called<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:47.070> girl<00:02:47.280> and

that we have here is called a girl and
as<00:02:48.840> we<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.980> newborn<00:02:50.400> girl

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
as we can see it's a it's a newborn girl

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.090 
as we can see it's a it's a newborn girl
that's<00:02:51.080> approximately<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.410> size<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.890> small

that's approximately the size of a small

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.920 
that's approximately the size of a small
truck<00:02:53.519> but<00:02:53.880> you're<00:02:54.090> right<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.420> thing<00:02:54.660> that's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
truck but you're right the thing that's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.690 
truck but you're right the thing that's
quite<00:02:55.440> extraordinary<00:02:55.739> about<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
quite extraordinary about it is the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.540 
quite extraordinary about it is the
meticulous<00:02:57.510> attention<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.290> detail<00:02:58.550> his

meticulous attention to detail his

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.670 
meticulous attention to detail his
massive<00:02:59.970> hyperreal<00:03:00.840> figures<00:03:01.440> are

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
massive hyperreal figures are

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.370 
massive hyperreal figures are
obsessively<00:03:02.340> detailed<00:03:02.940> down<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.329> every<00:03:04.079> pore

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
obsessively detailed down to every pore

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.140 
obsessively detailed down to every pore
and<00:03:04.650> wrinkle<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.400> think<00:03:05.760> there's<00:03:05.940> two<00:03:06.120> things

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
and wrinkle I think there's two things

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.910 
and wrinkle I think there's two things
that<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.810> go<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.140> with<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.410> sculptures<00:03:07.890> I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
that that go on with the sculptures I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.910 
that that go on with the sculptures I
mean<00:03:08.130> one<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.430> them<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.000> extraordinarily

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
mean one of them is this extraordinarily

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.009 
mean one of them is this extraordinarily
naturalistic<00:03:10.920> appearance<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.760> them<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.180> veins

thing<00:03:59.850> about<00:03:59.880> these<00:04:00.329> pieces<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.290> they're

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
thing about these pieces is that they're

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.250 
thing about these pieces is that they're
so<00:04:02.130> often<00:04:02.519> people<00:04:03.030> captured<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.780> such<00:04:04.230> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
so often people captured in such a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.200 
so often people captured in such a
personal<00:04:04.739> mind

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
personal mind

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.160

this<00:04:18.330> woman<00:04:18.660> who's<00:04:18.810> perhaps<00:04:18.989> poised<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.739> this

this woman who's perhaps poised in this

this woman who's perhaps poised in this

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
moment but you know between waking up

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.960 
moment but you know between waking up
and<00:04:22.260> getting<00:04:22.350> out<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.710> bed<00:04:22.860> which<00:04:23.100> is<00:04:23.340> on<00:04:23.730> the

one hand a very kind of everyday perhaps

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.510 
one hand a very kind of everyday perhaps
even<00:04:27.000> banal<00:04:27.630> moment<00:04:28.230> but<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:29.160> given

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520

this<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:30.180> know<00:04:30.270> extraordinarily

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
this you know extraordinarily

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.410 
this you know extraordinarily
naturalistic<00:04:32.430> treatment<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.060> we<00:04:33.180> end<00:04:33.330> up

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
naturalistic treatment that we end up

naturalistic treatment that we end up
having<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:34.140> think<00:04:34.800> I'm<00:04:34.980> very<00:04:35.220> strong

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
having this I think I'm very strong

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.880 
having this I think I'm very strong
identification<00:04:36.210> with<00:04:36.660> with<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.260> subject<00:04:37.710> and

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
identification with with the subject and

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.030 
identification with with the subject and
and<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:38.370> think<00:04:38.550> that's<00:04:38.700> when<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.420> works<00:04:40.040> often

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
and I think that's when the works often

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.530 
and I think that's when the works often
move<00:04:41.190> people<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.580> most<00:04:41.790> is<00:04:42.030> when<00:04:42.150> they<00:04:42.360> can

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
move people the most is when they can

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.960 
move people the most is when they can
kind<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.780> transplant<00:04:43.230> themselves<00:04:43.890> into<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
kind of transplant themselves into the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.210 
kind of transplant themselves into the
minds<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.750> sculpture<00:04:46.110> it's<00:04:46.980> quite<00:04:47.190> a

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
minds of the the sculpture it's quite a

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.800 
minds of the the sculpture it's quite a
fascinating<00:04:47.760> experience<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.570> see<00:04:48.690> the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
fascinating experience to see the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.210 
fascinating experience to see the
different<00:04:49.110> ways<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.230> people<00:04:49.410> interact<00:04:49.890> with

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
different ways that people interact with

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.310 
different ways that people interact with
the<00:04:50.310> works<00:04:50.520> almost<00:04:50.900> almost<00:04:51.900> as<00:04:52.020> if<00:04:52.140> they're

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
the works almost almost as if they're

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.830 
the works almost almost as if they're
real<00:04:52.470> people
