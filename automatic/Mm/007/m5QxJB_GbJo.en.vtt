especially<00:02:46.740> as<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.220> think<00:02:47.370> these<00:02:47.760> males<00:02:48.090> didn't

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
especially as I think these males didn't

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.190 
especially as I think these males didn't
sire<00:02:48.720> her<00:02:48.930> cubs<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:50.720> because<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.990> would

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
sire her cubs and because of that would

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.190 
sire her cubs and because of that would
possibly<00:02:52.740> kill<00:02:52.980> him
