in about 6 to 8 feet of water and the
idea<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.489> that<00:00:39.820> as<00:00:40.330> the<00:00:40.570> fish<00:00:40.720> come<00:00:40.900> in<00:00:41.019> at

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
idea is that as the fish come in at

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.600 
idea is that as the fish come in at
night<00:00:41.290> to<00:00:41.470> spawn<00:00:41.710> they'll<00:00:42.070> run<00:00:42.280> into<00:00:42.519> these

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
night to spawn they'll run into these

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.930 
night to spawn they'll run into these
gill<00:00:42.850> nets<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.479> they'll<00:00:44.470> be<00:00:44.589> entangled<00:00:45.250> for

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
gill nets and they'll be entangled for

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.420 
gill nets and they'll be entangled for
me<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.150> their<00:00:46.299> teeth<00:00:46.510> or<00:00:46.750> their<00:00:46.870> gill<00:00:47.080> flaps

o'clock that evening run the nets reset
the<00:00:59.530> nets<00:00:59.910> bring<00:01:00.910> those<00:01:01.060> fish<00:01:01.270> back<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.500> then

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
the nets bring those fish back and then

we go through pick out the right females

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.110 
we go through pick out the right females
they'll<00:01:47.380> be<00:01:47.470> placed<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:48.010> and<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.850> tub<00:01:49.090> with

they'll be placed in a and a tub with
co2<00:01:49.750> which<00:01:50.590> kind<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:50.920> relaxes<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.580> fish<00:01:51.790> so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
co2 which kind of relaxes the fish so

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.990 
co2 which kind of relaxes the fish so
that<00:01:52.030> we're<00:01:52.210> able<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.479> handle<00:01:52.780> them<00:01:52.930> without

that we're able to handle them without
squirming<00:01:55.000> around<00:01:55.090> too<00:01:55.390> much<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:57.520> generally

squirming around too much we generally
take<00:01:58.420> two<00:01:58.660> or<00:01:58.780> three<00:01:58.810> females<00:01:59.590> per<00:02:00.010> pan<00:02:00.690> we<00:02:01.690> we

squeeze the it manually squeeze the eggs
right<00:02:04.479> out<00:02:04.720> when<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.470> fish<00:02:05.650> is<00:02:05.680> ripe<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.220> eggs

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
right out when the fish is ripe the eggs

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.109 
right out when the fish is ripe the eggs
flow<00:02:06.700> easily<00:02:07.030> right<00:02:07.510> out<00:02:07.660> of<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.869> fish<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:09.119> we

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
flow easily right out of the fish so we

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.120 
flow easily right out of the fish so we
-<00:02:10.300> two<00:02:10.630> or<00:02:10.690> three<00:02:10.750> females<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.709> then<00:02:11.860> usually

two or three males we collect the Milt

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.580 
two or three males we collect the Milt
from<00:02:16.270> two<00:02:16.390> or<00:02:16.480> three<00:02:16.660> males<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.110> add<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.470> the

from two or three males to add to the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.510 
from two or three males to add to the
eggs<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:19.150> keep<00:02:19.390> everything<00:02:19.660> dry<00:02:19.989> as<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:21.340> do

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
eggs we keep everything dry as we do

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.640 
eggs we keep everything dry as we do
this<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:22.000> fish<00:02:22.209> themselves<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:23.170> dry<00:02:23.440> off

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
this the fish themselves we dry off

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.670 
this the fish themselves we dry off
because<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.660> egg<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:26.080> firm<00:02:26.290> aren't

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
because the the egg is firm aren't

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.540 
because the the egg is firm aren't
activated<00:02:27.280> until<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.780> they<00:02:29.230> hit<00:02:29.410> water<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.430> we

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
activated until the they hit water so we

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.000 
activated until the they hit water so we
have<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.730> window<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.209> about<00:02:31.270> 42<00:02:31.870> seconds<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.980> a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.730 
linear tanks those tanks then each day
the<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.910> we<00:04:33.390> funnel<00:04:33.660> into<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:34.080> different<00:04:34.500> tank

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
the the we funnel into a different tank

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.880 
the the we funnel into a different tank
so<00:04:35.580> by<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.210> end<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.540> time<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.230> four<00:04:37.620> days

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
so by the end of time in the four days

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.730 
so by the end of time in the four days
we<00:04:38.340> have<00:04:38.550> eggs<00:04:38.880> or<00:04:39.150> fry<00:04:39.540> that<00:04:39.780> are<00:04:39.960> four<00:04:40.530> days

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
we have eggs or fry that are four days

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.090 
we have eggs or fry that are four days
old<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.280> some<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.150> have<00:04:42.300> just<00:04:42.540> hatched<00:04:43.100> eggs

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
old and some that have just hatched eggs

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.170 
old and some that have just hatched eggs
when<00:04:44.430> they<00:04:44.460> first<00:04:44.820> hatch<00:04:45.230> or<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.730> fry<00:04:47.970> at

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
when they first hatch or the the fry at

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.180 
when they first hatch or the the fry at
that<00:04:48.330> stage<00:04:48.600> or<00:04:48.810> what<00:04:49.020> we<00:04:49.170> really<00:04:49.410> call<00:04:49.620> larval

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
that stage or what we really call larval

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.220 
that stage or what we really call larval
fry<00:04:50.460> because<00:04:50.970> they're<00:04:51.180> not<00:04:51.360> fully<00:04:51.660> developed

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
fry because they're not fully developed

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.360 
fry because they're not fully developed
they<00:04:53.510> they<00:04:54.510> have<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.720> tail<00:04:55.050> which<00:04:55.740> they<00:04:55.950> wiggle

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
they they have a tail which they wiggle

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.520 
they they have a tail which they wiggle
and<00:04:56.490> that's<00:04:56.640> helps<00:04:56.940> from<00:04:57.210> swim<00:04:57.990> them<00:04:58.140> up<00:04:58.320> in

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
and that's helps from swim them up in

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.970 
and that's helps from swim them up in
the<00:04:58.680> outer<00:04:59.010> jar<00:04:59.430> but<00:05:00.390> at<00:05:00.540> that<00:05:00.690> stage<00:05:00.900> while<00:05:01.800> we

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
the outer jar but at that stage while we

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.130 
the outer jar but at that stage while we
keep<00:05:02.160> them<00:05:02.340> for<00:05:02.550> four<00:05:02.760> days<00:05:02.970> is<00:05:03.750> because

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
keep them for four days is because

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.710 
keep them for four days is because
they've<00:05:04.380> got<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.590> yolk<00:05:04.830> sac<00:05:05.240> very<00:05:06.240> much<00:05:06.450> like<00:05:06.690> a

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129 
get a little plastic bag with a fish in

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.430 
get a little plastic bag with a fish in
it<00:06:26.159> our<00:06:26.879> bags<00:06:27.180> are<00:06:27.419> a<00:06:27.449> little<00:06:27.569> bigger<00:06:27.810> we<00:06:28.289> only

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
it our bags are a little bigger we only

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.890 
it our bags are a little bigger we only
put<00:06:28.740> about<00:06:29.000> four<00:06:30.000> or<00:06:30.120> five<00:06:30.270> gallons<00:06:30.720> of<00:06:30.840> water

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
put about four or five gallons of water

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.249 
put about four or five gallons of water
in<00:06:31.319> each<00:06:31.740> bag<00:06:32.069> and<00:06:32.970> we<00:06:33.210> put<00:06:33.419> the<00:06:33.539> fry<00:06:33.780> in<00:06:34.020> there

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
in each bag and we put the fry in there

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.939 
in each bag and we put the fry in there
and<00:06:34.789> then<00:06:35.789> we<00:06:36.300> try<00:06:36.539> and<00:06:36.810> evacuate<00:06:37.440> most<00:06:37.680> of<00:06:37.860> the

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
and then we try and evacuate most of the

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.339 
and then we try and evacuate most of the
air<00:06:38.099> out<00:06:38.430> of<00:06:38.610> that<00:06:38.759> bag<00:06:39.030> just<00:06:39.900> by<00:06:40.080> kind<00:06:40.259> of

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
air out of that bag just by kind of

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.719 
air out of that bag just by kind of
squeezing<00:06:40.770> it<00:06:40.889> like<00:06:41.039> the<00:06:41.190> way<00:06:41.310> you<00:06:41.370> would<00:06:41.699> a

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
squeezing it like the way you would a

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.839 
squeezing it like the way you would a
ziploc<00:06:42.360> bag<00:06:42.659> at<00:06:42.840> home<00:06:43.020> and<00:06:44.009> then<00:06:44.280> we<00:06:44.460> fill<00:06:44.729> the

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849 
ziploc bag at home and then we fill the

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.350 
ziploc bag at home and then we fill the
bag<00:06:45.030> with<00:06:45.060> pure<00:06:45.659> oxygen<00:06:45.690> and<00:06:46.520> tie<00:06:47.520> it<00:06:47.580> off<00:06:47.849> good

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
bag with pure oxygen and tie it off good

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.649 
bag with pure oxygen and tie it off good
so<00:06:48.690> it<00:06:48.870> so<00:06:49.560> it<00:06:49.680> won't<00:06:49.800> leak<00:06:50.099> we<00:06:50.970> put<00:06:51.180> the<00:06:51.330> bag<00:06:51.630> in

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659 
so it so it won't leak we put the bag in

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:55.309 
so it so it won't leak we put the bag in
in<00:06:52.110> boxes<00:06:52.770> cover<00:06:53.639> or<00:06:53.849> close<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.360> boxes<00:06:54.840> so<00:06:55.080> the

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
in boxes cover or close the boxes so the

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.980 
in boxes cover or close the boxes so the
sunlight<00:06:55.800> doesn't<00:06:55.830> get<00:06:56.370> to<00:06:56.550> them<00:06:56.669> and<00:06:57.030> then<00:06:57.840> we

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
sunlight doesn't get to them and then we

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.110 
sunlight doesn't get to them and then we
can<00:06:58.020> home<00:06:58.349> we<00:06:58.620> can<00:06:58.800> usually<00:06:58.949> keep<00:06:59.460> fry<00:06:59.789> in

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
can home we can usually keep fry in

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.240 
can home we can usually keep fry in
boxes<00:07:00.659> like<00:07:00.840> that<00:07:00.870> for<00:07:01.469> ten<00:07:01.680> or<00:07:01.830> twelve<00:07:02.069> hours

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
boxes like that for ten or twelve hours

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.469 
boxes like that for ten or twelve hours
if<00:07:02.639> we<00:07:02.819> have<00:07:03.000> to

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
if we have to

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.040 
if we have to
so<00:07:04.080> we're<00:07:04.849> we've<00:07:05.849> already<00:07:06.030> hatched<00:07:06.449> a<00:07:06.719> lot<00:07:06.900> of

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
so we're we've already hatched a lot of

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.809 
so we're we've already hatched a lot of
eggs

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:07.819 
eggs

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:12.339 
eggs

20 to 25 million fry out of those and

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:18.050 
20 to 25 million fry out of those and
we'll<00:07:16.710> stock<00:07:16.979> them<00:07:17.250> then<00:07:17.520> throughout<00:07:17.880> the
