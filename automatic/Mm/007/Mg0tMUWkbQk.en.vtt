unsuccessful in natural reproduction so

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.249 
unsuccessful in natural reproduction so
a<00:00:30.460> lot<00:00:30.759> of<00:00:30.789> zoos<00:00:31.090> do<00:00:31.300> this<00:00:31.509> with<00:00:31.810> their<00:00:31.990> cranes

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
a lot of zoos do this with their cranes

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.490 
a lot of zoos do this with their cranes
and<00:00:32.739> other<00:00:33.180> long-legged<00:00:34.180> birds<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.839> get

and other long-legged birds to get

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.340 
and other long-legged birds to get
fertility<00:00:36.040> out<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.400> their<00:00:36.550> parents<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:38.079> all

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
fertility out of their parents not all

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.200 
fertility out of their parents not all
crane<00:00:38.710> pairs<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.370> not<00:00:39.520> all<00:00:39.610> Stanley<00:00:39.969> cranes

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
crane pairs and not all Stanley cranes

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.299 
crane pairs and not all Stanley cranes
are<00:00:40.540> receptive<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.200> artificial<00:00:41.680> insemination

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
are receptive to artificial insemination

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.180 
are receptive to artificial insemination
so<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.809> a<00:00:43.930> skill<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.530> takes<00:00:44.829> a<00:00:45.010> lot<00:00:45.160> of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
so it's a skill it takes a lot of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.979 
so it's a skill it takes a lot of
practice<00:00:45.700> our<00:00:46.210> keeper<00:00:46.510> staff<00:00:46.719> actually

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
practice our keeper staff actually

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.010 
practice our keeper staff actually
trained<00:00:47.469> out<00:00:47.800> at<00:00:48.489> Front<00:00:49.030> Royal<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.539> learn<00:00:49.750> how

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
trained out at Front Royal to learn how

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.889 
trained out at Front Royal to learn how
to<00:00:50.050> artificially<00:00:50.680> inseminate<00:00:50.770> cranes<00:00:51.370> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to artificially inseminate cranes and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.500 
to artificially inseminate cranes and
it's<00:00:52.899> not<00:00:53.110> an<00:00:53.230> easy<00:00:53.350> experience<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.940> do<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.390> it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
it's not an easy experience to do and it

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.910 
it's not an easy experience to do and it
can<00:00:55.629> be<00:00:55.719> dangerous<00:00:55.899> for<00:00:56.289> both<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.559> bird<00:00:56.710> and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
can be dangerous for both the bird and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.110 
can be dangerous for both the bird and
the<00:00:57.100> keeper<00:00:57.520> when<00:00:57.910> we<00:00:58.300> go<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.750> do<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.800> AI<00:01:00.789> or

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
the keeper when we go to do the AI or

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.599 
the keeper when we go to do the AI or
the<00:01:01.539> artificial<00:01:01.899> insemination<00:01:02.680> first<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:03.460> will

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
the artificial insemination first I will

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.060 
the artificial insemination first I will
bring<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.879> male<00:01:04.059> out<00:01:04.330> of<00:01:04.539> his<00:01:04.690> shed<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.259> I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
bring the male out of his shed and I

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.550 
bring the male out of his shed and I
have<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.460> co-worker<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.270> is<00:01:07.600> going<00:01:07.899> to<00:01:08.080> do

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.050 
have a co-worker that is going to do
what<00:01:08.709> we<00:01:08.800> call<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.220> leg<00:01:09.459> or<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.849> thigh

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
what we call the leg or the thigh

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.830 
what we call the leg or the thigh
massaging<00:01:11.160> after<00:01:12.160> he's<00:01:12.399> calmed<00:01:12.849> down<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.390> will

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
massaging after he's calmed down I will

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.020 
massaging after he's calmed down I will

cloaca massage and this will stimulate

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.999 
cloaca massage and this will stimulate

the male is mean he's just an aggressive
kind<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.510> crane<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.480> we've<00:02:42.630> learned<00:02:42.870> is

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
kind of crane so what we've learned is

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.180 
kind of crane so what we've learned is
we've<00:02:43.230> learned<00:02:43.410> how<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.590> artificially

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
we've learned how to artificially

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.100 
we've learned how to artificially
inseminate<00:02:44.280> cranes<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.810> apply<00:02:46.080> that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
inseminate cranes and we can apply that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.840 
inseminate cranes and we can apply that
to<00:02:46.290> some<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.590> our<00:02:46.739> other<00:02:46.920> Korean<00:02:47.250> species<00:02:47.640> here

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
to some of our other Korean species here

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:48.410 
to some of our other Korean species here
at<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.060> zoo

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
at the zoo

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.240 
at the zoo
that<00:02:48.810> may<00:02:48.959> also<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.380> having<00:02:49.800> trouble<00:02:50.010> with

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
that may also be having trouble with

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.250 
that may also be having trouble with
natural<00:02:50.940> reproduction
