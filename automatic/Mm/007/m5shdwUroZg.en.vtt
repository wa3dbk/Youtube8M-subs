room forward so when I die I know it was

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.180 
room forward so when I die I know it was
probably<00:02:13.239> my<00:02:13.480> fault<00:02:13.510> not<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.379> enemies<00:02:14.890> fault

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190

probably my fault not the enemies fault
the<00:02:16.030> s12<00:02:16.719> shotgun<00:02:17.319> is

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
the s12 shotgun is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.070 
the s12 shotgun is
my<00:02:18.220> favorite<00:02:18.940> shotgun<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.510> game<00:02:19.810> right

now<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.710> just<00:02:20.950> got<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.970> many<00:02:22.210> advantages<00:02:22.720> in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
now it's just got so many advantages in

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.950 
now it's just got so many advantages in
my<00:02:23.290> opinion<00:02:24.010> it's<00:02:24.280> it's<00:02:24.910> got<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> great<00:02:25.540> clip

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
my opinion it's it's got a great clip

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.170 
my opinion it's it's got a great clip
size<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.890> mega<00:02:27.190> advantage<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.150> can

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
size that is the mega advantage I can

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.720 
size that is the mega advantage I can
see<00:02:28.570> straight<00:02:28.960> off<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.380> don't<00:02:29.920> really<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
see straight off I don't really have the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.340 
see straight off I don't really have the
real<00:02:30.940> law<00:02:31.210> that<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.570> take<00:02:31.750> out<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.930> couple<00:02:32.230> of

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
real law that can take out a couple of

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.890 
real law that can take out a couple of
enemies<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.130> then<00:02:34.000> switch<00:02:34.360> over<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.720> my

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
enemies and then switch over to my

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.940 
enemies and then switch over to my
secondary<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.920> b23<00:02:36.850> or<00:02:37.440> pistol<00:02:38.440> that

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
secondary with the b23 or pistol that

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.190 
secondary with the b23 or pistol that
gives<00:02:39.250> me<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.490> little<00:02:39.850> bit<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.150> extra<00:02:40.420> range<00:02:40.870> for

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
gives me a little bit of extra range for

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.970 
gives me a little bit of extra range for
them<00:02:41.320> longer<00:02:42.180> sight<00:02:43.180> line<00:02:43.450> kills<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.650> keeps

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
them longer sight line kills this keeps

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.640 
them longer sight line kills this keeps
the<00:02:45.130> enemies<00:02:45.520> at<00:02:45.700> bare<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:47.080> really<00:02:47.440> does

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
the enemies at bare and it really does

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.580 
the enemies at bare and it really does
work<00:02:47.920> very<00:02:47.950> well<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.420> it's<00:02:49.990> basically<00:02:50.410> coming
