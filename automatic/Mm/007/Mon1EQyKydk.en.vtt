00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
but perhaps not the widest
so<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.220> show<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.030> spine<00:01:45.420> height

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
so I can just show you the spine height

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.480 
so I can just show you the spine height
there<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.200> also<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:46.799> how<00:01:46.950> long<00:01:47.220> this

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
there and also you can see how long this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.770 
there and also you can see how long this
middle<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.030> well<00:01:48.180> which<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.390> what<00:01:48.600> I'm<00:01:48.750> most

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
middle is as well which is what I'm most

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.560 
middle is as well which is what I'm most
impressed<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.549> it's<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:51.030> long<00:01:51.210> middle

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
impressed with it's a really long middle

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.450 
impressed with it's a really long middle
which<00:01:52.020> means<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.439> even<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.070> quite

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
which means that even if you don't quite

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.190 
which means that even if you don't quite
get<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> center<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.990> still

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
get it right in the center you are still

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.590 
get it right in the center you are still
getting<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.710> very<00:01:56.490> good<00:01:56.670> performance<00:01:56.820> off<00:01:57.420> this

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
getting a very good performance off this

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.539 
getting a very good performance off this
bat<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> took<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.219> about<00:01:59.340> performance

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
bat now I took a lot about performance

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.030 
bat now I took a lot about performance
so<00:02:00.240> I'll<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> look<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.799> pin

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
so I'll have a look at it on the pin

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
so I'll have a look at it on the pin
with<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.310> mallet<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.149> starting<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.750> right

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
with the mallet here starting I'm right

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.359 
with the mallet here starting I'm right
middle<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.710> there<00:02:06.950> then<00:02:07.950> move<00:02:08.130> me<00:02:08.220> towards

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
middle about there then move me towards

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.190 
middle about there then move me towards
the<00:02:08.550> bottom<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.770> finally<00:02:10.770> right<00:02:11.190> at<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> top

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
the bottom and finally right at the top

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.620 
the bottom and finally right at the top
I<00:02:13.520> mean<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.670> can't<00:02:14.910> really<00:02:15.000> express<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.570> how

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
I mean I can't really express to you how

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.810 
I mean I can't really express to you how
good<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.250> performance<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.610> one<00:02:17.790> of

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
good this performance is this is one of

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.580 
good this performance is this is one of
the<00:02:17.970> rare<00:02:18.180> junior<00:02:18.660> bats<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:19.050> exceptional

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the rare junior bats with exceptional

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.500 
the rare junior bats with exceptional
performance<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.070> mean<00:02:20.100> really<00:02:20.550> pings<00:02:20.940> nicely

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
performance I mean really pings nicely

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.870 
performance I mean really pings nicely
so<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.740> say<00:02:23.280> about<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.730> that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
for us for a junior size 5 it doesn't

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.040 
for us for a junior size 5 it doesn't
look<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.790> best<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.270> certainly<00:02:27.480> performs

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
look the best but it certainly performs

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.420
