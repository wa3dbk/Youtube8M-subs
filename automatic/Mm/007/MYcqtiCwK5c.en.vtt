attach<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.630> take<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:37.050> fork<00:00:38.180> you<00:00:39.180> scratch

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
attach you take your fork you scratch

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.250 
attach you take your fork you scratch
and<00:00:39.960> add<00:00:40.440> water<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> parts<00:00:43.050> you're<00:00:43.230> going

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and add water to the parts you're going

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.850 
and add water to the parts you're going
to<00:00:43.469> add<00:00:43.590> things<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:45.230> scratching<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.559> called

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to add things to scratching it is called

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.690 
to add things to scratching it is called
scouring<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.930> water<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.379> called<00:00:49.680> slip<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.610> if

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
scouring the water is called slip so if

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.930 
scouring the water is called slip so if
there's<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> word<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.660> watered<00:00:52.110> down<00:00:52.140> clay

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
texture this one doesn't so to blend I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.240 
texture this one doesn't so to blend I
take<00:01:14.280> some<00:01:14.580> glite<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.330> clay<00:01:15.659> from<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> first

part and pull it up and I take some clay

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.480 
part and pull it up and I take some clay
from<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.549> second<00:01:21.000> part<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.450> pull<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> down

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
from the second part and pull it down

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
part and then mix them together and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.520 
part and then mix them together and
that's<00:01:28.829> called<00:01:29.100> blending<00:01:29.930> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.140> slip<00:01:31.409> in

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that's called blending if you slip in

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
that's called blending if you slip in
score<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> blend<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.570> very

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
score and blend it's going to be very

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800 
score and blend it's going to be very
strong<00:01:34.549> if<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.759> add<00:01:36.000> something<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
strong if you add something to the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.440 
strong if you add something to the
outside<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.159> had<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> chance<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:39.090> dry<00:01:39.299> out

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
outside and it's had a chance to dry out

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.410 
outside and it's had a chance to dry out
a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.689> bit<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.460> will<00:01:41.850> not

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
a little bit then it just will not

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.440 
a little bit then it just will not
attach<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.850> also<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.869> some<00:01:46.170> things<00:01:46.200> like

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
attach you can also do some things like

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
attach you can also do some things like
make<00:01:48.450> design<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> decoration<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.220> here's<00:01:50.460> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
make design and decoration so here's a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.560 
make design and decoration so here's a
piece<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.939> clay<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.420> made<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:51.960> thin<00:01:52.380> I

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
piece of clay that I made very thin I

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.920 
piece of clay that I made very thin I
took<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:54.810> hand<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.750> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
took it in my hand like this and I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.340 
took it in my hand like this and I
tapped<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.469> until<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.009> got<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.579> thin<00:02:00.350> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
tapped it until it got this thin and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.550 
tapped it until it got this thin and
I've<00:02:01.560> cut<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.070> shape<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.549> heart<00:02:03.469> if<00:02:04.469> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
I've cut out the shape of a heart if I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230 
I've cut out the shape of a heart if I
wanted<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.920> add<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> outside<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
wanted to add that to the outside of

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.440 
wanted to add that to the outside of
mine<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.719> would<00:02:06.960> still<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.469> slip<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.069> score

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450
