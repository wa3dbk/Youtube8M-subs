00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

so<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.510> want<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.750> make<00:00:00.870> an<00:00:01.260> adaptive<00:00:01.800> component

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
so I want to make an adaptive component

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.230 
so I want to make an adaptive component
that<00:00:03.680> is<00:00:04.680> going<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.190> be<00:00:05.279> my<00:00:05.430> glass<00:00:05.700> panel<00:00:06.180> and

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
that is going to be my glass panel and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.970 
that is going to be my glass panel and
what<00:00:09.240> I'm<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.480> do<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.870> fail<00:00:10.260> give<00:00:10.830> me

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
what I'm going to do is fail give me

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.019 
what I'm going to do is fail give me
four<00:00:11.400> points<00:00:13.160> 1<00:00:14.870> stars<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.170> reference<00:00:16.619> level<00:00:17.029> 2

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
four points 1 stars on reference level 2

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.900 
four points 1 stars on reference level 2
3<00:00:18.539> 4<00:00:19.730> I'm<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:21.740> proximate<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.340> shape<00:00:23.640> you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
3 4 I'm just proximate in the shape you

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.900 
3 4 I'm just proximate in the shape you
I'm<00:00:24.810> gonna<00:00:24.990> turn<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:25.380> into<00:00:25.910> adaptive

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
I'm gonna turn these into adaptive

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.290 
I'm gonna turn these into adaptive
points<00:00:27.390> by<00:00:27.660> selecting<00:00:28.349> them<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.150> clicking<00:00:30.150> on

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
points by selecting them and clicking on

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.990 
points by selecting them and clicking on
you<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.660> adaptive<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:32.550> now<00:00:32.669> I'm<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
you make adaptive and now I'm going to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700 
you make adaptive and now I'm going to
connect<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.469> draw<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
connect them up so I'm going to draw a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.970 
connect them up so I'm going to draw a
reference<00:00:35.370> line<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.170> got<00:00:40.379> my<00:00:40.530> 3ds

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
reference line and I've got my 3ds

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.510 
reference line and I've got my 3ds
snapping<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> want<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> make<00:00:43.800> sure<00:00:43.829> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
snapping on so I want to make sure that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.229 
snapping on so I want to make sure that
when<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> draw<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:48.710> these<00:00:49.710> are<00:00:49.980> connected<00:00:50.820> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
when I draw this these are connected so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.819 
when I draw this these are connected so
what<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.899> flex<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> know

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
what I'm going to do is flex it you know

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.060 
what I'm going to do is flex it you know
if<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.039> grab<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.719> move<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.899> make<00:00:55.680> sure<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
if I grab it and move it make sure it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.720 
if I grab it and move it make sure it
flexes<00:00:57.500> if<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.770> grab<00:00:59.340> it<00:01:00.109> move<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.699> making<00:01:02.699> sure

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
flexes if I grab it move it making sure

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.039 
flexes if I grab it move it making sure
it<00:01:03.059> flexes<00:01:04.400> okay<00:01:05.400> let<00:01:05.580> me<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.670> put<00:01:06.150> our<00:01:09.049> point

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it flexes okay let me just put our point

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.649 
it flexes okay let me just put our point
on<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.100> drop<00:01:11.310> some<00:01:11.580> geometry<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.510> I'm

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
on here to drop some geometry so I'm

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.420 
on here to drop some geometry so I'm
going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.140> select<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.740> plane<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.369> I'm

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
going to do is select the plane but I'm

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.990 
going to do is select the plane but I'm
drafting<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:16.250> then<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> come<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
drafting on then I'm going to come in

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.749 
drafting on then I'm going to come in
and<00:01:18.119> draw<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:18.780> geometry<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.100> plane<00:01:20.520> here

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and draw some geometry on the plane here

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.260 
and draw some geometry on the plane here
it's<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.090> drafted<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:23.000> something<00:01:24.000> kind<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it's just drafted as something kind of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's just drafted as something kind of
approximate<00:01:25.020> let's<00:01:25.229> do

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.850 

so<00:01:29.190> it<00:01:29.280> comes<00:01:29.550> in<00:01:29.820> two<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.660> about<00:01:30.990> 29

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so it comes in two and it's about 29

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.310 
so it comes in two and it's about 29
inches<00:01:31.890> deep<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.940> then<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.050> I'm<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.260> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
inches deep and then what I'm going to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.910 
inches deep and then what I'm going to
do<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:34.830> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.100> say<00:01:35.370> lets<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.970> move

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
do is I'm going to say lets you move

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.140 
do is I'm going to say lets you move
that<00:01:38.780> let's<00:01:39.780> move<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.290> from<00:01:40.620> mid<00:01:41.580> point<00:01:41.940> they

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that let's move it from mid point they

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.640 
that let's move it from mid point they
are<00:01:42.180> down<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.900> other<00:01:43.080> pointers<00:01:45.470> ok<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:46.619> ready

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
are down to other pointers ok I'm ready

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.790 
are down to other pointers ok I'm ready
to<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> sweep<00:01:48.660> so<00:01:49.080> I'm<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.410> pick<00:01:49.590> on

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
to to do a sweep so I'm going to pick on

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.680 
to to do a sweep so I'm going to pick on
the<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:51.560> reference<00:01:52.560> planes<00:01:53.330> reference<00:01:54.330> lines

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
the for reference planes reference lines

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.620 
the for reference planes reference lines
and<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.440> ctrl<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:56.670> select<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.180> actual

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
and then ctrl and select the actual

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.770 
and then ctrl and select the actual
profile<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.360> say<00:02:00.360> create<00:02:00.960> me<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> form<00:02:02.780> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
profile and say create me a form and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.100 
profile and say create me a form and
that<00:02:04.020> would<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.410> outline<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.340> my<00:02:06.110> glass

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that would be the outline of my glass

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.690 
that would be the outline of my glass
panel<00:02:07.710> let<00:02:07.920> me<00:02:08.040> just<00:02:08.190> check<00:02:08.580> again<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:11.340> call

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
