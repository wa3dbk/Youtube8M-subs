00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.250
 one of the women who have to be 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.680

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.270
 left very strong and jessica trying 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.970
 follow the wake of going with the Korean I 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:19.310
 as I was saying is a swimmer of 224 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.670
 He has also come out with a lot of desire 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.050
 it has stopped us orienting by the madness 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.140
 previous of 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.520
 assigned rhythm and there has not 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.409
 gone a lot slower than her because 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.060
 he has also gone through that 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.280
 the initiative is willing to 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.439
 plant him battle to see if he can stand and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.240
 meanwhile all occupying navy 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.159
 that for now the third position and 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.000
 third and a good time is at the end 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.939
 physical that has gone through a hundred in seventh 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.290
 position looking also lower that 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.320
 personal brand try 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.530
 approach because not to those eight best 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530
 time 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.520

 fighting marine lake of lords 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.590
 very close the low of 20 at this rate 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.140
 but above all marine it seems that 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.300
 it's squeezing and it's happening 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.890
