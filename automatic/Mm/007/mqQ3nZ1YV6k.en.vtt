what<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.360> did<00:01:45.509> was<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.780> set<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.740> sort<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.280> little

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
what we did was we set up sort of little

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.450 
what we did was we set up sort of little
villages<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.530> makes<00:01:49.680> sense<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.009> living

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
villages if that makes sense or living

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.910 
villages if that makes sense or living
pods<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.420> again<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:51.990> how<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
pods and and again I don't know how the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.649 
pods and and again I don't know how the
families<00:01:53.430> interact<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.509> know

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
families interact and I don't know

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.480 
families interact and I don't know
obviously<00:01:55.530> every<00:01:55.740> situation<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.280> different

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
obviously every situation is different

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
obviously every situation is different
but<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:57.450> tried<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.719> build<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.049> around<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
but we tried to build it around a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.929 
but we tried to build it around a
courtyard<00:01:58.590> where<00:01:59.549> there<00:01:59.700> could<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.880> some

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
courtyard where there could be some

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
courtyard where there could be some
safety<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.479> security<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.049> family<00:02:01.439> there

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
safety and security for a family there

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.590 
safety and security for a family there
could<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.909> internal<00:02:02.909> garden<00:02:03.270> plot

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
could be a internal garden plot

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.910 
could be a internal garden plot
something<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.259> nature<00:02:04.380> where<00:02:04.799> they

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
something of that nature where they

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.600 
something of that nature where they
could<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:05.700> they<00:02:06.630> could<00:02:06.799> grow<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
could they could they could grow and

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.869 
could they could they could grow and
produce<00:02:08.849> some<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.209> their<00:02:09.300> own<00:02:09.420> food

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
produce some of their own food

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.599 
produce some of their own food
and<00:02:10.539> then<00:02:10.629> we<00:02:10.719> just<00:02:10.869> depend<00:02:11.590> again<00:02:12.249> again

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.609 
and then we just depend again again

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.429 
and then we just depend again again

approach to for children on the other
side<00:02:30.730> we've<00:02:31.689> got<00:02:31.719> 15<00:02:32.349> different<00:02:32.469> layouts<00:02:32.950> I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
side we've got 15 different layouts I

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.410 
side we've got 15 different layouts I
mean<00:02:33.129> it<00:02:33.250> there's<00:02:33.609> nothing<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.030> needs<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.329> be

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
mean it there's nothing it needs to be

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.000 
mean it there's nothing it needs to be
written<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.689> stone<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.079> front<00:02:35.290> but<00:02:35.739> again

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
written in stone on that front but again

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.490 
written in stone on that front but again
by<00:02:36.159> doing<00:02:36.430> that<00:02:36.519> we<00:02:36.730> then<00:02:36.969> can<00:02:37.209> make<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.810> area

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
by doing that we then can make this area

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.780 
by doing that we then can make this area
in<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.650> middle<00:02:38.889> that's<00:02:39.069> sort<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.489> their

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
in the middle that's sort of the their

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.089 
in the middle that's sort of the their
personal<00:02:40.299> living<00:02:40.540> space<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.590> expansion

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
personal living space and for expansion

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.509 
personal living space and for expansion
space<00:02:42.250> for<00:02:42.639> more<00:02:43.299> beds<00:02:43.510> or<00:02:43.689> whatever<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.109> is

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
space for more beds or whatever it is

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.099 
space for more beds or whatever it is
but<00:02:45.519> again<00:02:45.579> it<00:02:45.879> doesn't<00:02:46.180> what<00:02:46.689> we're<00:02:46.840> doing

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
but again it doesn't what we're doing

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.569 
but again it doesn't what we're doing
then<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.590> using<00:02:47.949> the<00:02:48.040> shipping<00:02:48.250> containers

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
then is using the shipping containers

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.939 
then is using the shipping containers
it's<00:02:48.730> basically<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.239> mass<00:02:49.959> structure<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.799> the

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:50.949 
it's basically the mass structure of the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.800 
it's basically the mass structure of the
building<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.879> walls<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.449> then<00:02:52.599> we<00:02:52.689> can

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
building and the walls and then we can

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.360 
building and the walls and then we can
come<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.019> with<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.169> truss<00:02:53.379> system<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:54.280> we

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
come in with a truss system that we

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.809 
come in with a truss system that we
think<00:02:54.579> we<00:02:54.669> can<00:02:54.699> handle<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:56.319> scale<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:57.760> it

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
think we can handle to scale it so it

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:58.740 
think we can handle to scale it so it
doesn't<00:02:58.060> make<00:02:58.120> people<00:02:58.419> feel<00:02:58.540> like<00:02:58.569> they're

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
doesn't make people feel like they're

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.360 
doesn't make people feel like they're
living<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.079> a<00:02:59.109> box<00:02:59.319> so<00:02:59.739> there's<00:03:00.010> several

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
living in a box so there's several

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.520 
living in a box so there's several
buildings<00:03:00.909> I<00:03:01.060> think<00:03:01.269> one<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.540> them<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.959> is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
buildings I think one of them is is

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.800 
buildings I think one of them is is
gonna<00:03:02.829> be<00:03:02.949> large<00:03:03.219> enough<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.879> this<00:03:04.389> may<00:03:04.659> not

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
gonna be large enough that this may not

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.839 
gonna be large enough that this may not
be<00:03:05.049> an<00:03:05.319> option<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:05.709> yeah<00:03:06.129> it<00:03:06.370> would<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.519> like

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
be an option for yeah it would have like

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.250 
be an option for yeah it would have like
it<00:03:07.090> would<00:03:07.180> probably<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.719> know<00:03:07.750> more<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.109> a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
it would probably you know more of a

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.470 
it would probably you know more of a
steel<00:03:08.500> frame<00:03:08.680> perfect'<00:03:09.579> you<00:03:09.639> know<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.389> that's

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
steel frame perfect' you know and that's

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.559 
steel frame perfect' you know and that's
what<00:03:11.069> Uptown<00:03:12.069> market<00:03:12.370> we<00:03:12.609> believe<00:03:12.639> that<00:03:13.329> steel

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
what Uptown market we believe that steel

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.420 
what Uptown market we believe that steel
frame<00:03:13.810> has<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.079> lot<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.349> benefit<00:03:15.040> or<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
frame has a lot of benefit or a

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.219 
frame has a lot of benefit or a
combination<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.239> two<00:03:16.449> to<00:03:16.780> mix<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.199> two

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
combination of the two to mix the two

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.710 
combination of the two to mix the two
well<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.009> just<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.699> get<00:03:18.849> some<00:03:19.000> height<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.540> mean

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
well and just to get some height I mean

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.229 
well and just to get some height I mean
versus<00:03:20.079> stacking<00:03:20.470> these<00:03:20.560> things<00:03:20.859> right<00:03:21.239> not

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239

versus stacking these things right not
that<00:03:22.389> you<00:03:22.479> can't<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:23.079> just<00:03:23.379> a<00:03:23.470> matter<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.799> is

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
that you can't it's just a matter of is

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.740 
that you can't it's just a matter of is
it<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.459> most<00:03:24.639> efficient<00:03:25.090> way<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.209> do<00:03:25.449> it<00:03:25.569> right

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
it the most efficient way to do it right

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.629 
it the most efficient way to do it right
and<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.590> if<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.709> can<00:03:26.889> sit<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.250> strip<00:03:27.459> down<00:03:27.489> a

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
and and if you can sit and strip down a

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.089 
and and if you can sit and strip down a
steel<00:03:28.389> building<00:03:28.509> I<00:03:28.900> think<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.590> make<00:03:29.739> or<00:03:29.919> have

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
steel building I think that make or have

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.920 
steel building I think that make or have
it<00:03:30.250> been<00:03:30.370> manufactured<00:03:31.060> there<00:03:31.180> right<00:03:31.659> I<00:03:31.840> mean

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
it been manufactured there right I mean

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.149 
it been manufactured there right I mean
that's<00:03:32.019> exactly<00:03:32.470> what<00:03:32.590> we<00:03:32.680> did<00:03:32.799> here<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:33.040> mean

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
that's exactly what we did here I mean

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.039 
that's exactly what we did here I mean
that<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.459> whole<00:03:33.639> part<00:03:33.909> is<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.449> steel<00:03:34.780> and

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
that this whole part is is steel and

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.319 
that this whole part is is steel and
then<00:03:35.349> we<00:03:35.439> put<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:36.040> know<00:03:36.129> Alexian<00:03:36.699> Plexiglas

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
then we put you know Alexian Plexiglas

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.960 
then we put you know Alexian Plexiglas
kind<00:03:37.569> of<00:03:37.629> thing<00:03:37.810> for<00:03:38.019> see-through<00:03:39.009> but<00:03:39.639> down

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
kind of thing for see-through but down

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.300 
kind of thing for see-through but down
there<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.269> may<00:03:40.389> not<00:03:40.569> make<00:03:40.840> sense<00:03:41.099> you<00:03:42.099> may<00:03:42.250> need

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
there it may not make sense you may need

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.610 
there it may not make sense you may need
just<00:03:42.489> have<00:03:42.759> something<00:03:42.970> more<00:03:43.479> opaque<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.229> keep

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
just have something more opaque to keep

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.409 
just have something more opaque to keep
the<00:03:44.709> heat<00:03:44.889> yeah<00:03:45.159> we<00:03:45.340> definitely<00:03:45.759> would<00:03:45.939> and

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
the heat yeah we definitely would and

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.429 
the heat yeah we definitely would and
then<00:03:46.659> ultimately<00:03:46.780> if<00:03:47.109> there's<00:03:47.259> enough

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
then ultimately if there's enough

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.110 
then ultimately if there's enough
shipping<00:03:47.650> containers<00:03:47.949> down<00:03:48.129> there<00:03:48.340> we'll<00:03:49.000> set

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
shipping containers down there we'll set

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.539 
shipping containers down there we'll set
up<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.269> shop<00:03:49.479> down<00:03:49.689> there<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.109> and<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.250> then<00:03:51.400> go

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
up a shop down there and and and then go

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.949 
up a shop down there and and and then go
back<00:03:51.669> to<00:03:51.699> your<00:03:51.819> education<00:03:52.329> situation<00:03:52.479> teach

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
back to your education situation teach

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.499 
back to your education situation teach
people<00:03:53.139> how<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.319> weld<00:03:53.560> cut<00:03:54.400> metal<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:54.969> and

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:55.509 
people how to weld cut metal and and

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:56.520 
people how to weld cut metal and and
hopefully<00:03:55.780> make<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.049> self-sustained<00:03:56.469> I

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
hopefully make it a self-sustained I

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.020 
hopefully make it a self-sustained I
think<00:03:56.709> long<00:03:56.979> term<00:03:57.009> that<00:03:57.519> makes<00:03:57.729> a<00:03:57.849> lot<00:03:58.000> of

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
think long term that makes a lot of

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.670 
think long term that makes a lot of
sense<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.540> know<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.229> gives<00:03:59.379> you<00:03:59.500> guys<00:03:59.650> a

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
sense you know it gives you guys a

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.249 
sense you know it gives you guys a
chance<00:03:59.829> to<00:04:00.189> get<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.549> mm-hmm<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.359> but<00:04:01.900> not<00:04:02.079> have

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:02.259 
chance to get in mm-hmm and but not have

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.990 
chance to get in mm-hmm and but not have
to<00:04:02.409> make<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.709> like<00:04:02.979> long<00:04:03.250> term<00:04:03.280> commitment

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
to make this like long term commitment

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.670 
to make this like long term commitment
to<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:04.239> there<00:04:04.479> well<00:04:04.900> anything<00:04:05.199> and<00:04:05.439> it<00:04:05.500> seems

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
to be there well anything and it seems

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.020 
to be there well anything and it seems
like<00:04:05.799> there's<00:04:05.949> a<00:04:05.979> lot<00:04:06.129> of<00:04:06.219> people<00:04:06.400> trying<00:04:06.819> to

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
like there's a lot of people trying to

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.539 
like there's a lot of people trying to
be<00:04:07.150> there<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:07.599> I'm<00:04:07.689> trying<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> figure<00:04:08.409> out

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
be there and I'm trying to figure out

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.949 
be there and I'm trying to figure out
what<00:04:09.549> makes<00:04:09.789> sense<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.180> we've<00:04:10.629> had<00:04:10.780> some

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
what makes sense and we've had some

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.629 
what makes sense and we've had some
conversations<00:04:11.650> with<00:04:11.829> people<00:04:12.340> who<00:04:12.489> are

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
conversations with people who are

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.879 
conversations with people who are
rushing<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.629> be<00:04:13.810> there<00:04:14.139> right<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:14.709> think

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
rushing to be there right and I think

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.719 
rushing to be there right and I think
they're<00:04:14.979> making<00:04:15.129> some<00:04:15.789> some<00:04:16.389> interesting

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
they're making some some interesting

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.750 
they're making some some interesting
value<00:04:18.729> engineering<00:04:19.180> decisions

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
value engineering decisions

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.790 
value engineering decisions
I<00:04:19.790> think<00:04:20.240> won't<00:04:20.570> have<00:04:20.810> long-term<00:04:21.080> benefits

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
I think won't have long-term benefits

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.440 
I think won't have long-term benefits
for<00:04:21.980> the<00:04:22.040> people<00:04:22.070> down<00:04:22.400> there<00:04:22.640> well<00:04:23.060> obviously
