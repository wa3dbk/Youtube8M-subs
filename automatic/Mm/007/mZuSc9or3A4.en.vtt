00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.360 
under labour this season would I keep
him<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.900> think<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.350> i<00:03:42.560> think<00:03:42.770> he'll<00:03:43.100> be<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.340> a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
him I think so i think he'll be on a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.220 
him I think so i think he'll be on a
free<00:03:43.610> anyway<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.030> I'd<00:03:44.300> obviously<00:03:44.750> taken<00:03:45.110> my

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
free anyway so I'd obviously taken my

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.370 
free anyway so I'd obviously taken my
camera<00:03:45.650> that's<00:03:45.920> true<00:03:46.220> though<00:03:46.959> first<00:03:47.959> half<00:03:48.200> it

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
camera that's true though first half it

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.140 
camera that's true though first half it
was<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:48.650> dominant<00:03:48.860> we<00:03:49.160> had<00:03:49.310> chances<00:03:49.580> to<00:03:49.820> bury

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
was just dominant we had chances to bury

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.840 
was just dominant we had chances to bury
it<00:03:50.300> besides<00:03:50.720> that<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.200> we<00:03:51.290> just<00:03:51.320> didn't<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.250> I

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
it besides that and we just didn't and I

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.920 
it besides that and we just didn't and I
think<00:03:53.060> there's<00:03:53.420> one<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.570> those<00:03:53.660> things<00:03:53.810> that

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
think there's one of those things that

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.750 
think there's one of those things that
could<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:54.320> cost<00:03:54.530> us<00:03:54.770> an<00:03:54.920> under<00:03:55.220> Lambert<00:03:55.610> it

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
could have cost us an under Lambert it

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.280 
could have cost us an under Lambert it
would<00:03:56.060> have<00:03:56.180> cost<00:03:56.390> us<00:03:56.630> under<00:03:56.870> Sherwood

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
would have cost us under Sherwood

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.620 
would have cost us under Sherwood
obviously<00:03:58.070> given<00:03:58.430> stepping<00:03:59.120> in<00:03:59.270> for<00:03:59.450> goose

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
obviously given stepping in for goose

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.150 
obviously given stepping in for goose
and<00:03:59.870> I<00:03:59.930> think<00:04:00.140> it's<00:04:00.260> been<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.530> right<00:04:00.800> call

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
and I think it's been the right call

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.010 
and I think it's been the right call
here<00:04:01.400> obviously<00:04:01.670> given<00:04:02.239> who<00:04:02.570> knows<00:04:02.780> that<00:04:02.930> he's

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
here obviously given who knows that he's

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.570 
here obviously given who knows that he's
going<00:04:03.170> to<00:04:03.230> retire<00:04:03.530> kin<00:04:03.770> season<00:04:04.160> what<00:04:04.430> his

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
going to retire kin season what his

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.760 
going to retire kin season what his
future<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:05.060> at<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.810> club<00:04:06.050> giving<00:04:06.350> him<00:04:06.500> all

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
future is at the club giving him all

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.229 
future is at the club giving him all
ample<00:04:07.160> games<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.610> think<00:04:07.850> I<00:04:07.970> have<00:04:08.120> more

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
ample games I think I have more

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.870 
ample games I think I have more
confidence<00:04:08.300> in<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:09.860> cases<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.250> corners<00:04:10.760> when

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
confidence in the cases of corners when

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.520 
confidence in the cases of corners when
corners<00:04:11.209> are<00:04:11.330> coming<00:04:11.600> into<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.900> box<00:04:12.140> i<00:04:12.320> feel

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
it's just one of those things we have to

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.080 
it's just one of those things we have to
look<00:05:24.720> at<00:05:25.010> going<00:05:26.010> in<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.190> rest<00:05:26.370> of<00:05:26.520> season<00:05:26.669> and

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
look at going in the rest of season and

I'm not dwelling and really going in the

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.469 
I'm not dwelling and really going in the
second<00:05:29.280> half<00:05:29.310> because<00:05:29.639> it<00:05:29.849> was<00:05:29.940> utter<00:05:30.120> crap

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
second half because it was utter crap

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.500 
second half because it was utter crap
and<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:31.130> it's<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.250> positive<00:05:32.460> when<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.000> don't<00:05:33.360> want

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
and I it's a positive when I don't want

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.330 
and I it's a positive when I don't want
to<00:05:33.570> focus<00:05:33.720> too<00:05:33.990> much<00:05:34.020> on<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.380> negatives<00:05:34.800> but<00:05:35.070> I

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
to focus too much on the negatives but I

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.940 
to focus too much on the negatives but I
think<00:05:36.090> one<00:05:36.539> more<00:05:36.720> point<00:05:37.020> would<00:05:37.229> do<00:05:37.410> us<00:05:37.560> in<00:05:37.740> for

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
think one more point would do us in for

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.159 
think one more point would do us in for
safety<00:05:38.370> if<00:05:38.460> no<00:05:38.669> we<00:05:38.820> already<00:05:38.910> safe<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.570> don't

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
safety if no we already safe I don't

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.690 
safety if no we already safe I don't
want<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.380> be<00:05:40.470> too<00:05:40.620> cocky<00:05:40.860> but<00:05:41.099> I<00:05:41.190> love<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.550> see

another team wins and just get to 40
points<00:05:44.400> I<00:05:44.580> think<00:05:45.180> that's<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.479> goal<00:05:45.720> right<00:05:45.900> now

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960
