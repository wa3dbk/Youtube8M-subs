I<00:01:02.140> like<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.710> idea<00:01:02.980> of<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.460> door<00:01:04.000> breaching

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330

barrel<00:01:05.580> obviously<00:01:06.580> I<00:01:06.610> mean<00:01:06.850> this<00:01:06.970> could<00:01:07.119> be

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
barrel obviously I mean this could be

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.969 
barrel obviously I mean this could be
used<00:01:07.390> as<00:01:07.509> a<00:01:07.570> door<00:01:07.750> breaching<00:01:08.080> device<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.890> have

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
used as a door breaching device to have

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.469

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's pretty good
all<00:02:08.619> right<00:02:08.770> so<00:02:08.920> from<00:02:09.040> 30<00:02:09.340> feet<00:02:09.430> I'm<00:02:10.270> actually

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
all right so from 30 feet I'm actually

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.480 
all right so from 30 feet I'm actually
very<00:02:10.869> impressed<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:11.560> how<00:02:11.770> much<00:02:12.040> lethality

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
very impressed with how much lethality

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.730 
very impressed with how much lethality
this<00:02:12.850> gun<00:02:13.090> actually<00:02:13.300> has<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.930> thought<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.650> would

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
this gun actually has I thought it would

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.020 
this gun actually has I thought it would
be<00:02:14.800> all<00:02:15.010> over<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.310> place<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.820> would<00:02:15.970> be

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
be all over the place and this would be

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.630 
be all over the place and this would be
kind<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.450> speckled<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.380> mean<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.460> eight

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
kind of speckled but I mean it is eight

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.830 
kind of speckled but I mean it is eight
shots<00:02:18.880> there's<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> lot<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.390> pellets<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.720> there

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
shots there's a lot of pellets in there

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.630 
shots there's a lot of pellets in there
but<00:02:20.050> man<00:02:20.530> that's<00:02:20.800> pretty<00:02:20.920> good<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.250> mean<00:02:21.460> I'm

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
but man that's pretty good I mean I'm

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.740 
but man that's pretty good I mean I'm
going<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.820> draw<00:02:21.940> an<00:02:22.060> outline<00:02:22.360> around<00:02:22.390> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
going to draw an outline around the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.880 
going to draw an outline around the
pellets<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> distance<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.770> they

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
pellets and the distance that they

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.280 
pellets and the distance that they
spread<00:02:24.160> this<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.000> furthest<00:02:25.360> one<00:02:25.390> there's

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
spread this is the furthest one there's

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.000 
spread this is the furthest one there's
two<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.560> them<00:02:26.650> down<00:02:26.740> there<00:02:26.980> goes<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:29.430> around<00:02:30.540> up

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
two of them down there goes in around up

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:40.170 
two of them down there goes in around up
around<00:02:37.260> that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
around that

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.680 
around that
is<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.870> spread<00:02:41.140> pattern<00:02:41.530> at<00:02:41.709> 30<00:02:42.069> feet<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.690> still

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
is the spread pattern at 30 feet I still

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.030 
is the spread pattern at 30 feet I still
consider<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.140> lethal<00:02:44.440> especially<00:02:44.860> if<00:02:44.920> you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
consider that lethal especially if you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.589 
consider that lethal especially if you
had<00:02:45.190> double<00:02:45.489> ought<00:02:45.580> buck<00:02:45.610> runs<00:02:46.060> because

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
had double ought buck runs because

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.820 
had double ought buck runs because
that's<00:02:46.900> going<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.110> put<00:02:47.349> most<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.739> those

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
that's going to put most of those

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.280 
that's going to put most of those
pellets<00:02:48.220> in<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.549> range<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.090> those<00:02:49.810> are<00:02:49.959> 32

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
pellets in this range and those are 32

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.740 
pellets in this range and those are 32
calibers<00:02:50.680> most<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.010> time<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.480> yeah<00:02:52.480> let's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
calibers most the time so yeah let's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.970 
calibers most the time so yeah let's
step<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.049> back<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.230> notch<00:02:53.379> we're<00:02:53.709> going<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.890> go

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
step it back a notch we're going to go

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.460 
step it back a notch we're going to go
from<00:02:54.190> 40<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.819> then<00:02:55.360> try<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.569> 50<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.170> see<00:02:56.349> where

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
from 40 and then try to 50 and see where

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.259 
from 40 and then try to 50 and see where
we're<00:02:56.620> at<00:02:56.709> alright<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.459> thought<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.060> we

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
we're at alright so I thought that we

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.850 
we're at alright so I thought that we
were<00:02:58.329> going<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.540> step<00:02:58.810> herself<00:02:59.200> up<00:02:59.379> from<00:02:59.650> 30

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
were going to step herself up from 30

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.319 
were going to step herself up from 30
feet<00:02:59.950> but<00:03:00.370> that's<00:03:00.489> still<00:03:00.760> pretty<00:03:00.909> lethal<00:03:01.120> at

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
feet but that's still pretty lethal at

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.899 
feet but that's still pretty lethal at
30<00:03:01.569> through<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:02.110> 40<00:03:02.530> feet<00:03:02.739> now<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.220> we'll<00:03:03.760> see

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
30 through a 40 feet now and we'll see

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:12.720 
30 through a 40 feet now and we'll see
how<00:03:04.030> lethal<00:03:04.269> this<00:03:04.599> is

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.709 

Wow<00:03:13.969> I'm<00:03:14.060> impressed

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
Wow I'm impressed

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.589 
Wow I'm impressed
forty<00:03:15.049> feet<00:03:15.200> away<00:03:15.849> it's<00:03:16.849> still<00:03:17.180> holding<00:03:17.389> a

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
forty feet away it's still holding a

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.879 
forty feet away it's still holding a
group<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.019> I'm<00:03:18.139> impressed<00:03:18.439> with<00:03:18.590> and

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
group that I'm impressed with and

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.239 
group that I'm impressed with and
granted<00:03:19.370> this<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.549> birdshot<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:21.889> consider

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:22.249 
granted this is birdshot but to consider

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:24.789 
granted this is birdshot but to consider
the<00:03:22.400> fact<00:03:22.639> that<00:03:22.810> forty<00:03:23.810> feet<00:03:24.019> distance<00:03:24.560> with

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
the fact that forty feet distance with

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.709 
the fact that forty feet distance with
this<00:03:25.069> short<00:03:25.370> of<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.549> barrel<00:03:25.879> still<00:03:26.180> keeping<00:03:26.629> a

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:26.719 
this short of a barrel still keeping a

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.050 
this short of a barrel still keeping a
group<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.620> this<00:03:27.950> looks<00:03:28.189> like<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.430> pellets<00:03:28.760> -

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
group that this looks like the pellets -

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.789 
group that this looks like the pellets -
great<00:03:29.239> alluded<00:03:29.599> for<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.870> route<00:03:29.989> but<00:03:30.650> it's

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
great alluded for the route but it's

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.949 
great alluded for the route but it's
still<00:03:31.010> hitting<00:03:32.469> all<00:03:33.469> down<00:03:34.750> around<00:03:35.750> his

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
still hitting all down around his

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:43.960 
still hitting all down around his
shoulder<00:03:37.629> tighter<00:03:38.629> group

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.340 

you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.980 

it's<00:03:48.350> shooting<00:03:48.740> a<00:03:48.830> man-sized<00:03:49.310> target<00:03:49.600> at<00:03:50.600> 40

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
it's shooting a man-sized target at 40

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.860 
it's shooting a man-sized target at 40
feet<00:03:51.220> let's<00:03:52.220> step<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.490> back<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.760> 50<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.690> let's

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
feet let's step it back to 50 and let's

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.570 
feet let's step it back to 50 and let's
see<00:03:54.020> if<00:03:54.080> we<00:03:54.200> can<00:03:54.350> finally<00:03:54.770> say<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.010> may<00:03:55.520> be

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
see if we can finally say this may be

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.220 
see if we can finally say this may be
the<00:03:55.820> point<00:03:56.120> where<00:03:56.360> you<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.600> no<00:03:56.870> more

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
the point where you have no more

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.590 
the point where you have no more
lethality<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.070> 50<00:03:58.340> feet<00:03:58.550> all<00:03:59.270> right<00:03:59.450> so

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
lethality this is 50 feet all right so

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.510 
lethality this is 50 feet all right so
now<00:03:59.720> we're<00:03:59.900> at<00:03:59.960> 50<00:04:00.320> feet<00:04:00.560> I'm<00:04:01.190> pretty

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
now we're at 50 feet I'm pretty

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.700 
now we're at 50 feet I'm pretty
impressed<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.940> far<00:04:02.240> let's<00:04:03.230> take<00:04:03.350> a<00:04:03.380> look<00:04:03.590> to

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
impressed so far let's take a look to

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:20.129 
impressed so far let's take a look to
see<00:04:03.740> how<00:04:03.950> this<00:04:04.250> handles

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.100 

serving<00:04:20.949> firearms<00:04:21.609> makes<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.479> dang<00:04:22.840> good

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
serving firearms makes it dang good

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.290 
serving firearms makes it dang good
shotgun<00:04:23.590> because<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.099> shorter<00:04:24.400> barrel<00:04:24.729> even

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
shotgun because this shorter barrel even

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.860 
shotgun because this shorter barrel even
