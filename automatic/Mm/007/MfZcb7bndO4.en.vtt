00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.240
 hi girls you can teach it to make a 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.950
 bracelet as we did flat for it 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.290
 we need the disk of yourself 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.210
 square and a brooch and glue on the 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.889
 case we want to put the brooch or if 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.980
 not with knots 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.939
 we're going to need four pieces of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.720
 cord one meter each 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.620
 approximately 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.860
 I'm going to do it in two colors 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:30.920
 and we take two colors of two threads of 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.920
 each color we cross in this way 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.380
 we double them both and the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.220
 crossed like this 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.670
 we are going to place the disk 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.740
 we put the center in the hole and go 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.740
 to place them at number 17 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.309
 that same cord we are going to place in the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:58.210
 14 and the other two in the 15 in the 16 and 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:02.050
 the same black in the 7 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:06.740
 that same cord we put him in 4 and 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.200
 the rest in 5 and 6 well 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.689
 now to begin we hold the center 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.040
 let's take the one that is number 7 and 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.040
 we passed to the letter f 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.120
 and now we started making bracelet 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.240
 that is in the 17 we went up to 7 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.009
 On the 6th we went down to 17 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.009
 from 15 to 6 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.170
 5 to 16 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.170
 from 15 to 5 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.960
 on the 4 we go down to 15 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.610
 that is in the 14 we went to the 4 and the f 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.610
 which is the one of tradition we downloaded 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.010
 to 14 and we will stay like this and now 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.950
 we start again the one in 7 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.690
 we are going to put it in the f 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.390
 and we follow the same steps 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.600
 as it is the same all the time 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.170
 let's stop and I'll show you when I'm 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.170
 completed 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.540
 when it arrives we are left without a cord 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.110
 it does not take us anymore 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.110
 we take it out 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.500
 we give a bit of shape a bracelet 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.400
 and to tie it 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.800
 the two 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.849
 pieces of coral cord we leave the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.849
 blacks in the middle 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.470
 we put it that way 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.260
 and these two others we went behind 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.700
 and tight 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.170
 and the pieces that are left over, we cut them and 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.920
 those of us who go with a lighter so that 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.920
 fraying 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.880
 and we paste them like that 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.910
 we make the knots we put the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.740
 brooches 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.740
 we put a little bit of glue 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.400
 in the closing 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.310
 and on the bracelet 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.379
 And the mind 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.560
 let it dry 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.700
 and we would have finished our 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.700
 eat bracelet 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.390
