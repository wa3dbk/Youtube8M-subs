00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello today in this new 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.359
 video let's see how lubricated 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.610
 a rubik's cube 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.460
 let's start by seeing the material 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.030
 necessary then let's move on to different 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.379
 steps 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.680
 we're off to lubricate our rubik's 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.180
 cube 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.090
 we will need a fluids 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.689
 silicones in spray with a small trunk 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.410
 as well as all-purpose nuyl that lubricates 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.570
 cleans and prevents rust step a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.540
 to separate each piece 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.890
 of our rubik's cube for that we shift 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 the top and we shoot at a 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.600
 item like this and here again 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.399
 that a first corner is removed there remains 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.809
 just slide the other 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.809
 pieces like that and remove them to 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
 parts 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:07.400
 that's it's all keep them and not in 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:12.750
 a room you will see in the center 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.600
 central kallas and so the pieces and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.740
 which some parts do not come out of it 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.450
 So here you have entrusted all 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.759
 here is in the center 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.400
 you will have this little text openly 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.650
 the parts do not get out of there so the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.890
 cells well like that and we're proclaiming 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.979
 once again your ubix of the facts you 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.170
 take it like this you lubricate the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.420
 rotation axes in speaks and brilliant 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.189
 no matter so put a sheet 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.930
 something for boss m because 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.570
 that after that say you shoot slightly 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 on the interstices to try to put 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:01.829
 a little pressure it's not easy 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:03.380
 go put a little on the hands can 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:10.790
 there is little beside it is not very serious 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:13.020
 it lubricates rats the other pieces yes 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.110
 so here we do for all 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.110
 branches 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.360
 once it's done you try to 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.480
 diverted assets normally you go 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.209
 see it's already easier you sort 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.630
 the rubik's who have only two 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.150
 daily 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.640
 you see it's white orange so 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:03:23.290
 slow I put it back here so I'll 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:03:25.690
 to make a crown already the god is to 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.690
 see how they are located to avoid 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:36.150
 to look for master by red color 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.150
 yes, it will already be easier 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.650
 yellow or red 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.560
 so I made turrets 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.940
 so thing I did not say I 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.030
 also lubricated is a little bit the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.090
 sides since we see look here he 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.680
 there is wear in force 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.360
 so I put a little bit of lubricants 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.160
 see to prevent it from rubbing it's 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.970
 for that remix too and you see 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.169
 so I put a little bit of 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.560
 Vaseline you can also be from a 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.990
 pollution 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:45.360
 to see so here I tried to do there 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:49.680
 the crown of the top go slowly 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:55.970
 because it happened quickly and it's 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:05:00.150
 not easy then there i will try to m 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.419
 I started to make the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.419
 player 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 this 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.940
 normally reassure you that must 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.720
 must someday fall a moment or a 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.720
 other what it is 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.680
 I holds a little order 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.140
 this is the food here so I'm going 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.880
 d2 interstices the two elected for the 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:48.660
 interstices but the side screens 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:48.660
 and what am I here 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:23.950
 it's like that for young people is like that 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:26.850
 here I may have been wrong it's 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.350
 not easy but it makes me 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:33.520
 quietly see already we redo 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:38.380
 half of the income in power it is 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:41.200
 posed like that remains the press 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.620
 the most difficult part especially for 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.620
 keep it 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:15.380
 I'm going because the one who has to be born here 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.020
 only three are left, it's normal 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.550
 So here here over this one gavage 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.530
 normally this is where c is 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:27.090
 several to m so why hesitate 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.220
 normally when you put yourself 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.380
 try to put it in the middle like that 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:36.150
 is the support to do it and you will not hesitate 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:40.590
 not aulas and you'll already see that the 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:42.600
 rubik's cube so eat a little 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.950
 little vazy power for that 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.380
 works rents between the parties who 

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.880
 are here why is it rubbing so 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.770
 possibly you wipe it your vote 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.510
 rubik's for him to be well for him 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.979
 be very clean and then it will not 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.800
 is more than doing it so that's it 

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:57.870
 I already have facts, so what are you doing? 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.210
 parties you see it already works 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:07.740
 much easier two funds 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:09.270
 sovereigns and do not forget the record 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.520
 it's within ten seconds and we 

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:15.360
 done behind the back my right the left 

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:19.760
 it's very hard but 1032 minutes is 

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.760
 already good to succeed go good luck
