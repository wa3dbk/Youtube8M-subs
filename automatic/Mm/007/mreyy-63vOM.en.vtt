00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
new key plug on it you see that so you

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.870 
new key plug on it you see that so you
would<00:04:27.070> assume<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:27.970> can<00:04:28.180> plug<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:28.780> into<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
would assume that you can plug it into a
