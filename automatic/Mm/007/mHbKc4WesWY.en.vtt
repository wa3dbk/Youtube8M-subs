00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
so now going into the engine bay we have

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.460 
so now going into the engine bay we have
the<00:03:50.980> rentec<00:03:51.980> airbox<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:53.030> intake<00:03:53.270> and<00:03:54.020> I<00:03:54.260> got

about<00:04:01.910> five<00:04:02.210> to<00:04:02.420> ten<00:04:02.600> horsepower<00:04:02.980> depending

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
about five to ten horsepower depending

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.620 
about five to ten horsepower depending
on<00:04:04.310> what<00:04:04.430> speed<00:04:04.700> you're<00:04:04.910> going<00:04:04.970> is<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.510> know

on what speed you're going is you know

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.120 
on what speed you're going is you know
you<00:04:05.690> need<00:04:05.840> more<00:04:06.020> air<00:04:06.200> flowing<00:04:06.680> into<00:04:06.830> the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
you need more air flowing into the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.610 
you need more air flowing into the
engine<00:04:07.490> to<00:04:07.700> get<00:04:07.820> more<00:04:08.060> horsepower<00:04:08.480> so<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:09.440> was

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
engine to get more horsepower so I was

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.650 
engine to get more horsepower so I was
cool<00:04:09.830> add<00:04:10.010> on<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.520> add<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.760> lot<00:04:11.030> more<00:04:11.060> throttle

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
cool add on that add a lot more throttle

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.230 
cool add on that add a lot more throttle
response<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.740> throttle<00:04:13.220> it's<00:04:13.760> definitely

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
response the throttle it's definitely

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.479 
response the throttle it's definitely
more<00:04:14.390> lively<00:04:14.870> now<00:04:15.020> that<00:04:15.200> I've<00:04:15.320> added<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.830> and

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
more lively now that I've added that and

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.130 
more lively now that I've added that and
it's<00:04:16.640> really<00:04:16.700> evident<00:04:17.330> on<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.570> freeway<00:04:17.930> when

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
it's really evident on the freeway when

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.630 
it's really evident on the freeway when
you<00:04:18.230> got<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> lot<00:04:18.590> of<00:04:18.709> air<00:04:18.920> flowing<00:04:19.280> into<00:04:19.489> the

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
you got a lot of air flowing into the

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.480 
you got a lot of air flowing into the
engine<00:04:20.470> another<00:04:21.470> add-on<00:04:21.830> I<00:04:21.860> did<00:04:22.100> at<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.310> same

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
engine another add-on I did at the same

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.120 
engine another add-on I did at the same
time<00:04:22.760> with<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.150> air<00:04:23.270> box<00:04:23.480> was<00:04:23.840> rented<00:04:24.500> short

time with the air box was rented short
tube<00:04:25.340> headers<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:26.840> was<00:04:27.020> one<00:04:27.260> of<00:04:27.350> the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
tube headers and that was one of the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.260 
tube headers and that was one of the

came off the track RC 55 and it gave the
car<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.490> lot<00:04:43.910> more<00:04:44.180> of<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.330> raspy<00:04:44.780> sound

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
car a lot more of a raspy sound

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.810 
car a lot more of a raspy sound
especially<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.770> higher<00:04:45.950> rpm<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:46.730> it

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
especially in the higher rpm so it

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.850 
especially in the higher rpm so it
really<00:04:47.000> opens<00:04:47.090> up<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.660> sound<00:04:47.930> allows<00:04:48.620> the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
really opens up the sound allows the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.950 
really opens up the sound allows the
engine<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.220> breathe<00:04:49.310> better<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:49.940> as<00:04:50.540> a<00:04:50.570> result

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
engine to breathe better and as a result

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.840 
engine to breathe better and as a result
you<00:04:51.080> get<00:04:51.230> more<00:04:51.380> power

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.940 

to<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.210> rear<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.510> car<00:04:55.750> we<00:04:56.380> have<00:04:56.410> the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
to the rear of the car we have the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.060 
to the rear of the car we have the
carbon-fiber<00:04:57.850> rear<00:04:58.180> diffuser<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:59.230> that<00:04:59.710> was

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
carbon-fiber rear diffuser and that was

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.800 
carbon-fiber rear diffuser and that was
added<00:05:00.460> on<00:05:00.550> at<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.790> same<00:05:00.970> time<00:05:01.030> as<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.570> front

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
added on at the same time as the front

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.930 
added on at the same time as the front
lip<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.620> kind<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.890> complete<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.280> carbon<00:05:03.730> fiber

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
lip to kind of complete the carbon fiber

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.720 
lip to kind of complete the carbon fiber
look<00:05:04.560> again<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.770> kind<00:05:05.950> of<00:05:05.980> updates<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.550> car

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
look again it kind of updates the car

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.970 
look again it kind of updates the car
gives<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.120> little<00:05:07.270> more<00:05:07.360> modern<00:05:07.750> look<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:08.560> little

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
gives a little more modern look a little

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.040 
gives a little more modern look a little
more<00:05:09.130> aggressive<00:05:09.340> racing<00:05:09.970> look<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.690> all<00:05:10.870> the

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
more aggressive racing look like all the

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.240 
more aggressive racing look like all the
new<00:05:11.470> c63<00:05:12.220> s<00:05:12.250> have<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.820> stuff<00:05:13.390> like<00:05:13.570> that

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
new c63 s have and stuff like that

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.490 
new c63 s have and stuff like that
one<00:05:15.610> thing<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:15.940> forgot<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.390> mention<00:05:16.570> in<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
one thing I forgot to mention in the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.070 
one thing I forgot to mention in the
engine<00:05:17.890> bay<00:05:18.010> was<00:05:18.340> there<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.330> a<00:05:19.360> euro<00:05:19.660> charged

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
engine bay was there is a euro charged

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.800 
engine bay was there is a euro charged
ECU<00:05:20.590> reflash<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:21.730> that's<00:05:21.850> about<00:05:22.030> 20-25

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
ECU reflash so that's about 20-25

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.700 
ECU reflash so that's about 20-25
horsepower<00:05:24.030> gain<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.330> it's<00:05:25.780> it<00:05:26.320> was<00:05:26.470> when<00:05:26.680> I

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
horsepower gain and it's it was when I

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.500 
horsepower gain and it's it was when I
first<00:05:27.010> got<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.400> car<00:05:27.550> so<00:05:27.850> it<00:05:28.000> was<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.180> little<00:05:28.420> bit

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
first got the car so it was a little bit

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.500 
first got the car so it was a little bit
harder<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:29.310> realize<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.760> power<00:05:30.970> difference

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
harder to realize the power difference

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.110 
harder to realize the power difference
so<00:05:31.750> wasn't<00:05:32.560> as<00:05:32.710> great<00:05:33.130> of<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.610> difference<00:05:33.970> as

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
so wasn't as great of a difference as

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.490 
so wasn't as great of a difference as
like<00:05:34.330> when<00:05:34.480> I<00:05:34.570> got<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.870> airbox<00:05:35.170> with<00:05:35.410> the

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
like when I got the airbox with the

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.680 
like when I got the airbox with the
headers<00:05:35.770> put<00:05:35.980> on<00:05:36.100> but<00:05:36.790> it's<00:05:36.940> definitely<00:05:37.150> it

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
headers put on but it's definitely it

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.540 
headers put on but it's definitely it
definitely<00:05:37.840> showed<00:05:38.290> in<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.560> dyno<00:05:38.770> numbers<00:05:38.920> so

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
definitely showed in the dyno numbers so

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.280 
definitely showed in the dyno numbers so
that's<00:05:39.730> a<00:05:39.910> good<00:05:40.500> modification<00:05:41.520> to<00:05:42.520> do<00:05:42.640> as<00:05:42.790> well

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
that's a good modification to do as well

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.100 
that's a good modification to do as well
because<00:05:44.290> I<00:05:44.320> actually<00:05:44.590> sent<00:05:45.100> the<00:05:45.250> ECU<00:05:45.930> to<00:05:46.930> your

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
because I actually sent the ECU to your

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.890 
because I actually sent the ECU to your
recharge<00:05:47.470> in<00:05:47.650> Texas<00:05:48.130> they<00:05:48.790> reflashed<00:05:49.420> it<00:05:49.600> send

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
recharge in Texas they reflashed it send

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.090 
recharge in Texas they reflashed it send
it<00:05:49.930> back<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.140> me<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.500> I<00:05:50.530> just<00:05:50.560> put<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:50.920> back<00:05:51.040> in

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
it back to me and I just put it back in

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.160 
it back to me and I just put it back in
the<00:05:51.310> car<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:51.700> it's<00:05:51.820> a<00:05:51.910> simple<00:05:52.170> easy

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
the car and it's a simple easy

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.800 
the car and it's a simple easy
modification<00:05:54.070> and<00:05:54.880> then<00:05:55.120> for<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.390> exhaust

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
modification and then for the exhaust

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.380 
modification and then for the exhaust
along<00:05:56.530> with<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.830> headers<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:57.310> in<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.180> front

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
along with the headers and in the front

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.290 
along with the headers and in the front
I<00:05:58.660> also<00:05:59.200> have<00:05:59.830> the<00:06:00.190> secondary<00:06:00.790> catalytic

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
I also have the secondary catalytic

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.150 
I also have the secondary catalytic
converters<00:06:01.750> taken<00:06:02.230> out<00:06:02.350> as<00:06:02.590> well<00:06:02.919> as<00:06:03.040> the

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
converters taken out as well as the

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.130 
converters taken out as well as the
resonator<00:06:03.640> and<00:06:03.910> for<00:06:04.510> those<00:06:04.600> of<00:06:04.660> you<00:06:04.870> who<00:06:05.050> are

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
resonator and for those of you who are

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.720 
resonator and for those of you who are
familiar<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.680> resonator<00:06:06.160> is<00:06:06.280> kind<00:06:06.490> of<00:06:06.520> just

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
familiar the resonator is kind of just

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.030 
familiar the resonator is kind of just
like<00:06:06.790> a<00:06:06.850> secondary<00:06:07.300> muffler<00:06:07.750> quiets<00:06:08.740> the<00:06:08.860> car

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
like a secondary muffler quiets the car

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.520 
like a secondary muffler quiets the car
down<00:06:09.280> for<00:06:10.240> people<00:06:10.510> who<00:06:10.600> don't<00:06:10.750> like<00:06:10.990> loud<00:06:11.169> cars

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
down for people who don't like loud cars

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.650 
down for people who don't like loud cars
but<00:06:11.860> all<00:06:12.100> this<00:06:12.250> car<00:06:12.490> guys<00:06:12.700> love<00:06:12.730> love<00:06:13.210> cars<00:06:13.540> so

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
but all this car guys love love cars so

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.930 
but all this car guys love love cars so
just<00:06:14.410> cut<00:06:14.620> that<00:06:14.770> out<00:06:14.830> with<00:06:15.220> and<00:06:15.430> then<00:06:15.580> added<00:06:15.850> a

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
just cut that out with and then added a

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.590 
just cut that out with and then added a
straight<00:06:16.180> pipe<00:06:16.450> as<00:06:16.660> long<00:06:16.870> as<00:06:17.050> the

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
straight pipe as long as the

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.750 
straight pipe as long as the
as<00:06:18.080> well<00:06:18.320> as<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:18.680> secondary<00:06:19.220> catalytic

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
as well as the secondary catalytic

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.950 
as well as the secondary catalytic
converters<00:06:20.090> were<00:06:20.210> a<00:06:20.240> place<00:06:20.480> with<00:06:20.660> a<00:06:20.720> straight

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
converters were a place with a straight

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.870 
converters were a place with a straight
pipe<00:06:21.140> as<00:06:21.380> well<00:06:21.410> and<00:06:21.860> that<00:06:22.010> just<00:06:22.280> opens<00:06:22.730> up<00:06:22.820> the

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
pipe as well and that just opens up the

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.300 
pipe as well and that just opens up the
sound<00:06:23.240> more<00:06:23.480> allows<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.590> car<00:06:24.770> to<00:06:24.920> exhaust

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
sound more allows the car to exhaust

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
sound more allows the car to exhaust
better<00:06:25.580> and<00:06:25.940> about<00:06:26.720> 510<00:06:27.290> horsepower<00:06:27.470> gain<00:06:28.330> so

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
better and about 510 horsepower gain so

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.020 
better and about 510 horsepower gain so
that's<00:06:30.290> basically<00:06:30.740> all<00:06:31.070> the<00:06:31.310> modifications

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030
