00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.250
 So what are we doing lifting the weights 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.259
 we go on street days and show 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.210
 that we as a vegan still strong 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.630
 can be able to build muscle and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.880
 can lift heavy weights and years 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.560
 Generally, our goal was so early 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.769
 was this cliche that there was that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 Vegans are not good athletes, especially 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.619
 maybe good endurance athletes though 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.390
 no strength athletes can be so with it 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.309
 abolish because we have many people 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 knew the totally strong but were from 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.790
 you never heard anything there we have 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.620
 First, our service renk team founded 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.280
 had our own website with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.960
 profiles and then have us there 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 presents and shows life too 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.620
 then start article 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.940
 Write so that the people know too 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 what you have to do when you are 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.899
 eat vegan food and exercise 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.899
 Because it starts that way when you start 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.640
 Not so far then until sometime 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.079
 another forum for the whole 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.980
 have closed where there now 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.860
 also exchange 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.620
 between 800 members and 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.090
 yes that a busy traffic and above 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.560
 we organize regularly then 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.080
 like here for us 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.160
 stand on the way to the hospital or have 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.780
 after that the show we still have 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.550
 become 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.140
 and yet they spread the joyful customer 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.890
 It is best if we are such a 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.060
 little bit different 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.100
 strength sports so the individual 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.720
 disciplines lead the court so 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.160
 probably will be a bit 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.320
 Kreuzheben show that it is in principle 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.650
 just requests on ground lies 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.790
 standing upright is unspectacular 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.120
 But you really weight a lot 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.840
 Take it and then it's fun too 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.020
 make but I have a bit 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.190
 show weight lifting maybe bumping 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.240
 look how much of my technique 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.330
 I have more left over now 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.440
 not done and then maybe that 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.300
 shoulder bridges or something in the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.130
 direction and then people can do that 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.320
 then try it out so that's how it is 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.340
 a join in history that the people 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.220
 also a bit of a sport edge 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.810
 Leading is also a great thing I do 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.920
 not really as dangerous as 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.960
 you imagine that all think 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.940
 the backs of the joints and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.259
 the end effect if only a bit 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.240
 The technology has learned that's great 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.729
 sure and he makes sure that you do not 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.060
 Eats at the time because the muscles live 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.799
 The body can support super thing 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.190
 for anyone who is fun too 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:18.090
 found there are better and 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.090
 for people to try
