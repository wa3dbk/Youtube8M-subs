00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 Then from here , please come to Mr. Takamori, who is in charge of that air . 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:16.740
 Because the influence of this aviation system has come out by this Mt. Ontake eruption, I would like to hear the story here 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.260
 I think you Thank you Thank you Yes 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.630
 I also but has become a fairly big news 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.530
 k I think that I'm worried about the influence a little more Today 37,000 in the secret part 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.230
 Say hero 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.230
 Or to advanced, such as when the fly normally 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:41.010
 Are there any blue and so on around here? 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.200
 Well, for now, there is no big impact yet . 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.320
 Just corn 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.530
 I think the company is good 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 I want to change the route that 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:57.300
 In particular, yeah 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:01:05.760
 It's the end of Toyama and it's the end of Noto Airport It's a flight to Haneda 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:09.360
 In the case of Higashi Matsumoto Airport, it is just around 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.970
 As there was a commentary of Mr. Nagai earlier from Mt. Ontake 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.720
 Four 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.960
 Since we have been waiting for this volcanic ash on the east side 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.420
 Cho 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.590
 Arrival time slightly delayed due to rerouting 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.409
 There is an agricultural administration 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.890
 Well, it's one more thing, and it's just another holiday season. 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:34.149
 I think some people are going to Hokkaido but 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:38.560
 It is Nagoya Chubu International Airport from Hokkaido 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:46.400
 Airplane fly Well there is it's just from New Chitose 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:51.740
 A little to the south-west side of the hand to go to Matsumoto Airport from now through Niigata Airport much the Japan Sea side 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:58.520
 But is distinguished service down through the much less just east of Ontakesan dawn to the lines and rear also it 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:05.780
 The arrival time is also coming out due to a little detouring here 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:12.290
 By the way, if you are using an airplane on this route , just tomorrow 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.069
 And Well wonder if a little I wish I can think that I wonder be delayed return arrival time 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.720
 think 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:24.930
 After that , look at the wind of the sky for you 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 Hey yes this is a little bit Just that airline uses that 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:35.550
 Though it is a thing, there is Mt. 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:38.740
 In it this is I know the sky of wind that there is a little arrow in this area 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:45.340
 Yes from 255 degrees to 58 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:50.950
 Everyone that by writing teeth Yes you though is that this is also called'll also blowing west wind in the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:55.480
 I just came to send a report that there was a junior on the ground in the sky mission 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.700
 But the heights are just as good as the pilots now from soy sauce 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:06.260
 I I'm me has also sent a trip Hi 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.840
 So smells 20,000 feet per 15000 feet per Nikko It is today 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.430
 Did 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.560
 It is volcanic gas, and after that Tachikawa in Tokyo 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:23.260
 Also volcanic gas in it from the southern part of the knitting of Ibaraki sky 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:26.799
 Reports from people of Well pilot, such as say that the Mashi Nioigashi I had a value ordering 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.830
 Well, first of all in the Kanto region. 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.080
 that 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.640
 Again the incoming say in said so from the direction of that aircraft of the duct in the sky 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.960
 so 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:43.460
 I am dropping a report from the sky just like you . 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:50.300
 Yes I feel and Jiro now that's right 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:51.680
 There is no effect at all in the market, but the cup is a bit like volcanic gas coming into the sky 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.940
 The 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.830
 You know 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.880
 This is just late for 8 nights today, yet the taxation of the West is 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.340
 I'm blowing 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.290
 This is Mr. Nagai's travel ano 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.380
 As it was in the commentary, it will be tomorrow , little by little 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.560
 West wind is high 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:20.400
 Come by the top of the northwest northwest 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.579
 Then, when it says what happens, the wind that is now heading in the direction of the west is a little in the Kanto area 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 Come in 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:33.639
 I have seen the Fu that there is no well of Haneda Night Watch impact it is tomorrow Te 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:41.259
 But yes only aircraft some of the root because this neighborhood walk aircraft have been in the very care 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:41.600
 I think that there is a possibility of delay due to the change , and it would be nice if you could put it in that head 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:47.840
 I will 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:56.000
 It looks like 4 schools and work, etc., and elderly people have a good look at the information. 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:59.570
 I want to say so I see why it is so easy to get out of the plane 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.590
 Would you like to see this one more time 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.800
 Yes this is true 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:14.509
 Yes It is what what was the airplane engine to round slices 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:17.040
 We take in air from well before jet plane and compress and burn that air and discard 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:22.530
 The plane is in front of you 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.700
 I live but I do not know the temperature of the burning place here 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:29.890
 I understand about 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.450
 Hey I state is also the first time look at you you wish'm so clean that cut into round slices the engine 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.920
 Which one is this 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:42.030
 Wow, sendo lead 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:47.400
 And better Idei include a glass component of Tteyuu in the It is such a hot Hey volcanic ash is it 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.450
 When the falling and will do I suppose Deko wiper of it in the car as there was earlier 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.600
 Cultural standard is this 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:54.910
 I got hurt but I went there 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.660
 Glass component melts at this young boy 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:05.230
 It's about 600 to 800 degrees at the end of the day 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:13.090
 When volcanic ash gets into Koenji a little completely, it will be at the time of future combustion 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:14.020
 If I nest , my brother will be stuck in the exhaust efficiency towards the exhaust . 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.930
 Right 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.660
 That kind of place 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:25.790
 In the past, the engine of that aircraft sucks in volcanic ash 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:32.900
 Or also there that the four there was engine that all had to stop 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:38.480
 Well, in Europe before , Iceland is large but it is a volcano 2 weeks a week 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:44.060
 Is still this kind of volcano but I have a when the aircraft was extremely kind in about 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.780
 There it and crawl in the fact that the aircraft comes out is also the very first to the impact 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.550
 With that still over the next 6 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:55.810
 Because there is also the possibility of a large eruption 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:07:01.300
 I think The person who uses sleep the airplane If you can find the first note published 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:06.310
 Yes another in also I think I'm a very dangerous belly of Tteyuu fly through the volcanic ash 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.840
 Well we are too much for the alternative route how long and how long 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:13.150
 Information such as masuyo 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:16.510
 Resulting in a change root in some cases we still than offer the airline's 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.660
 And some wisdom comes out 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:23.920
 There 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:28.620
 Please confirm the information firmly when everyone is moved too Yes 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.620
 Thank you very much Mr. Takamori at Yamashita
