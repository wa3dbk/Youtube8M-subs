I'm<00:01:10.439> gonna<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.650> installing<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.220> CPU<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:12.200> here

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I'm gonna be installing the CPU now here

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.600 
I'm gonna be installing the CPU now here
is<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.680> CPU<00:01:14.159> itself<00:01:14.900> sort<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.220> maybe<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
is the CPU itself sort of and I maybe I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.870 
is the CPU itself sort of and I maybe I
can<00:01:17.729> focus<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.210> lens<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.960> it

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
can focus my lens to it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.480 
can focus my lens to it
AMD<00:01:20.880> FX<00:01:21.110> 4100<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.740> let's<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.340> can

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
AMD FX 4100 and let's see if I can

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.780 
AMD FX 4100 and let's see if I can
refocus<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> board<00:01:25.439> okay<00:01:26.130> you're<00:01:26.670> gonna

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
refocus to the board okay you're gonna

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480 
refocus to the board okay you're gonna
have<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.979> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.220> look<00:01:29.369> on

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
have this little like if you look on

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.149 
have this little like if you look on
this<00:01:29.579> processor<00:01:30.329> itself<00:01:30.630> has<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.799> air<00:01:31.979> on

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this processor itself has little air on

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.390 
this processor itself has little air on
the<00:01:32.250> corner<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.979> corner<00:01:35.280> that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the corner and that is the corner that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.499 
the corner and that is the corner that
has<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.700> match<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.479> your

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
has to match up with the one on your

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.240 
has to match up with the one on your
motherboard<00:01:36.869> let's<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.860> tilt<00:01:38.070> this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
motherboard let's see if I can tilt this

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.940 
motherboard let's see if I can tilt this
a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.520> bit<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.909> guys<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.950> this

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
a little bit so you guys can see it this

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.300 
a little bit so you guys can see it this
here<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.430> corner<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.540> sort<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.310> okay

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
here right in the corner it sort of okay

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550 
here right in the corner it sort of okay
let's<00:01:44.670> lay<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:46.110> simple<00:01:46.530> just

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
let's lay this down and it's simple just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.870 
let's lay this down and it's simple just
don't<00:01:46.979> touch<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.220> pins<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> bottom

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
don't touch the pins on the bottom

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.090 
don't touch the pins on the bottom
that's<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> most<00:01:49.380> important<00:01:49.890> part

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
that's like the most important part

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.520 
that's like the most important part
which<00:01:51.670> goes<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.140> your<00:01:53.140> processor<00:01:53.680> obviously

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
which goes to your processor obviously

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.710 
which goes to your processor obviously
they're<00:01:56.530> real<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:58.090> just<00:01:58.270> set<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.630> in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
they're real and you just set it in

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.790 
they're real and you just set it in
there<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:01.420> I<00:02:01.480> get<00:02:01.660> in<00:02:01.780> there<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.410> you<00:02:02.530> push

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
there but I get in there and you push

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.150 
there but I get in there and you push
down<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.280> lever<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.960> it's<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.920> should<00:02:06.130> be

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
down the lever and it's in it should be

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.870 
down the lever and it's in it should be

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
thermal compound considering I had like

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.480 
thermal compound considering I had like
none<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.770> it'll<00:02:14.770> be<00:02:14.860> fine<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:17.490> we'll

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
none on it but it'll be fine and we'll

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.090

hook this to the bracket it seems like

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.560 
hook this to the bracket it seems like
with<00:02:24.220> AMD<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.730> doesn't<00:02:24.970> really<00:02:25.120> matter<00:02:25.390> what

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
with AMD it doesn't really matter what

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:37.230 
with AMD it doesn't really matter what
side<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.930> connect<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.910> push<00:02:37.209> down

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
side you connect it to and you push down

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.540 
side you connect it to and you push down
that<00:02:37.959> until<00:02:38.800> it's<00:02:38.920> secure

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550

I<00:02:40.620> will<00:02:41.620> be<00:02:42.000> investing<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.060> water<00:02:43.300> cooling

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
I will be investing in water cooling

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:58.650 
I will be investing in water cooling
eventually<00:02:56.820> now<00:02:57.820> I'll<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.120> go<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
eventually now I'll just go with it

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.400 
eventually now I'll just go with it
across<00:02:58.989> side<00:03:00.420> okay<00:03:01.420> that's<00:03:01.930> all<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.200> have<00:03:02.320> to
