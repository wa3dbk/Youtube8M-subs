00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to all so as can see 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.340
 I changed my background and now funds 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.389
 will be so here I hope that the bottom 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.309
 So here you go, I'll tell you 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 found in this video to make a 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.720
 before / after my creations while filming 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.289
 so we will be able to start everything from 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.090
 next so I'll start with the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.060
 so cupcakes but cupcake before that's it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 so I'm showing you this so that's a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:40.200
 of my Turkish is from before and that's but 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.940
 who according to this one is not 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.190
 textured or nothing but actually it's a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.129
 test 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.910
 that's but otherwise at the grassroots level 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.280
 she is much better but this one 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.110
 so that's for his first 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.899
 creations 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.910
 then a shot that like that so that 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.979
 it's my first shot that I believe 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.830
 it's still texture and that's it but 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:14.159
 the nuggets are not great and a cost 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:22.009
 who after that much more 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:23.970
 realistically here is a pie before 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.549
 so I was a prefect that canes 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:34.369
 it's me who has them and who is waiting 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.369
 after that there is change 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:45.710
 because for that then a bn before my 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.890
 very first who is really but ugly 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:02:03.890
 oh there and it's me and a bn after 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:10.399
 So here we go, but bn after 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.750
 here is a box of chocolates 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.600
 so that's my first ever ola 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:21.260
 of fronts and a box of chocolates that 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.830
 I did recently with whipped cream and 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.480
 it's all in the little chocolates 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.470
 boxes that close like that after 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:39.140
 stay at gaza before so it's with 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:47.769
 real sugar that I had done here and there 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.769
 stay at gala after so that's it 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.690
 then a chocolate will have to do that 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.690
 it was you had already shown that one 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.220
 and a chocolate according to that it is known 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.530
 not too much but but here I am 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.650
 still with laughter then 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.970
 ah yes a chocolate bread from before so 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:22.420
 this is my very first device here 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:32.890
 the cops and that I did not do long 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:32.890
 that's the difference much more real 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:43.489
 this is then a pacifier from the law to the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.940
 letter other tribute here go 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:51.410
 really beautiful you can see 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.870
 so here's one if this lady in the end 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.570
 after this one, I'm doing them 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.269
 today so it's following me seven 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.230
 tweets 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:08.570
 how does this presence I believe I 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:09.400
 will say well here is inspired by chloe 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.100
 filmo 1 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.190
 now I know there are some there 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.940
 make her mom then strawberries 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.590
 so beautiful 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.620
 so it's still going well and does not seem 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.919
 ugly finally to ceignac the foliage which 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:34.490
 is beautiful all this one is inspired by 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:40.750
 miss the atvs like that there and we'll do this 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.750
 I do not have a long time like this 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:56.280
 which much neater I find here 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.280
 for that then I think is not finished 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.010
 a love apple here are the feints is 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:11.669
 is actually the test 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:11.669
 a horror that's the end here it is 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:19.350
 and a love apple 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.810
 so according to so I did today 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.150
 so here it is in fact it is in 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.340
 train to dry so 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:34.450
 so that's it and to finish one to 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:40.900
 politain before that is textured 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.550
 there but not when and after that is not too 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.590
 of difference 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.660
 that's what I like most about doing 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.270
 Neapolitan 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.970
