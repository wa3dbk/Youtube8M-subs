00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
strength using this by itself without

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.540 
strength using this by itself without
giving<00:02:08.680> like<00:02:08.860> extreme<00:02:10.020> soft<00:02:11.020> hair<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:12.340> tell

giving like extreme soft hair I can tell
that<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.970> thing<00:02:13.210> definitely<00:02:13.810> gives<00:02:14.020> my<00:02:14.170> hair

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
that this thing definitely gives my hair

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.320 
that this thing definitely gives my hair
strength<00:02:14.920> but<00:02:15.250> not<00:02:15.460> in<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.670> bad<00:02:15.910> way

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
strength but not in a bad way

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.840 
strength but not in a bad way
as<00:02:16.480> long<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:17.140> balance<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> out<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.430> think<00:02:18.700> I'm

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
as long as I balance it out I think I'm

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.910 
as long as I balance it out I think I'm
good<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.300> think<00:02:19.450> overall<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.350> is<00:02:20.560> definitely

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
good I think overall this is definitely

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.360 
good I think overall this is definitely
a<00:02:21.100> good<00:02:21.540> hair<00:02:22.540> strengthening<00:02:23.370> conditioner

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
a good hair strengthening conditioner

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.130 
a good hair strengthening conditioner
for<00:02:24.550> me<00:02:24.700> definitely<00:02:25.300> something<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.900> will

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
for me definitely something that I will

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.590 
for me definitely something that I will
try<00:02:26.410> again<00:02:26.470> because<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.640> does<00:02:27.940> give<00:02:28.210> my<00:02:28.360> hair

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
try again because it does give my hair

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.290 
try again because it does give my hair
strength<00:02:29.110> but<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.710> have<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.220> make<00:02:30.430> sure<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:31.030> I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
strength but I have to make sure that I

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.460 
strength but I have to make sure that I
use<00:02:31.330> something<00:02:32.260> moisturizing<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:34.030> counter<00:02:34.470> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
use something moisturizing to counter to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.430 
use something moisturizing to counter to
balance<00:02:36.430> everything<00:02:36.760> out<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:38.290> is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
balance everything out so this is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.590 
balance everything out so this is
definitely<00:02:38.980> not<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.340> conditioner<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.180> want

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
definitely not a conditioner that I want

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.590 
definitely not a conditioner that I want
to<00:02:40.690> be<00:02:40.780> using<00:02:40.960> every<00:02:41.740> week<00:02:41.950> because<00:02:42.550> it<00:02:43.390> will

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
to be using every week because it will

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.390 
to be using every week because it will
give<00:02:43.780> my<00:02:43.930> hair<00:02:44.140> too<00:02:44.320> much<00:02:44.500> strength<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.160> not

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
give my hair too much strength and not

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.670 
give my hair too much strength and not
enough<00:02:45.670> moisture<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.480> think<00:02:46.930> overall<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.620> is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
enough moisture I think overall this is

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.760 
enough moisture I think overall this is
a<00:02:47.830> good<00:02:48.210> strengthening<00:02:49.210> conditioner<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:50.500> if

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
you feel like you're in like a moisture

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.290 
you feel like you're in like a moisture

overload definitely I think this is

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.780 
overload definitely I think this is
