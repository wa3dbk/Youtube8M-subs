00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the lighting test this lighting of the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.250
 Continuous light with I'm thinking now 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.250
 So, thank you so much. Let's see more. 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.040
 the general tone is we are worth it 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.049
 and then youtube you beauty beauty frames 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 in industry and today another video 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.460
 teaching you how you are doing 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.439
 home lighting so your videos 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.289
 get even better 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.080
 beauty then using simple artifacts 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.109
 We're going to be lighting here. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 let's go to the tips then the good folks 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.290
 right now to our materials you 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.590
 will need to have a durex ribbon scissors 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.530
 a socket for the socket lamp a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.690
 adapter for lamps resumed one 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.440
 lamp in my case here I will be 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.960
 using a led bulb the ox brand 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.480
 but you may be using it too 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 several other works a box of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.629
 normal shoe the normal suit and a sheet 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.210
 a4 paper now let's do it in 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.739
 One you will pick up your box and it will cut 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.830
 her background 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.470
 Amodu after that we'll put the sheet 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.760
 here we can then 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.979
 here dial 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:24.210
 where are we going to cut up and down 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:26.520
 and then we'll make our cut 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.270
 now that we cut then command 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.670
 of the carton 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.310
 you can cut a little below the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.850
 line was marked so that it does not run 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.180
 risk of the leaf stay out stay base light 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.750
 so we can see here with certain here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.619
 It was right and the sides also now 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.140
 let's part and stick to the sheet in the box 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.490
 we talk here a whole tape in the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.820
 sides 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.710
 You can sell your video and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.150
 an entire tape 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:05.020
 here too up and down then rock 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:09.280
 It's this model we're going to do now. 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.670
 A hole right here in the middle does not have to be 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.050
 exactly the future depends a lot on your 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:22.209
 hot sun we can make some 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.340
 shapes that passes is just that part or 1 x 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.890
 what's going to happen can we do 1 x 1 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.010
 and I will make it here for you now 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:35.190
 have an idea and we now go to the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.190
 easy and by alan to do the xis here 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.400
 With the scissors I'm going to cut it and it stays 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.400
 like this 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.650
 bush is gone now let's make the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.650
 socket installation 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:17.880
 soon because it is installed 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 Let's put our wide and now I'm going 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.300
 explain to you a little because I 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.840
 I preferred this lamp 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.620
 first that it is a compact lamp 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.739
 and because it is neglected it is more economical and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.650
 Also it does not heat up as much right 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.700
 so for this project here I think 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.970
 would it be more recommendable this lamp ok 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.620
 this lamp more recommended as you 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.800
 already must have noticed you are not going 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.830
 put it right here on the jack nÃ© 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.420
 even because it would not work very well 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.170
 so let's get it now it works 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.080
 like this 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:04.489
 now let's get our extension doc 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.410
 stayed behind and so on 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.250
 We are going to close 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.120
 michalak bad 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.120
 now let's call 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:24.020
 So people, our project was like this. 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:28.180
 It's very simple, very quick to do the 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.180
 That's not the light. 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:38.020
 let's do a test 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:41.600
 so this is the video with our lamp 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:48.740
 It is positioned right side and here 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:51.440
 without a lamp it looks like we 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.670
 coming to the end of another video if 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.830
 Do you like the one that subscribes to the 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.830
 channel and until the next video
