00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 Speak, people, my name is Sesa. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.550
 today I'm teaching the music still 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.620
 that the fig tree flourish or even 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.670
 figueira do fernandinho 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.720
 come on, the rhythm of the song is the same as 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.689
 introduction of the whole song there I go 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 divide the first part into three parts 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.510
 it's up and down it's stuffy 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.510
 and two down 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.830
 slowly like this 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.140
 the second part 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.360
 It's gonna be one up and down to 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.239
 Up to drown and down. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.190
 remembering that all the fable I just 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.710
 untying wakes up to make sound 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:13.540
 percussive and the third part will be 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:26.550
 down and down the full video 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:26.550
 that's how you pay more 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:45.570
 the chords of the introduction 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:55.320
 basically they are low and smaller there bigger 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:59.630
 the more you are going to make the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.630
 first part of the rhythm and make minor 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.050
 the second part of the rhythm and the third part 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.050
 Greater there 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.989
 then the first part of the rhythm in 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.989
 do the best 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.040
 the second part in the and the third part in me 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:04.690
 it's just you do the sequence it's easy to have 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.930
 gone there cheerfully there you do me twice 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.930
 fine 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:31.569
 the chords of the first stanza are 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:42.000
 mamede lower and higher if smaller and is 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:42.000
 the greater becoming so you are my portion 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:58.900
 You are my punch in the days of 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:10.209
 employment in the ratio of the second 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:19.440
 stanza are bigger and bigger and smaller and 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:26.080
 Really, even look, my parents leave me. 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:31.310
 even if friends betray me and cids 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:35.660
 your arms my and save 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:44.300
 TCHO are for the chorus we will have 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:49.450
 following chords the greater and greater 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.870
 smaller is larger 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:05:03.050
 there you will make there bigger bigger volume 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:09.020
 and then only most beautiful yet the eu 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:16.120
 and I did not even cry that the real 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:19.120
 gave their future even if they do not seek 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 speed up
