00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
okay this is my update number two on the

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.750 
okay this is my update number two on the
on<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.600> poster<00:00:06.990> here<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:08.340> biggest<00:00:08.610> thing

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
on the poster here and the biggest thing

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.419 
on the poster here and the biggest thing
you<00:00:08.880> can<00:00:08.940> probably<00:00:09.269> see<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.139> now<00:00:10.349> has<00:00:10.800> not

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
you can probably see is it now has not

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.070 
you can probably see is it now has not
the<00:00:11.580> standard<00:00:11.969> post<00:00:12.210> II<00:00:12.360> engine<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:12.960> it

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
the standard post II engine in it

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.860 
the standard post II engine in it
anymore<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.650> have<00:00:14.160> had<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.179> swapped<00:00:15.450> out<00:00:15.630> and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
anymore I have had it swapped out and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.090 
anymore I have had it swapped out and
we've<00:00:16.049> put<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:17.119> but<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.180> call<00:00:18.449> o<00:00:18.480> Y<00:00:18.869> X<00:00:19.109> 160<00:00:19.800> engine

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
we've put a but I call o Y X 160 engine

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.769 
we've put a but I call o Y X 160 engine
but<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.760> one's<00:00:20.970> actually<00:00:21.060> been<00:00:21.390> bought<00:00:21.750> out

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
but this one's actually been bought out

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.240 
but this one's actually been bought out
to<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> 190<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.510> believe<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:26.189> should

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
to a 190 and so I believe that it should

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.330 
to a 190 and so I believe that it should
have<00:00:26.820> over<00:00:27.119> 20<00:00:27.359> horsepower<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:28.050> unsure<00:00:28.340> yet

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
have over 20 horsepower but unsure yet

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.780 
have over 20 horsepower but unsure yet
haven't<00:00:29.730> had<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> dyno<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:31.640> seems<00:00:32.640> to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
haven't had it on the dyno and seems to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
haven't had it on the dyno and seems to
go<00:00:32.910> pretty<00:00:33.149> good<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.290> cruise<00:00:34.500> along<00:00:34.649> on

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
go pretty good it can cruise along on

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.560 
go pretty good it can cruise along on
the<00:00:35.250> cut<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> road<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:36.000> about<00:00:36.210> 90

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the cut on the road at about 90

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.590 
the cut on the road at about 90
kilometers<00:00:37.020> an<00:00:37.140> hour<00:00:38.180> seems<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.450> no

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
kilometers an hour seems to be no

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.020 
kilometers an hour seems to be no
problem<00:00:39.770> yesterday<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:41.010> give<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.579> tried<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
problem yesterday I give it a I tried to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.119 
problem yesterday I give it a I tried to
want<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.780> only<00:00:42.930> got<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
want it out but I only got a just up to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.490 
want it out but I only got a just up to
100<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> bit<00:00:45.899> spiel<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.320> thought

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
100 which was a bit spiel and I thought

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.630 
100 which was a bit spiel and I thought
it<00:00:46.590> might<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> bit<00:00:46.950> better<00:00:47.100> than<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.370> but

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it might be a bit better than that but

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
it might be a bit better than that but
anyway<00:00:47.910> I'm<00:00:48.059> sure<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.480> only<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> tuning

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
anyway I'm sure it's only in the tuning

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.170 
anyway I'm sure it's only in the tuning
because<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> seems<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.520> go<00:00:50.640> better<00:00:50.789> everyday

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
because it seems to go better everyday

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.310 
because it seems to go better everyday
and<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.600> only<00:00:51.780> bit<00:00:52.260> fresh<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.800> yet<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
and it's only bit fresh just yet and

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
and it's only bit fresh just yet and
I'll<00:00:55.320> call<00:00:55.710> melt<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.760> front<00:00:56.910> there

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
I'll call melt it down the front there

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
I'll call melt it down the front there
and<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.109> oil<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> side<00:00:58.980> and<00:01:01.039> I've

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and the oil put it on the side and I've

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
and the oil put it on the side and I've
got<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> pod<00:01:02.460> filter<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.570> can

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
got a pod filter in there as you can

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
got a pod filter in there as you can
probably<00:01:03.960> see<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.500> tried<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
probably see I tried to use it with the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.740 
probably see I tried to use it with the
standard<00:01:06.119> post<00:01:06.869> II<00:01:07.130> air<00:01:08.130> filter<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
standard post II air filter but that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.359 
standard post II air filter but that
seemed<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> check<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.010> went<00:01:11.159> no

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
seemed to check it up and it went no

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.200 
seemed to check it up and it went no
good<00:01:11.580> um<00:01:12.770> what<00:01:13.770> else<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.460> engine<00:01:14.790> came<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
good um what else the engine came with a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570 
good um what else the engine came with a
standard<00:01:15.659> 16<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.259> sprocket<00:01:16.710> front<00:01:17.070> which<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
standard 16 to it sprocket front which I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.179 
standard 16 to it sprocket front which I
swapped<00:01:18.000> down<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> 14<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.009> think

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
swapped down to a 14 which I think

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.880 
swapped down to a 14 which I think
actually<00:01:20.310> might<00:01:20.700> be<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.210> too<00:01:21.890> small

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
actually might be a little bit too small

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.350 
actually might be a little bit too small
or<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> 15<00:01:23.759> would<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.030> been<00:01:24.150> better

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
or if and a 15 would have been better

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.179 
or if and a 15 would have been better
because<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.900> revs<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:26.070> bit

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
because I think it revs just a bit

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.130 
because I think it revs just a bit
harder<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.670> does<00:01:26.820> seem<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.180> sort<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> tap

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
harder and it does seem to sort of tap

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
harder and it does seem to sort of tap
out<00:01:28.350> before<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:29.520> else<00:01:29.880> happens<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.939> this<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
out before much else happens and this is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.640 
out before much else happens and this is

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the muffler it's only a look at people

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.700 
the muffler it's only a look at people

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
Jets not much just yet and just put the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.090 
Jets not much just yet and just put the
needle<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> its<00:01:54.960> full<00:01:57.590> that's<00:01:58.590> what's<00:01:58.890> is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
