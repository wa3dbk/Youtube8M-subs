and<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:15.920> after<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.910> you<00:01:17.240> are<00:01:17.840> going<00:01:18.410> to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
and not after that you are going to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.800 
and not after that you are going to
start<00:01:18.770> looking<00:01:18.950> for<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.720> broken<00:01:21.170> man<00:01:21.410> wire<00:01:21.680> a

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
start looking for the broken man wire a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.030 
start looking for the broken man wire a
way<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.870> spatter<00:01:24.410> this<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:25.010> look<00:01:25.190> for<00:01:27.010> like<00:01:28.010> a

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
way to spatter this to look for like a

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.740 
way to spatter this to look for like a
little<00:01:28.310> dent<00:01:28.760> on<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.860> surface<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.790> plastic
