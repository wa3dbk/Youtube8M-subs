00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hello everyone, if someone did not know me 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:12.570
 passion for heavy motorcycle 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:19.369
 and here by luck to us in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.369
 got the hands and loves m 61 61 years of release 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.490
 it hid 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 and we decided it completely 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.930
 restore if you love too 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.989
 motorcycle is put like and go on 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.090
 This moment it is already taken apart. 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.790
 painting 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.190
 earlier when starting the engine 1 cylinder 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.830
 very much smoked black so we 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.559
 decided to disassemble the piston and see 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.350
 how is it all to look at the liner ring 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.199
 and the piston and unscrew the nut and remove 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.059
 cylinder cover then on four 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.329
 stiletto heels 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.899
 unscrew the nuts for convenience 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.670
 unscrew the carburetor and remove the blah 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.670
 rocker arm and 2 stocks 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.550
 remove the cylinder head 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:32.890
 but the problem is brace and we see leg there 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.510
 very nice and unscrew the last 4 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.050
 large nuts and remove the cylinder 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.350
 previous owner 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.410
 treated very carefully technology rights he 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.960
 drove it very rarely and always in 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.090
 warm season dismantled piston we 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.990
 saw that in principle 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.509
 normal and could be worse than wear 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 virtually no cylinder bores are not 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.600
 was but since we are practically all 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.430
 dismantled we decided to change those rings 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.259
 who thinks that this technique already 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.290
 it's impossible to find spare parts then 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.459
 much wrong if you look for all 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.190
 maybe find 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.750
 Dress first with a gasket and then 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.880
 we went rings 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.459
 if you do not have such devices as 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.000
 and we have something better to wear 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.700
 this is all together one keeps and 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.820
 presses the rings and the second puts on 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.910
 cylinder slow neatly and need 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.830
 follow to the joints of the rings did not match either 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.950
 in any case, they can be 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.380
 90 degrees each 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.780
 Subsequent joint at 90 degrees from 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.269
 previous but we have arranged for 180 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.150
 there is first we are right left next 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.670
 up and down so as not to coincide exactly we 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.700
 did a good reanimation of our 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.370
 reciprocating all connections we processed 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.320
 vd-40 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.320
 put new rings and changed 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.110
 pads and give cleaned 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.960
 half a century soot it feels like up 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.800
 we have no one at all ever 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.460
 disassembled and replaced old sleeves were 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.860
 cracked chic glitter beauty 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.980
 see the future of our bike 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.980
 in the next issues 7 tips put 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.670
 until 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:40.590
 buy shit not even want it want 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.130
 you exposed i knew straight for the purpose i 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.130
 lay down
