but you know I put I put me li yuen
through<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.290> thought<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.680> gonna

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
through on go I thought he was gonna

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.469 
through on go I thought he was gonna
finish<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> easily<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.820> he<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.090> didn't

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
finish that easily and he just didn't

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
finish that easily and he just didn't
shoot<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.770> frustrating

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
shoot it it's really really frustrating

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.090 
shoot it it's really really frustrating
