00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 today the most fashionable picture is at the highest 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.940
 event by brazil's website to show 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:17.970
 that not only of stereotypes that are made 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:21.180
 now nothing with the winter trends 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.820
 2014 fashion plus size is this winter 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.160
 comes very colorful and very light 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.880
 stylists up to the economy 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.309
 last year they came more contained 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 in the direction of a less heavy winter 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.780
 then lightweight fabrics that can 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.510
 be used year-round so people 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.840
 It has a lot of color still prints so the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.510
 floral remains chess and also the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.010
 ethnic prints and the animal print that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.010
 never goes out of style with the chubby ones 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.350
 ae 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.199
 I arrived 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.980
 was with the importance of fashion plus size 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.920
 for your brand 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.960
 so my brand even van it only 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.480
 meets the plus size market 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.170
 So, I dedicate myself totally to 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.000
 that 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.340
 An hour ago I said no 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.440
 good to do small and big size 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.540
 Let's just do it for the agents of commerce. 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.100
 No 46 to 60 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.920
 I think this is fundamental because 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.290
 Do you have eyes only for that market you? 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.660
 ends up not discriminating and serving goods 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.030
 public a long time ago the marks 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.600
 They only worked with more masters clothes. 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.340
 and now this young fashion is 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.890
 coming in then we bring a lot of fashion 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.990
 young woman in fabric which is also a thing 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.450
 difficult to find on the market at times 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.680
 and colorful clothes also clothes 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.160
 that usually colored people 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.250
 end up stuck in black and 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.500
 brown and we try to make escape and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.740
 show that fashion cops can be 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.790
 colorful can be young can acinturada 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.590
 It does not have to be a bag, it does not have to be 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.269
 big did not hide the body and yes it is 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.820
 essential that you have your body 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.320
 We came to show the woman that 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.290
 she can dress well 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.980
 even using a dummy largest branch 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.980
 have money 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.969
 it is possible to make fashion plus size follow the 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:32.400
 trend is possible before they fail 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.329
 they did this before fashion designers 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.639
 plus size 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.769
 they bought that cloth and did it in the 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.810
 collection and that nothing was not a bit 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.719
 aligned with what was the trend today 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.849
 not today they anticipate go out 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.400
 take trends and make clothes what the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.079
 godmother uses chubby can also use 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.579
 in college 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.379
 We do not learn about them. 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.599
 does not learn to model because we do not 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.209
 learn styles website we do not learn 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.579
 about famous police stylists is 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.810
 all focused on smaller sizes 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.319
 so I think there's still a little bit of this 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.120
 tabu about the people who study the 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.719
 people who are in the same fashion 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.500
 is to understand how the market 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:16.519
 has grown and as the democratization of fashion 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.519
 is important 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:31.109
 as soon as it's a miss microsite it 's 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.750
 was rewarding at the time. 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.879
 that the people I recognized as 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.009
 model plus stronger even though I 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.169
 thanked my entire career thanked 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.389
 the neons my parents who gave me all 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.099
 fast food in the world 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.220
 It's not that I was very happy. 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.799
 imagine a woman winning a title 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.409
 miss independent of being thin is not 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.909
 being a plus size model was wonderful. 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.239
 I was elected the first miss plus size of 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.889
 country in 2010 in the Carioca contest and was 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.780
 very by chance in an age where it was 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.609
 still a little shame to participate 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.629
 This kind of contest I took some photos 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:08.310
 even with the renata director of the event and saw 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.750
 that had a beauty to him the people 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.120
 encouraged me to participate in the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.759
 I won the contest and in that I 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.789
 I started working as a model too 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:20.190
 I owe a lot and stayed like this 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.740
 title I think it was a title that 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.330
 brought a lot of personal fulfillment was the 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.090
 from him I started to see myself 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.250
 different is liking different and he 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.469
 gave me the impulse to conquer others 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.050
 dreams so you believe that this type 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.820
 help in self-esteem 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.450
 fat helps 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.450
 Yes, I was depressed myself and yours. 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.400
 staff here because there is independent 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.620
 anything like that 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.690
 we have to like people we have to 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.210
 If you love, you understand, it elevates our 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.330
 self-esteem a wonderful event that 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.900
 brings many women back to the life of 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.700
 back happiness to the liking 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.710
 models can be beautiful and start to 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.240
 get out in the media own media starts to 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.070
 show them how beautiful they look 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.570
 It only raises the last one. 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.300
 You begin to see how they really 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.850
 they are beautiful women and not like 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.470
 they end up criticizing the woman who is 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.080
 overweight today she has gained a 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.800
 with the people in the media. 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.930
 people are okay 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.580
 appearing little more and we're 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.800
 Cool clothes , we end up 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.930
 caring and people watching it 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.050
 It is also coming in the same wave 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.700
 thanks to the sight is less worse the woman 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.920
 being overweight but practicing 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.620
 physical activity feeding well 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.570
 being healthy than she does 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.040
 eternally regimen to lose weight 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.730
 put your health at risk 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.980
 I think happiness is what keeps the 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.400
 ideal weight health is what you feel 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.190
 good 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.810
 the pulsar media is there to stimulate 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.880
 people to be fat 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.190
 I believe it is to stimulate the 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.130
 people to accept themselves as they are 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.870
 from then on 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.700
 accepting people end up calling 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.320
 taking care of even taking care of the 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.660
 health because for example in many 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.000
 models after being accepted 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.090
 weight loss exercise 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.880
 so it does not mean that it is plus 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.520
 size or being overweight is to be 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.569
 every beautiful woman with his or her 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.990
 beauty with its unique good form of being 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.990
 Wow 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.300
 I have a friend 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.150
 I drove her crazy
