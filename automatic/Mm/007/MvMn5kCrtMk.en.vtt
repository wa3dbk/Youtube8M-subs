00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.449 

well<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.019> think<00:02:44.230> for<00:02:44.530> Walton<00:02:44.920> movie<00:02:45.310> he

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
well I think for Walton movie he

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.220 
well I think for Walton movie he
actually<00:02:45.879> does<00:02:46.120> like<00:02:46.390> his<00:02:46.599> work<00:02:46.780> he's<00:02:47.019> just

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
actually does like his work he's just

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.080 
actually does like his work he's just
he's<00:02:47.590> very<00:02:47.650> meticulous<00:02:48.400> about<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.819> but<00:02:49.000> he

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
he's very meticulous about it but he

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.750 
he's very meticulous about it but he
loves<00:02:49.560> what<00:02:50.560> he<00:02:50.650> does<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.159> images<00:02:51.579> that<00:02:51.609> he

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
loves what he does the images that he

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.670 
loves what he does the images that he
takes<00:02:51.969> care<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.659> looking<00:02:53.469> at<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
takes care of and looking at the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.530 
takes care of and looking at the
pictures<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.519> think<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.819> real<00:02:55.090> respect

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
pictures and I think is a real respect

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.949 
pictures and I think is a real respect
for<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.019> for<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.859> photography<00:02:57.519> okay<00:02:58.510> that's

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
for the for the photography okay that's

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.550 
for the for the photography okay that's
good<00:02:59.109> don't<00:02:59.439> get<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.219> diesel<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:02.200> doesn't

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
good don't get the diesel it doesn't

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.250 
good don't get the diesel it doesn't
mean<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.709> it's<00:03:03.010> any<00:03:03.219> less<00:03:04.079> meticulous<00:03:05.079> than

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
mean that it's any less meticulous than

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.470 
mean that it's any less meticulous than
work<00:03:05.379> or<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.680> he's<00:03:06.430> he<00:03:06.909> doesn't<00:03:07.120> really<00:03:07.299> get

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
work or that he's he doesn't really get

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.649 
work or that he's he doesn't really get
noticed<00:03:07.659> for<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.290> but<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:10.150> know<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.269> think<00:03:10.359> it's

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
noticed for it but you know I think it's

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.020 
noticed for it but you know I think it's
important<00:03:11.439> if<00:03:11.500> you're<00:03:11.620> doing<00:03:11.650> something<00:03:12.069> you

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
important if you're doing something you

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.210 
important if you're doing something you
find<00:03:13.269> some<00:03:13.510> sort<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.810> connection<00:03:14.049> with<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.530> you

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
find some sort of connection with it you

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.399 
find some sort of connection with it you
know<00:03:15.310> even<00:03:15.579> if<00:03:15.700> it's<00:03:15.849> if<00:03:16.180> it's<00:03:16.329> not<00:03:17.169> the<00:03:17.290> most

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
know even if it's if it's not the most

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.559 
know even if it's if it's not the most
exciting<00:03:17.799> job<00:03:18.189> in<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.430> world<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:19.329> obviously

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
exciting job in the world and obviously

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.449 
exciting job in the world and obviously
your<00:03:20.049> life<00:03:20.260> outside<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.889> job<00:03:21.129> becomes

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
your life outside of that job becomes

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.159 
your life outside of that job becomes
more<00:03:21.639> important<00:03:27.480> if<00:03:28.480> you're<00:03:28.659> doing<00:03:28.810> something

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
more important if you're doing something

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.690 
more important if you're doing something
that<00:03:29.260> doesn't<00:03:29.319> really<00:03:29.739> excite<00:03:30.129> you<00:03:30.340> or<00:03:30.400> that

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
that doesn't really excite you or that

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.490 
that doesn't really excite you or that
you<00:03:30.760> don't<00:03:30.969> really<00:03:31.060> connect<00:03:31.419> true<00:03:31.629> but<00:03:32.230> I

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
you don't really connect true but I

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.559 
you don't really connect true but I
think<00:03:32.709> trying<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.040> find<00:03:33.310> something<00:03:33.579> that<00:03:33.879> you

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
think trying to find something that you

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.940 
think trying to find something that you
know<00:03:34.689> that<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.989> can<00:03:35.169> connect<00:03:35.469> with<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.769> it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
know that you can connect with and it

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.830 
know that you can connect with and it
excites<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.519> if<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.849> have<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.150> ability<00:03:37.810> to

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
excites you if you have the ability to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.050 
excites you if you have the ability to
do<00:03:38.109> it<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.500> should<00:03:38.739> in<00:03:39.159> that<00:03:39.340> kind<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.700> job

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
do it you should in that kind of a job

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.459 
do it you should in that kind of a job
easier<00:03:40.810> said<00:03:41.079> than<00:03:41.230> done

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:41.469 
easier said than done

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:47.620 
easier said than done
probably

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.310 

I<00:03:49.450> do<00:03:50.450> actually

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
I do actually

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.200 
I do actually
I<00:03:51.350> would<00:03:51.620> not<00:03:51.740> yes<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.370> did<00:03:52.550> because<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.940> grew<00:03:53.150> up

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
I would not yes I did because I grew up

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.260 
I would not yes I did because I grew up
with<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.570> water<00:03:53.840> cooler<00:03:54.320> in<00:03:55.010> our<00:03:55.220> apartment

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
with a water cooler in our apartment

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.000 
with a water cooler in our apartment
I'm<00:03:56.720> not<00:03:56.960> kidding<00:03:57.320> we<00:03:57.440> had<00:03:57.590> like<00:03:57.710> one<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:57.950> those

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
I'm not kidding we had like one of those

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.770 
I'm not kidding we had like one of those
bottles<00:03:58.460> of<00:03:58.700> water<00:03:58.880> like<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.240> big<00:03:59.390> bottle<00:03:59.690> you

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
bottles of water like the big bottle you

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.320 
bottles of water like the big bottle you
put<00:03:59.960> in<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.140> thing<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:00.710> I<00:04:01.100> remember<00:04:01.520> it's

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
put in the thing and I remember it's

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.500 
put in the thing and I remember it's
like<00:04:02.480> pick<00:04:02.750> up<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.080> bottle<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:05.150> then<00:04:05.390> the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
like pick up the bottle and then the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.180 
like pick up the bottle and then the
whole<00:04:06.050> thing<00:04:06.080> is<00:04:06.260> like<00:04:06.440> opening<00:04:06.830> up<00:04:06.950> as<00:04:07.100> I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
whole thing is like opening up as I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.470 
whole thing is like opening up as I
pouring<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:07.700> in<00:04:07.820> so<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.090> doesn't<00:04:08.120> like

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
pouring it in so it doesn't like

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.240 
pouring it in so it doesn't like
overflow<00:04:09.080> when<00:04:09.320> you<00:04:09.410> pour<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:09.740> into<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.040> thing

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
overflow when you pour it into the thing

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.450 
overflow when you pour it into the thing
at<00:04:10.550> least<00:04:10.700> that's<00:04:10.880> how<00:04:10.940> they<00:04:11.180> did<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.480> back<00:04:11.600> in

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
at least that's how they did it back in

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:23.620 
at least that's how they did it back in
1975<00:04:13.460> it's<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.390> same

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.990 

yes<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:25.250> funny<00:04:25.430> you're<00:04:25.580> asking<00:04:25.820> all<00:04:25.910> these

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
yes it's funny you're asking all these

questions I don't work in an office so I

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.780 
questions I don't work in an office so I
