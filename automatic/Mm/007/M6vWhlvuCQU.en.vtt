00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.180
 written off

 or travel sleepers have been many times 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.830
 desire to hold schools 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.240
 what we have here is not necessary to place the road 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.720
 there are only floors here 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.570
 blog we dragged too since when dad 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.760
 I had a sacrifice thought thought to drag 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.879
 or not to drag the question dropped by itself 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.530
 when angry hall directories and here at 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.899
 his hair stood on end 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.840
 it turned out that the old sleepers are very dangerous 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.370
 slept and dangerous enough for 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.710
 house building thing because they 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.199
 impregnated with creosote scientists long ago 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.510
 found out creosote is a powerful carcinogen 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.699
 constant contact with him can 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.830
 lead to cancer but what about 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.589
 cause allergies and skin problems 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.110
 many people do not know this and some 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.000
 firms make good money on it they 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.280
 buy trunks after reconstruction 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.190
 railways and sell cheap 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.940
 summer cottages you arrange with your own hands 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.289
 such a poison bomb instead of a cottage 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.690
 by the way i saw lined up houses barn 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.869
 and minutes completely out of school 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.880
 how to be there and I do not have 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.190
 we have a big handkerchief 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.679

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.240
 bills put the problem box 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.240
 started when Daria took up the finish 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.430
 where to get an experienced contractor for advice 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.920
