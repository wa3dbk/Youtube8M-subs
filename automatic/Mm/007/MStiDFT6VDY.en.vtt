00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:03.819
 it's hard 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.259
 between the historical the thing is going to be always raised from the side the 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:13.229
 biology 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.480
 the easiest thing is back then only because of what was the idea is to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.169
 scope was to prohibit more than regular 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.239
 the idea was 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.559
 Canary Islands being less and taking advantage that we left the 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:27.509
 evolutionary processes will work with the idea of ​​trying to keep those so 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.910
 preserved and so far from 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.509
 those of human development as possible 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.030
 we are more than 1800 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.520
 of course the times advanced still we lay down the population of the earth a 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.180
 bit 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.870
 and we realized that they really have nothing to do with conservation 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 Let's say to shop with the present 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.110
 said the proposal today that has worked best burning results 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.740
 has had that law will include conservation in actions 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.810
 productive 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.920
 we went instead of it being a general cost 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.880
 forever for the economies of the countries 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.290
 pillar conservation as such the sustainable or conjunctural management that has 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.160
 made possible 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.520
 not only generate local economies without using that money to conserve species 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 that not only is thought to take advantage of for example 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.430
 because the advantage there parts like him as in all questions 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.010
 commercial there is a gigantic range of options 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.680
 the first one that most seems to burn the sardine has also left is the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.260
 hunting 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.510
 the hunt has been distorted in the concept of the poacher the hunter 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.180
 massive 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.250
 the one that exterminates a population to feed the day 2 to 1 to a town or 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.230
 to be enriched not by the skins and wolf let's say or by other products but 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.750
 also hunter conservationists that hunter waiting hotel ac 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.490
 compassion 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.290
 and that investing was exposed to Athenaeum Sada and works in the real world to 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.770
 invest your money in the conservation of animals 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.780
 with the idea that romantic ideal and keep the balance 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 per hundred natural for enjoyment 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.740
 of what is an interesting concept and what has to become operant 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.860
 paradoxical in the hunting this input poor neighbor animals not 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.579
 we are killing we are not finishing 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.369
 how it is possible to marry to conserve would seem truly stupid 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.590
 The issue is that lor malmete do nothing that simply be at home 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.940
 doing what you always do in reality you are not contributing anything the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.590
 conservation I am the fact of being good you have to think well it does not make a difference 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.320
 of good intentions both increased the ways of the pantheons 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.090
 the conservationist case home and for what it takes to be able to take your 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.300
 prey because he loves nature because I enjoy it because he knows it because he knows 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.159
 she 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.310
 is not going to marry an expensive dam in a place where there is no conservation what they do 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.879
 is to invest in conservation if we prohibit 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.389
 who is going to make that prohibition come true 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.439
 we want the protected areas of those of soldiers today in those of police 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.260
 federal we offer protected areas is mine alone 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.260
 because the owners of the land makes two or four fail to take advantage 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.009
 we humans are very good at exterminating 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.779
 that I tell you 40 or 50 million insects on a plot just to 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.260
 that the corn works well 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.230
 and the same with rodents with snakes with 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.839
 percent birds do not give us the same 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.739
 if you want your corn to arrive well the super you have to do away with all the 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.619
 fauna that exists today and the flora 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.489
 that's a question created from prayer trade center legs a theme 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.709
 that is never touched we do not sacrifice something like one million 200 thousand cattle 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.129
 store on the planet not 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.500
 but what is impressive is the impact they cause 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.059
 these giant animal fleets is that they feed us to the environment 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.369
 they arrive at places such as the Lacandon jungle 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.539
 in the felling of the Mexican jungles all been for livestock 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.319
 tote the wood to take advantage of them since they implant pastures and by boat 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.979
 where they do not occur 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.239
 7 how curious 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.069
 we can criticize the hunt but if we were critical adevers of the 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.909
 we have to stop eating meat 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.270
 or stop eating tuna 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.510
 or stop eating shrimp you can eat all the products that this pledge the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.510
 tower the environment 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.010
 ishida breasts like the beautiful elustondo yosemite in united states 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.860
 break all records not 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.420
 the club see in south africa for example the preserve of doñana in in the south of spain 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.270
 sun in communities that work 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.720
 incorporating the wines of the land or the people who originally lived 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.520
 in those places 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.330
 i to Aztec, the most modern tourism and low impact technologies 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.720
 At the end of the day I think that modernity conservation is more 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.720
 in asking for precautionary management in regulation 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.170
 will inform by consensus 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.919
 the irresponsible bite is not very responsible 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.189
 versus the traditional forecast of saying here is not done because no 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.270
 3 we generate more knowledge their masters than if we forbid 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.220
 we were more income if we use that we can incorporate the owners of 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.500
 the resources used 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.199
 we exclude them and we prohibit 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.090
 but it is that we want as a Musa society a vertical decision that 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.000
 falls from the sky and you have nothing to appeal 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.500
 or rather a management where we all participate and what ruiz is the 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.720
 responsibility and future arrests
