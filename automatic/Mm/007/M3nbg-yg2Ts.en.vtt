00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
you know inspiration wise it's just

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.670 
you know inspiration wise it's just
everything<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.850> happens<00:02:22.180> on<00:02:22.330> TV<00:02:22.990> or<00:02:23.410> whether

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
whatever happens in my pop culture and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.710 
whatever happens in my pop culture and
we<00:02:27.550> pretty<00:02:27.760> much<00:02:27.850> get<00:02:28.150> inspiration<00:02:28.660> about

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
we pretty much get inspiration about

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.600 
we pretty much get inspiration about
that<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.500> newer<00:02:29.710> stuff<00:02:30.010> that's<00:02:30.190> coming<00:02:30.370> out

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
that the newer stuff that's coming out

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.710 
that the newer stuff that's coming out
and<00:02:30.760> we're<00:02:30.910> probably<00:02:31.060> do<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.270> lot<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.510> like

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
and we're probably do a lot of like

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.810 
and we're probably do a lot of like
trucker<00:02:32.020> hats<00:02:32.320> things<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.980> have<00:02:33.220> more<00:02:33.670> of<00:02:33.760> a

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
retro feel back when I first was

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.200 
retro feel back when I first was
designing<00:02:35.860> we<00:02:36.100> would<00:02:36.220> take<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.400> lot<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.670> style

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
designing we would take a lot of style

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.390 
designing we would take a lot of style
cues<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:37.660> other<00:02:37.960> industries<00:02:38.530> outside<00:02:39.250> of

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
surf and that's what we were getting a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.690 
surf and that's what we were getting a
lot<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.840> ideas<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.830> know<00:02:41.950> fashion<00:02:42.400> was

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
lot of ideas and you know fashion was

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.100

our take on it now it's like we're

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.230 
our take on it now it's like we're
trading<00:02:56.740> off<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.250> blurring<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> line<00:02:58.210> a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
trading off and blurring the line a

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.510 
trading off and blurring the line a
