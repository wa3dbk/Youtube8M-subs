00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.660
 hi friends from youtube I am flash 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.059
 phoenix 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.059
 and here I am going to make another of my videos 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.559
 and in this one 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.020
 to try on how to kill pop 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.080
 I have seen many other videos 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 to other pages 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.219
 in 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:42.180
 the pont dies with a thousand faces or it 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:45.260
 dies get fat a lot if you leave it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.260
 Long time no 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.610
 without 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.720
 in food they are doing everything to heaven 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.810
 and I was investigating a little more and I saw 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.670
 that if there is a version of the pool that 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.910
 can kill 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:09.350
 There are two versions 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.350
 of the show for android or for another mobile 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.640
 one in which you can not kill it and another 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.460
 in which yes you can kill are like 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 some different versions I do not know I have 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.829
 the one that can not be killed 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.689
 but I'm researching and researching 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.429
 that's why there are people who say that if 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.640
 can kill and others who say it is 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.640
 impossible 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.350
 and then in conclusion at the end yes that 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.759
 it always kills but you can not kill 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.759
 it will be both 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.650
 and on that android android that you can 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.290
 send to the pool you can kill these 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.030
 ways as they say with many 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.600
 leaving all boxes with zero much 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.600
 weather 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.380
 with mild fattening giving too much 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.289
 food 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.520
 and the other one, whatever you do, no 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.580
 go dead 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.209
 and here until here tells me how 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.209
 kill pop 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.380
 what you liked and 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.980
 to another 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.980
 we wrote
