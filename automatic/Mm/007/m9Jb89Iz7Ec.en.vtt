00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.510
 sand pattern 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.410
 son here is the scheme of this too 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.660
 but 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.020
 no offense 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.450
 understandable scheme of this you can find on 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.140
 my website will link under the video and 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.790
 so let's get started as you see 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:32.710
 rapport pattern 4 loops so I typed 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:36.699
 the number of loops is a multiple of four me 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:43.300
 last loop we type 2 air 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:45.690
 loop knit 3 single crochet columns with 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.690
 common peak 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.540
 spa 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.720
 and 3 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:12.040
 Now we will immediately knit and second 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:17.759
 parts of our pattern we type 3 air 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:24.250
 loop and knit 3 single crochet columns 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:26.759
 but we enter and here in these loops here in 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.759
 this place 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:42.039
 and all three columns knit exactly here 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:42.039
 that is, also here under these loops 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.250
 Here we have the first such element 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:06.120
 in order to link the next item 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:07.340
 we do 3 nakida and knit 4 columns with 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.340
 common peak 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.340
 one 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.580
 come on 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.740
 and 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.849
 four 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.849
 here we have four nevyazanny columns 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:38.140
 there are two nakida and loop that you were 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:43.599
 On the hook, we initially knit these 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:49.209
 four columns and 1 cap like this 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:52.180
 way that's what we have left on the hook 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.660
 and now we knit a column with one 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.470
 crochet and knit three more columns with one 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.470
 nakida here under all here these strings 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.769
 that is, we have to log in under 4 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.769
 strings 45 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:42.130
 Here we have the second such element 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:46.540
 and so knit until the end of the row 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:51.460
 I will link another such column that is 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.430
 the first item she will contact differently 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:02.610
 from farther they all fit in like this 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.610
 way to 1 2 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.860
 Terek 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.260
 four 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.870
 now we knit all four of these 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:26.300
 column with one of the sc 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:29.550
 and add a single crochet 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.320
 do not forget to go further here under all 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.320
 these loops 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.370
 here 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:04.040
 the first row we have ready the second row we 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.040
 knit just with single crochets 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.189
 again to get here which side 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.189
 knitting 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.460
 say it 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.420
 third row we start just like the first 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:58.500
 that is, knit 2 air loops and three 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.480
 not connected single crochet 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:07.150
 Here is such an interesting picture 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:13.240
 we get as a result of it a little bit 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:15.670
 different of course from the wrong side then 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.800
 there is he not two sides here here not 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.800
 seen here with such beautiful transitions 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.110
 but a very nice drawing such 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:29.580
 unusual shemku 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.580
 you will find on my website
