I'm sorry to say this but that's how I
feel<00:01:59.399> um<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> fact<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.229> i<00:02:01.380> got<00:02:01.560> these

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
feel um so the fact that i got these

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.440 
feel um so the fact that i got these
bonuses<00:02:02.159> was<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> only

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
bonuses was like it was like the only

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.499 
bonuses was like it was like the only
thing<00:02:04.280> like<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> only<00:02:05.579> reason<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.390> me<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
thing like the only reason for me to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.730 
thing like the only reason for me to
have<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> profession<00:02:07.200> other<00:02:07.350> than<00:02:07.590> gathering

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
have a profession other than gathering

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.130 
have a profession other than gathering
professions<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.369> making<00:02:08.700> gold<00:02:08.970> right<00:02:09.869> at<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
professions for making gold right at the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.590 
professions for making gold right at the
sudden<00:02:10.500> expansion

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
sudden expansion

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.560 
sudden expansion
tools<00:02:11.960> are<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.950> primary<00:02:13.400> source<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.420> income

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
tools are the primary source of income

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.270 
tools are the primary source of income
for<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.320> server<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.530> takes<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> flavor

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
for the server so it it takes the flavor

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.190 
for the server so it it takes the flavor
out<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.670> from<00:02:19.970> for<00:02:20.270> me<00:02:20.390> at<00:02:20.510> least<00:02:20.540> from<00:02:21.080> a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
out of it from for me at least from a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.690 
out of it from for me at least from a
development<00:02:21.590> standpoint<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.310> think<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
development standpoint I think it's a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.690 
development standpoint I think it's a
good<00:02:22.820> idea<00:02:22.970> though<00:02:23.360> because<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.800> in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
good idea though because you know in

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.000 
good idea though because you know in
reality<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.720> looking<00:02:27.200> at<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.500> technically

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
reality like looking at it technically

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.440 
reality like looking at it technically
you<00:02:28.340> shouldn't<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.760> choosing<00:02:29.060> professions

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
you shouldn't be choosing professions

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.850 
you shouldn't be choosing professions
because<00:02:29.510> all<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.710> this

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
because all I have to have this

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.740 
because all I have to have this
profession<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.640> should<00:02:31.880> be<00:02:31.910> oh<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.270> like<00:02:32.600> this

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
profession it should be oh I like this

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.900 
profession it should be oh I like this
profession<00:02:33.200> I'm<00:02:33.320> going<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.560> pick<00:02:33.710> this<00:02:33.740> so<00:02:34.610> in

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
profession I'm going to pick this so in

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.910 
profession I'm going to pick this so in
theory<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.870> actually<00:02:36.290> good<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> deal<00:02:36.740> what

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
theory it's actually good a deal what

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.320 
theory it's actually good a deal what
they're<00:02:37.070> doing<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.670> good<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.180> good

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
they're doing is it good it's a good

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.750 
they're doing is it good it's a good
change<00:02:38.570> essentially<00:02:39.290> now<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.100> was<00:02:40.370> wondering

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
change essentially now I was wondering

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.320 
change essentially now I was wondering
though<00:02:40.910> if<00:02:41.410> certain<00:02:42.410> things<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:43.610> i<00:02:43.970> use<00:02:44.300> for

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
though if certain things that i use for

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.200 
though if certain things that i use for
combat<00:02:44.960> are<00:02:45.380> using<00:02:45.770> during<00:02:46.550> raid<00:02:46.790> encounters

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
combat are using during raid encounters

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.660 
combat are using during raid encounters
also<00:02:47.750> count<00:02:47.990> as<00:02:48.230> combat<00:02:49.220> enhancers

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
also count as combat enhancers

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.520 
also count as combat enhancers
essentially<00:02:50.360> what<00:02:50.990> I'm<00:02:51.110> talking<00:02:51.350> about<00:02:51.410> here

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
essentially what I'm talking about here

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.680 
essentially what I'm talking about here
is<00:02:51.800> for<00:02:52.280> example<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.760> nitro<00:02:53.150> boost<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.660> the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
is for example a nitro boost and the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.240 
is for example a nitro boost and the
Goblin<00:02:54.290> glider<00:02:54.500> from<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.890> engineering

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
Goblin glider from the engineering

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.570 
Goblin glider from the engineering
oppression<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:57.260> was<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:57.890> like<00:02:58.100> thinking

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
oppression and I was just like thinking

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.520 
oppression and I was just like thinking
you<00:02:58.850> know<00:02:59.000> high-end<00:02:59.840> gills<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.260> know<00:03:00.350> that

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
you know high-end gills you know that

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.920 
you know high-end gills you know that
you<00:03:00.680> everything<00:03:01.040> they<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.880> make<00:03:02.510> themself

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
you everything they can to make themself

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
you everything they can to make themself
the<00:03:03.080> best<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.840> let's<00:03:05.840> say<00:03:06.140> they<00:03:06.350> take<00:03:06.590> out<00:03:06.740> all

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
the best so let's say they take out all

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.390 
the best so let's say they take out all
combat<00:03:07.550> enhancers<00:03:08.210> but<00:03:09.080> they<00:03:09.320> keep<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:10.070> nitro

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
combat enhancers but they keep the nitro

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.430 
combat enhancers but they keep the nitro
boost<00:03:10.550> in<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.880> Goblin<00:03:11.180> glider<00:03:11.390> would<00:03:12.290> that

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
boost in the Goblin glider would that

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.920 
boost in the Goblin glider would that
mean<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.970> high-end<00:03:14.360> guilds<00:03:14.750> would

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
mean that the high-end guilds would

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.960 
mean that the high-end guilds would
force<00:03:15.290> every<00:03:15.950> single<00:03:16.340> Raider<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.820> have

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
force every single Raider to have

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.450 
force every single Raider to have
engineering<00:03:17.420> or<00:03:18.290> would<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.860> actually<00:03:19.190> reach<00:03:19.340> a

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
engineering or would we actually reach a

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.130 
engineering or would we actually reach a
point<00:03:19.670> which<00:03:20.000> they<00:03:20.210> say<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.540> know<00:03:20.810> what<00:03:20.930> pick

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
point which they say you know what pick

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.240 
point which they say you know what pick
whatever<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.500> fuck<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.800> want<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.100> doesn't

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
whatever the fuck you want it doesn't

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.060 
whatever the fuck you want it doesn't
matter<00:03:22.400> too<00:03:22.700> much<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.060> know<00:03:23.210> just<00:03:23.740> yeah<00:03:24.740> you

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
matter too much you know just yeah you

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.580 
matter too much you know just yeah you
go<00:03:25.670> do<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.120> know<00:03:26.270> whatever<00:03:26.900> whatever<00:03:27.350> you

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
go do it you know whatever whatever you

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.610 
go do it you know whatever whatever you
feel<00:03:27.740> like<00:03:27.800> whatever<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.250> don't<00:03:28.670> care<00:03:28.820> anymore

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
feel like whatever I don't care anymore

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.230 
feel like whatever I don't care anymore
with<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.800> would<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.250> be<00:03:31.520> I<00:03:31.700> got<00:03:31.880> I'm<00:03:32.030> like

with that would that be I got I'm like

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.170 
with that would that be I got I'm like
that<00:03:32.540> sounds<00:03:32.570> boring<00:03:33.200> right<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.770> does<00:03:34.180> but

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
that sounds boring right it does but

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
that's just me you know putting it out

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.860 
that's just me you know putting it out
there<00:03:37.520> as<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> foreign<00:03:38.180> thing<00:03:38.360> because<00:03:38.660> that's

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
there as a foreign thing because that's

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.430 
there as a foreign thing because that's
my<00:03:39.410> opinion<00:03:39.680> right<00:03:40.100> i<00:03:40.130> find<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.030> boring<00:03:41.240> so<00:03:42.140> you

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
my opinion right i find it boring so you

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.840 
my opinion right i find it boring so you
know<00:03:42.560> it's<00:03:42.680> ernest<00:03:42.950> sound<00:03:43.220> boring<00:03:43.670> when<00:03:43.820> I

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
know it's ernest sound boring when I

whether or not I'll carry next expansion
you<00:04:09.010> know<00:04:09.129> it<00:04:09.280> depends<00:04:09.640> on<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.819> nitro<00:04:10.150> boost

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
you know it depends on the nitro boost

being taken away or not goblin glider is
very<00:04:14.170> rarely<00:04:14.500> useful<00:04:15.099> like<00:04:15.640> during<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.090> boss

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
very rarely useful like during a boss

very rarely useful like during a boss
encounter<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.739> happens<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.310> know<00:04:18.370> like

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
encounter but it happens I know like

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.580 
encounter but it happens I know like
it's<00:04:18.940> extremely<00:04:19.510> good<00:04:19.660> for<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:20.049> gala<00:04:20.320> crass

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
it's extremely good for like gala crass

whatever but normally it doesn't do too
much<00:04:26.919> but<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.580> nitro<00:04:27.880> boost<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.389> know<00:04:28.540> on

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
much but the nitro boost you know on

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.140 
much but the nitro boost you know on
some<00:04:29.800> hero<00:04:30.070> encounters<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.669> can<00:04:30.790> easily<00:04:30.910> be

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
some hero encounters it can easily be

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.490 
some hero encounters it can easily be
something<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:31.720> should<00:04:31.870> use<00:04:32.080> because<00:04:32.260> there's

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
something you should use because there's

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.550 
something you should use because there's
a<00:04:32.590> chance<00:04:32.889> that<00:04:33.190> it'll<00:04:34.320> gave<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.500> you

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
a chance that it'll gave it to you

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.810 
a chance that it'll gave it to you
instead<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:36.760> it<00:04:37.830> might<00:04:38.830> be<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:39.100> thing<00:04:39.460> though

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
instead but it might be a thing though

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.029 
instead but it might be a thing though
like<00:04:40.419> I<00:04:40.630> i<00:04:40.720> know<00:04:41.289> i've<00:04:41.530> used<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:41.919> some

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
like I i know i've used it in some

there<00:04:47.289> is<00:04:47.410> an<00:04:47.590> encounter<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.160> higher<00:04:48.310> chance

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
there is an encounter the higher chance

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.969 
there is an encounter the higher chance
there<00:04:48.699> is<00:04:48.729> that<00:04:48.940> i'll<00:04:49.030> use<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:49.840> i<00:04:50.710> would

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
there is that i'll use this and i would

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.219 
there is that i'll use this and i would
love<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.460> keep<00:04:51.610> using<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.630> chance<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:53.050> me
