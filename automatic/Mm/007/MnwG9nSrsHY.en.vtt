so<00:00:20.029> let's<00:00:21.029> look<00:00:21.720> at<00:00:21.900> specs<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.310> ipad

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
so let's look at specs here on the ipad

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:32.979 
so let's look at specs here on the ipad
2<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.269> has<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.400> 9.5<00:00:26.400> inch<00:00:26.990> you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.140> oh<00:00:29.449> wait

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.549 

wrong<00:00:34.070> anyway<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.760> 9.7<00:00:36.750> inch<00:00:36.870> diagonal

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
wrong anyway so it's a 9.7 inch diagonal

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010 
wrong anyway so it's a 9.7 inch diagonal
led-backlit<00:00:38.660> glossy<00:00:39.660> widescreen

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
led-backlit glossy widescreen

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410

multi-touch<00:00:40.649> display<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.730> IPS<00:00:42.210> technology

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
multi-touch display with IPS technology

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.500 
multi-touch display with IPS technology
which<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.440> pretty<00:00:43.649> nice<00:00:44.059> we<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.480> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
which is pretty nice we all know that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.319 
which is pretty nice we all know that
the<00:00:45.870> IPS<00:00:46.320> technology<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:47.340> screens<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> really

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the IPS technology for screens is really

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.360 
the IPS technology for screens is really
nice<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.920> gives<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.430> good<00:00:51.770> angle<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
nice so it gives you a good angle and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.860 
nice so it gives you a good angle and
very<00:00:54.059> nice<00:00:54.420> colors<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:56.149> it's<00:00:57.149> also<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
very nice colors so it's also a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.980 
very nice colors so it's also a
resolution<00:00:58.800> of<00:01:00.859> 1024<00:01:01.859> x<00:01:03.350> 768<00:01:04.400> which<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.640> like

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
resolution of 1024 x 768 which is like

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.429 
resolution of 1024 x 768 which is like
720p<00:01:07.580> resolution<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.920> 100<00:01:12.439> 130

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
720p resolution and that is just 100 130

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.810 
720p resolution and that is just 100 130
2<00:01:14.010> pixels<00:01:14.939> per<00:01:15.420> inch<00:01:15.659> which<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
2 pixels per inch which is not that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.190 
2 pixels per inch which is not that
impressive<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.150> new<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
impressive and on the new one here the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.520 
impressive and on the new one here the
ipad<00:01:22.560> 3<00:01:23.299> we<00:01:24.299> could<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.229> Retina<00:01:26.070> display<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
ipad 3 we could see a Retina display of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.160 
ipad 3 we could see a Retina display of
2048<00:01:28.530> x<00:01:29.299> 1536<00:01:31.909> that's<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
2048 x 1536 that's that's like the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.280 
2048 x 1536 that's that's like the
double<00:01:34.680> resolution<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:36.960> really

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
double resolution and we don't really

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.380 
double resolution and we don't really
know<00:01:37.650> about<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.280> screen<00:01:38.610> size<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
know about the screen size here on the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.310 
know about the screen size here on the
ipad<00:01:39.720> 3<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.200> still<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> would<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.320> 9.7

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
ipad 3 but still if it would be a 9.7

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.069 
ipad 3 but still if it would be a 9.7
inch<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> new<00:01:44.189> ipad<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:45.390> would<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
inch on the new ipad we would see a

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.660 
inch on the new ipad we would see a
pixels<00:01:46.860> per<00:01:47.130> inch<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.640> light<00:01:48.799> 250<00:01:49.799> which<00:01:50.040> would

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
pixels per inch of light 250 which would

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.440 
pixels per inch of light 250 which would
be<00:01:51.180> pretty<00:01:51.720> awesome<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:53.630> i<00:01:55.310> personally

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
be pretty awesome and i personally

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.139 
be pretty awesome and i personally
personally<00:01:57.799> don't<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.890> apple<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.820> much

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
personally don't like apple that much

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.959 
personally don't like apple that much
you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.810> i<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.700> like

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
you know i think they have like

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.219 
you know i think they have like
overpriced<00:02:03.689> pressed<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.710> uh<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.399> know

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
overpriced pressed and uh and you know

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.529 
overpriced pressed and uh and you know
you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.890> lot<00:02:08.190> cheaper<00:02:08.729> stuff<00:02:09.060> we'd

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you can get a lot cheaper stuff we'd

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
you can get a lot cheaper stuff we'd
better<00:02:09.840> press<00:02:10.229> tanda

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
better press tanda

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.070 
better press tanda
and<00:02:11.989> we<00:02:12.989> also<00:02:13.170> know<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.500> I've<00:02:14.270> a5<00:02:15.270> processor

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and we also know that I've a5 processor

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.030 
and we also know that I've a5 processor
the<00:02:16.680> dual<00:02:16.890> core<00:02:17.250> with<00:02:17.459> 1<00:02:17.760> gigahertz<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the dual core with 1 gigahertz in the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.460 
the dual core with 1 gigahertz in the
ipad<00:02:20.459> 2<00:02:20.730> could<00:02:21.660> be<00:02:22.019> upgraded<00:02:22.769> in<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.310> ipad<00:02:23.790> 3<00:02:24.090> i

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
ipad 2 could be upgraded in the ipad 3 i

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.100 
ipad 2 could be upgraded in the ipad 3 i
don't<00:02:25.470> know<00:02:25.560> if<00:02:25.590> there<00:02:26.099> will<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:27.110> 6

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
don't know if there will be a a 6

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.400 
don't know if there will be a a 6
processor<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.060> would<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> dual<00:02:30.989> core

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
processor like that would be a dual core

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.150 
processor like that would be a dual core
or<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:32.010> quad<00:02:32.430> core<00:02:32.760> or<00:02:32.940> anything<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
or a quad core or anything like that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.080 
or a quad core or anything like that
that<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.430> up<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.239> Apple<00:02:36.750> right<00:02:37.560> now<00:02:38.090> there's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that is up to Apple right now there's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.180 
that is up to Apple right now there's
probably<00:02:39.989> not<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:41.250> much<00:02:41.489> people<00:02:42.030> knowing

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
probably not that much people knowing

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.140 
probably not that much people knowing
what<00:02:44.190> there<00:02:44.730> will<00:02:44.910> be<00:02:46.640> what<00:02:47.640> kind<00:02:48.030> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
what there will be what kind of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.140 
what there will be what kind of
processor<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:49.019> will<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:50.040> yeah<00:02:50.640> there<00:02:51.000> are

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
processor it will be but yeah there are

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.390 
processor it will be but yeah there are
some<00:02:51.450> stuff<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.349> will<00:02:52.739> be<00:02:52.950> improved

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
some stuff that will be improved

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.640 
some stuff that will be improved
probably<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.180> battery<00:02:54.360> will<00:02:54.989> be<00:02:55.170> improved

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
probably the battery will be improved
