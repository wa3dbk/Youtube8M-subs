 Features like 308 interface spi will be in a dash 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.770
 Though it is after having you tell economy 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.020
 This was also from the traditional i-mode terminal Twelve 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.900
 As we reuse plastic bag, we use in sense of mom 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
 Will be able to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.780
 After opening this country, we will replace the old signboard etc. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.280
 But I can not do it but the enthusiasts are huge and so on 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.810
 After this you have created a group 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.880
 Clearly separate the application 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.670
 Became 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 Compared 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.920
 For example, this island country Cyprus fourth place 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.220
 By the way 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.670
 It is sort to sort 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.330
 The first time in this application etc. The dentist 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.850
 Say that 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.630
 It is possible to say 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.300
 Prevent the situation of the group Nitaku group not used often 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.300
 It is also possible to perform operations such as 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 We carry out at this time 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.000

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.059

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.139
 And come here to talk about that manner mode 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.850
 The stone was kept guarding 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.200
 However, the model is originally used in the same sense 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 It will be 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.019
