00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
I've had since I've been 16 and yeah
it's<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.430> neck<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.030> bit<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.450> bit<00:02:00.869> hosed

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
it's the neck on it's a bit a bit hosed

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.340 
it's the neck on it's a bit a bit hosed
I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.219> can't<00:02:02.520> adjust<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.060> back<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.659> an

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
I think I can't adjust it back to an

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.859 
I think I can't adjust it back to an
action<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:04.829> decent<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
action that's decent and it's like a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.219 
action that's decent and it's like a
trampoline<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.860> um<00:02:08.690> yeah<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
trampoline so um yeah so it's going to

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.309 
trampoline so um yeah so it's going to
be<00:02:10.319> replacing<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> yeah<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
be replacing this one so yeah that's it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.890 
be replacing this one so yeah that's it
I<00:02:13.440> just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
I just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.690 
I just
maintaining<00:02:14.500> pulse<00:02:14.739> by<00:02:15.010> thought<00:02:15.340> I'd<00:02:15.430> share

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
maintaining pulse by thought I'd share

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.110 
maintaining pulse by thought I'd share
it<00:02:15.730> with<00:02:15.909> is<00:02:16.120> um<00:02:16.360> um<00:02:17.459> shame<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:18.700> not<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.909> normal

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.149 
it with is um um shame it's not a normal
fender<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:19.780> not<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> squire<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:20.590> like<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.099> said

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
fender and not a squire but like I said

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.630 
fender and not a squire but like I said
still<00:02:21.730> feels<00:02:22.000> pretty<00:02:22.239> good<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.689> it's<00:02:23.560> $150<00:02:24.430> so

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
still feels pretty good and it's $150 so

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.340 
still feels pretty good and it's $150 so
I<00:02:25.150> could<00:02:25.569> can't<00:02:25.989> go<00:02:26.110> wrong<00:02:26.489> if<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.849> ask<00:02:28.030> me

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:57.260 

Oh

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:30.059 

you

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:46.950 

you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.570 

you

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:12.360

you

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.230 

so<00:05:29.159> I<00:05:29.189> thought<00:05:29.370> I'd<00:05:29.490> just<00:05:29.639> record<00:05:30.000> a<00:05:30.090> couple

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
so I thought I'd just record a couple

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.850 
so I thought I'd just record a couple
sound<00:05:30.599> samples<00:05:31.020> of<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.199> guitar<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:31.800> sounds

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
sound samples of the guitar it sounds

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.189 
sound samples of the guitar it sounds
pretty<00:05:32.250> good<00:05:32.520> it's<00:05:32.939> got<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.300> little<00:05:33.780> bit<00:05:33.990> less

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
pretty good it's got a little bit less

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.420 
pretty good it's got a little bit less
output<00:05:34.740> than<00:05:35.370> what<00:05:35.610> I'm<00:05:35.729> used<00:05:35.939> to<00:05:36.090> being<00:05:36.719> the

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
output than what I'm used to being the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.820 
output than what I'm used to being the
Gibson<00:05:38.430> SG<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.180> Ibanez<00:05:39.719> Les<00:05:40.409> Paul<00:05:40.620> copy

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
Gibson SG and the Ibanez Les Paul copy

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.279 
Gibson SG and the Ibanez Les Paul copy
they<00:05:41.370> have<00:05:41.550> a<00:05:41.789> higher<00:05:41.939> output<00:05:42.210> so<00:05:42.659> that's

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
they have a higher output so that's

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.270 
they have a higher output so that's
something<00:05:43.500> that<00:05:43.650> I'm<00:05:43.800> gonna<00:05:43.919> have<00:05:44.069> to<00:05:44.099> get

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
something that I'm gonna have to get

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.980 
something that I'm gonna have to get
used<00:05:44.460> to<00:05:44.639> and<00:05:44.819> the<00:05:45.090> actions<00:05:45.419> a<00:05:45.509> bit<00:05:45.629> different

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
used to and the actions a bit different

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.179 
used to and the actions a bit different
to<00:05:46.080> those<00:05:46.229> two<00:05:46.469> as<00:05:46.620> well<00:05:46.740> which<00:05:46.949> is<00:05:47.069> something

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
to those two as well which is something

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:48.409 
to those two as well which is something
else<00:05:47.490> that<00:05:47.610> I'm<00:05:47.669> gonna<00:05:47.789> have<00:05:47.879> to<00:05:47.969> get<00:05:48.060> used<00:05:48.270> to

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
else that I'm gonna have to get used to

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.240 
else that I'm gonna have to get used to
but<00:05:48.810> that's<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.259> I<00:05:49.289> think<00:05:49.620> it<00:05:49.680> sounds<00:05:50.039> pretty

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
but that's it I think it sounds pretty

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.559 
but that's it I think it sounds pretty
good<00:05:50.370> I<00:05:50.430> think<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:50.789> plays<00:05:51.030> pretty<00:05:51.270> good<00:05:51.449> as

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
good I think it plays pretty good as

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.459 
good I think it plays pretty good as
well<00:05:51.750> it's<00:05:52.590> definitely<00:05:53.129> for<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:54.469> Stratocaster

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
well it's definitely for a Stratocaster

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.279 
well it's definitely for a Stratocaster
that<00:05:55.949> I<00:05:55.979> play<00:05:56.310> every<00:05:56.520> now<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:56.819> then<00:05:56.909> it's<00:05:57.719> I

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
that I play every now and then it's I

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.990 
that I play every now and then it's I
don't<00:05:59.069> think<00:05:59.190> it's<00:05:59.310> going<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.610> be<00:05:59.699> going<00:05:59.849> on

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
don't think it's going to be going on

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.270 
don't think it's going to be going on
eBay<00:06:00.330> I<00:06:00.360> think<00:06:00.629> it's<00:06:00.750> um<00:06:00.930> I<00:06:01.199> think<00:06:02.039> it's<00:06:02.129> worth

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
eBay I think it's um I think it's worth

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.339 
eBay I think it's um I think it's worth
while<00:06:02.550> hanging<00:06:02.849> on<00:06:02.969> to<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:03.810> it's<00:06:03.960> definitely

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
while hanging on to and it's definitely

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.140 
while hanging on to and it's definitely
a<00:06:04.530> worthwhile<00:06:04.710> replacement<00:06:05.520> for<00:06:05.699> the<00:06:05.789> UM<00:06:05.969> for

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
a worthwhile replacement for the UM for

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.390 
a worthwhile replacement for the UM for
the<00:06:06.719> legend<00:06:07.080> which<00:06:07.259> is<00:06:07.440> which<00:06:08.039> has<00:06:08.190> got<00:06:08.370> a
