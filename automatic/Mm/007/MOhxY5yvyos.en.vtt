00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.170
 the 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.089
 Hello Goodnight 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.389
 here we are again ready to analyze 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.910
 those things that the owners of commercial media 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.659
 they do not want to 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.800
 we know 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.089
 now it is also clear 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.949
 what is the strategy 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.920
 Of the media 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.220
 they are trying to plant 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.760
 in the minds of people 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.320
 the idea 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.030
 that the country 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.940
 is entering a crisis process 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.450
 frightful terrible 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.970
 that here will happen 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.370
 something like what happened 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370
 in the venezuela of the fourth republic let's say 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.770
 year 89 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.420
 when Carlos Andres PerellÃ³ came to the presidency in unleashed that brutal 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.740
 package of neoliberal measures 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.610
 that put the whole world 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.560
 to sweat cold 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.420
 and in the case of popular sectors 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 made them go hungry 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.719
 that's what they're trying to ep from inder to people 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.130
 falsely 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.880
 and there they were conchaban 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.570
 Abidjan is made 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.480
 newspapers like the national 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.320
 as the universal 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.860
 politiquitos of the opposition these malandros type manuel rosales type julio 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.830
 borges 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.460
 type bouquets allup 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920
 that is to say 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 the scum the political underworld 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.210
 and of course 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.399
 all this obk been 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.670
 from the United States 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.890
 No doubt 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.180
 nike in 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.270
 in the western world 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.230
 such industrialized 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.410
 a crisis is occurring 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.410
 of more than respectable dimensions 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.170
 crisis that started being only financial 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.899
 that is, affecting bank assured 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.459
 per hundred investment banking 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.459
 in brokerage firms and brokerage firms 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.389
 those who handle those who move money 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.259
 but that at this moment is also affecting 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.189
 to the real economy 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.079
 the productive economy 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:29.439
 the factory agriculture trade the non-financial services sector 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:30.879
 all that 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.129
 they are starting to get very bad 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.219
 but very bad 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.959
 what will be the impact of the crisis in the industrialized world 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.799
 it is difficult to foresee what 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.739
 could be 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.359
 a terminal crisis 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.359
 for the neoliberal capitalist system 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.319
 opportunity to be simply 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.169
 a scare 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:01.219
 a scare losses of billions of dollars fuck euro 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.069
 achieve the government 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.469
 recover the economy 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.219
 In our life 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.229
 that capitalism has many resources 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.919
 capitalism learned a lot 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.769
 he has even learned a lot from the crises 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.569
 because the crisis is a reality 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.569
 that always threatens capitalist economies 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.209
 especially when 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.439
 The route of neoliberalism takes the extreme route 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.259
 here we have already seen several crises 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.979
 serious big falls in the bag 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.319
 but the reality 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.159
 is that 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.719
 the governments 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.719
 they have been able to weather the storm 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.439
 now gives the impression that they are also here pearl or 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.089
 and they're going to ride it 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:56.829
 by the method that the neoliberals like the most 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.759
 carrying the full weight of the crisis 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.039
 over the shoulder of the most fearsome 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.419
 the poorer the less favored 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.689
 a person 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.829
 in that industrialized society 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.900
 greater will be the relative burden that you will have to endure 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.910
 that is already clear 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.809
 but of course 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.459
 and then what do they do 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.930
 these bandits 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.940
 that we have in Venezuela as representatives of the politics of the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.319
 U.S 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.779
 things like this 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.270
 a while ago he was showing 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.490
 add 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.460
 Giving and giving 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.990
 this is 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.249
 a supposed 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.249
 passbook or ration card 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:47.180
 and see you 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.029
 who produces it 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.029
 and you see the gesture of the hand 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.969
 when it says vote for a new time 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.909
 by the way since this is electoral propaganda 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.919
 it would be good if the cn 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.409
 will be pronounced around these of muster 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.719
 for example the rector about it 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:08.789
 could perfectly 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:14.050
 p study if this thing is legal and this is placed on the back 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.699
 First 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.249
 the supposed amounts to which a person with that right is entitled to 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:22.620
 rationing 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.290
 and second and this is the most serious thing this is what I should study about it 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.189
 and is that the people of a new adecco those who take 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.309
 they grab an article 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.309
 d percent 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.930
 of security and sovereignty adoro alimentary 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.569
 and they distort what they distort they mutilate 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.899
 and they try to compare it with the opel text the constitutional reform 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.099
 that a lie sovereignty 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.599
 by manuel rosales 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:03.580
 and from other thugs like him but in this specific case of the game a 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.819
 new CD 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.819
 by the way also for the Lord about it days 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.199
 see you 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.979
 advertising 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.499
 what's wrong with it 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.169
 a chain of pharmacies 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.150
 in maracaibo called pharmacies 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.199
 a new time 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.169
 here you have it 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.869
 it's more than a quarter of a page 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.990
 of panorama 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.139
 i is a twenty pharmacy pharmacy chain 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:33.939
 name 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:36.749
 pharmacy a new time 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:38.950
 the wolf or the emblem 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.839
 d the party that signed it peru 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.409
 by the way what about the pharmacy 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.819
 we should remember that in a new time in 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:51.189
 ubuntu new adecco as that party is called 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:52.899
 in a game of adecos 

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.899
 already go with the offspring and worth the redundancy 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.339
 to dress up they invented another name 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:03.979
 because they are ashamed to say that they are adecos 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:06.979
 but you are looking at the rationing book 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.300
