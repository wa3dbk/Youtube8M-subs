00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
gigantic thrusters in the back um he's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
gigantic thrusters in the back um he's
also<00:01:03.420> got<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.949> point<00:01:05.220> him<00:01:05.339> all<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
also got the if you point him all the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.830 
also got the if you point him all the
way<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:07.880> if<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> point<00:01:09.210> him<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> way<00:01:09.659> up

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
way up if you point him all the way up

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.999 
way up if you point him all the way up
and<00:01:10.020> let<00:01:10.140> him<00:01:10.260> rest<00:01:11.240> push<00:01:12.240> him<00:01:12.330> down<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> little

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.100 

here's<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> countdown<00:01:17.670> noise<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
here's the countdown noise and the I

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
here's the countdown noise and the I
guess<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:22.320> men<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> Space<00:01:23.340> Flight<00:01:24.180> kind

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.830 
space blaster mode space blaster then
you<00:02:25.680> want<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.430> usually<00:02:27.060> tend<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> crack

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
you want to I usually tend to crack

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.530 
you want to I usually tend to crack
these<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.590> think<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.130> gets<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.390> little<00:02:30.390> bit

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
these I think it gets a little bit

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.449 
these I think it gets a little bit
easier<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:30.990> transform<00:02:31.680> them<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.130> do<00:02:32.250> that

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
easier to transform them and do that

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.110 
easier to transform them and do that
then<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:32.940> want<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.380> extend<00:02:34.380> these<00:02:34.620> pieces

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
then you want to extend these pieces

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.330 
then you want to extend these pieces
then<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.930> can<00:02:37.050> flip<00:02:37.290> these<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.190> if

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
then you can flip these up like that if

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.710 
then you can flip these up like that if
you<00:02:38.459> want<00:02:38.700> or<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:40.190> flip<00:02:41.190> these<00:02:41.720> pieces

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
you want or you can flip these pieces

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.979 
you want or you can flip these pieces
down<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.500> fly<00:02:46.830> using<00:02:47.130> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
down like that so you can fly using the

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.370 
down like that so you can fly using the
thrusters<00:02:50.570> then<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.660> want<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.110> little

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
thrusters then you want to the little

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.150 
thrusters then you want to the little

you can push down that button again now

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.249 
you can push down that button again now
fire<00:04:42.530> or<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.849> can<00:04:44.090> if<00:04:44.629> you<00:04:44.780> want<00:04:47.139> put<00:04:48.139> them

fire or you can if you want put them
together<00:04:48.699> put<00:04:49.699> on<00:04:49.819> Minicon<00:04:50.389> on<00:04:50.539> that<00:04:50.659> peg

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
together put on Minicon on that peg

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.939 
together put on Minicon on that peg
there<00:04:51.199> I<00:04:51.409> usually<00:04:52.400> team<00:04:52.819> them<00:04:53.000> up<00:04:53.120> with<00:04:53.360> the

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
there I usually team them up with the

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.510 
there I usually team them up with the
sonar<00:04:54.949> I<00:04:55.750> think<00:04:56.750> I<00:04:57.020> think<00:04:57.620> they<00:04:57.800> work<00:04:58.099> together

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
sonar I think I think they work together

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.219 
sonar I think I think they work together
best<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.210> be<00:04:59.330> honest<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.750> think<00:04:59.810> they've<00:05:00.050> got

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
best to be honest I think they've got

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.959 
best to be honest I think they've got
similar<00:05:00.680> enough<00:05:00.949> all<00:05:01.190> modes<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.729> where<00:05:01.849> they

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
similar enough all modes to where they

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.719 
similar enough all modes to where they
kind<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.240> work<00:05:02.419> together<00:05:02.830> but<00:05:03.830> anyway<00:05:04.219> if<00:05:04.520> you

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
kind of work together but anyway if you

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.730 
kind of work together but anyway if you
press<00:05:05.030> down<00:05:05.060> now<00:05:05.659> with<00:05:05.719> the<00:05:05.930> mini<00:05:06.110> compact<00:05:06.590> on

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
press down now with the mini compact on

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.770 
press down now with the mini compact on
I<00:05:07.659> think<00:05:08.659> make<00:05:09.139> kind<00:05:09.349> of<00:05:09.409> a<00:05:10.210> recoil<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.569> then

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
I think make kind of a recoil and then

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.459 
I think make kind of a recoil and then
firing<00:05:12.229> noise<00:05:13.060> it's<00:05:14.060> got<00:05:14.240> cool<00:05:14.680> I'm<00:05:15.680> also<00:05:17.469> also

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:18.469 
firing noise it's got cool I'm also also

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:21.969 
firing noise it's got cool I'm also also
