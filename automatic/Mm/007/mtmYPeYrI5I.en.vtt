 New Year's apartment again many many 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.300
 good tips and first place 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.219
 This is usually the good thing 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.559
 lose weight by losing body fat 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.000
 to be exact and already the search goes 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.160
 go after diets 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 diet according to plans 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.529
 instructions on how best to lose weight 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.769
 can 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.630
 and many people are up right now 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.010
 looking for and still looking for and are 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 she is not sure if back a diet 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.420
 because you hear that so often 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.820
 diet are not healthy and in the end only 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 lead to even more body weight and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.399
 for exactly that I have this video 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.129
 made because it is not about it 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.950
 definitely a very special one 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 diet concept to imagine but 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 to sum up in general with 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.640
 several videos on how to lose weight easily 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 Can be like the underlying principle 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.020
 It does not matter if you are vegetarian 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.570
 or would like to feed vegan or otherwise 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 the hormonal connections in the body 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.870
 are always the same and you have to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.879
 observe certain principles 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 there will also be a so-called the eta 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 emerge the stone age diet 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 or palio diet has but with the concept 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.619
 Diet only by the most original 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.600
 Common diet comes from the Greek 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.070
 original means living it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.110
 Basically, that's what it's all about 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 his diet his entire 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 to change the way of life 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.869
 but not just for a few weeks 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.060
 for the bikini figure but lasting 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.880
 are fundamental principles there goes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.200
 it's not about bans or never 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.549
 again to eat as a delicious 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.710
 it starts with what is the palaeo 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.689
 diet as describe the just mentioned 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.100
 stone age nutrition what you are in front of 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.659
 all she is not that she me 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.380
 a firm corset is but rather a 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.500
 concept to get closer to her 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.880
 which suits you best 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 mostly it has something to do with it like me 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.790
 at the same time the next video hangs in 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.920
 the calorie counting together that is one 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.110
 a widespread misunderstanding 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.150
 widespread opinion that one 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.070
 solely by calorie counting and by 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.360
 a correct calorie balance decrease 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.729
 or just to take 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.130
 this is more accurate in this video 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.869
 explained and then of course one is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.000
 The next big step is always the sport 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.140
 what kind of sports do sport do 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.440
 I'm going to lose weight 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.060
 also for that i have your video and 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.760
 even two more videos now 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.040
 here and here come with felix klinger 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.959
 from the author jim the concretely two 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.220
 Exercises show everyone at any time 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.690
 you can not do it at home 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.500
 fitness center you do not have to go much 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.480
 spend money 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.390
 You can do it all the time too 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.280
 go on with the house 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.310
 first kink that may occur 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.840
 I can stand that again 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.799
 temptation what am I doing if there right now 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.450
 what lies ahead, I actually know 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.980
 should know I hear knows 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.380
 that 's not supposed to eat 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.000
 and yet it depends says is me 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.510
 is me and I like so much what should 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.350
 I do 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.569
 this video is intended for this purpose 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.850
 relatively fresh video a video about it 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.220
 how insulin works and that explains 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.840
 how and why sugar makes you fat and 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.829
 why sugar is such a problem for the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.470
 body and why not too much 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.940
 sugar should be eating here exactly 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.890
 Also explains a video that is a hormone 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.440
 This explains how this explains 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.670
 leptin works very important leppin 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.040
 is a very important saturation 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.459
 hormones that can cause you 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.170
 increases without wanting to do it 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.769
 by wrong diet 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.540
 confuses and is in the body 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.430
 signals that he has to eat more 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.609
 although that would not have to be everything 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.410
 explained here specifically for children 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.200
 but also valid for adults 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.970
 these two videos are about it 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.190
 Again, what I mentioned earlier 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.870
 had no sugar to eat 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.600
 preferably not sugared 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.790
 drinks nothing where liquid form sugar 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.280
 is included 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.959
 because these are virtually empty calories 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.250
 sometimes not even things are 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.840
 just a drink and with this 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.180
 trend comes a lot of sugar rows 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.709
 again a memory reaction a bold 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.230
 are triggered that one would like yes 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.910
 mostly not and the second video there 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.310
 now that's the main point 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.380
 really a children just 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.910
 that you should feed yourself constantly 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.050
 that you do not constantly offer food 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.800
 should not be constantly everywhere 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.520
 is a sufficient one because what is that 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.430
 main problem 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.900
 it is perhaps from boredom, the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.160
 eating is about to called eight 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.350
 I'm still a bit more 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.680
 a bit more useful would be longer 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.889
 times between nothing to eat 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.360
 and really successful 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.030
 You have to do it every day 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.380
 day in everyday life can apply 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.210
 nothing if only on the weekend 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.030
 can do since I'm only has the time 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.650
 to cook it yourself but it has to 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.940
 that really works too 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.260
 not just for two weeks because you look 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.110
 then tearing together really needs that 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.000
 always work and for this is this 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.470
 video made 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.139
 that just explains how to do all this 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.850
 Aspects that had called before in the 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.440
 everyday life can implement the whole thing 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.990
 truly successful push to 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.190
 really reach his goal 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.320
 that maybe still on the verge as 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.180
 separate information just for this 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.150
 video the most important thing is that you look 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.190
 sets a goal and that one is 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.900
 makes clear that the goal is that the 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.090
 the motivation is not clear 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.039
 why do I want that at all exactly 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.000
 I want and then you can do it slowly 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.479
 work towards it 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.620
 completely without feeling guilty without 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.820
 bootcamp mentality when people are in 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.229
 the butt occurs or in the 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.840
 butt and so on 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:23.580
 ultimately it's about your own wishes 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.300
 around your own goals and exactly that applies 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.860
 to realize it 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.180
 You can do it successfully for that 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.860
 these same videos but there is also 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.169
 a separate playlist she would need here 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.940
 somewhere to give this video one 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.400
 playlist means to lose weight 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.270
 There are over 20 videos to this 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.300
 subject who run experience new things 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.310
 would like to talk about these topics or about one 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.470
 new recipes or book tips can 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.370
 up here or down here I know I 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.650
 where youtube meanwhile 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.240
 has subscribed to subscribe 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.220
 then comes once a week an e 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.250
 mail with a message taste 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.680
 has uploaded a new video you can 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.169
 also unsubscribe anytime there 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.820
 will not be locked and you have to 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.919
 do not pay anything for it because everything 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.010
 free 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.689
 Have fun so much success and good 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.219
 appetite 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:12.459
 then watch and see you next 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:12.459
 times
