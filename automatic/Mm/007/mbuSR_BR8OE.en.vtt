it up on the site and one more thing end

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.990 
it up on the site and one more thing end
grain<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.320> n<00:01:13.590> grain<00:01:13.860> blocks<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
grain if you have n grain blocks and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
grain if you have n grain blocks and
grains<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.570> same<00:01:15.810> deal<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.470> only<00:01:16.710> difference

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
grains the same deal the only difference

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.800 
grains the same deal the only difference
really<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.880> soaks<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:18.720> bit

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
really is that it soaks up a little bit

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.660 
really is that it soaks up a little bit
more<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.740> n<00:01:19.920> grain<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.280> might<00:01:20.430> put<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
more so with n grain you might put a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.130 
more so with n grain you might put a
little<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.740> oil<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.700> cream
