00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.950
 upload 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.170
 we are already here what we have to do 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.739
 is to put the standard type just like me 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.739
 I put it 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.769
 in laps we have to see 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.699
 standard in laps we have to put 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.699
 two laps 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.600
 the way I have it here is worth it 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.330
 current time traffic and levels of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.869
 searches and custom vehicles and 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.270
 to reach is not worth important there we give 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.460
 to staff we will confirm adjustments 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.580
 and we started the race okay we have it 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.630
 What to do is catch the slipstream of the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.100
 partner with which we go to play vale 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.750
 In this case, I started playing with 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.740
 a people that you know they knew too 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.530
 how to do the trick and get pretty 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.000
 experience is worth going out with turbo 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.770
 get quite enough experience 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.680
 in a very short time he has pressed the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.330
 five minutes like that about 20,000 rp me 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 It seems that they are look at her 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.119
 getting experience you see for being 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.640
 behind the others catching the slipstream 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.820
 it's one is a very short circuit plus 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.979
 is the good thing about 28 30 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.039
 seconds we have gone around and look 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.260
 here when you get to the finish line what's going 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.630
 to upload the experience 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.630
 notice that here is the first one behind 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.890
 back there as new round has come up 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.510
 a bar and a half of experience 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.790
 look at the fixed look fixed 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.250
 about 3000 4000 points 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.160
 experience that added to what they give you 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.340
 when you finish the race they will be 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.170
 approximately 5000 to 5000 per 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.670
 30 seconds later after 30 seconds that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.780
 you are in the menu then one minute 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.980
 approximately and you have about 5 thousand 5000 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.290
 Experience points are worth what 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.550
 second, it gives you the same, they give me 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.550
 pretty good score 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.140
 almost four thousand dollars and 1,500 thousand 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.430
 went up more than two bars in a matter of 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.590
 a few minutes 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.390
 now and I go back up you see I was not 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.850
 nor level 48 and there I already have more than one 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.580
 bar 48 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.350
 again it 's a matter of going to go 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.650
 doing racing in this circuit without 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.170
 stop at 2400 of experience very very 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.790
 easy is just going around 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.860
 that even the options that 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.210
 You put in because you're going to get pretty 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.790
 experience but if you put them like me 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.130
 I have told you that you are going to get even more and 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.320
 nothing is to be here a ratillo and sure 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.300
 that you go up from very fast level very 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.480
 fast me in about an hour is 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.640
 went up from level 45 to level 50 in one hour 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.810
 a little less than an hour so 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.340
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.930
