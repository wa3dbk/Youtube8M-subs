00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.349
 today we decided to take to the streets of the city 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.990
 to find out about Almaty people whether they want 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.390

 What do you think you are patriots ? 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.020
 I think yes with age it is especially 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.240
 expresses moves or parents are relatives 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.880
 still in this case connected bryantsev 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:54.450
 because it says otherwise 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:57.060
 Yegorych on any country yes yes why not 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.100

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.530
 get back this one here right on start on 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.110
 permanent residence for permanent residence 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.870

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.510
 and which country to Canada or Korea is not 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.120
 I know the exact roots and why can 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.150
 because here it is not like any 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.960
 there is one possibility in Korea 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.000
 yes in canada 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 economy good would you like 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.600
 when the thread move from Kazakhstan to vargu 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.530
 country to live were of course they also did not 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.540
 I know how to explain 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.509
 Well, that is to move to learn 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.820
 Auto Muradu rather then stay here already 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.290
 stay live in another country no love 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.570
 when you are a patriot 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.580
 well, well, something like this is approximately 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.320
 would like to say when in this 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.060
 Kazakhstan move to another country dinner 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.000
 for why not why not because 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.920
 Kazakhstan is our historical homeland 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.509
 guest is good at home is better but mine 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.390
 historical homeland Germany therefore I 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.159
 I want to move to Germany 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.950
 in other countries of education is better than 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.320
 Kazakhstan but I don't need just but if 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.740
 You better get back here and back to you 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.270
 work and live in Kazakhstan is hard 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.880
 break through just like in other countries yes 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:15.620
 why have a dream since childhood and in what 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.230
 countries have stunned about us with actions that here 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.800
 like you are not a patriot or a patriot no i 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.709
 patriot 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.690
 but I want to return to another country 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.519
 Far naturally such if we 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.590
 working now on this eternal for example 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.330
 something you don't like here 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.920
 I want to go to study 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.530
 somehow not regrettable to recognize but in 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.650
 Kazakhstan, of course, we have the level 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.190
 learning higher limps here and so 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.890
 abroad once 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.780
 want to come live well let's see how 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.760
 I hope I can 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.530
 I will be back and will be in demand here 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.590
 still want to do for my 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.170
 country something worthwhile i'm still here 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:09.110
 born live all my life and how my homeland 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.080
 Yes, from some side to 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.540
 Yes, I, too, such thoughts were principle 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.970
 go somewhere abroad to the districts 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.920
 usa or canada there get higher 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.260
 education to come back here to 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.350
 achieve something more than ours 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.410
 Kazakhstani education because in 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.610
 our in our state as a rule 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.670
 education really staggers and impossible 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.520
 achieve what you want to say in 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.680
 where would you like when not to move 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.180
 from constant country on understand only 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.430
 if learn when you move no say 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.379
 you will demand start 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.760
 Well, in a sense, maybe yes, a patriot 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.720
 tell me here is how your patriotism 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.090
 show but maybe there 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.700
 I do not know friends there to speak 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.090
 holiday go to the new square this 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.000
 considered 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.360
 I read the conclusion next to you 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.849
 Well, how would I be proud of Kazakhstan and this 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.459
 the main thing is probably I consider myself 3 to 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:20.150
 like for example in america there more all 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.460
 advanced possibly more 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.210
 and what is more opportunity for example 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.440
 in different fields of trees I 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.470
 want 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.460
 I like St. Kazakhstan 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.400
 patriot 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.810
 yes three but go on a visit there 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.199
 look would not refuse not here 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.199
 why 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:50.230
 but the standard of living is not good at everything 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.480
 which country would like to move 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.660
 eg 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.120
 please tell me in europe you moved 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.820
 from kazakhstan to another country no you 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.620
 patriot yes i'm a patriot i don't like how 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.750
 raise for example the youth of children in 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.050
 other countries and i like how 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.140
 educate people here as you 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.830
 patriotism manifests itself you inspire children 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.740
 is it with you 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.870
 or somehow well firstly I am a teacher I 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.400
 psychologist by profession I 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.320
 I work therefore we have education 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.660
 patriotism is both a duty and 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.230
 vocation so it is practically 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.050
 constantly going to have what you 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.430
 love country patriot of course and how are you 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.430
 show your patriotism 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.200
 as 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.330
 temporary more 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.069
 sugar 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.830
 something that I love my country and gurza not 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.199
 Hello you really jump the name 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.330
 water in a very pleasant manner say 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.569
 please would you like to move from 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.849
 Kazakhstan to another country live only 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.400
 for one simple reason that practically 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:57.770
 at one o'clock already lived here and the meaning 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.090
 losing friends and acquaintances home right 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.969
 right but in your heart you are a patriot or 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.159
 still for earlier visited thoughts or 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:09.259
 application to know and not that maybe they 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:12.840
 swam in my head yes well in general then no i 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:15.240
 I live here for a long time and do not want to change even 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.810
 stop Almaty I do not want to modern 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.810
 Almaty 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:22.020
 he will take children somehow because 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:26.360
 that they are no longer you know again 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.360
 it's all honest but probably 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.800
 I do not know it is bad for no sense can 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.020
 be right for me probably track 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.270
 bad such a question no offense to you 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.160
 why only for one simple reason 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:46.360
 what we've got so that one 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.490
 take German another French means these 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:53.470
 what did you go to the Nazis 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:56.260
 these Frenchman left last to study at 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.140
 omsk medakademii so me for example is very 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.000
 sagre like parents yes there grandfathers there 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.220
 great-grandfathers it would probably be good that 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.880
 all the same these were nevertheless near because 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.310
 what do you understand this distance 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.320
 distance she kinship 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.820
 breaks completely we interviewed several 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.250
 passersby 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.410
 as it turned out the main reason for the desire 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.900
 moving out of the country is weak 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.610
 education in kazakhstan 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.750
 it was Latina Satarova and the program 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.750
 there is a contact
