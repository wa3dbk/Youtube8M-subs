00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
can even shoot out helicopters as you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.229 
can even shoot out helicopters as you
can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:43.460> so<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.700> does<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.059> works

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
can see here so what it does it works

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.110 
can see here so what it does it works
much<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.020> flam<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:47.550> aim<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
much like the so flam and you aim the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.869 
much like the so flam and you aim the
laser<00:00:48.289> designator<00:00:49.289> at<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> target<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.520> here

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.590 

he<00:00:53.879> gets<00:00:54.090> his<00:00:54.239> cannon<00:00:54.570> box<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600 

and<00:00:58.560> then<00:00:58.770> he<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.100> launched<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> heat

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
and then he just launched the heat

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:11.310 
and then he just launched the heat
seeker<00:00:59.790> and<00:01:00.030> finally<00:01:00.960> heavy<00:01:04.370> and<00:01:05.370> again

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.630 

it's<00:01:12.320> extremely<00:01:12.710> useful<00:01:12.950> for<00:01:13.130> taking<00:01:13.340> our

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
it's extremely useful for taking our

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.000 
it's extremely useful for taking our
attack<00:01:14.210> helicopters<00:01:14.870> is<00:01:15.260> often<00:01:15.590> they'll<00:01:15.740> fly

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
attack helicopters is often they'll fly

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.370 
attack helicopters is often they'll fly
too<00:01:16.460> high<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.630> main<00:01:17.810> cannon<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.200> be<00:01:18.290> able

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
too high for the main cannon to be able

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.600 
too high for the main cannon to be able
to<00:01:18.500> shoot<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.130> one<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.460> better

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
to shoot so this is one of the better

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:30.490 
to shoot so this is one of the better
ways<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:20.000> taking<00:01:20.360> them<00:01:20.479> out<00:01:28.810> needed<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.020> target

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
ways of taking them out needed to target

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.590 
ways of taking them out needed to target

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.430 
then sometimes it seems to miss I'm not
sure<00:03:32.300> ever<00:03:32.480> not<00:03:32.600> that's<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.840> glitch<00:03:33.050> or<00:03:33.290> it's

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
sure ever not that's a glitch or it's

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.590 
sure ever not that's a glitch or it's
supposed<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.770> be<00:03:33.890> like<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.280> but<00:03:34.600> often

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
supposed to be like that but often

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
supposed to be like that but often
you'll<00:03:35.780> get<00:03:35.930> times<00:03:36.290> where<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:38.500> seems<00:03:39.500> to

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
you'll get times where it just seems to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:58.009 
you'll get times where it just seems to
hit<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:39.920> ground<00:03:40.160> below<00:03:40.550> them

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.539 

gives<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.260> big<00:03:59.439> range<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.829> answers<00:04:00.069> as<00:04:00.370> well

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
gives you a big range of answers as well

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.220 
gives you a big range of answers as well
as<00:04:00.609> you<00:04:00.939> can<00:04:01.060> lock<00:04:01.209> on<00:04:01.359> something<00:04:01.689> I<00:04:01.930> think

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
as you can lock on something I think

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.830 
as you can lock on something I think
it's<00:04:02.379> about<00:04:02.560> 2,000<00:04:03.189> meters<00:04:03.280> command<00:04:03.879> and<00:04:04.540> a

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
it's about 2,000 meters command and a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:18.120 
it's about 2,000 meters command and a
thousand<00:04:05.260> meters<00:04:05.620> fall<00:04:05.920> for<00:04:06.640> air<00:04:06.849> targets

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.410 

I<00:04:22.380> can<00:04:23.380> even<00:04:23.470> switch<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.040> main<00:04:24.220> gun<00:04:24.420> and

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
I can even switch to the main gun and

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.030 
I can even switch to the main gun and
then<00:04:25.840> back<00:04:26.020> again<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.980> do<00:04:27.100> of<00:04:27.190> infantry<00:04:29.010> well<00:04:30.010> I

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
then back again to do of infantry well I

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.560 
then back again to do of infantry well I
