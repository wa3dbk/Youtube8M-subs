 per cent we will install a warning when using 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.079
 the oracle 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.299
 virtualbox ovi store or vox mostly known 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.569
 it was the first time 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.050
 open the program logically 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.580
 here I go I had created 1 but I deleted it for that perez as well as thousands 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:30.890
 of civilians 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.740
 and then it is created we are going to 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.210
 is that the main page captures that stretch 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.120
 let's see the next 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.820
 let's place a man 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.930
 in this case yesterday 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.239
 the next girl the memory 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.100
 which 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.460
 today they discuss choosing 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.460
 behind 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 here in the wind aft télam this operating windows 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
 in this case it will be very intense and hamburg 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.260
 is not a zero sites the windows name will be deposited the next as 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.800
 I would take off Dec 12 the recommended of promoter your mind 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.270
 recommends a memory 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.720
 posed the next 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.380
 we are going to create a virtual hard disk so you see it as we discussed the following 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.420
 choose event 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.180
 to the disc format 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.190
 anyone 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.520
 who confrontation but we said the beginning 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.560
 how to recommend bosé is very dynamic 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 the size of parakeets make 35 years 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.710
 let's give it next 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 create 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.490
 now what you should say is this closes the program 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.330
 good to mix it of the conflict sierra 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.530
 now that we still keep going 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.340
 ap home team vico c users 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.330
 in this case the mentioned plan 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.610
 the educators and painted the box 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.520
 and that folder that was created 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.160
 that is always operational 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.230
 use it 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.960
 cut 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.920
 Now I'm going to take a place where I have 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.920
 much later 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.260
 in this case it is all 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.449
 I have here one that thickens ual 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.069
 I'm going to fight here 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.589
 how can you notice here I have everything 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.589
 already and on disk 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.279
 they have not the c disk because it has returned 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.519
 It could be that there is no virus 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.040
 another school system citigroup reported that the disk was found with that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.629
 we had a job 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.849
 important as it was placed in the 13th 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.709
 and formatting we will regain your attention or action but we are going to 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.549
 erase unless they alan the process of entering as your operating system thing 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.419
 that if they do not know better not to risk 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.819
 Ok, now yes 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.789
 the only Jamaican we are going to do is good double click 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.659
 to and as usual 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.659
 We do not handle practical double glazing 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:13.129
 accept here what I am going to do this delete it if favre to close 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.309
 already received this hybrid engine 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.569
 because it happened this horror time it gets to happen 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.589
 as it was already assigned in this list an operational site with the same name two 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.839
 soldiers error 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.559
 which if I'm going to have to delete it update the list and reload it 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:30.619
 Very simple 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.619
 hello girl start 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.019
 if done a little full screen 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.369
 the assistant I will cancel not 

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:45.369
 ready 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.769
 we have our 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.139
 our virtual pc created perfectly 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.539
 now all we need is to change an operating system 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.659
 the story 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.599
 let's do it right now
