this<00:01:53.009> game<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.280> think<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.000> an

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
this game I think you can make an

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
this game I think you can make an
argument<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.689> both<00:01:54.990> sides<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.470> i<00:01:55.590> settled<00:01:56.040> on

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
argument for both sides but i settled on

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.609 
argument for both sides but i settled on
backing<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> arizona<00:01:57.600> state<00:01:57.869> sun<00:01:57.899> devils<00:01:58.140> as

backing the arizona state sun devils as

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260 
backing the arizona state sun devils as
three-point<00:01:59.280> home<00:01:59.460> favorites<00:01:59.909> given<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
three-point home favorites given the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.060 
three-point home favorites given the
fact<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:00.810> ranked<00:02:01.049> seventh<00:02:01.500> nationally

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
fact that they ranked seventh nationally

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.190

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.719 
sixteenth and turnover margin those are
two<00:02:06.899> categories<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> team<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:08.459> looking

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
two categories for a team that's looking

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.930 
two categories for a team that's looking
to<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.300> off<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.840> deck<00:02:10.110> as<00:02:10.459> washington<00:02:11.459> that
