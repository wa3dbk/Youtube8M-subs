00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
confusing but I know what I'm doing this

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.950 
confusing but I know what I'm doing this
time<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.650> think<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.270> subject<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
time I think then on the subject of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
time I think then on the subject of
vlogs<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:20.009> considering<00:01:20.820> making

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
vlogs I was actually considering making

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.359 
vlogs I was actually considering making
my<00:01:21.509> own<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:22.470> channel<00:01:22.830> because<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
my own little channel because I

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.910 
my own little channel because I
really<00:01:23.970> want<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.240> keep<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.869> vlogs<00:01:25.170> sort<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
really want to keep the vlogs sort of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560 
really want to keep the vlogs sort of
like<00:01:26.070> pet-related<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.090> channel<00:01:27.330> because

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
like pet-related on this channel because

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.370 
like pet-related on this channel because
this<00:01:27.930> channel<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.530> animal-based<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.380> I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
this channel is animal-based and I

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
this channel is animal-based and I
thought<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.250> maybe<00:01:32.400> faster<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.150> own

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
thought that maybe faster on my own

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.080 
thought that maybe faster on my own
login<00:01:33.570> channel<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.100> could<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.610> videos

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
login channel then I could do videos

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
login channel then I could do videos
