00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.200
 it was he who happened to have been there 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.040
 it's not us 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.050
 and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.030
 they logically received 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.190
 they have continental climate 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:35.560
 Atlantic Mediterranean which 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:38.080
 meet on the territory have known 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.520
 adapt my work I am adapted 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.230
 their architecture and their daughter adapt 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.570
 their city where every day and this at 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.740
 over time makes almost five thousand 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.740
 years they knew how to play with that 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.740
 1 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.200
 with the boer children viverge 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.530
 morning at 8:30 has already compared his day 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.530
 in the living room 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 g 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.460
 at 18 already my father entrust me with the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.600
 flock is at 14 I started to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.200
 go with the shepherd 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.710
 I had my flock buddy at 18h forever 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.710
 my purpose 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.710
 in reality agropastoralism is 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.619
 much wider than that since there is 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.880
 both breeders who are created from 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.880
 mans and others who are sedentary 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.700
 the transhumance what is it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.040
 represents for a real it's to his 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.010
 sides do not know what it is this movie is 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.920
 more apt to dubai that's how much thiem 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.920
 60th more 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.030
 on landscapes cleans her of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.619
 scrub it opens paths too 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.900
 low to regulate a little vegetation 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.070
 otherwise we would be blunders and by 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.070
 example here we could not go 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.709
 I have always dreamed of being a farmer 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.140
 it's a child's dream I made 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.180
 studies in sociology in psychology at 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 departure years some times I'm 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.810
 found more than one what I was doing 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.860
 and suddenly I decided to try to 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.860
 to concretize my brother 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.100
 in general when we make images 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.020
 it's all right there 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.940
 always pictures of when everything is going 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.020
 good and nothing and nobody to do any 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.020
 pictures of poles to hurt 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.960
 recently the problems of last lure 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.610
 we had three attacks montceau flock 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.900
 to lie down as one enters the beasts a 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.750
 little more that puts us a little bit more 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.130
 work on the buttons that it risks 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.370
 do not upset our organization 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.920
 work that is decided with 8:00 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.710
 tomorrow to say I blame what do we do 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.510
 we do not send the guys upa if they 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.230
 leave them repass the rally in 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.230
 will go with them 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.010
 I believe when we find five minutes 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.010
 that's it 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.120
 and 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.100
 the tarp 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.610
 yes see you for lio line growers 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.610
 and gold
