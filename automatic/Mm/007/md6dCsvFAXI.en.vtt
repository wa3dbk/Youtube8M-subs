options<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.890> well<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.970> found<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.510> using

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
options as well we found that just using

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.690 

and<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.530> can<00:01:15.680> switch<00:01:15.890> which<00:01:16.100> cameras<00:01:16.520> you're

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
and you can switch which cameras you're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.100 
and you can switch which cameras you're
using<00:01:17.920> for<00:01:18.920> instance<00:01:19.750> now<00:01:20.750> you're<00:01:20.960> actually

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
using for instance now you're actually

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.340 
using for instance now you're actually
seeing<00:01:21.560> our<00:01:22.550> video<00:01:22.880> camera<00:01:23.300> here<00:01:23.630> because<00:01:24.200> we

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
seeing our video camera here because we

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.280 
seeing our video camera here because we
switch<00:01:24.620> to<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.860> front<00:01:25.070> facing<00:01:25.460> camera

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.850 

let's<00:01:32.920> switch<00:01:33.100> back<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.580> original<00:01:33.970> one

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.880 

there's<00:01:37.700> also<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:38.000> self-timer<00:01:38.480> option<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.710> go

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
there's also a self-timer option and go

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.700 
there's also a self-timer option and go
two<00:01:39.950> or<00:01:40.130> ten<00:01:40.430> seconds<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.440> there's<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.500> couple
