obviously<00:04:28.030> here<00:04:28.570> in<00:04:28.690> Finland<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.250> that's<00:04:30.250> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
obviously here in Finland and that's the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.840 
obviously here in Finland and that's the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
use electricity to cool them down so

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.820 
use electricity to cool them down so
basically<00:04:36.520> we<00:04:36.699> save<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.389> lot<00:04:37.750> electricity<00:04:38.560> in

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
cities who have this assessment they

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.950 
cities who have this assessment they
should<00:05:21.250> definitely<00:05:21.430> do<00:05:21.849> that<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.479> use<00:05:22.659> all

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
should definitely do that the use all

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.600 
should definitely do that the use all
the<00:05:23.110> excess<00:05:23.380> heat<00:05:23.590> if<00:05:23.889> they<00:05:24.070> don't<00:05:24.280> do<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.400> they

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
the excess heat if they don't do it they

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.570 
the excess heat if they don't do it they
should<00:05:24.820> do<00:05:24.970> it<00:05:25.080> I'd<00:05:26.080> be<00:05:26.500> an<00:05:26.590> industrial<00:05:27.310> bits
