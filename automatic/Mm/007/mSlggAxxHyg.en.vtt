00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 good time of the day with you 6 0 and we 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.550
 do here by 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.410
 no pms one we do here by r in 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.769
 stage and artillery eighth level 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.360
 German you are good artillery 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.410
 damage ratio 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.640
 the accuracy is also here there are downsides in that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.260
 it is slow in all aspects 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.800
 heavy artillery want literally 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.109
 unless it can be thrown off a cliff 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.780
 Mouse on dusty E100 to anybody buckle 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.770
 kill will even look like that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.030
 shoot from it because there are 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.700
 splash and for 2017 I already had once 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.420
 per unit 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.449
 it's very sad okay let's go 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.530
 map westfield start exploring stage like 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.039
 corrected our five plants from ours 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.170
 each of our well balanced and 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.600
 start by entering number one on this error 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.210
 0 0 to pi I crawl on 8 if on both 455 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.090
 the ninth palace is from 5 st1 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:19.619
 platoon lm m x 13 90 artillery objects 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:24.119
 weighs 12 and a platoon of top of you're almost there 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.619
 he is 25 tons platoon rivals top 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.100
 tt platoon 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.710
 we have it and sit and it happened 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.820
 the radio operator is 26 authors hibachi is strong 25 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.009
 tons also they have and a platoon of a 8 i 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 assets I want to say that this is bad 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.079
 combination as they act in 1 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.720
 category 1 in the bushes one in the field left mx 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.710
 class 90 also want to say bad 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.270
 combination one in the field one roughly speaking 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.810
 suck him begin 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.270
 I occupy a little hill to the left of you 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.179
 see for yourself begin to rise let's 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.870
 slightly accelerate to increase 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:15.849
 efficiency let us replace and 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.890
 so glows on the line d3 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.780
 c2 shone down there right there if 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.410
 when t come down for a very long time to sit like that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.720
 This artillery is very long and therefore 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:36.190
 walks wait here is lit t30 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:39.500
 we make room and now 882 flies in 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:45.019
 You can see the top result 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.519
 it comes down there moved 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.519
 accordingly we are reduced there on 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:53.299
 Just in case, no matter how useful and 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:57.410
 recession teller boil down here pimp 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:01.130
 copper is charging t 30 says it will finish 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:06.220
 he makes a volley meme here i'm charging 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:10.959
 I will finish the parable with him and make a salvo 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.870
 destroy match 30 destroy 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.980
 we are reduced to the same place see 1081 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.209
 street 7 and 729 have a tight is a 7 now 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.030
 let's make a free camera 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.220
 and watch 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.900
 the action of these forests of the seventh isa 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.660
 accordingly st-1 is also here 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.290
 there are 700 484 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.200
 it probably already here kill vaults 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.919
 make the hall a little slow down run 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.340
 of notice 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:50.450
 the projectile flew right into the back housing in 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:54.530
 stern tank tying back camera 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.800
 we are well or maybe roughly speaking is a 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.599
 7 on 729 hepe because we could 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.709
 apply him and, respectively, and 500 and 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:06.650
 600 Well, no, 700 for this you need well 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.470
 aim to make a rear volley 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.780
 tank and therefore destroy them is 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.849
 a 8 I did not have time to catch the mystery of their ears 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.760
 for a very long time I have been making a volley from the seventh 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.639
 all the stuff but he anticipating it 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.150
 goes back as luck would have it 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:27.370
 scold him but thatâ€™s not the point 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.770
 to the boy he starts bending down is a 8 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.300
 finishes isa 7 finishes isa 8 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:40.040
 Well, he did glow Jagdtigr 9 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:48.200
 left good fri-shka here and dare mine 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:53.060
 state co-ordinate and I say filiaev 940 hundred 523 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:56.300
 hp I take on my already 2103 4 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.870
 damage is not considered inviz on t 30 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.080
 whom when he disappeared from the light we 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.880
 move to the bridge 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:11.060
 let's accelerate again here we agree 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.450
 On the pilot I was collecting platoon I 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.970
 I shoot at him now I'm being shot 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:22.820
 but he doesn't understand it I do a volley and 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:26.419
 he at this moment shoots I scare sit down 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.979
 212 slaughter think well kill my sword 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:33.889
 sovzvodny do salvo and he him 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.560
 accordingly kills i understand what it is 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.360
 not mine he already has three frags and I have 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.370
 three frags enjoy saying a game want 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.280
 kill him 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.490
 the young man has time and here and here already patience 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.460
 ends remains they have two ah you 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:54.770
 somewhere here I see the track bring it here 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:58.490
 I think first finish it 90 I can already see 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:03.110
 100 hp shooting the entrance to the very and the shell 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:07.039
 Exactly comes there thanks for the fight and here 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.190
 we rolled the fight one fight on the map to court 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:13.970
 in battle with batchatilyon 155 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:18.110
 for south 83 what can I say about this 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.880
 good cart 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.340
 just because of the ratio of home guy 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.300
 Accuracy is nothing here I see 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.880
 is it if you started want german 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.050
 vundervaflya here such here get ready 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.620
 to sadomasochism 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.479
 it's very hard to see it good 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.110
 artillery is most likely from the left 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:43.400
 punks are the only one catching everything 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.180
 accuracy is speed is damage on 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.349
 your level 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.500
 acceptable tolerable good sound it 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:55.190
 something is a barn which is nowhere 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.740
 past nowhere hide any bush 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:01.400
 will be small so I ride without 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:03.680
 grids because 2gis very often she 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.139
 only works to stand still in 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.240
 within 5 seconds after 5 seconds she 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.440
 turn on not worth it I wanted for skir 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.219
 to compensate for this 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.969
 accordingly as you see i have two 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:20.209
 peak versus here's 206 first or 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:21.669
 let's batch too in this type 

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:25.399
 pumped 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:28.639
 I pumped for often 55 

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:32.439
 gaming stage I am for free experience well 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:38.449
 ride every artillery of each 

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:44.149
 Accordingly, next year will be like 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:47.449
 you understand poachite Leon 155 but it 

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:51.789
 when will it be soon wait 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:51.789
 Thank you for your attention bend random
