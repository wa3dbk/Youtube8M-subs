we've attached all the servo leads to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
we've attached all the servo leads to
the<00:01:19.830> Naza<00:01:20.040> where<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.909> tape<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.659> tape

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the Naza where that tape is it tape

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.840 
the Naza where that tape is it tape
blocks<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.560> light<00:01:22.590> beam<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.369> comes<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
blocks the light beam that comes out the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120 
blocks the light beam that comes out the
receiver<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:24.990> those<00:01:25.140> interference<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
receiver just so those interference the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
receiver just so those interference the
only<00:01:26.460> plug<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.939> that's<00:01:27.119> left<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.930> actual

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
only plug in that's left is the actual

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.920 
only plug in that's left is the actual
GPS<00:01:28.740> compass<00:01:29.220> unit<00:01:29.549> which<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.509> unit

now we're going to move on to install it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.510 
now we're going to move on to install it
at<00:01:35.520> elementary<00:01:36.290> okay<00:01:37.290> guys<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
at elementary okay guys now we know that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
at elementary okay guys now we know that
the<00:01:38.880> telemetry<00:01:39.570> unit<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> spectrum

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the telemetry unit for the spectrum

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
the telemetry unit for the spectrum
sends<00:01:40.829> back<00:01:40.979> your<00:01:41.310> current<00:01:41.850> battery<00:01:42.090> voltage

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
sends back your current battery voltage

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
sends back your current battery voltage
under<00:01:43.200> load<00:01:43.439> which<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.189> nice

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
under load which is really nice

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
under load which is really nice
now<00:01:45.090> how<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.840> into<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.350> telemetry

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
now how we get that into the telemetry

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.460 
now how we get that into the telemetry
unit<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.810> data<00:01:49.110> cable

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
unit is we actually take the data cable

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.490 
unit is we actually take the data cable
and<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.520> solder<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.570> negative<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and we actually solder the negative and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.889 
and we actually solder the negative and
positive<00:01:52.970> accordingly<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.509> those<00:01:54.659> two

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
positive accordingly to those two

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.200 
positive accordingly to those two
locations<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:57.119> we're

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
locations right there and then we're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.700 
locations right there and then we're
going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> use<00:01:57.540> some<00:01:57.780> two<00:01:57.960> sided<00:01:58.229> sticky<00:01:58.380> tape

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
going to use some two sided sticky tape

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.920 
going to use some two sided sticky tape
move<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.280> compas<00:02:00.149> cable<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.719> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
move that compas cable out the way and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.560 
move that compas cable out the way and
it's<00:02:01.079> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> mount<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.570> then

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's going to mount right there and then

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.080 
it's going to mount right there and then
we're<00:02:03.689> gonna<00:02:03.810> take<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.380> cable<00:02:04.860> put<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> small

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
we're gonna take this cable put a small

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.580 
we're gonna take this cable put a small
extension<00:02:06.540> over<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> go

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
extension over it and it's going to go

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.320 
extension over it and it's going to go
to<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.979> data<00:02:08.220> cable<00:02:08.489> there<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:08.940> it'll<00:02:09.060> talk

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
to the data cable there so it'll talk

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.460 
to the data cable there so it'll talk
what<00:02:09.509> they<00:02:09.660> are

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
what they are

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.200 
what they are
so<00:02:10.680> this<00:02:11.010> unit<00:02:11.340> right<00:02:11.370> here<00:02:11.490> will<00:02:11.880> send<00:02:12.180> back

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
so this unit right here will send back

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.740 
so this unit right here will send back
the<00:02:13.080> SC<00:02:13.440> temperature<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:15.210> will<00:02:15.420> send<00:02:15.720> back

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the SC temperature it will send back

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.340 
the SC temperature it will send back
battery<00:02:16.530> voltage<00:02:17.130> temp<00:02:17.460> um<00:02:18.020> voltage<00:02:19.020> as<00:02:19.170> well

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
battery voltage temp um voltage as well

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.870 
battery voltage temp um voltage as well
so<00:02:20.190> it'll<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.460> complete<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:20.940> your<00:02:20.970> own<00:02:21.210> dx8
