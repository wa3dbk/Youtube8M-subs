electromagnetic behavior and that is

the filaments should have a very short

you<00:03:16.560> know<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.890> gravity<00:03:17.609> will<00:03:17.760> always<00:03:18.090> form

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
you know the gravity will always form

you know the gravity will always form

that being true are almost zero so they

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.890 
that being true are almost zero so they
