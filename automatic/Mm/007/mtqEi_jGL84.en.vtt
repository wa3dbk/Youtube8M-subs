 before it took two days to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.140
 making hand 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.280
 the equipment does not loose ground in the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.270
 the right amount sticks and puts the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.940
 5 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.000
 we are in the market segment where 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.940
 highly dependent on skilled labor 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.160
 and one of them the world over face to face 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.260
 and increasingly difficult to find and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.870
 with the use of this machine you can 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.440
 standardize and anyone even without 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.080
 qualification can operate sigh is a 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.810
 good example of machine profitability 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.490
 it's a cheap recipe to do enough 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.500

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.220
 Can you pack a pack of these? 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.490
 actual acts 50 cents 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.920
 a machine the production of confectionery 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.780

 we intend to distribute search 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.550

 businessman denis roberto ramos shows 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.050
 the work that gives the whole process was 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.450
 even handcrafted to use 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.810
 the pudding we put one by one 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.390
 we had to weigh everything 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.040
 individually and goes time and goes time 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.780
 so it takes time we lost 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.970
 to make a recipe such pudding 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.440
 around four 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.930
 hours at 5 o'clock 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.570

 goodbye rocks shells and dosage eye 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.840
 now they program the equipment 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:29.360
 dump the dough on and ready 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.360

 compared to hand-crafted work 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.379
 samarco taken at least this time more 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.689
 ours at the same time and practically with 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.319
 the same clutches per employee open 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.539
 the eyes every seven seconds she enjoys

 a row of four pots 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.729
 in short the candy got faster and 

00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:04.869
 cheaper to produce and the difference 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.779
 in the pocket of the businessmen entrepreneurs 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:09.249
 calculate a reduction in the total cost of 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.979
 10 and 15 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:13.029
 the result is more competitiveness for 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.939
 the company 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:19.059
 now that we have equipment 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:21.369
 We hope to get ahead of you 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:24.249
 market because we will be able to have 

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:26.559
 a greater demand to meet the machine 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:28.719
 opened up the market for companies with 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:31.899
 ease of production entrepreneurs 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:35.169
 They won more customers now produce 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:38.289
 30,000 doses per month for 300 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.269
 restaurants our goal to the end 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.519
 of the year now is to increase around 30% 

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:46.679
 our production and for next year 

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:46.679
 buy other equipment
