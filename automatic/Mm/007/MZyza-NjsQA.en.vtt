present is too high for you to even
trade<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.660> her<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> only<00:00:38.070> solution<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
trade with her so the only solution is

trade with her so the only solution is
the<00:00:39.120> simplest<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.900> go<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:40.800> farm<00:00:41.070> lane

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
the simplest one go for farm lane

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.460 
the simplest one go for farm lane
champions<00:00:42.360> who<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.750> farm<00:00:42.990> from<00:00:43.170> great

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
champions who can farm from great

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.490 
champions who can farm from great
distance<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.220> easy<00:00:44.460> times<00:00:44.790> against<00:00:45.239> scale

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
distance have easy times against scale

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.890 
distance have easy times against scale
so<00:00:46.500> champions<00:00:47.040> like<00:00:47.190> malzahar<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.390> farm<00:00:48.690> from

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
so champions like malzahar can farm from

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.170 
so champions like malzahar can farm from
high<00:00:49.170> distance<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.430> try<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> press<00:00:51.000> her

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
high distance and can try to press her

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.640 
high distance and can try to press her
down<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.780> necessary

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
down if necessary

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.090 
down if necessary
note<00:00:53.580> that<00:00:53.850> kale<00:00:54.270> can't<00:00:54.809> hold<00:00:55.170> herself<00:00:55.860> or

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
note that kale can't hold herself or

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580 
note that kale can't hold herself or
anyone<00:00:56.460> else<00:00:56.760> while<00:00:57.150> being<00:00:57.390> stunned<00:00:57.750> nor<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590

will plant any CC from its target

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.520 
will plant any CC from its target
so<00:01:01.080> malzahar<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.980> use<00:01:02.160> old<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.699> he<00:01:02.850> desires
