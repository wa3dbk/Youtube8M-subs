hey there everyone so we all know
hackers<00:00:05.590> are<00:00:06.009> a<00:00:06.040> huge<00:00:06.430> problem<00:00:07.000> in<00:00:07.149> BTD

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810 
hackers are a huge problem in BTD

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.500 
hackers are a huge problem in BTD
battles<00:00:07.839> now<00:00:08.559> and<00:00:08.860> the<00:00:09.309> amount<00:00:09.610> of<00:00:09.790> hackers<00:00:10.269> in

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
battles now and the amount of hackers in

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.410 
battles now and the amount of hackers in
the<00:00:10.539> game<00:00:10.870> are<00:00:11.170> at<00:00:11.259> an<00:00:11.410> all-time<00:00:11.620> high<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:13.269> it

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
the game are at an all-time high so it

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.629 
the game are at an all-time high so it
isn't<00:00:13.719> surprising<00:00:13.870> that<00:00:14.469> I<00:00:14.620> myself<00:00:15.190> run<00:00:15.370> into

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
isn't surprising that I myself run into

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.690 
isn't surprising that I myself run into
one<00:00:15.910> while<00:00:16.119> playing<00:00:16.480> on<00:00:16.720> my<00:00:16.960> secondary<00:00:17.550> now<00:00:18.550> at

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
one while playing on my secondary now at

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.729 
one while playing on my secondary now at
first<00:00:18.970> this<00:00:19.210> guy<00:00:19.540> didn't<00:00:19.960> look<00:00:20.140> like<00:00:20.200> a<00:00:20.439> hacker

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:20.739 
first this guy didn't look like a hacker

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.190 
first this guy didn't look like a hacker
given<00:00:21.189> his<00:00:21.340> shitty<00:00:21.640> win-loss<00:00:22.180> record<00:00:22.689> but<00:00:23.169> I

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
given his shitty win-loss record but I

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.409 
given his shitty win-loss record but I
guess<00:00:23.529> that<00:00:23.800> can<00:00:24.040> be<00:00:24.189> quite<00:00:24.430> deceiving<00:00:25.059> to<00:00:25.090> say

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
guess that can be quite deceiving to say

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.190 
guess that can be quite deceiving to say
the<00:00:25.630> least

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
the least

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.400 
the least
so<00:00:26.980> yeah<00:00:27.520> with<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:28.000> new<00:00:28.149> update<00:00:28.180> it<00:00:28.960> was<00:00:29.200> made

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
so yeah with the new update it was made

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.260 
so yeah with the new update it was made
a<00:00:29.439> little<00:00:29.829> harder<00:00:30.189> to<00:00:30.340> actually<00:00:30.910> beat<00:00:31.119> the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
a little harder to actually beat the

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.750 
a little harder to actually beat the
hacker<00:00:31.480> now<00:00:31.779> since<00:00:32.559> rounds<00:00:33.040> go<00:00:33.250> by<00:00:33.460> slightly

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
hacker now since rounds go by slightly

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.329 
hacker now since rounds go by slightly
quicker<00:00:34.180> now<00:00:34.690> meaning<00:00:35.440> you<00:00:35.589> don't<00:00:35.800> get<00:00:36.100> as

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:36.339 
quicker now meaning you don't get as

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.790 
quicker now meaning you don't get as
much<00:00:36.640> income<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.390> as<00:00:37.750> such<00:00:38.019> make<00:00:38.289> it<00:00:38.440> harder

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
much income and as such make it harder

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.160 
much income and as such make it harder
to<00:00:38.829> survive<00:00:39.399> their<00:00:39.730> infinite<00:00:40.089> regrow<00:00:40.660> rainbow

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
to survive their infinite regrow rainbow

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.310 
to survive their infinite regrow rainbow
rushes<00:00:41.739> well<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:42.879> doesn't<00:00:43.179> really<00:00:43.690> help<00:00:43.989> here

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
rushes well it doesn't really help here

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.470 
rushes well it doesn't really help here
as<00:00:44.440> well<00:00:44.679> since<00:00:45.010> this<00:00:45.249> account<00:00:45.699> doesn't<00:00:46.269> even

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
as well since this account doesn't even

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.989 
as well since this account doesn't even
have<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:46.809> mortar<00:00:47.199> unlocked<00:00:47.679> and<00:00:48.039> telling<00:00:48.820> by

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:48.999 
have a mortar unlocked and telling by

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.119 
have a mortar unlocked and telling by
the<00:00:49.059> title<00:00:49.570> given<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:50.379> haven't<00:00:50.769> changed

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
the title given that I haven't changed

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.610 
the title given that I haven't changed
it<00:00:51.609> you<00:00:52.030> can<00:00:52.239> already<00:00:52.600> assume<00:00:52.989> I<00:00:53.230> am<00:00:53.260> doomed

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
it you can already assume I am doomed

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.479 
it you can already assume I am doomed
for<00:00:53.920> this<00:00:54.069> game<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.480> yeah<00:00:55.929> we<00:00:56.890> are<00:00:56.920> on<00:00:57.249> water

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
for this game so yeah we are on water

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.419 
for this game so yeah we are on water
hazard<00:00:58.089> which<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.809> fairly<00:00:59.319> easy<00:00:59.499> map<00:00:59.980> but

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
hazard which is a fairly easy map but

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.610 
hazard which is a fairly easy map but
that<00:01:00.670> doesn't<00:01:01.210> mean<00:01:01.420> anything<00:01:02.019> since<00:01:02.289> he<00:01:02.379> can

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
that doesn't mean anything since he can

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.680 
that doesn't mean anything since he can
literally<00:01:03.069> kill<00:01:03.309> me<00:01:03.519> with<00:01:03.670> almost<00:01:03.850> any<00:01:04.330> rush

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
literally kill me with almost any rush

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.590 
literally kill me with almost any rush
later<00:01:04.989> on<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:06.340> doesn't<00:01:06.850> look<00:01:07.090> like<00:01:07.300> he<00:01:07.480> is

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
later on and it doesn't look like he is

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.230 
later on and it doesn't look like he is
showing<00:01:07.900> me<00:01:08.200> any<00:01:08.470> mercy<00:01:08.680> either<00:01:09.010> declining<00:01:09.880> my

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
showing me any mercy either declining my

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.690 
showing me any mercy either declining my
request<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:10.930> go<00:01:11.080> late-game<00:01:11.410> cause<00:01:12.400> usually

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
request to go late-game cause usually

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.480 
request to go late-game cause usually
late-game<00:01:13.330> is<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.050> bane<00:01:14.230> of<00:01:14.410> hackers<00:01:14.830> since

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
late-game is the bane of hackers since

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.520 
late-game is the bane of hackers since
you<00:01:15.700> will<00:01:15.850> have<00:01:16.120> as<00:01:16.270> much<00:01:16.540> money<00:01:16.870> as<00:01:17.110> them<00:01:17.350> and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
you will have as much money as them and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.350 
you will have as much money as them and
at<00:01:17.680> that<00:01:17.890> point<00:01:18.160> it's<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.550> little<00:01:18.820> more<00:01:19.030> fair

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
at that point it's a little more fair

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.620 
at that point it's a little more fair
game<00:01:19.630> however<00:01:20.620> if<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.190> didn't<00:01:21.580> know<00:01:21.820> ninja

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
game however if you didn't know ninja

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.410 
game however if you didn't know ninja
kiwi<00:01:22.810> also<00:01:23.410> made<00:01:23.650> Moab<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.400> PLAs<00:01:24.670> Bloom's<00:01:25.150> a

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
kiwi also made Moab and PLAs Bloom's a

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.960 
kiwi also made Moab and PLAs Bloom's a
lot<00:01:25.630> stronger<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.860> I<00:01:26.890> don't<00:01:27.340> think<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.790> can

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
lot stronger so I don't think you can

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.670 
lot stronger so I don't think you can
survive<00:01:28.210> very<00:01:28.690> long<00:01:28.870> anymore

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
survive very long anymore

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.820 
survive very long anymore
if<00:01:29.950> they<00:01:30.250> plan<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.610> rush<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.330> then<00:01:31.570> so<00:01:32.470> that's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
if they plan to rush you then so that's

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.280 
if they plan to rush you then so that's
that<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.640> win-loss<00:01:34.120> for<00:01:34.480> this<00:01:34.600> account<00:01:34.990> now

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
that the win-loss for this account now

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.650 
that the win-loss for this account now
is<00:01:35.470> pretty<00:01:35.680> shitty<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.340> was<00:01:36.850> hoping<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.330> go

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
is pretty shitty I was hoping to go

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.870 
is pretty shitty I was hoping to go
something<00:01:37.990> along<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.590> lines<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:39.070> 100<00:01:39.760> and

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
something along the lines of 100 and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.510 
something along the lines of 100 and
zero<00:01:40.270> but<00:01:40.870> that's<00:01:41.050> been<00:01:41.380> foiled<00:01:41.680> now<00:01:42.070> because

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
zero but that's been foiled now because

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.820 
zero but that's been foiled now because
of<00:01:42.670> disconnects<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.420> hackers<00:01:44.050> in<00:01:44.320> that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
of disconnects and hackers in that

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.820 
of disconnects and hackers in that
I'm<00:01:45.550> sure<00:01:45.910> if<00:01:46.120> you<00:01:46.270> ask<00:01:46.510> ninja<00:01:47.020> kiwi<00:01:47.200> they<00:01:47.620> will

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
I'm sure if you ask ninja kiwi they will

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.950 
I'm sure if you ask ninja kiwi they will
remove<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.490> hacker<00:01:48.700> losses<00:01:49.330> for<00:01:49.480> you<00:01:49.630> if<00:01:49.780> you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
remove the hacker losses for you if you

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.410 
remove the hacker losses for you if you
show<00:01:50.230> valid<00:01:50.710> proof<00:01:51.040> but<00:01:51.670> Who<00:01:51.790> am<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.120> give<00:01:52.390> a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
show valid proof but Who am I to give a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.530 
show valid proof but Who am I to give a
 about<00:01:52.780> my<00:01:53.260> win-loss<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:53.980> mean<00:01:54.490> just<00:01:55.240> look

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540
