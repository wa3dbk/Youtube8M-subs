00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.099
 good morning everyone is the chef marco 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.929
 echelon today I will present you one 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.210
 rustic gluten-free loaf with the 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.670
 line feeds cold as first 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.030
 ingredient I present to you a mixture 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.379
 without gluten notified with a flour 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.290
 of pure buckwheat 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.820
 then we're going to put some water 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.780
 addition to sugar and yeast 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.640
 to finish with oil and salt 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.610
 very well now we are going to weigh the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.610
 gluten-free mix for bread mix 

00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:06.409
 word bull of glass and I'm going to put 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.530
 400 g of bread mix inside the 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.530
 bull 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:24.399
 at this point I go to add the flour 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.399
 100% pure buckwheat 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.700
 and put it aside 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:40.380
 in the meantime to shorten the time I have 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.380
 already weighed the water which are 380 grams 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.110
 I put 15 grams of quarrel inside 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.110
 water 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:02:00.039
 at this point I take 10 grams of 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:02:02.229
 taro sugar again start a 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.569
 dissolve 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.009
 we have a water temperature of 22 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:10.649
 bar 26 degrees 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.649
 it will help us a lot for the limitation 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:18.340
 now helping even with your hands but 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.090
 helps dissolve others there 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.549
 inside the water and I go to 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.819
 insert it into the bull that I thought 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.819
 before 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.120
 little by little I put the first half e 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.840
 begins to knead the beauty of this 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.959
 mix mixture for bread and that we succeed in 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.299
 knead it as you used to do with 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.269
 bread with gluten 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.950
 today we are instead preparing a bread 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.319
 typically gluten-free with the addition 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.200
 of a pure flour that grain 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:58.060
 Saracen very ancient as a cereal and there 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.920
 it also gives satisfaction to use it 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.200
 because as we will see later 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.359
 we'll even get one out 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.920
 beautiful rustic loaf as well 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.400
 taking some of our origins 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.400
 bread 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.800
 you see I'm going to mix a lot anyway 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.040
 very vigorously with his hands 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.670
 the dough initially seems a lot 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.140
 sticky but as we will see later 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.230
 with the addition of very little flour 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.900
 we can handle it very well it goes by 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.200
 add the oil that I have already weighed 20 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.440
 grams inside then the part 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.959
 fat of our recipe I go to 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:55.500
 weigh our 10 grams of salt in the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.620
 I put everything in our beautiful balance 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.650
 placed in all the add them as you see 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.360
 at the end the salt always at the end for 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.750
 a simple reason why it inhibits the 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.000
 levitation so I always recommend 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.209
 to mix everything well at the beginning 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.010
 so sugar water as you have seen 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.260
 we used sugar because 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.030
 because it helps us so much in the 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.489
 leavening especially in a life of 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.320
 today's life is so hectic too 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.650
 celiac who must therefore eat without 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.380
 gluten the addition of sugar gives us 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.550
 a push also in leavening and then 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.550
 also in fragrance 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.169
 as you can see the fat part helps me 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.780
 even to manipulate it even better 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.450
 the dough, that is, does not give me that 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.510
 sticky initial and to make you 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.000
 see even better than it is beautiful 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.810
 I work on the hand and throw it over here 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.110
 cutting board with a sprinkling of mix for 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:00.419
 bread and I go to work as you see 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.640
 the dough is quite elastic you work 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.350
 very well 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.910
 I'm going to form a ball putting everything 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:12.300
 below so that the oxygen entering 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.100
 enter the lower part of the dough 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.789
 even making a small hole in it 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.870
 small crack lovato to transfer the 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.710
 bully and before 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.730
 famous famous time to see also the 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:31.390
 levitation I put in a clean ball 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.760
 bathe lightly with water on 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.890
 bath hands wrong the dough for 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.650
 moisten it but it will help a lot not 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:43.270
 form crusts on top and close with 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.010
 a film with about an hour 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.240
 and a half 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.240
 we have the dough ready 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.110
 very well spent an hour of 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:06.069
 dough leavening is doubled 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:09.580
 I remove the film I help with the mix 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:11.909
 of flour for bread and in the faces because 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.919
 we have the dough, however moist 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:19.690
 first take a baking sheet with paper from 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:23.440
 oven ready 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:29.080
 the detachment laterally slowly without 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:31.690
 try to break the ebook levitation 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:36.969
 is sitting here above the dough is already 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:40.389
 ready and to give you that sense of 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:46.240
 rustic I go to put some flour 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:49.539
 over with the help of a knife I go 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.930
 to engrave on top slightly to do it 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:55.690
 open and now I throw in the oven at 180 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.469
 degrees and bearded 100 degrees based also 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:01.930
 the oven you have at home for 45 hours 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:04.020
 roughly and then I'll show you the 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.020
 result 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.980
 very well taken out the bread from the oven 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.350
 after his cooking time you see 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.920
 also that sense of rustic that you 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:24.130
 I said before I challenge anyone to say 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.720
 that in any case is not a bread that returns 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.810
 at the origin look also at the veins 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.690
 from the crusts that are going to form with 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.880
 the mix for bread without gluten minute 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:37.510
 refrain now I just want to do 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.420
 see the free one last 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:49.300
 skills that you can feel good with 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:51.600
 the knife and I'll show you too 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.600
 inside
