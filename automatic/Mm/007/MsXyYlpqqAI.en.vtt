00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.000
 this video as you may have heard 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 that was just a review with 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 I'll do this video here 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.340
 Today we show you which mac in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.019
 which equipment you buy 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.280
 should and now we wish you much 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.280
 fun with this video 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.480
 if you are a student you should 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.859
 of course, being mobile and being here 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.810
 the macbook air the first choice 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.189
 Here you could between 11 and 13 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.230
 deciding who does not necessarily 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.670
 Every cent should necessarily turn to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.740
 13 inch model grab 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.300
 This simply more pleasant to write 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.559
 and for surfing you would otherwise I would 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.390
 do not guess the flash memory 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.829
 to upgrade because we really for the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.629
 data you have love on one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.790
 external hard drive should take 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.649
 that's a lot cheaper than that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 Money is not really worth it 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 slightly higher clock frequency at ten 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.320
 minutes of exporting video footage straight 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.700
 a minute faster is when 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.170
 frame looks quite different 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.910
 who graphic or video editing program 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.629
 is used with the eight gigabytes of his 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.789
 have fun 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.410
 But not everyone has to be ultraportable 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.879
 if you have the calculator only sometimes 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.949
 in the middle of the forest and like the ram 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.229
 or want to upgrade the hard drive 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.159
 you with the macbook 13 inch since 15 should 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.869
 better advice 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.700
 In addition, the price is performance 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.770
 ratio very good a great start 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 for students so in the app store itself 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.760
 There are no important upgrades there 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.799
 cpu once again hardly brings more power 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.360
 with the 15 inch model one should note 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.840
 in higher resolution screen too 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.369
 choose 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.049
 now you will not be the best 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.570
 laptop the apple has ever made 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.890
 no we come to the best apps 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.110
 I've ever done anyone 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.420
 the macbook retina that is perfect for 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.070
 every pixel junkie among you and people 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.780
 the mobile videos also cut well 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.790
 Here are the 16 gb ram nice 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.470
 recommended more flash memory is 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 but it does not have to be cool that one 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.250
 external solution in the end cheaper 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.619
 and you have more memory who you want 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.299
 the cpu deadlines I would guess it 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.040
 nevertheless not that does not offer itself 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.320
 You can really improve the money 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.479
 save the 13 inch model is total 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.240
 Therefore, some languages ​​of the graphics are used 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.310
 rather right on the 15th 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.439
 It is really worth the price and off 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.240
 go to the desktops and immediately beforehand 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.920
 with apples cheap calculator but 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.869
 still powerful on it 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.580
 The Mac Mini offers comprehensive eating 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.110
 possibilities like two hard disks and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.820
 up to 16 gb ram 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.440
 who wants to cut videos here with the 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.330
 seven well advised nevertheless it works 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 of course the fusion drive can do better 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.290
 one with some idea even 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.580
 install and a ssd as well as important 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.830
 Please note that you neither 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.290
 keyboard again in the scope of delivery 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.040
 Now we come to the imac apples all in 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.569
 one computer 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.670
 that does not come from somewhere ne in a 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.230
 keyboard mouse and the monitor velvet 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.340
 Integrated calculators are for everyone 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.890
 scope of delivery included 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.100
 You have the choice between 21 5 inches and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.750
 27 inches being the 27er for graphic 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.750
 Applications is great and in contrast 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.390
 can be upgraded to 21 of the frame 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.709
 the fusion drive is currently at mainz 05 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.019
 Definitely a great recommendation 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.540
 therefore slower hard drives installed 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.100
 are as when the 7 20 who cut videos 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.750
 want to equal to the maximum 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.120
 amount frame namely 16 gigabytes 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.900
 upgrade and who wants to gamble 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.290
 that a gt 750 m at the only 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.959
 and at least a gtx 775 m 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.640
 the 27 is installed as a meeting 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.890
 always worth considering but is at 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.750
 the reality in a ten minute clip 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.640
 when exporting only about one to two 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 minutes faster and I do not know if 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.269
 that the extra price 15 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.190
 justifies defend the money spend 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.680
 just want to pay attention is still too important 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.480
 that no dvd drives will report imacs 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.500
 you have to fit in here 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.720
 buy external 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.730
 Now we come to the crème de la crème 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.530
 mac pro only a few among you are allowed 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.880
 but if you have the necessary change 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.180
 It is just a dream 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.489
 pci ssd hex core processor and and and 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.230
 he supports 34 car displays and is 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.090
 the dream of every video producer 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.380
 pakt best purely what's up in the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.090
 contrary to the predecessor no longer 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.590
 upgradeable overall you have to go here 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.100
 But no worries not do what 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.660
 so fast 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.150
 because he is and remains simply a dream 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.470
 Well that's it from us myself 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.030
 Hope we could give you the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.680
 facilitate purchasing decision 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.329
 and if you still have questions leave it 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.220
 us in the comments if you know more 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.389
 watching such videos shows us that 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.959
 but also by a click on like 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.739
 me 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.739
 Until next time
