00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:09.049
 Today is a master to another place It is a video dedicated to paid members like this week On last Saturday 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.810
 I little is talk and the as of about whether the race junior 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:19.320
 There was a course from last week seeing the teeth of a consumer player 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.550
 After talking about Fukushima and Chukyo, I will talk about Hakodate Horse Racing where the course changes from this week. 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.170
 I would like 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.990
 It is a high dividend of First desune players stood 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.760
 It's Saturday 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.180
 3 It is the final race of Hakodate mine on 3 Afuroi that was to the shaft to or that Eddie in two pieces 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.500
 Is it 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.070
 No. 9 by that Nigeki' it is still 40 times the popularity of the disadvantages 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.070
 It was a stormy race and Maren was how much it was 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.830
 Â¥ 7,320 It is a little back, but 19130 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:55.390
 I Dema is this less was a dividend to say that 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:59.050
 Well Hakodate This year Hakodate has been continuing all the time but now 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.320
 The committee also progressed held had been followed by a favorable Baba 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.890
 So make your head a fool 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.400
 Act or doctor 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.890
 It is a demon king who runs away If you must aim at the center, it is opposite 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.619
 Even if it was a popular horse, it was the tendency of the turf of Hakodate Racecourse that it would be severe if you go outside 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.650
 I drew 1 frame 1 by saying 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:23.450
 Yeah That's right cat Three Aphrodite 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.909
 Column is Nema is I preceding can Well No. 9 Toka 2 and # 3 is naturally that was exerts to favorite 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.180
 It was 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:44.160
 Among them is the 11 for 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:46.800
 This sounds good Tianyi Ati is the prima facie I say partner or Oh by say Ei Tsu Wells 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.170
 About 11th, 8th and 11th are 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.820
 Rah 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:56.229
 It is a race that it was decided in this Ito that if it runs away, it will expand Lucca and it will be bitterly escaped 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.070
 Hey yeah maa the child's raise is Otsu but it is the best 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.120
 Did you like the second ? 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:07.820
 Depending on the combination there is also that it was Well No. 2 to go there was a betting ticket, which is not quite stick 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.440
 As always to say, as a reform of Bakken, for example, it is more than the magnification which I decided 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.390
 If it is more than 50 times 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:18.060
 This 18 and 1-2 points in the city are good, and it was 73 times as hard to shop outside the store 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.530
 Furthermore, plus one point that it was somethin are buying Tteyuu 30 times the amount of 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.760
 It means that it will be bought three points, and it was back for a while, but this 191 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.870
 It is a triple child 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:34.020
 Well then how to buy again If you follow your usual policy a little 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.870
 Therefore, someone or machine I recommend books shepherd the way and buy in with one outfit my self, but the times 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.980
 a 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:43.420
 I'm wondering if it would be fine to buy only those with a high rate of this 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.379
 When the Which. If you select the oath Toka are buying only and that always juniors get chance 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.930
 I 'm wondering if this will happen too 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:54.329
 So this is 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:59.370
 It is the story of the players of Hakodate, so this week's fool from this week 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:04.500
 Fukushima has changed from course a to course b last week 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:08.920
 So what happened was the damper last year and it was actually a baba where the outside was growing 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.580
 But this year it will be a little change from a to b 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:18.610
 It is less extreme than the first two weeks of study 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.750
 Just respect to this autumn about than such and is followed by some people dominant state with respect to the Fukushima turf 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.030
 It is also 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.910
 I thought it might be better to aim at the leading horse inner frame 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.610
 Slightly outside and outside also from the opening two weeks 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.960
 Should we keep in mind that it has arrived ? 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:42.360
 The hard part is a little coder and I really don't know this yet 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:45.840
 On Saturday, the extremes were in favor and the runaway horse did not stop 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.800
 Sunday I'm this insert had reached the opposite it is the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:56.950
 So I have become a question mark, but how is this cause to be seen? 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:04:00.670
 The point is that Dart is actually last week and before last week 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.510
 Information that sand was replaced was given to ajr 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.519
 The staff became advantageous by it 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:12.900
 It's Sunday and it changed completely, and now it's time for an outsider to come , I wonder if something happened on that knit day 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:17.820
 One idea is possibly sand put that much in Saturday's horse racing Once you are in the knight is stop the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:22.620
 It might have been caring for a slightly weakened tour by not having or 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.560
 As it was raining and the time was awful for Sunday, it will be delivered under the influence of the rain 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.310
 When it became 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.550
 I can come up with two ways this week 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.690
 It is a place that I do not understand honestly if I do not do selfish little 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:39.010
 Well, so far for transport on Saturday 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:43.520
 With regard to dirt, I think that the objection is to predict in the form of advantage 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.639
 Then the turf in Chukyo is the number of turf in Chukyo, but even if the course changes. 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.680
 It was a width determined flat Baba outside feed 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:55.770
 The dirt is a bit m 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.030
 Lawn bill Baba state that the kana slightly more advantageous of this I'm not that Fukushima turf but because the inner little 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.060
 is 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:08.130
 Hakodate will change the course it is from it in this week's Fukushima Metropolitan Chukyo to this in 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.700
 In it changes to b course, but at the time of Hakodate turf a course from a course is extremely members 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.300
 The left hand Babaa continued 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.950
 I'm going to be honest about what happens with the change to the day course 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.280
 I do not know if there 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:25.750
 As I always say Baba's holding Babaa is the beginning of last year and it will be the most difficult, so last year 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:29.689
 Well, once it leaves, it will be held twice on the Hakata side, and in fact it will be from a course to b course 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:33.949
 It is the time of last year, but I sphere has changed 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:37.369
 It was not that extreme at the time of a course a, but some members were advantageous 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:43.459
 d As soon as I returned to the course, an extreme person came to say 

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:44.089
 I think that because the change in the course strengthened the yen's favorable tendency 

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:49.680
 Is it 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:53.340
 Maybe Hakodate's turf will continue to be favorable this week. 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:57.380
 I do not know if try Well a little run we are wondering Fu that there is a high possibility 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:01.520
 I can not say that absolute but I think the edge is advantageous 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:07.040
 I think that it would be nice if you could see the glory continuing like this 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:10.340
 With regard to the dark, in the form of a flat Baba that extends both inside and out 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.249
 I'm thinking I'm sorry I'm a little this week 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.609
 Bracketed a 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:19.990
 Shiba and the post-Fukushima dirt aren't this right? 

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:24.640
 It means that there is possibly when the possibility of Baba change 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:31.140
 Attention back I think I have to look deeply into the race a 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:31.140
 Because you deliver or video in the form of say Also please look forward to it next week
