00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.630
 this game of fights that are that are very 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.790
 classic in the coffers this game is 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.020
 super balanced has a lot 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.360
 characters to be able 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.120
 choose and besides that they have many 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.980
 modalities which make this a 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.590
 true combat experience in 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.010
 line creating what I tell them what 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.170
 had already approved this with a friend who 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.120
 has distension 3 and the truth is 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.680
 amazing and good here is the first 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.320
 split the truth I was pretty good 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.270
 I started losing a round and did not configure 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.680
 none of the buttons still did not know what 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.780
 buttons be and distribute did not let me 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.460
 try none of the buttons but if you 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.300
 it's going to help get to throw 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.070
 putazos and good gentlemen then we are going to 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.630
 try to make this get pretty 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.700
 well the advantage of this is that you can 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.680
 play up to eight of eight fighters 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.560
 at the same time so we can 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.700
 make championship tournaments events that 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.980
 you want because this modality 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.840
 It has a very fine coin that its strong 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.030
 here until this repetition finishes what 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.370
 let's see that it has a modality 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.380
 very nice tournament where you can 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.630
 organize a tournament and it can be or 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.040
 participant of the tournament organizer of the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.690
 tournament if the tournament organizers 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.150
 the only thing you're going to do is going to be 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.210
 transmit the encounters what the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.910
 It's good enough for everyone 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.530
 then for those who are not then I 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.050
 could also participate and so we can 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.970
 this the joke is to be throwing desmadre 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.380
 as in the mortal kombat that I believe that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.120
 are going to be two of the games that we are going to 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.220
 put obviously and continue as a base 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.470
 mortal kombat gentlemen and super street 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.120
 fighter 4 but this does not end here 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.000
 Now I want you to check what's 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.730
 I comment about what is the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.070
 famous mode tournament has many 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.140
 more modalities this game the truth 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.060
 has for example all the repetitions 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.000
 of many channels as you want 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.430

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.650

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.510
 plays of the best players of 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.730

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.470

 We can play up to eight people at 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.870

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.180
 split and in creating games what 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.410
 we can do is put them 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.750
