you can see the crease lines for poconos

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.530 
you can see the crease lines for poconos
shoes<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.040> start<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.310> those<00:01:08.540> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
shoes will to start with those that

shoes will to start with those that
crease<00:01:09.750> line<00:01:09.990> not<00:01:10.350> only<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.680> where<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.040> is

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
crease line not only is where it is

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
crease line not only is where it is
glued<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.729> generally<00:01:12.150> that's<00:01:12.360> where<00:01:12.720> your

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
glued but generally that's where your

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
glued but generally that's where your
soul<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.260> how<00:01:13.590> high<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.580> actually<00:01:14.970> goes<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:15.299> on

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
soul is how high it actually goes up on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.929 
soul is how high it actually goes up on
the<00:01:15.479> shoe<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.740> thinner<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> sole<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.790> more

the shoe the thinner the sole the more

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.170 
the shoe the thinner the sole the more
flexible<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.509> such<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:20.180> most

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
flexible it is such as this one most

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510 
flexible it is such as this one most
vulcanized<00:01:21.720> shoes<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.189> even

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
vulcanized shoes you can actually even

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.719 
vulcanized shoes you can actually even
bend<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> back<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> where<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.409> stand<00:01:25.729> and

bend the back of it where you stand and
what<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.659> does<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.110> allows<00:01:28.409> for

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
what that does is just allows for

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.880 
what that does is just allows for
greater<00:01:29.400> flexibility<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.590> also<00:01:31.590> allows<00:01:31.890> for

when<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.830> walk<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.250> course<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.830> reason

when you walk of course I the reason

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.040 
when you walk of course I the reason
it's<00:02:34.400> called<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.670> cup<00:02:34.850> soul<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.330> because<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.990> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
it's called a cup soul is because of the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.870 
it's called a cup soul is because of the
fact<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.890> inside<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.520> soul<00:02:37.730> is

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
fact that the inside of the soul is

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.300 
fact that the inside of the soul is
molded<00:02:38.420> more<00:02:38.900> like<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.080> cup<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.740> fit<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.160> ball

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
molded more like a cup to fit the ball

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.040 
molded more like a cup to fit the ball
or<00:02:40.430> heal<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> lot<00:02:40.880> better<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.660> when<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.870> were<00:02:41.930> to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
or heal a lot better so when you were to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.400 
or heal a lot better so when you were to
stand<00:02:42.940> your<00:02:43.940> heel<00:02:44.240> actually<00:02:44.600> fits<00:02:44.840> really

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
stand your heel actually fits really

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.490 
stand your heel actually fits really
nice<00:02:45.710> and<00:02:45.890> snug<00:02:46.130> inside<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.790> stays<00:02:47.030> secure

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
nice and snug inside and stays secure

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.630 
nice and snug inside and stays secure
while<00:02:48.500> you're<00:02:48.650> walking<00:02:48.830> around<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.340> skating

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
while you're walking around and skating

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.800 
while you're walking around and skating
I<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.860> great<00:02:52.730> thing<00:02:52.970> about<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.480> it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
I the great thing about this is it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.360 
I the great thing about this is it
provides<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.410> lot<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.860> foot<00:02:55.040> protection

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
provides a lot of foot protection

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.580 
provides a lot of foot protection
because<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.940> is<00:02:56.060> generally<00:02:56.270> thicker<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:57.080> what

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
because it is generally thicker and what

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.230 
because it is generally thicker and what
that<00:02:57.770> means<00:02:57.980> also<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.490> it's<00:02:58.700> not<00:02:59.000> quite

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
that means also is it's not quite

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.940 
that means also is it's not quite
flexible<00:02:59.450> so<00:02:59.990> you<00:03:00.050> will<00:03:00.410> have<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.709> break<00:03:00.830> these

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
flexible so you will have to break these

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.750 
flexible so you will have to break these
in<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.190> little<00:03:01.430> bit<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.870> advantage<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:04.550> not

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
in a little bit the advantage is it not

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.449 
in a little bit the advantage is it not
only<00:03:04.820> provides<00:03:05.030> good<00:03:05.630> foot<00:03:06.380> protection<00:03:06.680> but

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
only provides good foot protection but

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.730 
only provides good foot protection but
also<00:03:07.490> is<00:03:08.090> going<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.140> last<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.500> lot<00:03:09.650> longer

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
also is going to last you a lot longer

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.170 
also is going to last you a lot longer
than<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.040> Vulcan<00:03:10.280> issue<00:03:10.520> is<00:03:10.640> because<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.120> is

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
than a Vulcan issue is because it is

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.510 
than a Vulcan issue is because it is
thicker<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:12.230> disadvantage<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.310> being

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
thicker the disadvantage of it being

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.110 
thicker the disadvantage of it being
that<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.770> thicker<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.850> won't<00:03:17.000> be<00:03:17.060> able

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
that it is thicker so you won't be able

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.520 
that it is thicker so you won't be able
to<00:03:17.239> feel<00:03:17.480> your<00:03:17.780> board<00:03:18.019> quite<00:03:18.290> as<00:03:18.410> well

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
to feel your board quite as well

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.080 
to feel your board quite as well
especially<00:03:18.769> if<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.310> wanted<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.610> skate<00:03:19.820> up<00:03:19.910> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
especially if you wanted to skate up the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.740 
especially if you wanted to skate up the
second<00:03:20.480> day<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.810> bought<00:03:21.050> them<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:22.750> again

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
second day that you bought them so again

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.090 
second day that you bought them so again
takes<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.200> little<00:03:24.320> bit<00:03:24.440> longer<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.739> break<00:03:24.890> in

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
takes a little bit longer to break in

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.040 
takes a little bit longer to break in
and<00:03:25.340> they're<00:03:25.970> generally<00:03:26.269> capsules<00:03:26.840> are<00:03:27.019> a

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
and they're generally capsules are a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.570 
and they're generally capsules are a
little<00:03:27.320> bit<00:03:27.530> more<00:03:27.650> expensive<00:03:27.860> than<00:03:28.130> vulcanize

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
little bit more expensive than vulcanize

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.630 
little bit more expensive than vulcanize
shoes<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.900> definitely<00:03:30.080> remember<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:30.769> when

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
shoes so definitely remember that when

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.400 
shoes so definitely remember that when
you're<00:03:31.700> skating<00:03:31.970> one<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:32.989> ways<00:03:33.110> you<00:03:33.260> can

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
you're skating one of the ways you can

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.460 
you're skating one of the ways you can
tell<00:03:33.650> which<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.430> which<00:03:34.720> capsule<00:03:35.720> shoes<00:03:35.959> have

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
tell which is which capsule shoes have

over the line so it's going to help keep
it<00:04:34.580> intact<00:04:34.819> better<00:04:35.439> and<00:04:36.439> that's<00:04:36.800> pretty<00:04:37.009> much
