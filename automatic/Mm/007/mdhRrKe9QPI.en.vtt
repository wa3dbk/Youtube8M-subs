00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.120
 duty ghost on pc so here we will do 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.400
 some is even sure world 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.650
 and there is the weekend double xp I 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
 think I believe yeah well I'm telling you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 just that this pc is harder than on 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.680
 ps3 for them before I was a player of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.529
 ps3 now i want more to pc but 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.070
 I body at ps3 it's not the same at the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.369
 precision that will be difficult what because 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.469
 that there are joysticks and more joystick 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.980
 this pc now so that's the keyboard 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.930
 the mouse 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.210
 so here it is not serious I 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.969
 continues anyway ps3 videos and this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.030
 pc pro gamer so right now we 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.160
 will see a little gameplay with the tac 12 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
 it was more fun I had sided with 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 avenged he puts the software named hits 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.699
 this message is so there I re film with 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.010
 my old video software that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.960
 is called 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.859
 I do not know how but my flight slider 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.070
 it's called the case of asia studio 8 th or 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.070
 7 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:16.159
 so we 're going to get water okay 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:24.100
 was fine but if it just goes to 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:24.100
 side where the device at the earliest 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.640
 that is what is very naturally 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.640
 safe shots 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.600
 well 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.600
 intel will throw a small grenade by 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.600

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 bern 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.800
 I think those who are no and 1 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:25.590
 and 2 and then merce my level is 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.909
 still time daddy but normal knows it 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.170
 it's a bit more complicated than on ps3 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.170
 I need time to get used to 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.930
 especially since there they look strong 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.970

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.520

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.510
 not my fault is the software that I have 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.510
 do not know how to adjust it well 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.069
