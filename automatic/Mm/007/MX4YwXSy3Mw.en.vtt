wheelchair will this is incredible so
how<00:00:56.730> does<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.910> work

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
how does it work

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
how does it work
basically<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.590> whole<00:00:58.710> point<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
basically the whole point is that this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
basically the whole point is that this
it<00:01:00.000> takes<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.390> easy<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> convene<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
it takes it easy to go in the convene of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
it takes it easy to go in the convene of
the<00:01:02.309> plane<00:01:02.550> okay<00:01:02.850> where's<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.359> said<00:01:03.570> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the plane okay where's you said this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.060 
the plane okay where's you said this
have<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.930> go<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> belly<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> plane<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.010> the

whiskey damage oh wow and it can fit in
a<00:01:08.130> bar<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.990> crosses<00:01:10.140> like

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
a bar because it because it crosses like

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.899 
a bar because it because it crosses like
that<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> isn't<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> makes<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> very<00:01:11.760> simple

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that that isn't it makes it very simple

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.390 
that that isn't it makes it very simple
super<00:01:12.750> easy<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.409> travel<00:01:13.560> too<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.220> like

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
super easy for travel too is like

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
super easy for travel too is like
anybody<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> take<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.479> their<00:01:15.600> trunk

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
anybody can take this in their trunk

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
anybody can take this in their trunk
okay<00:01:16.259> where<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.710> limit<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.100> space<00:01:17.340> space

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
okay where your limit out of space space

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
okay where your limit out of space space
is<00:01:17.850> critical<00:01:18.390> especially<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.869> families<00:01:19.350> and

a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.790> easier<00:01:24.119> Tetris<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.710> Tetris

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
a lot easier Tetris in than this Tetris

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.179 
a lot easier Tetris in than this Tetris
in<00:01:26.790> yep<00:01:27.270> exactly<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.680> very<00:01:28.890> simple

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
in yep exactly and it's very simple

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.429 
in yep exactly and it's very simple
because<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> works<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.259> it's

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
because it how it works is up when it's

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.350 
because it how it works is up when it's
actually<00:01:31.650> engaged<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.549> perfectly<00:01:33.060> round

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
actually engaged it's perfectly round

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.690 
actually engaged it's perfectly round
okay<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.140> won't<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:34.979> fold<00:01:35.549> on

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
okay and it won't just you know fold on

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310 
okay and it won't just you know fold on
you<00:01:35.850> when<00:01:36.000> you're<00:01:36.090> pushing<00:01:36.299> because<00:01:36.960> when<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you when you're pushing because when the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
you when you're pushing because when the
when<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.710> axles<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.670> acts<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.000> safety

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
when the axles in it acts like a safety

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 
when the axles in it acts like a safety
mechanism<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.229> doesn't<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.710> unfold<00:01:41.549> on

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
mechanism and it doesn't just unfold on

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
mechanism and it doesn't just unfold on
solid<00:01:42.329> that's<00:01:42.479> right<00:01:42.689> even<00:01:42.869> now<00:01:43.170> Hercules

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
