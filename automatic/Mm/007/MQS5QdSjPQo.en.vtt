00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.840
 Yes 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.930
 Hello, I'm Andreas KÃ¶pke 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.039
 Goalkeeping coach of the German 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.110
 national team and I have you 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.640
 some super interesting ones as well 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.640
 compiled intensive exercises 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.620
 in this sequence we see a something 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.780
 more complex three exercises with shots out 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.180
 three different positions all clear 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.190
 Next exercise is a 3 exercise two 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.450
 of you who are not in the gate are going to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.150
 the balls and i play from the middle 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.180
 if you start from the middle 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.060
 you go over to the half position 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.990
 standing here gets the ball out of hand 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.260
 shot then get back from me 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 the ball from the middle at the beginning flat 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.670
 then sometimes as a patch then 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.940
 over here and from their dropkick in the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.500
 hand three different positions and 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.290
 again and again possible small 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.160
 steps then it goes on then it goes on 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.930
 then it goes on 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.470
 then so mid takes more often 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.710
 handy and then over again 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.710
 let's go 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 towers and you were dropkick 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:13.599
 and the last essays and break here 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.300
 we see a scene from the 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.950
 preparation for south africa where we go out 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.989
 a third exercise a second exercise 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.390
 and that actually shows 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.140
 just how variable this exercise is too 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.340
 shape is like this we have little 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.080
 variation built-in 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.299
 as you can see their women a large 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 hurdle here the middle again where the 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.150
 flat balls come or towers and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.280
 here are three small hurdles 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.380
 The exercise is actually the same only 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.450
 once over the hurdle then to the middle 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.340
 back the balls from me 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.319
 record and here about the little ones 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.410
 would shoot out of hand again 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.410
 and here dropkick comes up again 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:18.540
 flat the ball seemed loose back 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:28.680
 again flat very good yes probably easy 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:33.770
 back flat because soon liquid 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.770
 over patch 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.239
 small steps exactly and soon 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.769
 to back up 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:49.269
 once to the middle still and 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.269
 break very well 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.420
 to 28 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:21.920
 easy back small steps flat 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:29.620
 surely the ball comes loose 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.620
 back flat from me very well 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:51.870
 Misfires ensure just the little ones 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:57.379
 was over loosely loose and 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.639
 break very well super guys very strong 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.729
 the nice thing about these exercises is that 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.460
 You can offer many variations 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.710
 you can shoot flat 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.979
 you can throw up you can hurdle 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.449
 you can take small hurdles 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.620
 There are no limits to fantasy 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.449
 and it always comes down to that 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.029
 Goalkeeping coach on it too 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.129
 to do sensible exercise and always 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.120
 correct again and on a clean 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.590
 pay attention 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.919
 You can do this exercise as well 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.539
 to warm up when warmup 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.569
 you slowly see it out you see it 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.310
 with us also it is clean running it 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.210
 is not too fast it is relative 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.819
 slowly 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.379
 but you are variable and you can do it 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.639
 also as a power exercise by doing 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.389
 this exercise also much faster 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.389
 performs
