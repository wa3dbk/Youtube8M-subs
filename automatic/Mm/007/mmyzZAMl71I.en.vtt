00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.590
 seen something only about three months 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.420
 behind 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.470

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.590
 here they want a light so comes a light 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.200
 strong inside the park and from there I called 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.600
 my friend who was sleeping he too 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.390
 third cell phone 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.280
 the time he started the movie she june 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.560
 disappeared we just believe that I think 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.730
 there may have been academic failure because 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.940
 someone saw or you can not believe it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.920
 of these things because there is no 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.960
 only she who believes in these stories does not 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.200
 We have met other people here. 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.870
 who say they have seen works 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.810
 Look at the paranÃ¡'s 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.920
 contact with flying objects 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.709
 identified 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.080
 happened 18 years ago when one night 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.080
 He left the house with his cousin. 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.900
 I noticed that there popular of the 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:07.920
 young was a different light a light 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.140
 strong as a weld when 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.209
 You were the song on the same side but 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.310
 It has always been different then continue 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.590
 climbing and arrived on the trail 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.409
 perceiving a light like that was not so 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.409
 high is a very different route. 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.689
 airplane to understand how and why 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:28.620
 intuition I hit the headlight of my car 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.329
 by the jump in low blinking hour 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.340
 that I did it 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.849
 the light immediately went out 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.530
 My cousin popped up 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.900
 started shouting speak here're on 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.180
 Of us here, that light was off. 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.069
 strong and only the lust of the weak like that is 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.139
 red green to form it is a 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.609
 flying saucer I do not know what you 're seeing 15 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.909

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.099
 adolescent also he handled well 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.530
 slow as only seconds you loose 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.900
 no goals and no noise no noise 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.090
 I got in the friend's car, my body. 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.459

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.799
 also behind them that was in front 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.019
 followed on the avenue at the time we arrived 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.919
 here and went a little and disappeared 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.079

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.359

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.620
 this story caught the attention of bruno 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.280
 who is making a documentary about the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.500
 subject matter 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.750
 for some people this is a taboo can 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.139
 in some skeptics may not believe 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.490
 but there is a lot of evidence and this 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.120
 The documentary I'm doing is 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.490

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.380
