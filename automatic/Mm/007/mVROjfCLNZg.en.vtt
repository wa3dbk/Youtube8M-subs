00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.450
 Hello people let the thieves let the drug streamline and still 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.030
 a bit more 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.160
 he knows many of you and currently the EVGA x58 2 over first live 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.809
 last ride motherboard with which I am also very happy because I can and such 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.900
 Max shows I still have my sentence for a long time now 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.829
 if I am excited about this word 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.449
 Indeed 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.949
 I have this match 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.429
 First, a lot of effort to get very cheap and 240 euros cheaper than that 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.170
 What's new costs 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.600
 that was unique and had been achieved by the artificial bronchie 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.970
 and of course 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.140
 because I find myself getting better here of course now not only is the price 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.589
 it also has to have the three points now 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.880
 there he is 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.580
 first variant of the tivi de the first time has 2 s easiest time 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.069
 There is always a bit of this word meanwhile 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.120
 which also includes USB 3 points 0 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 m Sarah 3 6 will be up for grabs though 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.920
 but he appreciates the duet, that's why I accessed here 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.420
 and what is better here with the motherboard is that every better 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.280
 Possibility have meant Mayer 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 to obstruct the seven towers Lloyd LuftkÃ¼hler 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.960
 I think as he is now installed is not quite optimally installed 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.050
 visually, if that's also better if he attached it to it on the 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.190
 it will stand 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.250
 But this is not possible on the DJIA around Kerstin Falldorf 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.970
 of the huge Northbridge for the thing you can see here, "The Nasty Monster 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.080
 and would be a different position 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.880
 So in order to obstruct the cooler proposition case, this distress leaves 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.740
 would not be too easy way is 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.580
 that was of course much better solved here 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.620
 "It's pretty flat, everything is built here 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.150
 and that is the Andes yes the advantage with this motherboard I can the trip 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.180
 prove 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600
 Hercule on cooler in several different positions of the set up 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.030
 as I would like to and I can not do that at Melbourne 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.830
 Just install it as it looks right now and as I said I think so 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.359
 it is not optimal 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:14.189
 their money synonymous see the same if I have also noted down here because the 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.099
 which in this video several video sequences equal to the end 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.740
 see 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.319
 This also creates a lot of fun when finishing 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.250
 Rampage animals see what it looks like when all this is done and there is mounted 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.299
 nor does it really come down to that Sam's actual main as Cuba 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.769
 currently he is a pc-systems slides will see everything 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.879
 and I know it has unfortunately lagged a bit behind but 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.969
 After this video now one hundred percent promised 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.729
 Do you choose that thing the whole system I do not want anything else now 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:43.940
 more change a calculator 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.010
 that remains 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.819
 as I said that with the n-word far more unexpected because I pretty much 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.420
 I have accessed cheap and who has that yet 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.649
 fast 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.579
 before I made the actual host video we have to 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.120
 then make two videos again 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.120
 with two different members because it prefers to do so 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.600
 yes what a question 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.280
 as mentioned the accessories are completely everything wonderful what you also here 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.860
 However, he does not live on me for now otherwise I have 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.020
 yes the same problem as long as the first Jack kept me from behaving like that 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.030
 great October 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.230
 Processor i mean children today i could stand before the victims 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.769
 he could not have blocked the bottlenose dolphin much more often than I did 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.089
 that would like to have 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.539
 you can not help them 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.539
 to optimally cool the Northbridge 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.019
 this huge grille 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.259
 Fan installed if you want 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.129
 then look something like this 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.259
 but I do not do that 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.259
 Renault here 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.319
 To be honest, there are still the different sequences in the world 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.319
 to see everything as normal in more detail 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.539
 there 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.979
 50 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.860
 continue 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.159
 dpa 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.159
 Dortmund 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.999
 the students 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:41.160
 join in 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.330
 Vienna 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.069
 Vienna 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.099
 the one 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.349
 Vienna 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:47.180
 the 2 2 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.090
 that deserves 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.349
 that deserves
