inch<00:03:07.260> sleeves<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.280> caught<00:03:08.579> him<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.540> it

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
inch sleeves and I caught him so it

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.590 
inch sleeves and I caught him so it
wasn't<00:03:10.200> because<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.889> didn't<00:03:11.100> want<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.600> actually

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
wasn't because I didn't want to actually

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.949 
wasn't because I didn't want to actually
shave<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.410> bring<00:03:14.100> down<00:03:14.430> actually<00:03:15.120> designed

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
shave the bring down actually designed

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.800 
shave the bring down actually designed
so<00:03:16.889> it's<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.160> my<00:03:17.459> stuff<00:03:17.850> together<00:03:20.060> um<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
so it's like my stuff together um with a

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.220 
so it's like my stuff together um with a
scoop<00:03:22.230> on<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:23.329> actually<00:03:24.329> shaved<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.989> down

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
scoop on it I actually shaved it down

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.050 
scoop on it I actually shaved it down
pretty<00:03:25.709> much<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.130> actually<00:03:26.430> keep<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:26.850> up

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
pretty much is actually keep the one up

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.809 
pretty much is actually keep the one up
the<00:03:27.269> kid<00:03:27.750> shaved<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.859> all<00:03:28.980> down<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:29.700> main

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
the kid shaved it all down to the main

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.610 
the kid shaved it all down to the main
beam<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.510> gives<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.870> little<00:03:31.200> aggressive

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
beam so it gives it a little aggressive

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.840 
beam so it gives it a little aggressive
look

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850
