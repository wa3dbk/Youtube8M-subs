00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
collecting duct and distal convoluted

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.019 
collecting duct and distal convoluted
tubules<00:00:03.870> I'm<00:00:04.319> not<00:00:04.650> going<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.100> say<00:00:05.339> much<00:00:05.609> and

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
tubules I'm not going to say much and

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.690 
tubules I'm not going to say much and
the<00:00:06.899> reason<00:00:07.379> why<00:00:07.620> I'm<00:00:07.830> not<00:00:08.040> going<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> say<00:00:08.490> much

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
the reason why I'm not going to say much

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.370 
the reason why I'm not going to say much
is<00:00:08.880> because<00:00:09.240> we're<00:00:09.510> actually<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.110> spend

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
is because we're actually going to spend

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.700 
is because we're actually going to spend
another<00:00:10.740> whole<00:00:11.070> lecture<00:00:11.280> talking<00:00:12.120> about<00:00:12.710> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
another whole lecture talking about the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.750 
another whole lecture talking about the
thing<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:15.089> can<00:00:15.480> happen<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:16.760> distal

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
thing that can happen in distal

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.470 
thing that can happen in distal
convoluted<00:00:17.970> tubules<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.020> collecting<00:00:19.890> duct

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
convoluted tubules and collecting duct

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.730 
convoluted tubules and collecting duct
the<00:00:21.480> take-home<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.230> want<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.619> have

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the take-home that I want you to have

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.140 
the take-home that I want you to have
right<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:24.029> filtrate<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:25.470> enter

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
right now is that filtrate can enter

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.330 
right now is that filtrate can enter
this<00:00:27.150> zone<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:28.310> low<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.480> hundred<00:00:31.340> million

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
this zone as low as a hundred million

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.780 
this zone as low as a hundred million
miles<00:00:32.809> what<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.960> means<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.790> that's

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
miles what that means is that that's

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.020 
miles what that means is that that's
super<00:00:36.149> dilute<00:00:36.690> that's<00:00:37.500> actually<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.820> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
super dilute that's actually like if you

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450 
super dilute that's actually like if you
peed<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.440> would<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.100> dude<00:00:41.340> did

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
peed that out you would be like dude did

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.280 
peed that out you would be like dude did
I<00:00:41.610> even<00:00:41.790> pee<00:00:41.969> because<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.719> would<00:00:42.960> look<00:00:43.230> like

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
I even pee because it would look like

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.220 
I even pee because it would look like
you<00:00:43.530> peed<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.219> pure<00:00:44.760> water<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.079> how

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you peed out pure water you know how

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.470 
you peed out pure water you know how
that<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.559> you're<00:00:46.980> all<00:00:47.280> stoked<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.300> all

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.000 
that is you're all stoked to get all
hydrated<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.200> you're<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.469> okay<00:00:49.770> I'm<00:00:49.890> going

hydrated and you're like okay I'm going

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.950 
hydrated and you're like okay I'm going
to<00:00:50.070> drink<00:00:50.280> water<00:00:50.520> every<00:00:50.850> three<00:00:51.360> minutes<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
to drink water every three minutes and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
to drink water every three minutes and
you<00:00:52.559> start<00:00:52.800> drinking<00:00:53.160> water<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.610> think

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you start drinking water and you think

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.220 
you start drinking water and you think
I'm<00:00:53.969> such<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> rockstar<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.079> so

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I'm such a rockstar I'm going to be so

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
I'm such a rockstar I'm going to be so
hydrated<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> next<00:00:56.370> thing<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> know

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
hydrated and the next thing you know

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.510 
hydrated and the next thing you know
you're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.420> pee<00:00:57.660> every<00:00:58.050> five<00:00:58.260> minutes

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
you're going pee every five minutes

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.250 
you're going pee every five minutes
because<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.820> then<00:01:00.030> you're<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.480> peeing<00:01:00.899> out

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
because and then you're like peeing out

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.060 
because and then you're like peeing out
the<00:01:01.859> water<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.789> drank<00:01:03.799> that<00:01:04.799> kills

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the water that you just drank that kills

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
the water that you just drank that kills
me<00:01:05.339> why<00:01:05.880> bother<00:01:06.150> drinking<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:06.900> you're<00:01:07.020> just

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
me why bother drinking it if you're just

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.310 
me why bother drinking it if you're just
going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> pee<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:08.750> that's<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
going to pee it out that's because you

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.859 
going to pee it out that's because you
are<00:01:10.850> satisfactorily<00:01:11.850> hydrated<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
are satisfactorily hydrated and you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.510 
are satisfactorily hydrated and you
don't<00:01:13.080> need<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.520> body<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.570> hypo

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
don't need to have your body in a hypo

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.940 
don't need to have your body in a hypo
osmotic<00:01:17.600> environment<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.840> dude<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.770> pee

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
osmotic environment like dude just pee

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.840 
osmotic environment like dude just pee
out<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.280> extra<00:01:20.549> water<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> maintain

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
out that extra water and maintain

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.620 
out that extra water and maintain
osmotic<00:01:23.850> homeostasis<00:01:26.630> your<00:01:27.630> body<00:01:29.000> knows<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
osmotic homeostasis your body knows and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.249 
osmotic homeostasis your body knows and
there<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.680> hormones<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.780> can<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.960> produced

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
there are hormones that can be produced

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.170 
there are hormones that can be produced
and<00:01:34.530> we're<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.799> talk<00:01:35.040> about<00:01:35.070> them<00:01:35.490> but

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and we're going to talk about them but

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.550 
and we're going to talk about them but
they<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:37.790> deal<00:01:38.840> with<00:01:40.159> this<00:01:41.159> super<00:01:41.850> dilute

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
they can deal with this super dilute

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.230 
they can deal with this super dilute
filtrate<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.829> exits<00:01:44.520> distal<00:01:45.030> convoluted

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
filtrate that exits distal convoluted

filtrate that exits distal convoluted
tubules<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.520> exits<00:01:47.520> ascending<00:01:48.000> loop<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
tubules that exits ascending loop of

tubules that exits ascending loop of
Henle<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.869> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
Henle you can actually we all know this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.520 
Henle you can actually we all know this
you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:53.009> reabsorb<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.659> continue<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you can reabsorb you can continue to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.850 
you can reabsorb you can continue to
reabsorb<00:01:56.030> water<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.329> fact<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.829> make

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
reabsorb water in fact you can make

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.539 
reabsorb water in fact you can make
peepee<00:01:59.520> that<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> concentration<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.549> 1200

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
peepee that is a concentration of 1200

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.310 
peepee that is a concentration of 1200
milliosmoles<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.780> I'm<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.020> let<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
milliosmoles so I'm going to let you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.530 
milliosmoles so I'm going to let you
just<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.799> about<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:06.149> would<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.420> be

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
just think about that how would that be

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
just think about that how would that be
popped<00:02:06.719> that's<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.140> pee<00:02:07.320> where<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:07.799> in

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
popped that's the pee where you go in

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.979 
popped that's the pee where you go in
and<00:02:08.250> you're<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.550> whoa<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.569> peed<00:02:09.780> out

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
and you're like whoa I just peed out

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.580 
and you're like whoa I just peed out
like<00:02:10.970> orange<00:02:12.020> madness

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
like orange madness

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.949 
like orange madness
because<00:02:14.160> there's<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.790> hardly<00:02:15.209> any<00:02:15.510> water<00:02:15.690> in

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
because there's like hardly any water in
