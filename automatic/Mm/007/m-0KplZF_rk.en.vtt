00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.339
 the journey through Schaeffler 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.489
 Minister Ilse Aigner the strengthening of the riser the fast game after 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:36.930
 front 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.390
 on the 17th 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.480
 with the look for Benjamin Siegert Benjamin Siegert zol 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.870
 um for labor Wiesbaden 11d minute 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.680
 Of course, percent of SV Wehen Wiesbaden has until the last game 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.780
 in this picture fits again exactly they want back again especially the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.520
 We are finally suspects in the face of impending bankruptcy 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.520
 left again 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 Marienfeld here the ten 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.100
 for the study 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.320
 for La Reina had five times again 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 the fefa and against the defender Lell have 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.310
 as the game still not high class but a bit 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.820
 After all, it was generally years later 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 who is there? 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 it was still 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.399
 acted here 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.229
 that's all worries 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.249
 Lots of room for the SV Babelsberg 03 and Mattia Bianchi counts 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.169
 just so much praised but that is of course a very bad thing 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.269
 Tackles 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.699
 back in the polenta team 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.699
 because you can so wonderful sortable common good 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.089
 Ulm the secret services 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.089
 End before Moria Lambarene 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.089
 the Bad Driburger 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.479
 You can not do much later though 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.779
 two cheap in front of the line 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.819
 also in Porto was the step to keep 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.829
 really good technician 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.449
 Fatih Akin's movie 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.369
 if you have such a goal "this whole does not understand that at all 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.769
 take from Mainz even tackle 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.089
 do not control the formations 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.089
 since 17 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.219
 RSC 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:50.290
 the most striking 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.290
 at SV Wehen Wiesbaden 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.879
 than the year before 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.879
 own and thus 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.209
 so wanted engine failed 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.209
 the reason 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.009
 rather is 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.010
 So it should be ten years old car 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.010
 the orchestra is 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:46.939
 May 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.939
 he is everywhere 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.309
 He is the first time 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.309
 however, they are not present 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.669
 to 30 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.259
 they claim 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.259
 Surely the internet will surely work 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.689
 the entrepreneur de 10 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.749
 how efficient 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.739
 or these drivers really counted back was Formation Reuter 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.129
 the NPD 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.129
 shortly after 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.300
 Indeed 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.080
 how should one almost never be observed by the collision 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.080
 they are so laid out 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.900
 after waiting to be like the Queen 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:56.559
 that's what he is 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.860
 it is thrown up 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.809
 the best man of the SV labor Wiesbaden II 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.580
 Suddenly it looks like this 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.839
 it was said 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.839
 Dennis Schmidt has to worry 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.180
 The LTTE has moved a lot I liked 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.800
 we need him 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.800
 watching him play football 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.550
 Iran owns 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.550
 the role models 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.519
 We will see where we are in the print area
