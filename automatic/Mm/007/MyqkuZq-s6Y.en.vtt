00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.730
 what's going on today we're on day 8 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.529
 I had my body rested I did not have 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.119
 laces and like the day before 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.560
 I trained a lot because I was with many 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.970
 I wanted to train that I had slept 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.570
 some do not know why he had a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.669
 about elizarÃ¡n 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.259
 the goal was to get my movements 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.330
 that he had always wanted to learn and not 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.890
 never put me on so I started singing and 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.870
 I hurt my knee point because I was 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.910
 dancing in a disco and did not wear 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.010
 the knees and I hurt myself donkey 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:48.660
 I started trying to get a set going up 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:49.980
 to iron then I remembered the frizz 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.110
 the one who always wanted to learn from 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:03.899
 mill to a hand like that and I got to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:05.789
 practice it after many attempts 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.530
 to see me on video I realized that a 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.899
 of the legs I was sucking them towards 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.460
 up instead of circulating mind besides 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.899
 I did not expect to go up to head and then 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.580
 puts the arm but put arms 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.140
 directly and I was ahead of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.909
 movement 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.909
 once understood that was already coming out 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.979
 but I realized that naturally to 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:53.450
 work putting your feet on the ground and 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:55.490
 that I could get some mobility and 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.200
 I ended up getting closer every time I got 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.820
 I started inventing another because I had the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.440
 ceip benito in one hand and never used it 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.720
 for nothing so I started practicing 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.170
 technique of how to trace to 6 davis with 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.170
 a hand 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 and watching me on video I got 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:20.420
 do it and looking for a position that was 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:22.520
 more or less aesthetic and as in one of 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 Sometimes I fell with co2 because look perfect 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:36.280
 to go through the head and link it to another 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:36.280
 country and I was polishing and polishing and julieta 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.560
 and then later I put with others 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.560
 movements that I wanted to learn 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.710
 besides remembering a little the is that already 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.710
 3 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.810
 I hope that since I was already tired better 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.879
 and to practice and to another day and to finish 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.459
 and as always to expire finish the 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.349
 great training I was super motivated what 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.909
 only one that hurt the contracture until 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.340
 I still have here that is not going away 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.620
 not kicked but otherwise great 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.870
 so up to here the training of day 8 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.870
 see you tomorrow to take care of my voice
