or not but I think it's a pretty fun
game<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> touchpad<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:22.260> there's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
game for the touchpad because there's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380

even<00:00:27.930> reviewing<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.010> think<00:00:29.070> it's

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
even reviewing it because I think it's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.460
