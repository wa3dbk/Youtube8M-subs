mocha brownish white color with
ornamental<00:01:07.260> patterns<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:07.979> why<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.250> also

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
ornamental patterns that's why they also

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.630 
ornamental patterns that's why they also
call<00:01:09.030> them<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.330> ornamental<00:01:09.750> baboon<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> these

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
call them the ornamental baboon so these

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.789 
call them the ornamental baboon so these
are<00:01:11.880> old<00:01:12.299> world<00:01:12.600> species<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.560> come<00:01:13.710> from

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
are old world species that come from

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.320 
are old world species that come from
Africa<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.930> expect<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
Africa so you can expect them to have a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.109 
Africa so you can expect them to have a
nasty<00:01:18.330> attitude<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.640> really<00:01:20.640> bad<00:01:20.790> bite

video of the stroma at palma calcium

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
video of the stroma at palma calcium
will<00:01:32.970> also<00:01:33.240> apply<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> hv<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
will also apply to the hv do so so you

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.920 
will also apply to the hv do so so you
got<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> keep<00:01:37.619> these<00:01:37.770> arboreal<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.810> can

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
got to keep these arboreal and you can

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.810 
got to keep these arboreal and you can
see<00:01:40.110> characteristics<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.040> baboons<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.610> have

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
see characteristics of baboons they have

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.990 
see characteristics of baboons they have
very<00:01:42.390> thick<00:01:43.229> hind<00:01:43.530> legs<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.909> use<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
very thick hind legs that they use to

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.469 
very thick hind legs that they use to
use<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.180> their<00:01:48.270> speed<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> attack<00:01:49.860> really

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
use for their speed so the attack really

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.609 
use for their speed so the attack really
precise<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.689> accurate<00:01:51.810> these<00:01:52.320> are<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.590> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
precise and accurate these are one of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.380 
precise and accurate these are one of
the<00:01:52.770> act<00:01:52.950> most<00:01:53.310> accurate<00:01:53.670> tarantulas<00:01:54.149> ever

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the act most accurate tarantulas ever

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.800 
the act most accurate tarantulas ever
seen<00:01:54.570> attack<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:54.990> crickets<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:57.299> yours<00:01:57.600> that's

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
seen attack at crickets so yours that's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.679 
seen attack at crickets so yours that's
underside<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:59.759> basically<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.329> keep<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
underside so basically you keep it

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.459 
underside so basically you keep it
arboreal<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.329> hollow<00:02:03.329> log<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> just

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
arboreal have a hollow log so it just

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.310 
arboreal have a hollow log so it just
likes<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.860> crawl<00:02:05.040> under<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:07.140> water

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
likes to crawl under there and a water

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.590 
likes to crawl under there and a water

and<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:10.130> substrate<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:10.640> recommend<00:02:12.250> about<00:02:13.250> two

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
and for substrate I recommend about two

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.980 
and for substrate I recommend about two
inches<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.910> potting<00:02:14.180> soil<00:02:14.450> mixing<00:02:14.840> with
