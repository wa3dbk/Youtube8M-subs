00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.690
 but for me you should share this 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.920
 called 5 centers this they have 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.600
 tradition of a billie band with this 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.220
 theme as its name says let's do 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.349
 our control center and centers 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.790
 notifications for synthesis the most 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.469
 nice next let's see 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.910
 aesthetic that we install we are going to a 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.529
 full quick reboot that you're going 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.270
 to create one less but here for example 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.220
 and we can go to raise my center 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.279
 control and can see how they look very 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.470
 different and clear it looks clear nicer 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.990
 and the notification center here 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.090
 can see also how he looks is very 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.280
 very very well the truth to me I like 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.620
 much how it looks already depends on you 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.300
 If you like this style, not the truth 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 I loved it and well, since one 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.140
 that we made down without adjustments cristito and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.090
 has a lot of things that adjustments that 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.129
 we are going to see us we can 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.110
 select what to put that to take away 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.690
 our centers, you 're not here 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.760
 you are impotent in the pacific chris 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.059
 jones whole team of us have 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.050
 to modify the states where the 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.970
 date this from the headers of today 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.840
 that if we want to know a new one this 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.710
 notifications the genres 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.150
 notification that are the ones that sometimes 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.770
 that are at this disposal is what 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.440
 we want it to look if we want to design 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.200
 the icons and those things functionalities 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.990
 extra that is to change the create by the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 X in blur and background us 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.650
 we put ourselves if we want or not the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.910
 separator lines of the buttons 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.700
 digital all this we can 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.230
 configure that we have are enough in 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.820
 the notification center and if 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.180
 we enter control center 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.510
 we also have a lot to hide 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.190
 our the sections in the lawsuit with 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.229
 all this we can modify 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.060
 we can accommodate it as 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.130
 we want to taste, I do not have 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.670
 as you know all my settings well 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.410
 it's like I left it like that but I do not know 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.500
 mobilized the truth I really liked how 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.060
 lie to the type install and usb put together 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.770

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.390

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.080
 channel sequence see you in the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.080
