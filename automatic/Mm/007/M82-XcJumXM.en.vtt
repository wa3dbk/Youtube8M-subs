00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:57.639 

head<00:00:46.950> pen<00:00:48.590> ear<00:00:49.590> wire<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:52.730> jump<00:00:53.730> rings<00:00:55.010> okay<00:00:56.010> so

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
head pen ear wire and jump rings okay so

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
head pen ear wire and jump rings okay so
first<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.100> you're<00:00:59.340> gonna<00:00:59.579> make<00:01:03.379> we're

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
first of all you're gonna make we're

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.100 
first of all you're gonna make we're
gonna<00:01:04.939> make<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> loop<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.869> our<00:01:08.270> head<00:01:09.270> pin<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
gonna make a loop with our head pin so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.000 
gonna make a loop with our head pin so
you<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:11.369> puts<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:12.320> head<00:01:13.320> pin<00:01:13.680> through<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you just puts your head pin through the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.179 
you just puts your head pin through the
paper<00:01:14.970> bead<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.860> push<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
paper bead like this then you push it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.380 
paper bead like this then you push it
down<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:19.229> way<00:01:20.210> okay<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.890> we<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.130> cut<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.970> SS

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
down this way okay so we just cut the SS

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.899 
down this way okay so we just cut the SS
off<00:01:27.110> let's<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.350> oh

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.840 

I<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.899> then<00:01:34.610> after<00:01:35.610> captain<00:01:35.969> the<00:01:36.390> SS<00:01:36.810> off<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
I like then after captain the SS off I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.440 
I like then after captain the SS off I
think<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.240> too<00:01:39.539> long<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.469> me<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.549> cut<00:01:41.789> small<00:01:42.030> off

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
think is too long so me to cut small off

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.289 
think is too long so me to cut small off
like<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:44.420> okay<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.579> think<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.789> length<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
like this okay so I think this length is

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.840 
like this okay so I think this length is
okay<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.890> now<00:01:50.399> we're<00:01:50.610> gonna<00:01:50.759> make<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> loop

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
okay so now we're gonna make a loop

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:05.090 
okay so now we're gonna make a loop
we're<00:01:53.850> gonna<00:01:54.000> make<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> loop<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:57.740> this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:16.780 

okay<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:05.880> I'm<00:02:06.540> making<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.080> loon

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.820 

okay<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:17.849> we're<00:02:18.390> done<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:18.780> making<00:02:20.690> loop<00:02:21.830> with

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
okay so we're done with making loop with

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:31.600 
okay so we're done with making loop with
the<00:02:23.099> head<00:02:23.430> pin<00:02:24.650> okay<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:28.160> all<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.310> gonna<00:02:29.459> do<00:02:29.730> is

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
the head pin okay so all you gonna do is

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.890 
the head pin okay so all you gonna do is
we're<00:02:32.610> gonna<00:02:33.530> link<00:02:34.530> our<00:02:34.800> jump<00:02:35.459> rings<00:02:38.569> in<00:02:39.569> order

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
we're gonna link our jump rings in order

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.740 
we're gonna link our jump rings in order
to<00:02:40.140> achieve<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.920> we<00:02:42.080> need<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.380> link<00:02:43.650> several

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
to achieve this we need to link several

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.410 
to achieve this we need to link several
jump<00:02:45.750> rings<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:47.459> have<00:02:48.330> 11<00:02:48.959> jump<00:02:49.440> rings<00:02:49.739> here

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
jump rings and I have 11 jump rings here

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:59.259 
jump rings and I have 11 jump rings here
so<00:02:53.239> in<00:02:54.239> order<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:55.489> move<00:02:56.489> faster<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:58.530> need<00:02:58.739> two

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
so in order to move faster you need two

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.800 
so in order to move faster you need two
length<00:03:00.269> three<00:03:01.700> jump<00:03:02.700> rings<00:03:02.849> don't<00:03:03.420> make<00:03:03.660> you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
length three jump rings don't make you

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.750 
length three jump rings don't make you
move<00:03:03.989> faster<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.580> how<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:07.610> link<00:03:08.610> my

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
move faster so this is how I link my

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.690 
move faster so this is how I link my
three<00:03:09.420> jump<00:03:09.840> rings<00:03:09.989> all<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.130> need<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.430> do<00:03:11.580> is

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
three jump rings all you need to do is

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.630 
three jump rings all you need to do is
pop<00:03:11.910> in<00:03:12.120> one<00:03:12.799> jump<00:03:13.799> ring<00:03:14.099> like<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:18.440> okay<00:03:19.640> then

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
pop in one jump ring like this okay then

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.099 
pop in one jump ring like this okay then
you<00:03:21.269> put<00:03:22.579> two<00:03:23.579> jump<00:03:24.090> rings<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.750> it

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
you put two jump rings on it

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:37.510 
you put two jump rings on it
like<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:26.720> then<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:29.510> close<00:03:30.510> it

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.560 

we'll<00:03:38.060> sit<00:03:38.270> like<00:03:38.450> this<00:03:38.830> okay<00:03:40.030> then<00:03:41.030> you've<00:03:41.300> got

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
we'll sit like this okay then you've got

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.310 
we'll sit like this okay then you've got
three<00:03:42.280> jump<00:03:43.280> rings<00:03:43.460> links<00:03:44.330> linked<00:03:44.990> together

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
three jump rings links linked together

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:52.360 
three jump rings links linked together
and<00:03:48.490> so<00:03:49.490> you're<00:03:49.940> gonna<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:50.300> that<00:03:50.510> so<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.370> you

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
and so you're gonna do that so you you

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:01.570 
and so you're gonna do that so you you
link<00:03:53.560> eleven<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.710> them<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.590> have<00:03:59.020> ten<00:04:00.580> jump

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
link eleven of them so I have ten jump

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.770 
link eleven of them so I have ten jump
rings<00:04:01.880> here<00:04:02.270> I've<00:04:02.860> already<00:04:03.860> opened<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:07.780> so

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
rings here I've already opened to so

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.870 
rings here I've already opened to so
what<00:04:09.290> I'm<00:04:09.380> gonna<00:04:09.620> do<00:04:09.950> is<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:15.340> jump<00:04:16.340> ring<00:04:16.670> of

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
what I'm gonna do is the jump ring of

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.110 
what I'm gonna do is the jump ring of
open<00:04:17.330> I'm<00:04:17.540> going<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.870> link<00:04:18.170> it<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:19.630> my<00:04:20.630> ten<00:04:22.120> jump

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
open I'm going to link it to my ten jump

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.690 
open I'm going to link it to my ten jump
