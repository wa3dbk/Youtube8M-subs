00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.700 

I've<00:00:07.450> been<00:00:07.570> using<00:00:07.720> fluorocarbon<00:00:08.260> for<00:00:08.590> me

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
I've been using fluorocarbon for me

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.990 
I've been using fluorocarbon for me
leaders<00:00:09.070> and<00:00:09.220> me<00:00:09.280> hook<00:00:09.400> links<00:00:09.700> the<00:00:09.820> last

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
leaders and me hook links the last

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.640 
leaders and me hook links the last
couple<00:00:10.270> years<00:00:10.330> and<00:00:10.660> I'm<00:00:10.750> definitely<00:00:11.139> certain

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
couple years and I'm definitely certain

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.530 
couple years and I'm definitely certain
it's<00:00:11.889> called<00:00:12.100> me<00:00:12.219> a<00:00:12.280> few<00:00:12.460> more<00:00:12.610> fish<00:00:12.850> at<00:00:13.480> the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
it's called me a few more fish at the

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.850 
it's called me a few more fish at the
end<00:00:13.570> of<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:13.809> day<00:00:13.930> Carper<00:00:14.350> definitely<00:00:14.709> gained

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
end of the day Carper definitely gained

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.470 
end of the day Carper definitely gained
a<00:00:14.889> lot<00:00:15.129> wiser<00:00:15.309> and<00:00:15.670> a<00:00:15.700> lot<00:00:15.789> more<00:00:15.820> pressured<00:00:16.299> so

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
a lot wiser and a lot more pressured so

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.730 
a lot wiser and a lot more pressured so
I've<00:00:16.600> got<00:00:16.750> though<00:00:17.020> everything<00:00:17.440> we<00:00:17.530> can<00:00:17.680> to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
I've got though everything we can to

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.380 
I've got though everything we can to
stay<00:00:18.010> one<00:00:18.220> step<00:00:18.250> ahead<00:00:18.460> of<00:00:18.730> them<00:00:18.850> and<00:00:19.060> I<00:00:19.330> think

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
stay one step ahead of them and I think

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.060 
stay one step ahead of them and I think
fluorocarbon<00:00:20.020> is<00:00:20.260> definitely<00:00:20.680> an<00:00:20.740> edge<00:00:20.890> on

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
fluorocarbon is definitely an edge on

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.099 
fluorocarbon is definitely an edge on
that<00:00:21.100> front<00:00:21.430> they<00:00:22.150> seem<00:00:22.359> company<00:00:22.720> over<00:00:22.960> on

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
that front they seem company over on

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.050 
that front they seem company over on
Christ<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:23.679> is<00:00:24.009> absolutely<00:00:24.519> awesome<00:00:24.609> stuff

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
Christ and is absolutely awesome stuff

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.210 
Christ and is absolutely awesome stuff
is<00:00:25.269> made<00:00:25.480> from<00:00:25.779> 100%<00:00:26.320> premium<00:00:26.830> grade

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
is made from 100% premium grade

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.159 
is made from 100% premium grade
fluorocarbon<00:00:27.939> fluorocarbon<00:00:28.449> has<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.779> very

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
fluorocarbon fluorocarbon has a very

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.140 
fluorocarbon fluorocarbon has a very
similar<00:00:29.380> light<00:00:29.650> refraction<00:00:29.980> to<00:00:30.550> water

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
similar light refraction to water

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.760 
similar light refraction to water
therefore<00:00:31.810> once<00:00:32.020> it<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.259> actually<00:00:32.590> in<00:00:32.680> the

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
therefore once it is actually in the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.130 
therefore once it is actually in the
water<00:00:32.890> it's<00:00:33.760> very<00:00:33.850> very<00:00:34.360> difficult<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.960> see

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
water it's very very difficult to see

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.870 
water it's very very difficult to see
now<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:35.950> other<00:00:36.070> thing<00:00:36.280> about<00:00:36.340> fluorocarbon

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
now the other thing about fluorocarbon

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.640 
now the other thing about fluorocarbon
is<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.390> it's<00:00:37.510> really<00:00:37.750> really<00:00:38.020> dense<00:00:38.320> and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
is that it's really really dense and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.230 
is that it's really really dense and
because<00:00:39.130> of<00:00:39.160> that<00:00:39.310> density<00:00:39.610> it's<00:00:39.970> a<00:00:40.060> lot

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
because of that density it's a lot

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.790 
because of that density it's a lot
heavier<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.780> therefore<00:00:41.110> it<00:00:41.260> sinks<00:00:41.590> like<00:00:41.740> a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
heavier and therefore it sinks like a

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.830 
heavier and therefore it sinks like a
brick<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:42.760> it's<00:00:42.910> pinned<00:00:43.150> down<00:00:43.270> to<00:00:43.450> the<00:00:43.540> bottom

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
brick so it's pinned down to the bottom

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.750 
brick so it's pinned down to the bottom
well<00:00:44.200> out<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.500> way<00:00:44.650> of<00:00:44.800> them<00:00:45.010> where<00:00:45.370> he<00:00:45.520> can

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
well out of the way of them where he can

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.150 
well out of the way of them where he can
another<00:00:46.690> good<00:00:46.900> thing<00:00:46.930> about<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.440> density<00:00:47.800> is

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
another good thing about that density is

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.830 
another good thing about that density is
the<00:00:48.220> fact<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:48.820> it's<00:00:49.030> really<00:00:49.270> really

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
the fact that it's really really

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.110 
the fact that it's really really
abrasive<00:00:50.230> resistance<00:00:50.950> really<00:00:51.250> tough<00:00:51.580> stuff<00:00:51.850> I

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
abrasive resistance really tough stuff I

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.790 
abrasive resistance really tough stuff I
mean<00:00:52.510> if<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.750> bite<00:00:52.960> for<00:00:53.230> it<00:00:55.110> struggling<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.260> if

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
mean if you bite for it struggling it if

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800 
mean if you bite for it struggling it if
you<00:00:56.950> bite<00:00:57.280> for<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.550> bit<00:00:57.670> of<00:00:57.790> that<00:00:57.910> compared<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.720> a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
you bite for a bit of that compared to a

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.240 
you bite for a bit of that compared to a
bit<00:00:58.990> of<00:00:59.080> normal<00:00:59.350> money<00:00:59.530> you'll<00:00:59.950> see<00:01:00.130> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
bit of normal money you'll see the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.040 
bit of normal money you'll see the
difference<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:00.940> obviously<00:01:01.480> it's<00:01:01.660> brilliant

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
difference so obviously it's brilliant

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.160 
difference so obviously it's brilliant
for<00:01:02.080> links<00:01:02.590> and<00:01:02.680> brilliant<00:01:03.310> for<00:01:03.460> leaders<00:01:03.760> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
for links and brilliant for leaders to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.450 
for links and brilliant for leaders to
now<00:01:05.170> they<00:01:05.350> get<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.530> lot<00:01:05.650> of<00:01:05.710> people<00:01:05.890> ask<00:01:06.220> me<00:01:06.369> how

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
now they get a lot of people ask me how

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.310 
now they get a lot of people ask me how
do<00:01:06.729> I<00:01:06.909> tie<00:01:07.360> my<00:01:07.390> combi<00:01:07.930> links<00:01:08.170> with

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
do I tie my combi links with

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320 
do I tie my combi links with
fluorocarbon<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.189> how<00:01:09.369> do<00:01:09.430> I<00:01:09.549> tie<00:01:09.790> my<00:01:09.820> leaders

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
fluorocarbon and how do I tie my leaders

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.480 
fluorocarbon and how do I tie my leaders
on<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.780> fluorocarbon<00:01:11.410> so<00:01:11.830> I'll<00:01:11.920> just<00:01:12.070> run<00:01:12.220> for

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
on the fluorocarbon so I'll just run for

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.610 
on the fluorocarbon so I'll just run for
it<00:01:12.580> quickly<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:13.780> makes<00:01:13.990> perfect<00:01:14.230> leader

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
it quickly it makes perfect leader

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.670 
it quickly it makes perfect leader
material<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:15.480> really<00:01:16.480> cheap<00:01:16.720> bait<00:01:17.200> sinks

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
material I really cheap bait sinks

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.290 
material I really cheap bait sinks
really<00:01:17.920> well<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.310> see<00:01:18.580> it's<00:01:18.910> virtually

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
really well and see it's virtually

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.140 
really well and see it's virtually
invisible<00:01:19.680> from<00:01:20.680> your<00:01:20.860> main<00:01:20.980> line<00:01:21.220> onto<00:01:22.030> your

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
invisible from your main line onto your

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.000 
invisible from your main line onto your
leader<00:01:22.330> I'll<00:01:22.930> use<00:01:23.170> some<00:01:23.350> braid<00:01:23.590> here<00:01:23.800> because

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
leader I'll use some braid here because

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.280 
leader I'll use some braid here because
it<00:01:24.100> should<00:01:24.550> show<00:01:24.760> they're<00:01:25.000> not<00:01:25.030> easier<00:01:25.659> all

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
it should show they're not easier all

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.320 
it should show they're not easier all
I'm<00:01:26.500> doing<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.220> back<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.520> back<00:01:27.700> for<00:01:28.090> tone

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
I'm doing is it back to back for tone

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.899 
I'm doing is it back to back for tone
greener<00:01:28.600> so<00:01:29.230> get<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.800> fluorocarbon<00:01:30.250> make<00:01:30.880> a

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
greener so get the fluorocarbon make a

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.440 
greener so get the fluorocarbon make a
loop<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.450> then<00:01:31.720> go<00:01:31.900> around<00:01:32.170> both<00:01:32.470> materials

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
loop and then go around both materials

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.950 
loop and then go around both materials
four<00:01:34.450> times

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.220 

just<00:01:39.710> Bank<00:01:39.980> tighten<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.430> fully<00:01:41.110> bit<00:01:42.110> in

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
just Bank tighten it fully bit in

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.900 
just Bank tighten it fully bit in
moisture<00:01:42.470> just<00:01:42.890> tighten<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.580> down<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.790> little

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
moisture just tighten it down a little

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.050

warmer months I tend to stick with the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
stiffer ones and in the window and I'm

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.570 
stiffer ones and in the window and I'm
finding<00:04:37.320> down<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.650> bit<00:04:37.920> I<00:04:38.010> go<00:04:38.220> on<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.340> lighter

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
finding down a bit I go on the lighter

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.840 
finding down a bit I go on the lighter
ones<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:40.020> leaders<00:04:40.380> I'd<00:04:40.830> go<00:04:41.070> for<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.280> 18<00:04:41.610> I

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
ones the leaders I'd go for the 18 I

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.520 
ones the leaders I'd go for the 18 I
think<00:04:42.030> they're<00:04:42.120> also<00:04:42.240> doing<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.660> 25-pound<00:04:43.290> one

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
think they're also doing a 25-pound one

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.140 
think they're also doing a 25-pound one
that<00:04:44.040> could<00:04:44.190> be<00:04:44.280> worth<00:04:44.400> checking<00:04:44.669> out<00:04:44.850> as<00:04:44.970> well

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
that could be worth checking out as well

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.880 
that could be worth checking out as well
but<00:04:45.330> 18<00:04:45.660> should<00:04:45.900> be<00:04:46.020> fine<00:04:46.230> for<00:04:46.470> most<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.770> what

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
but 18 should be fine for most of what

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.950 
but 18 should be fine for most of what
you<00:04:46.980> need<00:04:47.130> as<00:04:47.970> says<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.450> a<00:04:48.510> range<00:04:48.690> of<00:04:48.840> different

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
you need as says in a range of different

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.380 
you need as says in a range of different
