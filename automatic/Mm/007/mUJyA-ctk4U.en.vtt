00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:18.929
 Differentiated treatment 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:20.239
 But we can not 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.349

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.510
 oprah also toni managed in some cases with no down payment 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.349
 potential 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.789
 needed 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:37.859
 in the greatest hour 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.389
 everything when it comes to looks 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.279
 I remember 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.379

 from that era 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.169

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.629
 the next month and talking about asse 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:20.329
 twenty years ago 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.830
 As for the technological advance, there has been now 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.129
 in this years 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.129
 if elisa has a system like this I know how long 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.499
 kind of 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:33.789
 stonemason and now that we have cante 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.789
 all the technological advances 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.789
 if that was in December 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.439
 the next month because you already seemed on your salary payment card 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.129

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.090
 so much for this credit of the current icf love then 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.729
 I understand and I already had a policy 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.349
 that he could not deduct more than 30% of the salary 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:00.569
 the professional 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.219
 to protect the family 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.309
 so 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:07.580
 pd told the love 500 bolivars 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.210
 Two hundred bolivia 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.789
 already the following month they tried to count 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.520
 during this week 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.520
 and there they were incorporating the interests of all 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.889
 an abortion 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.919
 for America who is a hospital worker 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.849
 It is not a person who goes down the street 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.589
 easy suddenly not 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:31.059
 you are deducted from your salary 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:33.210
 automatic 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.889
 That's possible, that can be done 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.029
 in Brazil it has a similar system 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.610
 for housing credit especially 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.610
 aimed at both public and private workers 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.099
 your work in a factory a private cauchera then hugo chávez 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.240
 and pay a thousand bolivars 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.159
 average salary out there 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.389
 a credit for housing 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.409
 the housing that 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.169
 they do not discount me 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.860
 of my salary 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.059
 even when it's from the private sector 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:09.659
 I'm automatically discounted and that happens to the payment 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.839
 making it credit 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:13.710
 it's an easy thing 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.379
 only that you have to work with a socialist sense 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.930
 and using it advanced and technology to achieve justice 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.319
 good me 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.749
 just like I did yesterday 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:30.150
 with a bank the bicentennial bank 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.169
 who was born 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.550
 bossio 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.969
 but you know that Carlos Marcelo said 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.240
 the new society 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.309
 born 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:40.990
 besides the old 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.990
 the inevitable 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.889
 I asked a boy who is going to buy ibaka 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.169

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.699
 and a microcredit 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.419
 that of a family company case-shiller 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:55.960

 how much do they charge 16 percent 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:03.779
 I asked noda 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:07.339
 The woman takes the bank as much as the bank charges the woman 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.599
 to 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:09.930
 to women 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.659
 poor of the emt cooperative st 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:14.449
 6% 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.740
 already the difference and in the same micro credit 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.830

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.740
