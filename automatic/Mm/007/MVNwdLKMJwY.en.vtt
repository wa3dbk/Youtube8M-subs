but<00:00:30.199> well<00:00:31.199> let's<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.250> say<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> video<00:00:32.879> of<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
but well let's just say the video of the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.580 
but well let's just say the video of the
unboxing<00:00:34.340> didn't<00:00:35.340> pan<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.289> we'll<00:00:37.289> take<00:00:37.440> it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
unboxing didn't pan out so we'll take it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.069 
unboxing didn't pan out so we'll take it
up<00:00:37.680> take<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> quick<00:00:38.640> look<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.930> would

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
up take a quick look at it and I would

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
up take a quick look at it and I would
like<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.289> take<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> few<00:00:40.710> minutes<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:42.379> compare<00:00:43.379> it

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
like to take a few minutes to compare it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
like to take a few minutes to compare it
to<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:45.230> samsung<00:00:47.870> droid<00:00:48.870> charge<00:00:50.510> which

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
to the samsung droid charge which

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
to the samsung droid charge which
currently<00:00:51.870> doesn't<00:00:52.109> have<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.440> memory<00:00:53.010> card<00:00:53.039> or

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
currently doesn't have a memory card or

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.040 
currently doesn't have a memory card or
a<00:00:53.609> sim<00:00:54.359> card<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.730> HTC<00:00:57.449> Thunderbolt

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
a sim card in it and the HTC Thunderbolt

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.040 
a sim card in it and the HTC Thunderbolt
so<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.280> guess<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.969> could<00:01:00.120> say<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.019> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so I guess you could say that this is a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.580 
so I guess you could say that this is a
little<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:01.769> of<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.719> verizon<00:01:03.719> 4g<00:01:04.080> LTE<00:01:04.830> showdown

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
like what I've seen so far in the first

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.470 
like what I've seen so far in the first
day<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.200> device<00:01:16.730> it<00:01:17.730> feels<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.210> nice

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
day with the device it feels really nice

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.130 
day with the device it feels really nice
and<00:01:18.810> snappy<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> past<00:01:20.910> I<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.300> not<00:01:21.510> been<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and snappy in the past I have not been a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.130 
and snappy in the past I have not been a
fan<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> motorola<00:01:24.420> devices<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> I've

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
fan of the motorola devices that I've

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.830 
fan of the motorola devices that I've
used<00:01:25.610> they've<00:01:26.610> always<00:01:26.850> felt<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:27.630> just

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
used they've always felt like they just

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.260 
used they've always felt like they just
had<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:29.690> little<00:01:30.690> bit<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.250> molasses<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.550> top<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
had a little bit of molasses on top of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.430 
had a little bit of molasses on top of
their<00:01:33.680> user<00:01:34.680> interface<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.840> believe<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.870> blur

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
their user interface I believe that blur

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.120 
their user interface I believe that blur
was<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.340> cause<00:01:38.550> of<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.530> we<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.650> using<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
was the cause of that and we are using a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.330 
was the cause of that and we are using a
new<00:01:42.350> blur<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:45.420> Bionic<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.920> seems<00:01:47.160> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
new blur on the Bionic and it seems to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.830 
new blur on the Bionic and it seems to
run<00:01:47.370> a<00:01:47.490> lot<00:01:47.670> snappier<00:01:47.910> of<00:01:48.270> course<00:01:48.480> it<00:01:48.660> doesn't

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
run a lot snappier of course it doesn't

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.020 
run a lot snappier of course it doesn't
hurt<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.800> first<00:01:50.040> dual<00:01:50.640> core

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
hurt that this is the first dual core

course<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.849> side<00:02:47.090> here<00:02:47.120> we<00:02:47.659> have<00:02:47.870> our

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
course on the side here we have our

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.330 
course on the side here we have our
micro<00:02:49.340> USB<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.030> micro<00:02:50.060> HDMI<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.230> don't<00:02:52.159> really

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
micro USB and micro HDMI I don't really

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.229 
micro USB and micro HDMI I don't really
use<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:52.819> micro<00:02:53.150> HDMI<00:02:54.049> port<00:02:54.409> on<00:02:54.590> any<00:02:54.920> device

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
use the micro HDMI port on any device

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.569 
use the micro HDMI port on any device
but<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.720> there<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.560> back<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.459> device

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
but it's there the back of the device

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.699 
but it's there the back of the device
has<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.870> nice<00:03:00.340> soft<00:03:01.340> touch<00:03:01.489> feel<00:03:01.939> to<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.180> and

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
has a nice soft touch feel to it and

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.369 
has a nice soft touch feel to it and
we've<00:03:03.709> got<00:03:03.829> the<00:03:03.950> camera<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.900> speaker<00:03:05.900> up

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
we've got the camera and the speaker up

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.119 
we've got the camera and the speaker up
there<00:03:06.889> as<00:03:07.250> well<00:03:08.209> as<00:03:08.389> a<00:03:08.420> microphone<00:03:09.019> large<00:03:09.680> that

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
there as well as a microphone large that

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.860 
there as well as a microphone large that
it<00:03:10.159> I<00:03:10.459> can<00:03:11.030> even<00:03:11.090> remember<00:03:11.180> now<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.599> might

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
it I can even remember now that might

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.930 
it I can even remember now that might
have<00:03:12.019> something<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.290> do<00:03:12.379> with<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.560> camera

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
have something to do with the camera

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.240 
have something to do with the camera
anyway<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:15.349> power<00:03:15.590> button<00:03:15.859> is<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:18.250> is

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
anyway the power button is a is

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.530 
anyway the power button is a is
something<00:03:19.639> that<00:03:19.699> always<00:03:19.879> look<00:03:20.180> at<00:03:20.299> on<00:03:20.419> these

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
something that always look at on these

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.089 
something that always look at on these
devices<00:03:20.690> it's<00:03:22.389> it's<00:03:23.389> kind<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.780> strange<00:03:24.099> it's

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
devices it's it's kind of strange it's

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.360 
devices it's it's kind of strange it's
it's<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.849> it's<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.449> top<00:03:26.720> here<00:03:27.169> and<00:03:27.349> there's<00:03:28.310> a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
it's it's it's on top here and there's a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.399 
it's it's it's on top here and there's a
little<00:03:28.579> bit<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.790> wiggle<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.329> can<00:03:29.480> if<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.169> play

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
little bit of wiggle you can if you play

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.839 
little bit of wiggle you can if you play
with<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:30.859> can<00:03:30.889> fill<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.340> wiggling<00:03:31.549> and

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
with it you can fill it wiggling and

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.270 
with it you can fill it wiggling and
it's<00:03:32.000> not<00:03:32.120> doing<00:03:32.419> anything<00:03:32.599> and<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:34.040> may<00:03:34.220> be

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
it's not doing anything and it may be

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.680 
it's not doing anything and it may be
that<00:03:34.370> I'm<00:03:34.609> just<00:03:34.790> not<00:03:34.879> used<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.359> location

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
that I'm just not used to the location

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.129 
that I'm just not used to the location
because<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.909> Thunderbolt<00:03:37.909> has<00:03:38.599> it<00:03:38.840> on<00:03:38.989> the

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
because the Thunderbolt has it on the

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.309 
because the Thunderbolt has it on the
opposite<00:03:39.530> side<00:03:39.739> of<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.859> phone<00:03:40.780> on<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.139> top

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
opposite side of the phone on the top

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.780 
opposite side of the phone on the top
and<00:03:42.530> then<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.739> course<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.129> charge<00:03:43.370> actually

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
and then of course the charge actually

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.569 
and then of course the charge actually
has<00:03:43.940> on<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.569> side<00:03:44.870> of<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.109> phone<00:03:45.319> so<00:03:46.280> maybe

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
has on the side of the phone so maybe

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.890 
has on the side of the phone so maybe
with<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:46.790> little<00:03:46.849> time<00:03:47.209> I'll<00:03:47.359> get<00:03:47.510> used<00:03:47.659> to<00:03:47.750> that

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
with a little time I'll get used to that

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.689 
with a little time I'll get used to that
and<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.079> won't<00:03:48.229> bother<00:03:48.379> me<00:03:50.169> the<00:03:51.699> capacitive

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
and it won't bother me the capacitive

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.270 
and it won't bother me the capacitive
buttons<00:03:52.729> are<00:03:53.500> fine<00:03:54.500> there's<00:03:54.859> nothing<00:03:54.889> really

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
buttons are fine there's nothing really

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.199 
buttons are fine there's nothing really
much<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.579> say<00:03:55.729> there<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:57.290> yeah<00:03:58.250> I<00:03:58.459> mean<00:03:58.519> it's<00:03:58.879> an

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
much to say there so yeah I mean it's an

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.050 
much to say there so yeah I mean it's an
android<00:03:59.359> device<00:03:59.510> it<00:04:00.019> runs<00:04:00.319> really<00:04:00.560> well<00:04:01.060> if

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
android device it runs really well if

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.099 
android device it runs really well if
you<00:04:02.180> want<00:04:02.359> to<00:04:02.449> compare<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:03.409> sizes<00:04:05.079> none<00:04:06.079> of

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
you want to compare the sizes none of

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.539 
you want to compare the sizes none of
these<00:04:06.260> devices<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:06.799> I<00:04:06.859> have<00:04:07.040> are<00:04:07.190> actually

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
these devices that I have are actually

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.259 
these devices that I have are actually
running<00:04:07.699> stock<00:04:08.659> software<00:04:09.579> they're<00:04:10.579> all<00:04:10.729> well

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
running stock software they're all well

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.849 
running stock software they're all well
this<00:04:11.629> is<00:04:11.659> stock<00:04:12.019> but<00:04:12.229> it's<00:04:12.349> rooted<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.650> other

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
this is stock but it's rooted the other

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.220 
this is stock but it's rooted the other
two<00:04:13.069> are<00:04:13.099> running<00:04:13.519> some<00:04:13.669> custom<00:04:14.000> roms

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
two are running some custom roms

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.830 
two are running some custom roms
but<00:04:15.980> if<00:04:16.040> you<00:04:16.130> want<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.310> look<00:04:16.459> at<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.850> size<00:04:17.479> of

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
but if you want to look at the size of

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.400 
but if you want to look at the size of
the<00:04:17.989> device<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.639> is<00:04:19.639> a<00:04:20.000> little<00:04:20.660> bit<00:04:20.840> thicker<00:04:21.199> or

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
the device it is a little bit thicker or

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.790 
the device it is a little bit thicker or
thinner<00:04:21.550> than<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.970> charge<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:24.560> course

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
thinner than the charge and of course

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.260 
thinner than the charge and of course
these<00:04:25.040> two<00:04:25.220> devices<00:04:25.460> can<00:04:25.820> be<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:26.000> little<00:04:26.180> tricky

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
these two devices can be a little tricky

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.379 
these two devices can be a little tricky
in<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:27.169> way<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.500> they<00:04:27.560> show<00:04:28.430> their<00:04:28.669> width<00:04:28.910> or

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
in the way that they show their width or

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.870 
in the way that they show their width or
the<00:04:29.449> thickness<00:04:29.990> rather<00:04:30.400> because<00:04:31.400> they<00:04:31.610> both

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
the thickness rather because they both

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.780 
the thickness rather because they both
have<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.770> Lighting's<00:04:34.100> not<00:04:34.160> right<00:04:34.520> here

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
have and the Lighting's not right here

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.719 
have and the Lighting's not right here
but<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:38.510> like<00:04:38.660> with<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:39.050> droid<00:04:39.320> x<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.889> little

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
but just like with the droid x a little

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.550 
but just like with the droid x a little
bit<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.030> thickening<00:04:41.449> here<00:04:41.810> it's<00:04:42.199> not<00:04:42.440> as

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
bit of a thickening here it's not as

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.290 
bit of a thickening here it's not as
drastic<00:04:42.889> as<00:04:43.250> it<00:04:43.310> was<00:04:43.520> with<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.699> droid<00:04:43.940> x<00:04:44.060> it's

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
drastic as it was with the droid x it's

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.050 
drastic as it was with the droid x it's
more<00:04:44.510> gradual<00:04:45.110> as<00:04:46.010> it<00:04:46.310> kind<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.550> just<00:04:46.729> slopes

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
more gradual as it kind of just slopes

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.870 
more gradual as it kind of just slopes
up<00:04:47.330> but<00:04:48.139> it<00:04:48.560> does<00:04:48.770> make<00:04:48.949> it<00:04:49.130> feel<00:04:49.160> thinner<00:04:49.669> in

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
up but it does make it feel thinner in

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.000 
up but it does make it feel thinner in
this<00:04:50.030> area<00:04:50.330> where<00:04:50.539> you're<00:04:50.660> holding<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.169> and<00:04:51.380> it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
this area where you're holding it and it

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.409 
this area where you're holding it and it
does<00:04:52.130> feel<00:04:52.340> thinner<00:04:52.610> in<00:04:52.789> the<00:04:52.880> hand<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.330> the

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
does feel thinner in the hand and the

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:59.110 
does feel thinner in the hand and the
droid<00:04:54.320> charge<00:04:55.419> similarly<00:04:56.419> as<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:58.250> thickening

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
droid charge similarly as a thickening

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.810 
droid charge similarly as a thickening
at<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.360> bottom<00:04:59.690> instead<00:04:59.930> of<00:05:00.050> at<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.229> top<00:05:00.820> so

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
at the bottom instead of at the top so

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.689 
at the bottom instead of at the top so
they<00:05:01.940> can<00:05:02.060> both<00:05:02.180> be<00:05:02.389> kind<00:05:02.600> of<00:05:02.690> deceptive<00:05:03.020> about

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
they can both be kind of deceptive about

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.620 
they can both be kind of deceptive about
their<00:05:04.699> thickness<00:05:05.000> because<00:05:05.479> they've

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
their thickness because they've

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:13.260 
their thickness because they've
distributed<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.410> dif<00:05:06.860> different<00:05:07.490> spots<00:05:10.180> the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.080 

Bionic<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.800> about<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:15.889> slip<00:05:16.070> out<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.310> my<00:05:16.340> hand

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.879 

there<00:05:20.090> we<00:05:20.240> go<00:05:20.860> so<00:05:21.860> if<00:05:22.310> you<00:05:22.430> look<00:05:22.550> at<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.729> height

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
there we go so if you look at the height

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.029 
there we go so if you look at the height
try<00:05:24.889> and<00:05:24.950> get<00:05:25.099> that<00:05:25.280> over<00:05:25.669> a<00:05:26.000> little<00:05:26.210> bit<00:05:27.039> the

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
try and get that over a little bit the

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.629 
try and get that over a little bit the
charge<00:05:28.310> is<00:05:28.460> just<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:29.030> little<00:05:29.660> bit<00:05:29.810> taller<00:05:30.639> so

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
charge is just a little bit taller so

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.790 
charge is just a little bit taller so
that's<00:05:31.970> not<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.150> big<00:05:32.360> deal<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:32.900> Thunderbolt<00:05:33.740> is

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
that's not a big deal the Thunderbolt is

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.580 
that's not a big deal the Thunderbolt is
actually<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.280> shortest<00:05:34.750> of<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.960> devices<00:05:36.260> is

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
actually the shortest of the devices is

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.140 
actually the shortest of the devices is
the<00:05:36.770> thickest<00:05:37.010> of<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.340> devices<00:05:37.639> as<00:05:38.000> the

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
the thickest of the devices as the

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.620 
the thickest of the devices as the
heaviest<00:05:38.450> of<00:05:38.599> the<00:05:38.720> devices<00:05:39.020> and<00:05:40.450> if<00:05:41.450> you're

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
heaviest of the devices and if you're

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.870 
heaviest of the devices and if you're
going<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.110> look<00:05:42.349> at<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.800> width<00:05:44.349> the

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.350 

it<00:05:49.930> looks<00:05:50.930> like<00:05:51.140> the<00:05:51.760> width<00:05:52.760> is<00:05:52.970> about<00:05:53.090> the

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
it looks like the width is about the

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.120 
it looks like the width is about the
same<00:05:53.570> on<00:05:53.810> these<00:05:53.960> devices<00:05:54.110> and<00:05:54.620> maybe<00:05:54.800> a<00:05:54.890> little

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
same on these devices and maybe a little

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.810 
same on these devices and maybe a little
bit<00:05:55.540> the<00:05:56.540> charge<00:05:56.810> may<00:05:57.050> be<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.350> width<00:05:57.890> width

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
bit the charge may be the width width

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.990 
bit the charge may be the width width
wise<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.330> widest<00:05:59.780> of<00:05:59.900> the<00:05:59.990> devices<00:06:00.290> so<00:06:01.280> as<00:06:01.610> far

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
wise the widest of the devices so as far

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.340 
wise the widest of the devices so as far
as<00:06:02.060> you<00:06:02.360> know<00:06:02.480> comparing<00:06:02.870> it<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.110> other

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
as you know comparing it to the other

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.380 
as you know comparing it to the other
devices<00:06:03.590> and<00:06:03.920> having<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.160> in<00:06:04.250> your<00:06:04.370> hand<00:06:04.640> it

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
devices and having it in your hand it

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.960 
devices and having it in your hand it
feels<00:06:05.740> feels<00:06:06.740> really<00:06:06.980> nice<00:06:07.190> not<00:06:07.580> that<00:06:07.730> any<00:06:07.880> of

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
feels feels really nice not that any of

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.790 
feels feels really nice not that any of
these<00:06:08.150> really<00:06:08.480> felt<00:06:08.720> bad<00:06:08.930> it<00:06:09.320> feels<00:06:09.530> nice<00:06:09.740> and

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
these really felt bad it feels nice and

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.190 
these really felt bad it feels nice and
sturdy<00:06:10.160> the<00:06:11.030> build<00:06:11.270> quality<00:06:11.420> maybe<00:06:11.900> a<00:06:12.050> little

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
sturdy the build quality maybe a little

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.630 
sturdy the build quality maybe a little
bit<00:06:12.380> better<00:06:12.590> than<00:06:12.860> what<00:06:13.070> we've<00:06:13.190> seen<00:06:13.220> on<00:06:13.730> the

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
bit better than what we've seen on the

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.100 
bit better than what we've seen on the
Thunderbolt<00:06:16.640> and<00:06:18.910> as<00:06:19.910> far<00:06:20.240> as<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.720> user

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
Thunderbolt and as far as the user

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.630 
Thunderbolt and as far as the user
interface<00:06:21.320> just<00:06:21.890> kind<00:06:22.070> of<00:06:22.130> pulling<00:06:22.370> it<00:06:22.520> out<00:06:22.580> of

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
interface just kind of pulling it out of

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.450 
interface just kind of pulling it out of
the<00:06:22.760> box<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.300> stock<00:06:23.870> user<00:06:24.110> interface<00:06:24.590> was<00:06:24.920> the

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
the box the stock user interface was the

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.190 
the box the stock user interface was the
Thunderbolt<00:06:25.970> was<00:06:26.120> really<00:06:26.390> snappy<00:06:26.810> the<00:06:26.930> charge

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
Thunderbolt was really snappy the charge

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.840 
Thunderbolt was really snappy the charge
was<00:06:27.500> not<00:06:28.010> so<00:06:28.280> much<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:30.220> this<00:06:31.220> is<00:06:31.460> right<00:06:31.640> there

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
was not so much and this is right there

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.670 
was not so much and this is right there
with<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.090> Thunderbolt<00:06:32.570> I<00:06:32.750> think<00:06:33.560> it's

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
with the Thunderbolt I think it's

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.020 
with the Thunderbolt I think it's
probably<00:06:33.800> Louis<00:06:34.220> snappier<00:06:34.640> but<00:06:34.760> it's<00:06:34.880> been<00:06:35.000> a

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
probably Louis snappier but it's been a

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.760 
probably Louis snappier but it's been a
while<00:06:35.210> since<00:06:35.390> I've<00:06:35.600> used<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:35.990> stock

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
while since I've used the stock

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.510 
while since I've used the stock
Thunderbolt<00:06:37.370> user<00:06:37.610> interface<00:06:38.090> and<00:06:39.520> yeah

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
Thunderbolt user interface and yeah

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.860 
Thunderbolt user interface and yeah
there's<00:06:40.760> a<00:06:40.820> lot<00:06:40.970> of<00:06:41.000> liked<00:06:41.210> about<00:06:41.330> luck<00:06:41.660> about

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
there's a lot of liked about luck about

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.080 
there's a lot of liked about luck about
