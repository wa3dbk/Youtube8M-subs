00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.240 

printing<00:02:04.380> itself<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.890> actually<00:02:05.040> quite

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
printing itself is actually quite

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.039 
printing itself is actually quite
interesting<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.969> watch<00:02:06.090> once<00:02:06.420> your<00:02:06.659> phone<00:02:06.869> has

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
connected to the printer and you make

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.520 
connected to the printer and you make
sure<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> prince<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> simply<00:02:09.810> hit<00:02:10.410> the

thing
you'll<00:02:13.680> notice<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.750> photo<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:15.960> is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
you'll notice that the photo actually is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.680 
you'll notice that the photo actually is
printed<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.590> several<00:02:16.890> stages<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:18.570> it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
printed in several stages so as it as it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.420 
printed in several stages so as it as it
comes<00:02:18.810> out<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.080> comes<00:02:19.380> out<00:02:19.530> stages<00:02:19.830> first

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
comes out it comes out stages first

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.130 
comes out it comes out stages first
print<00:02:20.760> then<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.060> goes<00:02:21.180> back<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.510> second<00:02:21.960> third

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
print then it goes back in second third

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.230 
print then it goes back in second third
until<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:23.430> finally<00:02:23.850> done

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
until it's finally done

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.910 
until it's finally done
it<00:02:24.840> only<00:02:24.990> takes<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.350> couple<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.590> minutes<00:02:25.800> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
it only takes a couple of minutes and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.140 
it only takes a couple of minutes and
actually<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.280> quite<00:02:26.400> interesting<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.000> watch

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
actually it's quite interesting to watch

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.690 
actually it's quite interesting to watch
as<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.720> photo<00:02:28.070> literally<00:02:29.070> develops<00:02:29.490> before

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
with an Android phone this photo was

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.830 
with an Android phone this photo was
taken<00:03:19.950> with<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.430> DSLR<00:03:20.820> camera<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.390> holiday<00:03:21.780> so

the<00:03:22.230> calls<00:03:22.440> are<00:03:22.620> much<00:03:22.800> brighter<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.310> was<00:03:23.460> it<00:03:23.610> at

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
the calls are much brighter it was it at

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.540 
the calls are much brighter it was it at
the<00:03:24.300> seaside<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:25.380> quite<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> different<00:03:26.340> image
