00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello to all and sarens for a 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.259
 Christian points like new video 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.880
 so the minutes board today on 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.870
 will focus on the importance of a 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.100
 techno in pvp 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.529
 taking shares is taking 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.789
 of information you know why everything 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.140
 simply use a facto while 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.710
 you just do not like 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 need 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 TV in fact especially if you wear 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.300
 flight we go so this is influence of a 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.949
 facto a factory in French for 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 just panic 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.670
 and precisely its importance in in the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.040
 game then we left so we of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.500
 spam once again so we have the eight 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.309
 stalker 5 zealot against 4 a marauder 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.870
 and 12 marries no so he goes without pak 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.370
 have nothing at all we will take them on 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.410
 obviously fight the sign to ebooks and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.059
 roma are de rigueur you can see 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.890
 than the ones that store them are well 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.910
 focus so on on the opposing army all 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.430
 simply the best tides 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.050
 think i'm quite expensive but in the end the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.840
 store who will still succeed in getting 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.549
 get rid of the classic army 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.650
 have to say no big surprise 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.600
 really sure about the fit 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 the clash we will add after a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.450
 pac which we always have the same 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.030
 composition the apact one is here you 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.950
 see sail and rejected all that bill 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.220
 where will lead her 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.259
 Obviously in game you will have it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.780
 hope in control in which we will return 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.580
 also on the payment on oneself that we know 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.560
 minutes either in any case on another 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.670
 per month that I hope to go out very 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.049
 soon but in any case it's not 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.939
 the subject for so we have the same 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.180
 composition on both sides store 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.500
 the marauders so we'll go to 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.549
 the attack the pac to the gifts that it takes and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.470
 guys like you can see the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.820
 destackers but precisely the pilots 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.049
 who are left a little unprepared 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.130
 again the hockey dough took 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.530
 some damage but behind 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.750
 structures have not been successful for 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.070
 that precisely your units as 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.630
 terranère you can see little the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 difference is still another 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.409
 negligible in the end you have you 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.719
 had three structures that was just winning 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.600
 before now with the photo that has 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.280
 took the damage on precisely the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.930
 store and that's they left the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.719
 drivers just abandoned behind 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.310
 you can enjoy it with so you 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.619
 to marry your husbands knowing that there 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.840
 for us we have not added the non-rhône 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.730
 more 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.110
 crazy but in any case this is the small 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.959
 difference that uses a compact 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.900
 world is attacked in protos more 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.400
 information and impact during a team 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.080
 fight in a lease simply 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.140
 moors a push timing you would like 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.910
 put in place that was the council 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.230
 minutes it was a dream for eclipse 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.090
 yagg.com we find ourselves very 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.739
 soon for more on 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.220
