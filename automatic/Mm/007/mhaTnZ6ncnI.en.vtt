00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
then I noticed this see next to it so it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
then I noticed this see next to it so it
was<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.330> great<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.840> fine<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> managed<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
was a great little fine so I managed to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:22.300 
was a great little fine so I managed to
sneak<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.790> back<00:01:14.970> into<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.360> car<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.700> here<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.219 

unfortunately<00:01:23.299> this<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.540> a<00:01:23.570> really<00:01:23.990> poor

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
unfortunately this is a really poor

unfortunately this is a really poor
quality<00:01:24.680> camera<00:01:25.159> i'm<00:01:25.250> using<00:01:25.640> my<00:01:25.759> other<00:01:25.909> camera

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
isn't quite working at the moment so the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.969 
isn't quite working at the moment so the
flicker<00:01:35.329> is<00:01:35.689> probably<00:01:36.320> pretty<00:01:36.530> noticeable

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
flicker is probably pretty noticeable

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.760
