 since nothing else you get out of the bag and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.760

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 It does not take you long and good people 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.070
 will think that you spend 50 hours in 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.610
 the kitchen the ingredients are the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.960
 following 200 grams of chopped ham if 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.410
 you can order the thick slice and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 chop it finally is perfect 225 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.550
 grams of softened cream cheese 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.640
 half a cup of celery chopped celery 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.500
 apply it very finite and the same with the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.940
 onion that is also half a cup of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.940
 chopped onion very thin 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.830
 we're also going to need a quarter of 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.140
 cream can be the one you want you can 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.990
 be cream city cream 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.230
 there is no major problem we are also a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.880
 to a quarter of a cup of water and an envelope 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.799
 of grenetina 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.969
 The first thing we are going to do is good as 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.649
 I already told you is to bite our 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.649
 ingredients chop our ham 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.140
 chop the celery 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.220
 chop the onion 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.640
 and in a mold you are going to put these 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.939
 ingredients together with cheese and 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.939
 cream 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 and you will stir them very well until 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.920
 is a very even mix very 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.920
 homogeneous 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.709
 after this in a cacerolita 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.590
 well because the truth in the water is 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.130
 very little you are going to put the water and 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.620
 you add the sprinkle the grenetina the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.380
 grenetina so that it can curdle 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.510
 It has to warm up but do not go to 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.670
 put in hot water because when one 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.690
 add the grenetina to the hot lake 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.880
 It makes very chic those of then it's 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.010
 very difficult to dissolve then first 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.050
 we sprinkle it in cold water since 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.970
 is in the cold water we put it to 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.709
 heat at low temperature and move it 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.709
 that is perfectly dissolved 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.140
 and this you are going to add it to the mix 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.620
 of ham and cheese and the bind 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.540
 as it is very very very even what 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.540
 revolves are stirred by revolves 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.459
 you are going to pass a mold this mold a 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.030
 refractory mold anybody goes 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.670
 unmold I know very easy the secret is that 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.670
 the gears add your mix 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.680
 and you put it in the refrigerator this mix 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.560
 it has to be in the refrigerator by 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.210
 at least 4 hours to set if it is 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.190
 more time do not worry it does not happen 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.470
 nothing if you want to do it a day before or 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.000
 in the morning to use it at night if 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.070
 he spends more than 4 hours does not happen 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.180
 absolutely nothing covered that yes to 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.420
 that does not absorb other odors 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.300
 refrigerator and ready you have this for 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.330
 your food another thing is a quantity 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.550
 pretty important product 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.310
 if you have 10 guests 15 are very good 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.110
 if not what you do is do half or 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.150
 a quarter and you're doing the proportion 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.010
 ingredients and ready a smaller mold 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.200
 you are measuring what is what 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.550
 You want the same, you want, you do not have 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.700
 than having guests even for your 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.890
 family and your children the molds 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.480
 more very nice tester in ham like you 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.300

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.360
 a few leaves of parsley is to your liking 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.340

 nice to unmold a cupcake and if 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.750
 you have a more elaborate mold of flower or 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.370
 of thread is also worth it or put it in 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.830
 the cookies the question with the 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.420
 cookies is that you're going to serve 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.920
 immediately and that they put it on 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.110
 immediately because if it is not watered down the 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.130
 cookie you get to keep good we're going to 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.130
