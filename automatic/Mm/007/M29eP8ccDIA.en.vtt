00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
difference with a robotic makers it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.550 
difference with a robotic makers it
meets<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> cow<00:01:14.570> 24/7<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.020> color<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> cows

meets the cow 24/7 the color the cows
just<00:01:16.799> walk<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.400> they're<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
just walk up to it they're going it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.010 
just walk up to it they're going it
milsim<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:20.220> don't<00:01:20.460> really<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.729> any

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
milsim so we don't really have any

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.240 
milsim so we don't really have any
interaction<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> cow<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.799> has<00:01:22.979> helped
