and make it my own and I actually knew

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.709 
and make it my own and I actually knew
that<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.039> wanted<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.489> get<00:00:47.700> my<00:00:47.850> hair<00:00:48.059> cut<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.480> some

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that I wanted to get my hair cut at some

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.360 
that I wanted to get my hair cut at some
point<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.530> been<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> while<00:00:49.920> since<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
point because it's been a while since I

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.060 
point because it's been a while since I
had<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> cut<00:00:50.960> but<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.559> figured<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> would<00:00:53.039> be

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
had a cut but I just figured it would be

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
had a cut but I just figured it would be
a<00:00:53.190> great<00:00:53.460> way<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> end<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> challenge<00:00:54.570> just

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
a great way to end the challenge just

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.830 
a great way to end the challenge just
because<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.770> ready<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.160> something<00:00:56.340> new

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
because I was ready for something new

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
because I was ready for something new
after<00:00:57.840> finishing<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.559> 30<00:00:58.829> days<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.370> think<00:00:59.730> what

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
after finishing in 30 days I think what

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
after finishing in 30 days I think what
surprised<00:01:00.329> me<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.629> most<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.320> didn't

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
surprised me the most is that I didn't

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.549 
surprised me the most is that I didn't
know<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.579> hair<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.090> capable<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
know what my hair was capable of and I

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.260 
know what my hair was capable of and I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
think like for other people to take

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870 
think like for other people to take
inspiration<00:01:06.570> from<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:08.280> they<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.760> do

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
