00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
first time I think that we were ever in

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.060 
first time I think that we were ever in
a<00:00:47.100> boat<00:00:47.340> together<00:00:49.610> was<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> Marquesas

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
primary flat Jose zero a water

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.420 
primary flat Jose zero a water
temperature<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.160> too

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
temperature which you think it's too

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.160

warm<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:02.940> these<00:01:03.270> fish<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.539> come<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
warm for these fish to come up on the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.370 
warm for these fish to come up on the
flats<00:01:04.519> yeah<00:01:05.519> flip<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:06.960> like

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
flats yeah flip I think they they like

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
flats yeah flip I think they they like
to<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> certain<00:01:08.189> temperature<00:01:08.729> I'd<00:01:09.090> say

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to have a certain temperature I'd say

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.620 
to have a certain temperature I'd say
it's<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.930> around<00:01:10.100> from<00:01:11.100> 70<00:01:11.700> degrees<00:01:12.090> I'd

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's right around from 70 degrees I'd

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.330 
it's right around from 70 degrees I'd
say<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.200> 85

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
say to about 85

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.760 
say to about 85
they'll<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.150> happy<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.990> shallow<00:01:16.229> waters<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
they'll be happy in the shallow waters I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
they'll be happy in the shallow waters I
think<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.220> much<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.670> 85<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.479> they

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
think you get much over 85 and they

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.710 
think you get much over 85 and they
start<00:01:19.560> getting<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.490> deep<00:01:20.670> end<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.150> know

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
start getting off the deep end you know

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
start getting off the deep end you know
do<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.140> find<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> even<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> water<00:01:23.880> gets

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
do you find that even if the water gets

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.570 
do you find that even if the water gets
over<00:01:24.540> 75<00:01:25.110> degrees<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> find<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
over 75 degrees do you find that that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.999 
over 75 degrees do you find that that
exceptionally<00:01:27.420> good<00:01:27.659> current<00:01:28.409> flow<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
exceptionally good current flow and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.999 
exceptionally good current flow and
strong<00:01:29.520> tides<00:01:29.909> will<00:01:30.619> override<00:01:31.619> water

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
strong tides will override water

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.700 
strong tides will override water

deep channel up on top of the bank and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.550 
deep channel up on top of the bank and
then<00:01:51.090> flows<00:01:51.420> right<00:01:51.630> off<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.140> those<00:01:52.229> fish<00:01:52.409> will

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
then flows right off and those fish will

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
then flows right off and those fish will
get<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.009> feed<00:01:53.250> yeah<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.210> instinct

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
get up there and feed yeah so instinct

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.889 
get up there and feed yeah so instinct
to<00:01:55.290> feed<00:01:55.619> overrides<00:01:56.340> their<00:01:56.790> comfort<00:01:57.329> zone<00:01:57.570> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
to feed overrides their comfort zone so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.410 
to feed overrides their comfort zone so

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.289 
and you don't know if they're spooking
or<00:03:11.250> eating<00:03:11.900> that's<00:03:12.900> probably<00:03:13.200> one<00:03:13.349> of<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.530> two

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299

Jose<00:03:15.299> I<00:03:15.329> you<00:03:15.540> know<00:03:15.810> something<00:03:16.200> permit<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.829> don't

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
Jose I you know something permit I don't

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.309 
Jose I you know something permit I don't
know<00:03:17.220> what<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.549> about<00:03:17.790> permit<00:03:18.389> I<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.810> think

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
know what it is about permit I I think

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.259 
know what it is about permit I I think
that<00:03:19.440> they're<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.709> most<00:03:19.889> difficult<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.940> all

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
that they're the most difficult of all

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.240 
that they're the most difficult of all
of<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.599> flats<00:03:21.900> fish<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.590> tropical<00:03:23.069> waters

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
of the flats fish in the tropical waters

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.250 
of the flats fish in the tropical waters
I<00:03:23.730> think<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.180> got<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.480> agree<00:03:24.660> with<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.930> there

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
I think I got to agree with you there

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.080 
I think I got to agree with you there
but<00:03:25.440> they're<00:03:26.400> certainly<00:03:26.609> one<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
but they're certainly one of the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.900 
but they're certainly one of the
spookiest<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.840> know<00:03:27.959> as<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:28.290> seen<00:03:29.250> today<00:03:29.609> I

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
spookiest you know as you seen today I

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.240 
spookiest you know as you seen today I
think<00:03:30.299> it's<00:03:30.569> harder<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.169> the<00:03:31.319> angler<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:31.829> it's

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
think it's harder on the angler and it's

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.640 
think it's harder on the angler and it's
harder<00:03:32.609> on<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.880> boatman<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.630> properly<00:03:34.440> work

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
harder on the boatman to properly work

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.039 
harder on the boatman to properly work
