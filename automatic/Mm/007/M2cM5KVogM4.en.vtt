on throughout the night for example the
summer<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.870> will<00:04:22.110> slowly<00:04:22.590> drain<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.220> battery

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
summer I will slowly drain the battery

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.580 
summer I will slowly drain the battery
that's<00:04:23.880> why<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.180> believe<00:04:24.450> we<00:04:25.320> have<00:04:25.470> an

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
that's why I believe we have an

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.080 
that's why I believe we have an
indicator<00:04:25.950> light<00:04:26.220> on<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.430> front<00:04:26.580> panel<00:04:26.970> in
