alright the other technique is called
the<00:02:35.090> J<00:02:35.330> hook<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:36.770> technique<00:02:37.900> John<00:02:38.900> will

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the J hook for this technique John will

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.630 
the J hook for this technique John will
pick<00:02:39.200> whatever<00:02:39.500> foot<00:02:39.709> he<00:02:39.830> wants<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.160> use<00:02:40.340> again

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
pick whatever foot he wants to use again

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.510 
pick whatever foot he wants to use again
the<00:02:41.200> rope<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.350> gonna<00:02:42.470> be<00:02:42.680> on<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.950> outside<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
the rope is gonna be on the outside you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.150 
the rope is gonna be on the outside you
want<00:02:43.580> right<00:02:44.060> foot<00:02:44.440> okay<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.709> Rope<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:45.950> gonna

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
be on the outside of his foot okay then

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.840 
be on the outside of his foot okay then
he's<00:02:51.110> gonna<00:02:51.200> take<00:02:51.440> his<00:02:51.560> other<00:02:51.740> leg<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.280> wrap

he's gonna take his other leg and wrap

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.670 
he's gonna take his other leg and wrap
it<00:02:53.060> underneath<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:55.150> step<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.870> rope<00:02:57.110> right

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it underneath and step on the rope right

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.880 
it underneath and step on the rope right
there<00:02:57.890> creating<00:02:58.459> an<00:02:58.670> anchor<00:02:59.360> point<00:02:59.390> okay<00:03:00.020> this

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
there creating an anchor point okay this

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.820 
there creating an anchor point okay this
one's<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.250> little<00:03:01.400> more<00:03:01.580> complicated<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:03.680> it's

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
one's a little more complicated but it's

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.430 
one's a little more complicated but it's
probably<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.250> little<00:03:04.370> quicker<00:03:04.730> as<00:03:04.940> well<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:06.140> if

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
probably a little quicker as well so if

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.140 
probably a little quicker as well so if
you're<00:03:06.650> comfortable<00:03:06.980> with<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.340> that's

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
you're comfortable with that that's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.640 
you're comfortable with that that's
that's<00:03:08.720> how<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.900> want<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.440> want<00:03:09.590> to

good stand up I think I was back down in
the<00:03:45.040> same<00:03:45.310> way

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
the same way

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.210 
the same way
keeping<00:03:46.629> that<00:03:46.750> rope<00:03:47.110> in<00:03:47.379> that<00:03:47.650> same<00:03:47.920> foot

keeping that rope in that same foot

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.339 
keeping that rope in that same foot
position<00:03:49.769> this<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:51.250> climb<00:03:51.519> is<00:03:51.549> a<00:03:51.760> little<00:03:52.349> not

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
position this this climb is a little not

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.710 
position this this climb is a little not
as<00:03:53.500> secure<00:03:53.860> as<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.099> Spanish<00:03:54.549> rap<00:03:54.819> but<00:03:55.480> it's<00:03:55.629> a

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
as secure as a Spanish rap but it's a

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.789 
as secure as a Spanish rap but it's a
little<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:55.989> guess<00:03:56.110> that's<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.349> little<00:03:56.530> quicker

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
little I guess that's a little quicker

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
what's kind of the benchmark for how

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.210 
what's kind of the benchmark for how
many<00:04:25.539> rope<00:04:26.229> climbs<00:04:26.440> you're<00:04:26.560> going<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.740> do<00:04:26.889> yeah

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
many rope climbs you're going to do yeah

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.060 
many rope climbs you're going to do yeah
so<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.520> competition<00:04:28.120> we<00:04:28.660> could<00:04:28.810> do<00:04:29.070> any

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
so in competition we could do any

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.370 
so in competition we could do any
anywhere<00:04:30.639> from<00:04:30.850> between<00:04:31.419> maybe<00:04:31.840> about<00:04:32.110> five

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
anywhere from between maybe about five

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.939 
anywhere from between maybe about five
reps<00:04:32.699> five<00:04:33.699> climbs<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.330> about<00:04:34.810> 15<00:04:35.260> climbs<00:04:35.650> and

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
reps five climbs to about 15 climbs and

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.540 
reps five climbs to about 15 climbs and
the<00:04:36.490> rope<00:04:36.699> could<00:04:36.880> be<00:04:37.060> between<00:04:37.449> 15<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.199> say<00:04:39.070> 25

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
the rope could be between 15 and say 25

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.700 
the rope could be between 15 and say 25
foot<00:04:39.849> and<00:04:40.270> you're<00:04:40.419> doing<00:04:40.690> that<00:04:40.870> for<00:04:41.139> time<00:04:41.349> you

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
foot and you're doing that for time you

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.950 
foot and you're doing that for time you
know<00:04:42.039> with<00:04:42.550> other<00:04:42.699> stuff<00:04:43.000> involved<00:04:43.449> -<00:04:43.599> so<00:04:43.840> your

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
know with other stuff involved - so your

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.230 
know with other stuff involved - so your
heart<00:04:44.169> rates<00:04:44.349> high<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:45.400> that's<00:04:45.639> that's<00:04:45.970> kind

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
heart rates high so that's that's kind

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.750 
heart rates high so that's that's kind
of<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.510> an<00:04:47.380> idea<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.830> about<00:04:48.039> what<00:04:48.250> we<00:04:48.400> would<00:04:48.580> do

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
of a an idea of about what we would do

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.120 
of a an idea of about what we would do
with<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.320> great<00:04:50.320> so<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.560> might<00:04:50.710> not<00:04:50.830> start

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
with that great so you might not start

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.800 
with that great so you might not start
there<00:04:51.430> but<00:04:51.639> that's<00:04:51.729> a<00:04:51.880> goal<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.180> shoot<00:04:52.330> for

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
there but that's a goal to shoot for

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.450 
there but that's a goal to shoot for
I'm<00:04:53.320> Andy<00:04:53.620> Haley<00:04:53.889> and<00:04:54.039> thank<00:04:54.250> you<00:04:54.310> for
