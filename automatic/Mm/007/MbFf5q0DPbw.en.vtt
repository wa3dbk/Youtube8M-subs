00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
that this tip is actually sharper and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.270 
that this tip is actually sharper and
smaller<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.929> kind<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.379> dig<00:02:10.649> things<00:02:11.009> out

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
smaller I can kind of dig things out

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.020 
smaller I can kind of dig things out
with<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.760> try<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.359> next<00:02:12.600> time<00:02:14.030> that's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
with that try that next time that's

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.699 
with that try that next time that's
that's<00:02:15.359> a<00:02:15.540> little<00:02:15.600> tip<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:16.139> wasn't<00:02:16.410> even<00:02:16.590> going

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
that's a little tip I wasn't even going

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.509 
that's a little tip I wasn't even going
to<00:02:16.769> share<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.019> all<00:02:19.519> okay

to share with you you get it all okay
now<00:02:21.420> I'm<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.019> flip<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.410> around<00:02:23.299> with

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
now I'm going to flip this around with

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.020 
now I'm going to flip this around with
the<00:02:24.480> handle<00:02:25.670> going<00:02:26.670> down<00:02:27.859> and<00:02:28.859> it<00:02:29.100> should<00:02:29.370> push

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the handle going down and it should push

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.599 
the handle going down and it should push
right<00:02:30.389> on<00:02:30.660> there<00:02:30.900> look<00:02:31.109> at<00:02:31.230> that

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.830 

remember<00:02:35.609> this<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.000> was<00:02:36.120> over<00:02:36.359> there<00:02:36.540> that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
remember this one was over there that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.250 
remember this one was over there that
one<00:02:37.200> was<00:02:37.380> over<00:02:37.560> here<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.510> just<00:02:39.510> take<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.720> and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
one was over here I just take that and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.750 
one was over here I just take that and
it<00:02:40.380> slides<00:02:40.680> right<00:02:40.889> on<00:02:41.040> where<00:02:41.459> it's<00:02:41.549> supposed

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
it slides right on where it's supposed

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.860 
it slides right on where it's supposed
to<00:02:41.849> be<00:02:42.410> like<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:44.150> see<00:02:45.150> how<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.389> handle

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
to be like that see how this handle

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.199 
to be like that see how this handle
folds<00:02:46.410> over<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:47.130> way<00:02:47.340> that's<00:02:47.609> the<00:02:47.819> proper

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
folds over that way that's the proper

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.949 
folds over that way that's the proper
