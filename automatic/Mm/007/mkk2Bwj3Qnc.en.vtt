00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:02.362
 I came to talk to the gods 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.220
 They are angry, Rollo 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.700
 I can not imagine a world where there is one god and several 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.520
 I heard about Christians and their gods. 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.660
 Without the word of the Lord there will be only darkness 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.120
 There can be no reconciliation between our true gods and the god they worship. 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.920
 God bless paris 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.720
 God save England 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.900
 What do you want to ask the gods 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.080
 What is Ragnarok? 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.980
 What is a miracle? 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.240
 Glory to Odin, Torah and Freyr 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.060
 In the name of the father, son, and holy spirit, amen 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.400
 The gods have always been fair to me 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.820
 I want to know if the gods will be kind to me again 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.600
 We offer you a chance to excel in battle, impress the gods and come back with such booty that you could not even imagine 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.540
 In the name of the Lord, who are you? 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.560
 In the gentle rain that comes from heaven, I see my god, but in the thunder I still hear the Torah 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 Thor was angry with us. We saw it and heard the screams of people. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.560
 They have a different moral than us 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.980
 Sometimes your god is like one of ours. 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 Do you not see what the gods are trying to tell us? 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.240
 Is she ("the morality of the pagans") no more natural? 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.160
 My father, you and me 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.340
 we are all descendants of Odin 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 He is a descendant of Odin. 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.700
 Harbard is another name for Odin 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.740
 You want the gods to notice you 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.180
 Where is your faith? 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.820
 They already noticed me 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.940
 Who are these gods that do not let me sleep and torment me 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.760
 You do not hide not from your god, not from ours 

00:02:13.214 --> 00:02:16.914
 They honor the false god. They are only fleas, pests. 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.400
 Until we die for the sake of your Christians? 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.200
 Flocks 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.300
 Priest 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.320
 The gods themselves decided 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.520
 Know the gods will be pleased 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.980
 Gods, why did I infuriate you? 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.100
 I wonder what I have done, since the gods were so angry 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.660
 You betrayed the gods 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.480
 I have always been faithful to the gods 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.980
 God is One here 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.900
 One, I'm coming to you 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.560
 Some wise men say that these northerners were sent to us by the Lord 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.900
 The Lord understands how weak we are in our trials. 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.180
 God of all gods 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.940
 father 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.520
 hear my prayer 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.300
 I hope one day our gods can become friends 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.980
 I'm glad the gods were so stupid that they saved you 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.140
 The gods
