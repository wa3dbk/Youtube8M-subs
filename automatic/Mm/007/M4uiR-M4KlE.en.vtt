00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.129
 today we have to prepare brownie 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.960
 chocolate and nuts in the microwave to 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:19.630
 we need 80 grams of flour 80 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.380
 grams of nuts half on yeast 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:27.789
 Royal chemistry 125 grams of butter 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:33.130
 3 eggs 125 grams of dark chocolate 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:35.739
 for desserts 3 tablespoons of milk 125 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 grams of sugar and a little cocoa in 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.000
 powder to put in the mold 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.600
 in a container we have put 125 grams 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.710
 of butter and 125 grams of chocolate 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.470
 now we are going to introduce it to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.750
 microwave to melt it we'll start 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.910
 with a minute and we'll take it out for 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.800
 see if it's enough or you have to add 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.430
 some more minute 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.390
 we have put in this three vessel 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.600
 eggs and 125 sugar now we're going to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.320
 Beat well until it is sparkling and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.320
 whitish 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.060
 ah 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.450
 you see how the volume has increased and 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.980
 has been so sparkling and white 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.530
 that now we have it mounted 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.460
 then we add 3 tablespoons 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.460
 milk tureens 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.770
 and I'll move the mix well 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.820
 ah 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.040
 once we have melted the butter and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.310
 We hope the chocolate is not 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.340
 too hot to add the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.820
 to the other container of the eggs and the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.190
 sugar we will pour it and with the tongue 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.140
 we will remove it with movements 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.140
 envelopes until mixed well 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.540
 we have done collectively 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.340
 and we mix this well 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.349
 and finally we add the flour and the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.010
 yeast passed through a colander to 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.010
 sift the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.000
 we will mix all again with 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.000
 envolvent movements 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.910
 we already have all the well mixed 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.580
 ingredients 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.370
 and finally we have here the nuts 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.830
 we have chopped and we have submerged them 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.130
 little with water so that you add them 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.290
 cocoa powder and remove them later 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.690
 let's get to the bottom 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.300
 of the brownies 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.580
 with the cocoa jewel or with the cao tail 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.960
 with what you want then in season to 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.110
 film a little non-slip that at 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.600
 add the alborna oven then the times 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.050
 they are more spread out in all 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.050
 levels 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.880
 the mold that we are going to use we have 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:54.040
 Smeared a little with butter and 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:58.020
 we have added cocoa now we are going to 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.440
 to move cocoa through the walls 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.560
 to then be able to demold the brou well 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.560
 Y 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.650
 Well it's time to take our 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.650
 mix to the mold 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.330
 and we add the nuts 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.900
 a spoon and helping the 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.900
 we sink a little 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.300
 because then go when making 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.750
 Brownies are going to move towards the 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.750
 background 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.650
 we help them a little bit but not the 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.650
 we sink in excess 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:22.590
 Now we will put the mold in the microwave 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:26.110
 800 watts 5 minutes 40 seconds 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.300
 After that time we will not open the 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.550
 microwave door 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.940
 we will continue leaving it with the microwave 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.099
 off 5 more minutes without opening the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.430
 microwave door 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.840
 we just removed the brownie from the micro 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.940
 once the 5 minutes have finished 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.560
 40 seconds you know that I have 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:50.259
 opened the door for another five 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.060
 minutes more is the fluffy texture but 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:56.460
 you have to wait for it to cool down to 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.250
 be able to unmold what to expect 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.700
 once cold we have disassembled the brownie 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.670
 and you see 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.730
 it looks so rich that it has not 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.240
 talk about the taste because it's super super 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.240
 rich
