00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
area pretty much pretty much everybody

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.220 
area pretty much pretty much everybody
focusing<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.010> even<00:00:50.399> though<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.520> did<00:00:50.760> get<00:00:50.940> some

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
focusing on even though I did get some

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.750 
focusing on even though I did get some
some<00:00:52.230> backlash<00:00:52.590> against<00:00:53.039> my<00:00:53.160> hamstrings<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
some backlash against my hamstrings a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.610 
some backlash against my hamstrings a
little<00:00:53.789> bit<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.120> 2011<00:00:54.960> which<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.260> never<00:00:55.440> really

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
little bit in 2011 which is never really

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.099 
little bit in 2011 which is never really
i<00:00:55.890> thought<00:00:56.250> been<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> problem<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.719> focused

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
i thought been a problem but we focused

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.979 
i thought been a problem but we focused
on<00:00:58.230> them<00:00:58.350> anyway<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.180> basically<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.870> I've

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
on them anyway and basically what I've

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.560 
on them anyway and basically what I've
noticed<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:02.340> over<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.850> body<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.359> general

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
noticed is all over my body in general

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140 
noticed is all over my body in general
of<00:01:04.350> granting<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> lot<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.580> maturity<00:01:06.119> I

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
of granting a lot of much maturity I

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.429 
of granting a lot of much maturity I
guess<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.659> brings<00:01:06.869> our<00:01:07.049> detailed

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
guess and that brings our detailed

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
guess and that brings our detailed
separation<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.510> you'll<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.689> that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
separation and I think you'll see that

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.100 
separation and I think you'll see that
the<00:01:10.140> balances<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.860> improving<00:01:11.700> even<00:01:11.970> more<00:01:12.180> with

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the balances is improving even more with

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
the balances is improving even more with
the<00:01:13.200> upper<00:01:13.380> body<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:15.060> know<00:01:15.180> she's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> work

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the upper body and you know she's a work

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
the upper body and you know she's a work
in<00:01:15.780> progress<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.439> mean<00:01:16.710> none<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> us<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:17.280> there

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
in progress I mean none of us up there

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.940 
in progress I mean none of us up there
on<00:01:17.729> stage<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.229> perfect<00:01:19.229> yet<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.920> our

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
and you I you know you would ideally

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.979 
and you I you know you would ideally
consider<00:03:56.370> him<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.669> favorite<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:57.599> with<00:03:57.870> the

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
consider him the favorite but with the

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.300 
consider him the favorite but with the
injury<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.260> occurred<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.859> lot<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.069> people

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
injury that occurred a lot of people

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.509 
injury that occurred a lot of people
have<00:03:59.489> not<00:03:59.699> really<00:04:00.000> considered<00:04:00.780> him<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.019> favor

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
have not really considered him a favor

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.559 
have not really considered him a favor
some<00:04:02.519> people<00:04:02.730> have<00:04:02.819> even<00:04:02.879> kind<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.239> written

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
some people have even kind of written

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.349 
some people have even kind of written
him<00:04:03.750> off<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.139> slightly<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.739> bit<00:04:05.030> but<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.090> think

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
him off a slightly a bit but I think

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.089 
him off a slightly a bit but I think
he's<00:04:06.449> going<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.659> come<00:04:06.780> back<00:04:06.959> strong<00:04:07.319> I<00:04:07.590> don't

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
he's going to come back strong I don't

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.770 
he's going to come back strong I don't
haven't<00:04:08.879> seen<00:04:09.120> them<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:09.449> i<00:04:09.510> don't<00:04:09.690> know<00:04:09.750> if

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
haven't seen them so i don't know if

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.680 
haven't seen them so i don't know if
it's<00:04:10.019> going<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.169> be<00:04:10.260> perfect<00:04:10.440> but<00:04:10.859> I<00:04:11.569> just<00:04:12.569> do

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
it's going to be perfect but I just do

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.000 
it's going to be perfect but I just do
remember<00:04:12.989> that<00:04:13.079> being<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.470> smaller<00:04:13.799> like

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
remember that being the smaller like

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.219 
remember that being the smaller like
anyway<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.940> don't<00:04:15.780> think<00:04:15.870> it's<00:04:15.989> going<00:04:16.139> to

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
anyway so I don't think it's going to

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.379 
anyway so I don't think it's going to
make<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.620> much<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.979> difference<00:04:17.209> from<00:04:18.209> what

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
make that much of a difference from what

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.839 
make that much of a difference from what
I<00:04:18.419> have<00:04:18.959> seen<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.229> previous<00:04:19.380> pictures<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.430> no

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.589 
lineup I definitely want to to be in the
top<00:05:32.949> and<00:05:33.009> compared<00:05:33.819> with<00:05:33.940> in<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.180> top<00:05:34.360> of<00:05:34.539> the

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
top and compared with in the top of the

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.409 
top and compared with in the top of the
mix<00:05:34.810> of<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:34.990> guys<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.560> I<00:05:36.490> just<00:05:36.759> I<00:05:36.940> just<00:05:37.060> think

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
mix of the guys and I just I just think

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.939 
mix of the guys and I just I just think
it's<00:05:37.539> an<00:05:37.630> opportunity<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.409> capitalize<00:05:38.620> on

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
it's an opportunity to capitalize on

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.029 
it's an opportunity to capitalize on
what<00:05:39.250> I've<00:05:39.400> done<00:05:39.520> previously<00:05:40.180> but<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.080> just<00:05:41.560> I'm

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
what I've done previously but I just I'm

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.409 
what I've done previously but I just I'm
not<00:05:42.069> standing<00:05:42.430> back<00:05:42.699> there<00:05:42.729> because<00:05:43.240> that's

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
not standing back there because that's

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.149 
not standing back there because that's
not<00:05:43.599> what<00:05:43.659> I'm<00:05:43.840> I'm<00:05:44.440> satisfied<00:05:44.770> with<00:05:45.130> being

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
not what I'm I'm satisfied with being

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:57.730 
not what I'm I'm satisfied with being
labeled<00:05:45.639> I'm<00:05:45.940> looking<00:05:46.569> to<00:05:46.690> move<00:05:46.810> forward<00:05:47.139> body

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.800
