00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.500 
feel of photo finish it kind of felt
artificial<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.880> know<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.270> our<00:03:09.420> official

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
artificial and I know it is our official

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.420 
artificial and I know it is our official
because<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:09.990> dimethicone<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.920> silicones

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
because it's dimethicone and silicones

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.820 
because it's dimethicone and silicones
but<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.300> felt<00:03:12.570> heavy<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.230> felt<00:03:13.410> gross<00:03:13.650> on

but it felt heavy and it felt gross on
the<00:03:13.950> skin<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.880> didn't<00:03:15.210> really<00:03:15.330> enjoy

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the skin so I didn't really enjoy

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.780 
the skin so I didn't really enjoy
wearing<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> much<00:03:17.250> more<00:03:17.430> refined

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.110 
wearing it this is a much more refined
um<00:03:18.980> sort<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.070> dimethicone<00:03:20.490> at<00:03:20.700> least<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.000> feels

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
um sort of dimethicone at least it feels

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.790 
um sort of dimethicone at least it feels
like<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.480> my<00:03:21.510> fingers<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.050> much<00:03:22.320> smoother

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
like in my fingers it's much smoother

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.020 
like in my fingers it's much smoother
much<00:03:22.950> more<00:03:23.160> liquidy<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.580> when<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.850> goes<00:03:24.000> on

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
much more liquidy and when it goes on

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.030 
much more liquidy and when it goes on
your<00:03:24.180> skin<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.510> belts<00:03:24.870> right<00:03:25.020> in<00:03:25.200> creates<00:03:25.980> a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
your skin and belts right in creates a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.100 
your skin and belts right in creates a
