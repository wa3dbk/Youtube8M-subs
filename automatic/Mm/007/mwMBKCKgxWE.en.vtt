00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.849
 in the maneuver 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.390
 a plan of drummers around the world stirs up 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.739
 and his name is well known in more than 70 countries 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.860
 from Bad Berleburg in North Rhine-Westphalia 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.400
 Europe's leading manufacturer of exclusive percussion instruments 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.530
 quality 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.929
 this is natural 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.709
 l the most important thing we have written on the flag we want 

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:48.470
 qualitative market leader 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.010
 Of course, what is very important today is that we mean innovation 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.900
 So, so you bring the snow there is so much put in and we 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.360
 have very good the art department the very very close cooperation with customers 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.120
 gives drummers with users 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.120
 OMV then they finally implement that 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.910
 At least 2000 Euro costs the entry-level model at Solo 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.730
 in the professional field, it can sometimes be ten thousand euros 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.870
 At the company headquarters in Bad Berleburg around 1000 500 each year 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.710
 Drummer produced 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.510
 by adding new designs 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.300
 1994 becomes so only as first musical instrument manufacturer with the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.630
 Federal Award Design awarded 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.700
 they are unbelievably natural hand in hand you can not do that from each other 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.850
 separate 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.830
 Percent of course the purchase decision ultimately percent of the end user 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.960
 Place of the drama 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.220
 that either makes itself a clown or and it's or maybe 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.410
 also weight or maybe in the county so that players have many facts 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.460
 Role but as said 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.299
 one by the design of the speakers also underlined by the 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.510
 Using a variety of materials that speak specifically 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.450
 Of course, so will the usage of different users 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.910
 Door through the design need different Clank Future notes 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.909
 Percent, of course, the customer has to decide with which 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.909
 because sonic Zoundi best cope 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.679
 everything starts in 1875 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.129
 with Stature eardrums and military drums 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.359
 since then, only his instruments are constantly evolving 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.199
 very nice you can 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.199
 ARD development during the walk follow him 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.980
 Preuss machines that are already in use for their image of the tram 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.900
 to play tub since have very imposingly developed those us 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.709
 Machine built in 1900 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.990
 we look very simply built 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.469
 that is the function and 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.569
 Reason for complaint he sees only foot machine at so Mohr 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.439
 percent 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.529
 like this 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.429
 that means we have percent 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:56.469
 In order to redesign we have new materials which was the choice to use 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.929
 and test 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:00.209
 and so we are always on the lookout 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.459
 To make the musician's percent life as easy as possible 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.569
 and to optimally build a music is possible 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.659
 so a kiosk Merkel came for the German success hip-hopper Jan 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.659
 Delay relies on Sonora 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.630
 in the company headquarters he tests his newest q2 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.280
 the current top model of the house and dream of many drummers 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.159
 Music is also the guide of Exit the Sea 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.380
 or Christoph Schneider from Rammstein 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.270
 have been to Bad Berleburg 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.429
 to have their principles tailored 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:39.999
 That sounds reassuring 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.599
 and that 's Brooke' s stuff you say yourself to drums and stuff 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.879
 that applies and exploit 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.230
 and when drummer that is so are relatively difficult to handle 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.519
 in general 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.900
 Percent at the top Thoma 6 or 8 screws at the bottom also in each 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.829
 single screw even makes it that way 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.149
 and that means 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.759
 if it is very important that I continue to be like that and that the beauty 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.779
 Book are worked out and that was at so 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.049
 consistent and always good 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.049
 and "That's just an incredible job 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.059
 the model name it q2 is the abbreviation for Sun and high up two quality 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:20.859
 this is almost the self-commitment of the global company from the 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.219
