up really really dark but as you can see
my<00:02:13.490> finger<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.819> think<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.330> if<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.540> put<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.750> good

my finger I think that if you put a good

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.750 
my finger I think that if you put a good
base<00:02:15.170> under<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.860> think<00:02:16.160> you'd<00:02:16.310> have<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.520> nice

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
base under it I think you'd have a nice

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.390 
base under it I think you'd have a nice
colored<00:02:17.120> eyeshadow<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.950> far<00:02:19.190> I'm

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
colored eyeshadow and so far I'm

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.510
