 Japanese dotcom today we are going to cook 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.050
 rice paste filled much of the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.789
 flavor you want 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.789
 we are going to present the ingredients 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.950
 sugar 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.810
 glutinous rice flour is very 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.490
 important that it clumped healthy is the 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.079
 same that they sell in supermarkets 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.079
 as normal rice flour is usually 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.420
 and it is very important that it is glutinous 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.670
 a little more sticky water 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.320
 ice creams of the flavors that you want in 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.769
 this case we are going to use the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.560
 side of the side side of cream conan and 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:05.860
 the black sesame side 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.320
 curo gum we discovered these ice creams 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.440
 you have the recipe of these two on the web 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.290
 also for the water one used 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.610
 cream and something that we have also done 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.610
 mom 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.200
 we are going to use these utensils and 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.650
 transparent film paper we are going to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.740
 need eight pieces cut or what 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.509
 You can cut during the process 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.530
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:38.720
 make 8 scoops of ice cream with a spoon 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:42.140
 remember that on this side you have the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.080
 recipe in the links we will put it in the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.380
 video below 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.840
 the rubber also and for the white too 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.160
 we will put the recipe once 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.050
 we have finished making the eight balls 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.490
 of ice cream we put them in the freezer 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.260
 at least half an hour 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.560
 to prepare the mass of mochis 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.560
 First you have to mix the pink flour 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.450
 of the touch with a spatula 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.450
 we mix a little 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.280
 the ingredients and we add the water 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.409
 there are two ways to cook the dough 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.840
 we can do it or steamed or 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.989
 microwave to make it a microwave 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.689
 Once we have mixed this we must put 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.500
 a transparent film put it two minutes 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.689
 in the microwave to stir it well and 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.700
 go back to put one minute more and return it 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.220
 to remove those for microwave treats 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.620
 two minutes and one minute always covered 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.790
 with transparent and in this case I'm going to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.859
 steam it 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.689
 I like the more the sharper the more 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.590
 humid it costs a little bit more but 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.900
 I will explain how to do it we will see 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.730
 we stir well that there is no group 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.610
 to steam it up we're going to 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.519
 need an extra bamboo or a 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.610
 steamer to cook the dough of mods and 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.769
 we have to wet a cloth and put it 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.760
 in the bamboo basket to throw here 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.760
 inside the dough 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.600
 let's pour 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.970
 and we cover it to steam it and 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.980
 we're going to need a pot or in this 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.980
 case we are going to use a su and hunter 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.480
 d 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.480
 create a standard size 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.820
 once 120 minutes have passed 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.210
 We take out the steamer and remove a 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.210
 bit 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.420
 we cover it again 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.040
 and we leave 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.930
 10 minutes 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.909
 we had the Moche and teacher 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.670
 total of about 20 minutes in the steamer 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.280
 and it depends on the quantity 20 25 minutes 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.040
 when you see it that by removing what is 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.719
 it looks like this page 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.030
 of brightness above means that the 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.030
 Motril mass is now ready to 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.240
 ok let's continue with the moche 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.370
 we discover the next step is in a 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.700
 work table where you do better 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.280
 We have to spread tasting curicó 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.990
 which is flour at the potato level or in the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.960
 If you can not find it, you can 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.970
 use cornstarch but talk enough 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.160
 well the tasting curicó they sell it in 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.160
 asian supermarkets creams online 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.820
 we left a good table 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.820
 generous amount 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.710
 we have our entire work table 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.770
 well space we take the mass of backpack 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.389
 and we miss it 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.389
 we scatter again 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.010
 pretty much 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.010
 generous 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.450
 with your hands or helping us with a 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.450
 roll a roller too 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.190
 the next step after flattening the 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.720
 mass of mochi export it this mass gives 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.670
 for about 68 mochis 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.670
 we cut halves 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.800
 we already have cut we will touch now 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.530
 choose each 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.530
 if we remove the leftover flour 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.330
 on the other side too 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.250
 and we put it on top of a film 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.020
 transparent of those we had 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.780
 prepared 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.639
 over 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.639
 we cover with another paper film 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.849
 and so on until making them in sun 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.060
 ok we have the 8 clean addicts and 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.770
 in the film we welcome the dish and what 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.659
 we put in the refrigerator at least half 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.569
 hour half an hour for them to be 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.849
 well cold before putting 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.279
 we have had a little time the mass inside 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.199
 the fridge and now with the balls 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.200
 ice cream we are going to assemble and finally it is not 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:23.510
 a lot and I write 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.449
 we take the water ball and put it on 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.150
 to 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.680
 about the mass of mochis 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.840
 and together with the paper 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.360
 we put it inside the stories these 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.509
 that we had reserved that we were going to 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.509
 use 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.440
 you see 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.440
 he gets inside 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.450
 we close the car 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.220
 You can use a little public tasting if 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.640
 you need you must get stuck 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.640
 in the fingers 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.840
 and with the same transparent film 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.870
 and we leave it inside the same bowl if 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:16.449
 you want a mold of these that have 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.669
 holes once we have not already 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.060
