00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.040
 hello in this lesson with 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 programs corel photo-paint we 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.740
 convert the photo into a drawing style 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.470
 graffiti 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.140
 Ie paintings painted on stone 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.180
 concrete or brick wall for 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.640
 create a picture effect on the stone 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.210
 open the scanned wall here 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.439
 image size is 760 pixels 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.360
 300 dpi resolution 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.130
 if to create this effect you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.110
 will use another picture 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.489
 size with a different resolution you 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.530
 will need to pick up 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.840
 corresponding parameter settings 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.520
 applied effects from duplicate 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 source image by clicking a combination 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.100
 kontrol b keys apply the effect of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.100
 contour effect groups edge search 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:04.379
 let's raise the level of color edges 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:09.950
 spots up to 75 repeat the effect applied 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.950
 once again however reduce the level to 25 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.170
 change the merge mode of objects to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.009
 imposing rather clear contours 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.619
 describe the main color patches 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.570
 blur our image a little 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.650
 applying voice blurr radius 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.579
 blur approximately 2 pixels merge 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.939
 two objects key combination kontrol 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.610
 arrow to down 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.890
 let's give a picture effect now 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.759
 painted on a stone wall for this 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.189
 open the menu 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.909
 effects group effects texture 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:57.530
 pick up a cobblestone 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:06.740
 grout width parameters 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:07.759
 and sizes of texture elements if us 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.849
 everything suits me 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:17.950
 from duplicate again our object will change 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:23.739
 merge mode on multiply and reduce 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.470
 opacity combine two 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.430
 resulting objects have an effect 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.430
 graffiti on a stone wall 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.230
 open another image Lego size 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.080
 thousands of pixels on the long side and 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.580
 300 dpi resolution stylize 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.890
 will be under the image 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.520
 applied to the brick wall and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.340
 duplicate the object again and apply 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.670
 effects from the contour edge search group 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.850
 first time apply level 25 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.580
 percent second time we repeat this 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.750
 contour effect raising the level 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:06.310
 tracing contours of color spots up to 75 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:11.410
 76 percent use blur effect 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:17.410
 according to Gauss we change the merge mode to 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.870
 overlay we combine two objects we create 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.730
 control . we need her to 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.040
 any moment we could come back for this 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.650
 state of work add an image 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.880
 brick wall effect open or 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.690
 brick wall texture effects 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.850
 we select the roughness settings 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.060
 bricks width of mortar from 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.170
 duplicate the object again 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.860
 change the merge mode to multiply and 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:51.430
 change the opacity factor 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.830
 we combine two objects we succeeded 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.870
 stylized image is applied and on 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.600
 brick wall for greater 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.070
 realistic we can take the tool 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.970
 brush spray can choose type 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:14.500
 brushes wide textured brushes and 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:19.770
 spend a few strokes on the brick 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.640
 to her by adding the effect of aging 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.530
 back to the state 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.660
 images when it was not yet 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.980
 added brick wall texture 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.430
 To do this, open the menu Edit 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.970
 restoring the control point create 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.900
 new object and fill it with back color 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.470
 the plan is the background color for the background color 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.640
 choose pale the rope 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.070
 matte color is on this object we 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.400
 we will create a brick wall 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.160
 apply texture assembly effects 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.510
 we got a brick wall 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.460
 perfectly smooth brick 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:04.560
 so we add it distortion 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:11.550
 apply effects with different distortion 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:14.610
 pile select settings 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:21.170
 to make bricks look a little more so 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:26.900
 vintage dark brown 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:32.820
 apply some textured 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:38.370
 paint strokes from an aerosol can 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:41.130
 using either 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.880
 then the river image adjustments will strengthen 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.880
 contrast 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.110
 change 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:55.339
 jim merge on multiply and change 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.339
 opacity coefficient 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:08.039
 grabbing two objects again from 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:12.199
 duplicate the object and and once again apply 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:19.309
 decide merge multiplication also reduce 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:23.729
 the opacity coefficient combine 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:26.599
 the final image is now with us 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:30.529
 picture in graffiti style painted on 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.529
 aged brick wall 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.210
 open another image this is old 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.990
 Soviet New Year card 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.090
 and duplicate it and apply the effects of 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.759
 group contour search edges however 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.419
 change the merge mode to 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:54.500
 overlay apply effect from group 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:57.740
 contour edge search and level 75-76 even 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:02.030
 80 percent try this effect yet 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.990
 times also with a large level value 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.490
 tracing contours 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:16.370
 the image has become much more 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:21.250
 a clear blur unites him two 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:28.210
 object and add texture effect 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:33.349
 cobblestone can add effect 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:37.180
 from our texture group elephant skin 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:37.180
 the image became embossed
