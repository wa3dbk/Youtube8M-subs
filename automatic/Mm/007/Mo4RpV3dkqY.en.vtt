00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.490
 a new microsoft shader video on 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.800
 this time what we are going to try is 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.559
 lines the last game of game troopers 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.620
 a great game that this time has a 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.450
 cost of three euros but does not have 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.130
 purchases in app does not have advertising 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.140
 has nothing is a game of an aesthetic 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.870
 very simple but very addictive as 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 always and in really to me has 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.100
 delighted to wait to watch the video for 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 give your opinions but for me 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.700
 It seems a great game that deserves a lot 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.700
 the penalty for those three euros 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.769
 well here we are with our 830 with 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.469
 windows 10 as you can see and we're going to 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.570
 try lines the last game of game 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.480
 troopers has already announced a new one 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.220
 but this is the last one now we will have 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.430
 to change the screen tilt 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.809
 to the other side because this game is 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.399
 plays in landscape there we have it 'll 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.760
 zoom in a bit to see if 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.800
 I can for you to see it better there's a lot 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.380
 best 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.870
 well, the game is very simple 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.340
 but at the same time it is very addictive for a 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.930
 side we have the normal game that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.700
 come in here and on the other hand the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.980
 daily challenges let's start with the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.620
 normal game and then we're going to see the 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.300
 daily challenges the normal game by 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.080
 now I only have unlocked 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.780
 the point all these are different 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.680
 game modes 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 with about 40-50 levels for each one if 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.650
 You are moving forward to see the phone 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.650
 fly out 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.000
 air is that it reaches level 50 and of 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.690
 I play made for example to 49 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.760
 it's going to be super difficult and surely 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.550
 lose 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.970
 but let's try to think I'm already 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.480
 losing miserably surely 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.270
 I'm not winning a pop or you can see 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.160
 how my art playing games surprised me 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.070
 until myself and when I thought I was going to 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.750
 lose the cattle what is the theme of this 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.610
 game the theme of this game is that no 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.450
 just win what you have to do 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.940
 apart is to get multiple gusts and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.430
 So, how are you going to see something 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.980
 beginning 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.799
 chain a series of gusts to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.430
 get what you see here different 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.969
 say gold medals or achievements silver or 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.099
 bronze how this is achieved 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:33.290
 repeating the game 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.769
 for up to ten times to get the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.889
 gold medal you think is easy as 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.530
 You see, I had 19 victories in 22 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.599
 plays and three losses in those three 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.310
 defeats are the ones that hurt because 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.769
 they are the ones you have been playing 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.980
 you are with eight wins seven 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:56.330
 victories and suddenly you lose and you lose 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.670
 a lot of anger and he's going to say some kind of 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.300
 but not very suitable now that I'm 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.370
 recording the video was a lot of rage 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.960
 and well the game has a grace and is 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.660
 that we have only the option to place 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.640
 two points so we have to 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.000
 choose very well because if we are not 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.800
 lost in I propose the second there and 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.200
 that is what god wants I think that 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.180
 It has gone well if I wait so much 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.580
 well are you lucky today that you are 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.290
 watching winning all the time the truth is 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.480
 that is a simple game and I do not have 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.400
 that use a lot of hands and that 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.970
 it makes it easy for me to continue 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.940
 winning 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.340
 let's try one more and I'll leave it for 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.530
 enjoy it as you already 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.470
 you know this game contrary to others 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.360
 from within but yes that has cost to see 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.650
 the free things of life as they are 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.650
 some but not all 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.320
 good things in life free for free 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.980
 there is no can not be everything so that a 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.270
 see in the background I am delighted with 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.510
 the games that people do 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.280
 troopers and therefore is that enchant 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.010
 for this game it seems to me a very game 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.770
 entertaining and it's really worth it 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.690
 apart from that aesthetics I love 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.060
 and what I have not done that I'm going to do 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.980
 now 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.640
 expose it because all this has a 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.570
 music 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.030
 very very simple but very nice as well 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.920
 that the next game that brings the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.570
 daily challenge that surely this yes 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.280
 that you are going to see me lose it because I think 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.400
 who has never got it 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.590
 the daily challenge I will make it quiet 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.889
 so you can hear the nuances of 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.319
 music 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.740
 we have to win this level three times 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.740
 followed 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.480
 And you see that we do not also have the option of 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.480
 failure 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.000
 too high the volume and 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.860
 distorted a bit but you see that 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.419
 goes accompanying the music every time 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.169
 we put the finger in a way that does 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:15.150
 as I love it, I find it very 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.620
 quiet very relaxing 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.370
 Uruguay 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.650
 I believe that 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.500
 here 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.230
 and he almost certainly won it 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.020
 we go two of three as you see me do a 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.110
 video on youtube where not always 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.470
 because I've only lost once this is 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.040
 it deserves a like like a cathedral 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.040
 hard vistillas 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.050
 one 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.020
 one 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.720
 and the other one would now molarÃ­a you'll hear from 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.860
 background if there no no do not put 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.379
 in life play putting here 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.360
 Cross your fingers for me when you see it 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.610
 I will be dead I will have won it seems that 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.280
 da does not look like they were good good good 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.219
 good the first time and this is true 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.400
 absolute truth to make a challenge 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:13.530
 daily the advantage is that it is that every day 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.460
 we have a new level even if you finish 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.080
 the game 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.289
 you will continue to have new levels 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.719
 every day challenges games every day in the 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.389
 that you will have to compete against yourself 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:27.509
 and you'll have the best to win four 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:30.000
 three games or in this case 33 we're going 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.770
 that has nailed it and the truth is that I 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.830
 it seems a very entertaining game with a 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.379
 simple but super nice music 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.740
 that I recommend without a doubt that although 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:43.349
 have a cost of I think they are two with 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.169
 99 euros I recommend you that what 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.939
 You buy some because it's a great game is 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.889
 these games that surprises and that is 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:51.900
 completely different 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.840
 of course and how can it be otherwise 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.490
 way with achievements for now I have three 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.500
 achievements but there are many more 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.870
 and the truth is that with a design 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.180
 interesting so I love it 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.910
 certainly for me it has been a whole 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.060
 discovery for good so already 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.590
 you know this is lines the game troopers 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.330
 on windows phones 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.009
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.819
 see you in the next microsoft 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.330
 inside air 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:19.330
 a greeting
