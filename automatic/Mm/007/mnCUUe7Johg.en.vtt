minute<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:02.969> go<00:02:03.090> mid<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:05.040> reason<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.399> this

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
minute and go mid the reason I do this

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.630 
minute and go mid the reason I do this
is<00:02:05.880> because

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
you're here after you're here and you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.080 
you're here after you're here and you
just<00:03:02.750> walk<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.170> be<00:03:03.320> by<00:03:03.500> yourself<00:03:03.820> now<00:03:04.820> there

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
just walk in to be by yourself now there

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.880 
just walk in to be by yourself now there
could<00:03:05.180> be<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.360> rotator<00:03:05.780> CT<00:03:06.110> spawn<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.560> get<00:03:06.800> in

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
could be a rotator CT spawn so get in

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.740 
could be a rotator CT spawn so get in
here<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.250> bit<00:03:07.430> quickly<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.970> then<00:03:08.600> you

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
here a little bit quickly and then you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.449 
here a little bit quickly and then you
can<00:03:08.870> get<00:03:08.989> one<00:03:09.080> or<00:03:09.200> two<00:03:09.260> kills<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:09.980> quickly<00:03:10.340> this

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
can get one or two kills so quickly this

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.140 
can get one or two kills so quickly this
way<00:03:10.519> because<00:03:12.220> they<00:03:13.220> will<00:03:13.340> never<00:03:13.640> expect<00:03:14.000> you

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
way because they will never expect you

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.330 
way because they will never expect you
to<00:03:14.239> be<00:03:14.329> out<00:03:14.360> mid<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:15.200> fast<00:03:15.530> after<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.130> just

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
to be out mid that fast after you just

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.880 
to be out mid that fast after you just
smoke<00:03:16.579> mid<00:03:17.170> also<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.260> can<00:03:18.500> do<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:18.680> for<00:03:18.829> a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
smoke mid also you can do this for a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.620 
smoke mid also you can do this for a
fast<00:03:19.100> out<00:03:19.280> as<00:03:19.340> well<00:03:19.549> smoke<00:03:20.209> wit<00:03:20.420> you<00:03:20.510> can

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
fast out as well smoke wit you can

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.110 
fast out as well smoke wit you can
easily<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:21.230> go<00:03:21.350> super<00:03:21.799> quick<00:03:21.980> on<00:03:22.130> cat<00:03:22.340> if
