00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.420 

let's<00:00:09.850> next<00:00:10.120> talk<00:00:10.450> about<00:00:10.810> the<00:00:11.430> somewhat

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
let's next talk about the somewhat

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.020 
let's next talk about the somewhat
controversial<00:00:13.390> issue<00:00:13.810> and<00:00:14.550> also<00:00:15.550> somewhat

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
controversial issue and also somewhat

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.560 
controversial issue and also somewhat
confusing<00:00:16.720> issue<00:00:16.930> of<00:00:17.350> the<00:00:18.250> role<00:00:18.460> of<00:00:18.490> scans<00:00:19.060> in

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
confusing issue of the role of scans in

patients<00:00:20.290> with<00:00:20.320> breast<00:00:20.619> cancer<00:00:20.770> I<00:00:21.900> think

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
patients with breast cancer I think

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.650 
patients with breast cancer I think
patients<00:00:23.410> with<00:00:23.529> breast<00:00:23.740> cancer<00:00:23.890> often

patients with breast cancer often

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.640 
patients with breast cancer often
overestimate<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.270> benefit<00:00:28.270> and<00:00:28.420> need<00:00:29.020> for

overestimate the benefit and need for

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.850 
overestimate the benefit and need for
scans<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:31.300> in<00:00:31.660> my<00:00:31.690> own<00:00:31.900> practice<00:00:32.290> we

at least at that point in time to

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.090 
at least at that point in time to

determine the significance of that

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.539 
determine the significance of that

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.289 
abnormality in that case the patient may
remain<00:01:55.030> quite<00:01:55.390> nervous<00:01:55.899> until<00:01:56.789> one<00:01:57.789> repeats

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
remain quite nervous until one repeats

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.270 
remain quite nervous until one repeats
the<00:01:58.479> scan<00:01:58.749> three<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.259> four<00:01:59.439> months<00:01:59.619> later<00:01:59.799> to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
the scan three to four months later to

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.880 
the scan three to four months later to
see<00:02:00.429> if<00:02:00.460> there's<00:02:00.729> been<00:02:00.789> a<00:02:00.939> change<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.710> in

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
see if there's been a change so in

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.160 
see if there's been a change so in
higher<00:02:03.100> risk<00:02:03.429> patients<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.210> think<00:02:04.570> scanning<00:02:05.079> is

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
higher risk patients I think scanning is

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.830 
higher risk patients I think scanning is
appropriate<00:02:05.799> but<00:02:06.549> in<00:02:06.700> lower<00:02:06.909> risk<00:02:07.270> patients

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
appropriate but in lower risk patients

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.919 
appropriate but in lower risk patients
has<00:02:08.140> not<00:02:08.440> been<00:02:08.890> beneficial<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.819> I<00:02:10.509> would<00:02:10.750> try
