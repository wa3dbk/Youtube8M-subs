back and forth together those are the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.870 
back and forth together those are the
walking<00:01:12.420> steps<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.830> next<00:01:14.159> component<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
walking steps the next component is

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.539 
walking steps the next component is
going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.810> side<00:01:16.200> steps<00:01:16.680> side<00:01:16.979> steps<00:01:17.369> are

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
going to be side steps side steps are

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.700 
going to be side steps side steps are
very<00:01:17.580> simple<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.990> sideways<00:01:19.290> from

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
very simple they just go sideways from

very simple they just go sideways from
left<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:20.970> left<00:01:21.150> we

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
left to right and from right to left we

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020 
left to right and from right to left we
just<00:01:22.290> put<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.590> our<00:01:22.740> foot<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.250> we're<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
go side together side together then we

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
go side together side together then we
go<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.070> direction<00:01:29.420> side<00:01:30.420> together

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
go the other direction side together

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.859 
go the other direction side together
side<00:01:31.700> together<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.180> main<00:01:33.360> thing<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
side together the main thing with the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.530 
side together the main thing with the
side<00:01:34.110> steps<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.280> large<00:01:35.640> side<00:01:36.180> steps

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
side steps are to take large side steps

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
side steps are to take large side steps
so<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.689> reach<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> step<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.159> your<00:01:38.310> toe

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
so we go side together side together

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.260 
so we go side together side together
then<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> other<00:01:43.619> direction<00:01:43.950> side<00:01:44.790> together

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
then the other direction side together

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.560 
then the other direction side together
side<00:01:46.009> together<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.880> I'm<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.420> this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
side together now I'm going to do this

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.950 
side together now I'm going to do this
with<00:01:48.810> Cindy<00:01:49.290> from<00:01:49.829> side<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.159> side<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.970> position

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
with Cindy from side to side in position

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.770 
with Cindy from side to side in position
so<00:01:52.619> we're<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.509> her
