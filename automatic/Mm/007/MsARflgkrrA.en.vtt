getting<00:01:38.310> 25<00:01:38.820> RP<00:01:39.240> every<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.930> weird

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
getting 25 RP every time that weird

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
getting 25 RP every time that weird
buzzing<00:01:40.860> sound<00:01:41.280> goes<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.939> every<00:01:42.689> time<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
buzzing sound goes on and every time the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.319 
buzzing sound goes on and every time the
buzzing<00:01:43.200> sound<00:01:43.470> goes<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.829> you're<00:01:44.009> getting<00:01:44.369> 100

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
buzzing sound goes on you're getting 100

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.100 
buzzing sound goes on you're getting 100
clicks<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.409> that's<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.680> 100<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:48.180> x<00:01:48.479> 25

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
clicks so that's like 100 I think x 25

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.980 
clicks so that's like 100 I think x 25
RP<00:01:49.500> every<00:01:50.159> second<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:51.659> pretty<00:01:51.810> crazy

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
RP every second so that's pretty crazy

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.039 
RP every second so that's pretty crazy
that's<00:01:52.320> three<00:01:52.680> million<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.310> hour<00:01:53.520> um<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.899> yeah

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
that's three million an hour um so yeah

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.770 
that's three million an hour um so yeah
it's<00:01:55.380> pretty<00:01:55.530> crazy<00:01:55.969> it's<00:01:56.969> three<00:01:57.210> million<00:01:57.509> 24

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
it's pretty crazy it's three million 24

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.109 
it's pretty crazy it's three million 24
million<00:01:57.960> an<00:01:58.170> hour<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.850> rank<00:02:00.030> up

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
million an hour and you can rank up

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.149 
million an hour and you can rank up
literally<00:02:00.390> three<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.170> four<00:02:01.409> times<00:02:01.439> every

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
literally three to four times every

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.149 
literally three to four times every
minute<00:02:02.610> or<00:02:02.700> less<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.299> depends<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.560> your

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
minute or less it depends but your

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
minute or less it depends but your
friend<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.520> also<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.299> there's<00:02:06.719> about

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
friend can also do this so there's about

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.660 
friend can also do this so there's about
five<00:02:07.170> chapters<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.680> spawn<00:02:08.009> everywhere<00:02:08.399> so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
five chapters that spawn everywhere so

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.430 
five chapters that spawn everywhere so
he<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> chopper<00:02:09.390> take<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.289> briefcase

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
he can get a chopper take the briefcase

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.040 
he can get a chopper take the briefcase
from<00:02:10.800> your<00:02:11.039> spawn<00:02:11.370> go<00:02:11.940> back<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.270> his<00:02:12.420> spawn<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
from your spawn go back to his spawn and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.580 
from your spawn go back to his spawn and
do<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.319> same

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
do the same

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.930 
do the same
thing<00:02:13.769> that<00:02:13.860> I'm<00:02:14.010> doing<00:02:14.040> right<00:02:14.400> now<00:02:14.580> at<00:02:14.760> his

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
thing that I'm doing right now at his

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.580 
thing that I'm doing right now at his
capture<00:02:15.209> point<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:16.110> yeah<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:16.349> kind<00:02:16.560> of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
capture point so yeah it's kind of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.410 
capture point so yeah it's kind of
confusing<00:02:16.739> but<00:02:17.610> if<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.819> guys<00:02:17.940> understood

that then I yeah it's gonna be pretty

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.030 
that then I yeah it's gonna be pretty
easy<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:21.870> hopefully<00:02:22.349> guys<00:02:22.650> understood

about it i'll show you guys that he's
also<00:02:27.090> doing<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.900> glitch<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.319> his<00:02:28.470> spawn<00:02:28.739> right

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
also doing the glitch I his spawn right

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.789 
also doing the glitch I his spawn right
now<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> minute<00:02:29.550> um<00:02:30.299> but<00:02:30.690> yeah<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
now in a minute um but yeah this is a

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.770 
now in a minute um but yeah this is a
really<00:02:32.160> good<00:02:32.250> glitch<00:02:32.519> I<00:02:32.730> got<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.060> around<00:02:33.360> rank

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
really good glitch I got to around rank

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.930 
really good glitch I got to around rank
45<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.379> think<00:02:34.799> right<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:35.099> within<00:02:35.489> 10<00:02:35.730> minutes

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
45 I think right now within 10 minutes

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.750 
45 I think right now within 10 minutes
so<00:02:36.900> yeah<00:02:37.080> if<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.530> do<00:02:37.650> capture<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.640> go

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
so yeah if you do capture it just go

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.460 
so yeah if you do capture it just go
back<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.209> enemies<00:02:39.810> spawn<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.290> get<00:02:40.379> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
back to the enemies spawn and get the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.619 
back to the enemies spawn and get the
briefcase<00:02:40.620> again<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.489> keep<00:02:42.209> doing<00:02:42.540> this

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
briefcase again and keep doing this

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.720 
briefcase again and keep doing this
until<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.989> game<00:02:43.200> ends<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:44.280> game<00:02:44.370> will<00:02:44.549> never

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
until the game ends the game will never

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.630 
until the game ends the game will never
end<00:02:44.970> unless<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.660> do<00:02:45.900> um<00:02:46.220> unless<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> timer

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
end unless you do um unless the timer

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.270 
end unless you do um unless the timer
runs<00:02:47.760> out<00:02:48.120> or<00:02:48.329> you<00:02:49.049> get<00:02:49.260> 3<00:02:49.590> captures<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
runs out or you get 3 captures on the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.460 
runs out or you get 3 captures on the
clock<00:02:50.579> or<00:02:50.880> three<00:02:51.120> captures<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.750> thing

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
clock or three captures on the thing

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.470 
clock or three captures on the thing
whatever<00:02:52.799> but<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.819> guys<00:02:53.910> can<00:02:54.060> see<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.329> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
whatever but as you guys can see in the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.020 
whatever but as you guys can see in the
the<00:02:54.959> left<00:02:55.170> right<00:02:55.380> there<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> says<00:02:55.880> blah<00:02:56.880> blah

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the left right there it says blah blah

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.869 
the left right there it says blah blah
blah<00:02:57.060> um<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:58.170> can't<00:02:58.860> read<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.129> right<00:02:59.430> now<00:02:59.610> but

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.400 

collected<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.090> security<00:03:03.480> case<00:03:03.629> so<00:03:04.079> basically

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
collected the security case so basically

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.080 
collected the security case so basically
he's<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:05.160> means<00:03:05.340> he's<00:03:05.519> doing<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.879> glitch

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
he's that means he's doing the glitch

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.729 
he's that means he's doing the glitch
and<00:03:06.299> if<00:03:06.420> he<00:03:06.540> sees<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.959> for<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.319> then<00:03:07.560> that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
and if he sees that for you then that

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.470 
and if he sees that for you then that
means<00:03:07.860> you're<00:03:08.220> doing<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.549> glitch<00:03:08.730> right<00:03:08.940> so

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
means you're doing the glitch right so

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.330 
means you're doing the glitch right so
yeah<00:03:09.629> basically<00:03:10.049> that's<00:03:10.410> about<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.160> get

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
yeah basically that's about it you get

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.000 
yeah basically that's about it you get
three<00:03:11.579> digit<00:03:11.849> earn<00:03:12.120> 3<00:03:12.569> million<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:12.989> our<00:03:13.110> RP<00:03:13.650> +

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
three digit earn 3 million in our RP +

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.140 
three digit earn 3 million in our RP +
so<00:03:14.670> that's<00:03:14.819> about<00:03:14.970> rank<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:16.170> from<00:03:16.620> 0<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.150> rank

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
so that's about rank like from 0 to rank

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.660 
so that's about rank like from 0 to rank
like<00:03:18.359> 150<00:03:18.989> or<00:03:19.049> somewhere<00:03:19.350> around<00:03:19.380> there<00:03:19.670> or

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
like 150 or somewhere around there or
