a float cell and in umbreon and he makes
an<00:00:50.670> excellent<00:00:50.910> prediction<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.289> i

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
an excellent prediction here because i

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.420 
an excellent prediction here because i
was<00:00:53.489> i<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:53.940> explosion<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:55.020> i<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.770> hoping

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
was i use explosion because i was hoping

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
was i use explosion because i was hoping
that<00:00:56.489> he<00:00:56.969> would<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.020> going

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that he would think that I'm just going

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.170 
that he would think that I'm just going
to<00:00:58.170> his<00:00:58.320> trick<00:00:58.530> him<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.829> taught<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.399> uses

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
to his trick him and taught me but uses

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.560 
to his trick him and taught me but uses

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.630 
photo / text and Umbreon takes a really
large<00:01:15.210> hit<00:01:16.049> right<00:01:16.320> there<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:16.740> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
large hit right there because it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.630 
large hit right there because it's
almost<00:01:17.970> knocked<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.680> bronzong<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
almost knocked out now but bronzong is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.280 
almost knocked out now but bronzong is
the<00:01:20.729> only<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.240> down<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.930> don't<00:01:22.140> get

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the only one to go down and I don't get

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
the only one to go down and I don't get
to<00:01:22.350> qualify<00:01:22.740> sure<00:01:22.950> complaint<00:01:23.400> dang<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:24.780> good

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to qualify sure complaint dang not good

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.800 
to qualify sure complaint dang not good
so<00:01:25.770> range<00:01:26.310> continuing<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.970> fall<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.509> helps

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so range continuing to fall it helps

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
so range continuing to fall it helps
rolla<00:01:28.049> campus<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:29.570> waterfall<00:01:30.570> though<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.880> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
rolla campus a waterfall though but it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.609 
rolla campus a waterfall though but it
kind<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.420> hinders<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.960> team<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.470> bit

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
kind of hinders my team a little bit

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.249 
kind of hinders my team a little bit
because<00:01:35.610> he's<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.180> way<00:01:36.390> stronger<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.110> he

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
because he's just way stronger and he

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.740 
because he's just way stronger and he
has<00:01:37.380> he's<00:01:37.770> way<00:01:37.979> faster<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.540> he<00:01:39.630> was

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
has he's way faster now but he was

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
has he's way faster now but he was
faster<00:01:40.079> anyway<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.409> waterfall<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> decent

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
faster anyway so waterfall is a decent

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.870 
faster anyway so waterfall is a decent

chunk pouring onto his amazing defenses

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580

so<00:01:45.180> he's<00:01:45.299> able<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> hang<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.229> marinis

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so he's able to hang on and I marinis

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
so he's able to hang on and I marinis
garlock<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.430> pretty<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.299> seen

garlock this is a pretty I have not seen

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.030 
garlock this is a pretty I have not seen
something<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.140> before<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.770> pretty

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
something like this before it's pretty

cool<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.509> think<00:01:51.509> I've<00:01:51.659> swapped<00:01:51.960> your<00:01:52.170> swaps<00:01:53.000> 10

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000

metal<00:01:58.500> fan<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:58.979> yeah<00:01:59.369> he's<00:01:59.520> probably

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
metal fan going yeah he's probably

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.330 
metal fan going yeah he's probably
changed<00:01:59.939> exist<00:02:00.329> only<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.079> have

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
changed exist only if like you have

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.380 
changed exist only if like you have
status<00:02:02.340> effects<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.790> guess<00:02:02.969> could<00:02:03.180> said

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
status effects I guess could said

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.210 
status effects I guess could said
changed<00:02:03.899> effects<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.829> think

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
changed effects so I think

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.580 
changed effects so I think
yeah<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.850> think<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.300> does<00:02:07.330> but<00:02:07.810> rockslide

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
yeah I think it does but rockslide

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.070 
yeah I think it does but rockslide
knocks<00:02:08.890> out<00:02:09.130> umbreon<00:02:09.640> almost<00:02:10.420> non-stop<00:02:10.630> foot

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
knocks out umbreon almost non-stop foot

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.600 
knocks out umbreon almost non-stop foot
so<00:02:11.290> yeah<00:02:11.530> just<00:02:11.770> change<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.130> because<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.550> think

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
so yeah just change that because I think

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.600 
so yeah just change that because I think
it<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.270> think<00:02:13.870> it's<00:02:13.990> only<00:02:14.200> for<00:02:14.440> gain<00:02:15.130> status

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
it I think it's only for gain status

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.450 
it I think it's only for gain status
effects<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.680> just<00:02:17.860> be<00:02:17.980> better<00:02:18.160> off<00:02:18.310> using

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
effects but you just be better off using

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.790 
effects but you just be better off using
psych<00:02:18.850> up<00:02:19.090> from<00:02:19.420> another<00:02:19.720> pokemon<00:02:20.650> or

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
psych up from another pokemon or

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.740 
psych up from another pokemon or
something<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:21.250> besides<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.150> it's<00:02:22.600> pretty

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
something but besides that it's pretty

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.210 
something but besides that it's pretty
cool<00:02:22.960> thing<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.260> think<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:23.590> just<00:02:23.680> need<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:24.040> change

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
cool thing I think I just need to change

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.980 
cool thing I think I just need to change
you<00:02:24.490> need<00:02:24.640> changes<00:02:25.150> because<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.750> know<00:02:25.840> it's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
you need changes because you know it's

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.110 
you need changes because you know it's
not<00:02:26.110> actually<00:02:26.410> doing<00:02:26.560> anything<00:02:27.030> because<00:02:28.030> you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
not actually doing anything because you

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.020 
not actually doing anything because you
don't<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.300> any<00:02:28.390> static<00:02:28.930> gains<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:30.030> gangers

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
don't have any static gains so gangers

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.580 
don't have any static gains so gangers
is<00:02:31.270> sent<00:02:31.630> out<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.050> flow<00:02:32.230> till<00:02:32.290> he's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
is sent out and flow till he's

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.920 
is sent out and flow till he's
protecting<00:02:33.130> like<00:02:33.430> ah<00:02:33.640> getting<00:02:34.540> annoyed<00:02:34.810> by
