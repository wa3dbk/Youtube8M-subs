00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.890 

Rob<00:00:15.550> and<00:00:15.700> I<00:00:15.790> are<00:00:16.059> on<00:00:16.359> very<00:00:16.509> similar

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
Rob and I are on very similar

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.220 
Rob and I are on very similar
wavelengths<00:00:17.470> I<00:00:17.679> think<00:00:18.220> from<00:00:18.339> the<00:00:18.869> first<00:00:19.869> time

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
wavelengths I think from the first time

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.339 
wavelengths I think from the first time
we<00:00:21.160> sat<00:00:21.369> down<00:00:21.429> and<00:00:21.609> worked<00:00:22.480> out<00:00:22.660> the<00:00:22.810> storyline

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
we sat down and worked out the storyline

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.259 
we sat down and worked out the storyline
we<00:00:23.619> found<00:00:23.800> out<00:00:23.949> who<00:00:24.039> both<00:00:24.189> had<00:00:24.400> similar<00:00:24.609> ideas

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
we found out who both had similar ideas

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.480 
we found out who both had similar ideas
as<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:25.539> how<00:00:25.929> we<00:00:26.380> could<00:00:26.650> make<00:00:26.679> it<00:00:26.859> work<00:00:27.009> on<00:00:27.339> what

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
as to how we could make it work on what

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.339 
as to how we could make it work on what
we<00:00:27.609> would<00:00:27.789> have<00:00:27.909> gotten<00:00:28.150> by<00:00:28.419> setting<00:00:28.990> on<00:00:29.109> earth

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
we would have gotten by setting on earth

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.169 
we would have gotten by setting on earth
and<00:00:29.650> changing<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:30.220> to<00:00:30.339> now<00:00:30.519> and<00:00:30.820> this<00:00:30.909> sort<00:00:31.150> of

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
and changing it to now and this sort of

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.550 
and changing it to now and this sort of
thing<00:00:31.269> a<00:00:31.480> lot<00:00:31.570> of<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.900> idea<00:00:32.200> sort<00:00:32.470> of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
thing a lot of the idea sort of

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.710 
thing a lot of the idea sort of
dovetailed<00:00:33.310> into<00:00:33.580> each<00:00:33.700> other<00:00:33.910> as<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.450> script

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
dovetailed into each other as the script

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.000 
dovetailed into each other as the script
editor<00:00:35.050> are<00:00:35.230> therefore<00:00:35.380> had<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.620> pretty<00:00:35.770> fair

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
editor are therefore had a pretty fair

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.670 
editor are therefore had a pretty fair
idea<00:00:36.040> of<00:00:36.520> what<00:00:36.700> Nick<00:00:36.910> had<00:00:37.060> in<00:00:37.210> mind<00:00:37.560> from<00:00:38.560> what

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
idea of what Nick had in mind from what

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.070 
idea of what Nick had in mind from what
he<00:00:38.800> was<00:00:38.950> writing<00:00:39.130> what<00:00:39.460> I<00:00:39.490> was<00:00:39.780> rewriting<00:00:40.780> and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
he was writing what I was rewriting and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.780 
he was writing what I was rewriting and
sending<00:00:41.350> back<00:00:41.620> so<00:00:42.130> that<00:00:42.160> meant<00:00:42.550> I<00:00:42.640> had<00:00:42.670> a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
sending back so that meant I had a

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.240 
sending back so that meant I had a
pretty<00:00:42.970> firm<00:00:43.330> grasp<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:44.080> most<00:00:44.800> of<00:00:44.950> what<00:00:45.130> was

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
pretty firm grasp of most of what was

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.640 
pretty firm grasp of most of what was
going<00:00:45.520> on<00:00:45.690> yeah<00:00:46.690> course<00:00:47.080> some<00:00:47.230> of<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.380> early

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
going on yeah course some of the early

going on yeah course some of the early
drafts<00:00:48.040> of<00:00:48.130> the<00:00:48.700> power<00:00:48.940> script<00:00:49.270> look<00:00:49.360> very

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
drafts of the power script look very

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
drafts of the power script look very
very<00:00:49.660> different<00:00:49.840> very<00:00:50.620> different

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
very different very different

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.880

the<00:00:54.010> first<00:00:54.220> region<00:00:54.520> of<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.610> first<00:00:54.790> will<00:00:54.940> drop

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
the first region of the first will drop

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.420 
the first region of the first will drop
is<00:00:55.210> basically<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.720> just<00:00:55.960> junk<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.710> first<00:00:56.950> 15

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
is basically to just junk the first 15

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.920 
is basically to just junk the first 15
minutes<00:00:57.690> more<00:00:58.690> or<00:00:58.750> less<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.320> also<00:01:00.310> to<00:01:00.930> take

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
minutes more or less and also to take

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.510 
minutes more or less and also to take
evolve<00:01:02.350> minh<00:01:02.500> tam<00:01:02.620> unit<00:01:02.890> out<00:01:03.070> a<00:01:03.100> lot<00:01:03.370> more

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
evolve minh tam unit out a lot more

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.249 
evolve minh tam unit out a lot more
because<00:01:03.880> unit<00:01:04.210> was<00:01:04.329> originally<00:01:04.839> going<00:01:05.170> to

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
because unit was originally going to

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.289 
because unit was originally going to
arrive<00:01:05.499> on<00:01:05.649> the<00:01:05.740> island<00:01:05.770> in<00:01:06.219> force<00:01:06.549> which

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
arrive on the island in force which

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.090 
arrive on the island in force which
would<00:01:07.420> be<00:01:07.539> lovely<00:01:07.780> but<00:01:07.929> we<00:01:08.259> just<00:01:08.409> couldn't<00:01:08.859> do

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
would be lovely but we just couldn't do

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.620 
would be lovely but we just couldn't do
it<00:01:09.130> there<00:01:09.369> wasn't<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.700> time<00:01:09.939> but<00:01:10.390> yeah<00:01:10.509> the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
it there wasn't the time but yeah the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.209 
it there wasn't the time but yeah the
first<00:01:10.840> 15<00:01:11.200> minutes<00:01:11.409> introduced<00:01:12.009> the

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
first 15 minutes introduced the

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.560 
first 15 minutes introduced the
characters<00:01:12.609> on<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.820> island<00:01:13.149> quite<00:01:13.329> a<00:01:13.359> bit

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
characters on the island quite a bit

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.539 
characters on the island quite a bit
more<00:01:13.749> and<00:01:13.869> introduced<00:01:14.289> the<00:01:14.499> concept<00:01:15.039> which

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
more and introduced the concept which

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.980 
more and introduced the concept which
was<00:01:15.729> in<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.969> original<00:01:16.060> script<00:01:16.630> was<00:01:16.749> that<00:01:16.899> they

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
was in the original script was that they

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.209 
was in the original script was that they
were<00:01:17.049> actually<00:01:17.259> mining<00:01:17.829> for<00:01:17.950> something

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
were actually mining for something

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.130 
were actually mining for something
specific<00:01:18.399> Oh

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.760 

coercion<00:01:22.010> so<00:01:22.729> we<00:01:22.880> are<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:24.200> with<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.440> taking

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
coercion so we are so with the taking

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.590 
coercion so we are so with the taking
those<00:01:24.890> two<00:01:25.130> chunks<00:01:25.490> out<00:01:25.610> more<00:01:26.150> or<00:01:26.270> less<00:01:26.360> goes

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
those two chunks out more or less goes

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.940 
those two chunks out more or less goes
to<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.870> right<00:01:27.020> length<00:01:27.229> in<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.680> way<00:01:27.830> it

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
to the right length in a way it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.410 
to the right length in a way it
sharpened<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.610> mate<00:01:28.729> i<00:01:28.850> think<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.120> made<00:01:29.270> it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
sharpened is it mate i think it made it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.750 
sharpened is it mate i think it made it
it<00:01:29.930> made<00:01:30.140> it<00:01:30.260> quicker<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.590> PC<00:01:30.920> era<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.520> I

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
it made it quicker and PC era and I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.780 
it made it quicker and PC era and I
think<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:32.900> benefited<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.670> wasn't<00:01:34.670> sass

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
think that benefited it wasn't sass

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.030 
think that benefited it wasn't sass
broad<00:01:35.030> power<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.200> certainly<00:01:36.800> more

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
broad power is certainly more

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.920 
broad power is certainly more
