00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
infrared light is working as well what's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.870 
infrared light is working as well what's
happening<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.770> those<00:02:01.950> molecules<00:02:02.340> are

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
happening is those molecules are

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.260 
happening is those molecules are
becoming<00:02:03.299> smaller<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.770> theory<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.880> from

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
becoming smaller so in theory going from

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.400 
becoming smaller so in theory going from
as<00:02:06.390> large<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:09.090> as<00:02:09.239> small<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.050> so

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
as large as this to as small as this so

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.229 
as large as this to as small as this so
they<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.590> actually<00:02:11.009> go<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.580> be<00:02:11.819> part<00:02:12.120> of
