so you start thinking about this is

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.029 
so you start thinking about this is
dangerous<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:49.299> case<00:01:49.539> it<00:01:49.689> was<00:01:49.780> like<00:01:49.930> we<00:01:50.799> got<00:01:50.950> to

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
dangerous in case it was like we got to

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.669 
dangerous in case it was like we got to
