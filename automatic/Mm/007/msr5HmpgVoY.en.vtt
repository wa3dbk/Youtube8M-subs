00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
now there's about eight different spawn

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
now there's about eight different spawn
locations<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> sparks<00:00:54.539> up<00:00:54.690> here<00:00:54.960> there's

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
locations for the sparks up here there's

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
locations for the sparks up here there's
not<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.770> many<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.399> spawned<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.030> said

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
not that many that spawned like I said

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.819 
not that many that spawned like I said
there's<00:00:57.510> pretty<00:00:57.750> much<00:00:57.809> only<00:00:58.109> eight<00:00:58.469> that

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
there's pretty much only eight that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.290 
there's pretty much only eight that
spawn<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.579> from<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.059> I've<00:01:00.180> seen

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
spawn up here and from what I've seen

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020 
spawn up here and from what I've seen
they<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> minute<00:01:01.949> respawn<00:01:02.670> timer

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
they have about a minute respawn timer

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.359 
they have about a minute respawn timer
now<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.870> reason<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.409> respawn<00:01:04.799> time<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.189> worth

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
now the reason the respawn time is worth

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.340 
now the reason the respawn time is worth
mentioning<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:06.119> only<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> help<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.020> and

able<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> kill<00:01:09.210> without<00:01:09.390> having<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> wait

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
able to kill without having to wait

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.179 
able to kill without having to wait
around<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.710> also<00:01:10.860> worth<00:01:11.100> mentioning

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
around but it's also worth mentioning

have<00:03:11.190> four<00:03:11.580> percent<00:03:11.940> less<00:03:12.090> magic<00:03:12.480> fine<00:03:12.690> but

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
have four percent less magic fine but

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.660 
have four percent less magic fine but
that<00:03:13.170> four<00:03:13.470> percent<00:03:13.830> difference<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.370> very

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
that four percent difference is very

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.610 
that four percent difference is very
very<00:03:15.360> very<00:03:15.780> small<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.780> it's<00:03:19.080> not<00:03:19.260> going<00:03:19.440> to

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
very very small so it's not going to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.770 
very very small so it's not going to
really<00:03:19.770> matter<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.940> much<00:03:21.240> with<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
really matter that that much with the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.420 
really matter that that much with the
you<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.530> with<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.709> four<00:03:23.070> percent

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
you know with the four percent

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.970 
you know with the four percent
difference<00:03:23.610> i<00:03:23.940> mean<00:03:24.120> i'm<00:03:25.020> sure<00:03:25.260> some<00:03:25.680> people

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
difference i mean i'm sure some people

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.830 
difference i mean i'm sure some people
out<00:03:26.070> there<00:03:26.130> would<00:03:26.520> beg<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.850> differ<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.450> i<00:03:27.660> mean

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
out there would beg to differ but i mean

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.860 
out there would beg to differ but i mean
come<00:03:28.080> on<00:03:28.140> now<00:03:28.380> really<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:28.950> even<00:03:29.700> if<00:03:29.940> i<00:03:30.270> look<00:03:30.690> at

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:39.339 
I recommend using a much lower salvage

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.760 
I recommend using a much lower salvage
kit<00:05:39.610> don't<00:05:40.210> use<00:05:40.449> like<00:05:40.659> a<00:05:40.689> master<00:05:41.139> salvage<00:05:41.560> kit

on<00:05:41.949> one<00:05:42.189> of<00:05:42.279> these<00:05:42.370> but<00:05:42.639> instead<00:05:42.969> carrying

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
on one of these but instead carrying

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.600

around a crude salvage kit the reason

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.769 
around a crude salvage kit the reason
you<00:05:45.699> want<00:05:45.879> to<00:05:45.909> carry<00:05:46.089> around<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.539> crude

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
Salvage kits or even the basic salvage

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.119 
Salvage kits or even the basic salvage
kits<00:05:49.629> is<00:05:49.779> because<00:05:49.990> there's<00:05:50.199> so<00:05:50.409> much<00:05:50.589> cheaper

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
kits is because there's so much cheaper

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.129 
kits is because there's so much cheaper
you<00:05:51.729> don't<00:05:51.879> have<00:05:52.000> to<00:05:52.089> worry<00:05:52.240> about<00:05:52.360> paying<00:05:52.569> 15

silver<00:05:53.560> for<00:05:53.800> 25<00:05:54.219> uses<00:05:54.699> instead<00:05:55.120> you're<00:05:55.270> only

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
silver for 25 uses instead you're only

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.499 
silver for 25 uses instead you're only
paying<00:05:55.629> like<00:05:55.930> what<00:05:56.830> is<00:05:56.949> 88<00:05:57.460> silver<00:05:57.849> for<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.089> 25

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
paying like what is 88 silver for the 25

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.170 
paying like what is 88 silver for the 25
uses<00:05:58.899> for<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.199> basic<00:05:59.560> so<00:06:00.099> what<00:06:00.399> this<00:06:00.610> does<00:06:00.909> is

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
uses for the basic so what this does is

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.290 
uses for the basic so what this does is
it<00:06:01.270> increases<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.729> well<00:06:03.729> you're<00:06:04.000> not<00:06:04.120> going
