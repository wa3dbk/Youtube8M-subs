co-founder the lovely Jeremy Harmon and
we're<00:00:05.730> working<00:00:05.819> on<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.060> company<00:00:06.299> called

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
we're working on a company called

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.360 
we're working on a company called
plethora<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.890> just<00:00:07.919> wanted<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> go

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
plethora and we just wanted to go

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.290 
plethora and we just wanted to go
through<00:00:08.610> some<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:08.970> stuff<00:00:09.120> we're

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
through some of this stuff we're

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.850 
through some of this stuff we're
thinking<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.019> then<00:00:10.110> give<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> demo<00:00:10.679> at

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
thinking of and then give you a demo at

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.589 
thinking of and then give you a demo at
the<00:00:10.980> end<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.309> show<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.880> glimpse<00:00:12.480> of

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the end to show you this a glimpse of

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.720 
the end to show you this a glimpse of
some<00:00:13.230> stuff<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.530> got<00:00:13.830> working<00:00:14.160> literally

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
some stuff we just got working literally

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.830 
some stuff we just got working literally
like<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> few<00:00:15.179> days<00:00:15.299> ago<00:00:16.310> next<00:00:17.539> isn't<00:00:18.539> working

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
like a few days ago next isn't working

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.700 
like a few days ago next isn't working
so<00:00:19.170> okay<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.580> basically<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:21.930> i<00:00:22.080> think<00:00:22.260> i

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
so okay so basically right now i think i

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.410 
so okay so basically right now i think i
should<00:00:23.160> give<00:00:23.279> everyone<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.640> congratulations

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
should give everyone to congratulations

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.269 
should give everyone to congratulations
i<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.350> community<00:00:25.619> has<00:00:25.859> actually

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
i think that this community has actually

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
i think that this community has actually
solved<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.849> problem<00:00:27.060> largely<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.529> can

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
solved this problem largely that you can

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.109 
solved this problem largely that you can
actually<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> know<00:00:29.130> get<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.369> Arduino<00:00:29.789> from

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
actually you know get an Arduino from

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.550 
actually you know get an Arduino from
Adafruit<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.630> sparkfun<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.170> something<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
Adafruit or sparkfun or something you

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.470 
Adafruit or sparkfun or something you
can<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> Pinocchio<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.489> get<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:33.180> 3d

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
can go to Pinocchio and get your 3d

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.389 
can go to Pinocchio and get your 3d
printing<00:00:33.840> closures<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.290> shapeways<00:00:34.890> then<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
printing closures or shapeways then you

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.680 
printing closures or shapeways then you
can<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> tech<00:00:35.820> job<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.149> assemble<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
can get a tech job and assemble it and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.690 
can get a tech job and assemble it and
test<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.140> it's<00:00:37.680> pretty<00:00:37.980> easy<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
test it it's pretty easy to get to a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060 
test it it's pretty easy to get to a
prototype<00:00:39.239> now<00:00:39.480> which<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> awesome<00:00:40.590> that's

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
prototype now which is awesome that's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.779 
prototype now which is awesome that's
that<00:00:41.280> sucked<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.059> long<00:00:43.309> but<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.579> problem

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
that sucked for so long but the problem

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.160 
that sucked for so long but the problem
is<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.059> manufacturing<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.050> hasn't

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is that manufacturing really hasn't

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.660 
is that manufacturing really hasn't
changed<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.649> much<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.039> still<00:00:47.250> freaking

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
changed that much it's still freaking

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
changed that much it's still freaking
hard<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> took<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.289> tour<00:00:49.530> actually

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
hard and you know I took a tour actually

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.470 
hard and you know I took a tour actually
of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.340> Ford<00:00:50.579> Rouge<00:00:50.730> River<00:00:50.910> plant<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.420> they

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
of the Ford Rouge River plant and they

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.150 
of the Ford Rouge River plant and they
had<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.690> video<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.320> Model<00:00:52.649> T<00:00:52.800> making

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
had this video about Model T making

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.130 
had this video about Model T making
beforehand<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> laughing

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
beforehand and I was kind of laughing

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
beforehand and I was kind of laughing
cuz<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.559> went<00:00:55.739> into<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> factory<00:00:56.430> me<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.789> how

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
cuz we went into the factory me like how

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.340 
cuz we went into the factory me like how
this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.120> actually<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> same<00:00:57.870> thing<00:00:58.199> but

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this is actually the same thing but

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.619 
this is actually the same thing but
different<00:00:58.500> vehicles<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.340> color<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.850> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
different vehicles and in color and you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
different vehicles and in color and you
know<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> little<00:01:01.230> bit<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.280> bit

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
know it's a little bit it's a little bit

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
know it's a little bit it's a little bit
you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.149> more<00:01:03.480> advanced<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.019> there's<00:01:04.199> you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you know more advanced and there's you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.660 
you know more advanced and there's you
know<00:01:04.320> electric<00:01:04.650> screwdrivers<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.460> sorts

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
know electric screwdrivers and all sorts

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.100 
know electric screwdrivers and all sorts
of<00:01:05.700> cool<00:01:05.880> stuff<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.420> um<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.020> know

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
of cool stuff but um you know

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.090 
of cool stuff but um you know
fundamentally<00:01:07.290> there's<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
fundamentally there's like a lot of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.560 
fundamentally there's like a lot of
setup<00:01:08.400> costs<00:01:08.729> everything<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.510> you

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
setup costs everything with this and you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.940 
setup costs everything with this and you
gotta<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.799> lot<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
gotta you know you got to do a lot of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.320 
gotta you know you got to do a lot of
stuff<00:01:11.220> that's<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.460> pretty<00:01:11.729> hard<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> know

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
stuff that's a pretty hard for you know

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.260 
stuff that's a pretty hard for you know
a<00:01:12.360> person<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> budget<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> essentially<00:01:15.119> what

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
a person on a budget so essentially what

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.399 
a person on a budget so essentially what
i<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> come<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> talk<00:01:15.960> about<00:01:16.080> today<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
i want to come to talk about today is

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
i want to come to talk about today is
like<00:01:16.560> development<00:01:17.100> environments<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.880> i

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
like development environments and i

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580 
like development environments and i
think<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> huge<00:01:18.689> deal<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.380> from

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
think this is a huge deal for going from

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.560 
think this is a huge deal for going from
prototype<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> manufacturing<00:01:21.090> i<00:01:21.180> think<00:01:21.360> Carl

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
prototype to manufacturing i think Carl

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.030 
prototype to manufacturing i think Carl
litter<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> stuff<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.710> I'm

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
litter do a lot of the stuff that I'm

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.320 
litter do a lot of the stuff that I'm
gonna<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.220> talking<00:01:23.369> about<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.850> well<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.210> when

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
gonna be talking about as well so when

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.179 
gonna be talking about as well so when
you<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.869> code<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.860> some

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you think of like code you have some

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.410 
you think of like code you have some
kind<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.000> text<00:01:27.299> editor

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
kind of you know this is a text editor

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
kind of you know this is a text editor
sublime<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.320> might<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:28.799> terminal

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
sublime you might have some terminal

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
sublime you might have some terminal
open<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.850> debug<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.390> real<00:01:30.540> time<00:01:30.890> with

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
open and you can debug in real time with

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.830 
open and you can debug in real time with
inventor<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.329> inventor<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
inventor you know you have inventor you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.210 
inventor you know you have inventor you
can<00:01:33.960> design<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.740> ideas<00:01:35.070> from

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
can design you can take your ideas from

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
can design you can take your ideas from
your<00:01:35.369> brain<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:35.909> them<00:01:36.000> into<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.240> 3d<00:01:36.570> file

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
your brain and put them into a 3d file

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.280 
your brain and put them into a 3d file
and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.549> know<00:01:38.670> next<00:01:39.090> sublime<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.079> kind

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and then you know next sublime is kind

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.690 
and then you know next sublime is kind
of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> same<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.799> debug<00:01:40.920> instantly<00:01:41.460> but

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of the same you can debug instantly but

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.539 
of the same you can debug instantly but
now<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.810> want<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:42.990> debug<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.380> parts<00:01:43.829> you

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
now if you want to debug your parts you

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
now if you want to debug your parts you
have<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.850> talk<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.299> student<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.079> is

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
have to talk to this student and this is

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.640 
have to talk to this student and this is
an<00:01:46.380> old<00:01:46.590> man<00:01:46.860> and

the<00:02:00.140> high<00:02:00.500> priest<00:02:00.890> of<00:02:01.070> manufacturing<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.090> you

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
the high priest of manufacturing and you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.790 
the high priest of manufacturing and you
have<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.780> come<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:02.960> them<00:02:03.170> your<00:02:03.290> design<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.680> say

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
have to come to them your design and say

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.740 
have to come to them your design and say
okay<00:02:04.040> where<00:02:04.250> did<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.430> mess<00:02:04.640> up<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.150> then<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.660> go

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
okay where did I mess up and then you go

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.910 
okay where did I mess up and then you go
through<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:06.020> iterative<00:02:06.350> process<00:02:06.740> where<00:02:06.860> he

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
through this iterative process where he

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
through this iterative process where he
tells<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.220> where<00:02:07.340> you're<00:02:07.460> wrong<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.910> you

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
tells you where you're wrong and you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.630 
tells you where you're wrong and you
keep<00:02:08.119> going<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:09.649> know<00:02:09.770> this<00:02:10.070> is<00:02:10.130> instant

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
keep going and you know this is instant

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.740 
keep going and you know this is instant
this<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:10.940> like<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.210> know<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.330> gotta<00:02:11.480> call<00:02:11.720> a

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
this is like you know you gotta call a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.210 
this is like you know you gotta call a
guy<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.080> bug<00:02:12.350> him<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.770> you're<00:02:12.920> not<00:02:13.010> going<00:02:13.160> to

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
guy in bug him and you're not going to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.100 
guy in bug him and you're not going to
do<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.610> entire<00:02:13.880> time<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.540> know<00:02:14.660> on<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
do that the entire time you know on and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.960 
do that the entire time you know on and
on<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.830> want<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> get<00:02:16.310> past<00:02:16.580> this

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
on and on so I want to get past this

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.720 
on and on so I want to get past this
kind<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.270> stuff<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.380> we're<00:02:18.920> looking<00:02:19.010> at<00:02:19.250> where

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
kind of stuff so we're looking at where

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.880 
kind of stuff so we're looking at where
where<00:02:20.240> can<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:20.480> go<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.830> think

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
where can we go to do this and I think

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.740 
where can we go to do this and I think
the<00:02:22.220> best<00:02:22.430> way<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:23.000> right<00:02:23.209> in<00:02:23.390> front<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.660> your

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the best way is right in front of your

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.050 
the best way is right in front of your
face<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.260> your<00:02:24.320> CAD<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:25.070> think<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.640> CAD<00:02:25.820> should

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
face in your CAD I think that CAD should

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.890 
face in your CAD I think that CAD should
be<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.209> an<00:02:26.300> integrated<00:02:26.720> development

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
be like an integrated development

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.900 
be like an integrated development
environment<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.950> can<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.400> design<00:02:28.640> stuff

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
environment you can you can design stuff

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.400 
environment you can you can design stuff
you<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.120> pull<00:02:29.300> parks<00:02:29.600> libraries<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.200> from

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
you can pull parks libraries in from

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.110 
you can pull parks libraries in from
something<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.709> McMaster<00:02:31.459> for<00:02:31.640> your<00:02:31.760> bolts

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
something like McMaster for your bolts

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.760 
something like McMaster for your bolts
and<00:02:32.270> something<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:33.050> can<00:02:33.230> share<00:02:33.620> that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
and something you can share that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.530 
and something you can share that
you've<00:02:33.890> made<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.760> can<00:02:34.970> actually<00:02:35.150> simulate

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
you've made you can actually simulate

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.449 
you've made you can actually simulate
what<00:02:35.930> you've<00:02:36.080> made<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.770> can<00:02:36.920> validate<00:02:37.280> its

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
what you've made you can validate its

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.610 
what you've made you can validate its
manufacturing<00:02:38.150> quote<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.260> see<00:02:39.380> what<00:02:39.500> your

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
manufacturing quote to see what your

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.490 
manufacturing quote to see what your
prices<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.310> then<00:02:40.430> say<00:02:40.730> okay<00:02:41.270> make<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:43.270> and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
prices and then say okay make this and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.660 
prices and then say okay make this and
so<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.590> call<00:02:45.740> this<00:02:45.770> real-time<00:02:46.070> engineering<00:02:46.640> I

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
so I call this real-time engineering I

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.949 
so I call this real-time engineering I
think<00:02:46.850> it's<00:02:46.970> steve<00:02:47.150> ballmer<00:02:47.630> was<00:02:47.780> very

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
think it's steve ballmer was very

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.930 
think it's steve ballmer was very
prescient<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.680> mean<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.550> really<00:02:49.700> what<00:02:49.910> you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
prescient I mean this is really what you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.490 
prescient I mean this is really what you
have<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.270> focus<00:02:50.450> on<00:02:50.750> for<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:50.990> kind<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.290> stuff

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
have to focus on for this kind of stuff

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.810 
have to focus on for this kind of stuff
we<00:02:51.620> don't<00:02:51.709> want<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.950> focus<00:02:52.130> on<00:02:52.340> making<00:02:52.580> all

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
we don't want to focus on making all

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.160 
we don't want to focus on making all
this<00:02:52.910> stuff<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.209> very<00:02:53.360> manufacturing

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
this stuff it's very manufacturing

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.660 
this stuff it's very manufacturing
centric<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.769> should<00:02:55.070> be<00:02:55.100> very<00:02:55.190> engineered

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
centric it should be very engineered

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.729 
centric it should be very engineered
centric<00:02:56.209> we<00:02:56.330> want<00:02:56.480> engineering<00:02:57.019> super<00:02:57.380> powers

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
centric we want engineering super powers

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.290 
centric we want engineering super powers
right<00:02:57.769> like<00:02:58.550> we<00:02:58.670> want<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.850> be<00:02:58.910> able<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.090> say

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
right like we want to be able to say

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.540 
right like we want to be able to say
give<00:02:59.750> me<00:02:59.830> manufacturing<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.100> you<00:03:01.130> know<00:03:01.459> you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
give me manufacturing and you know you

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.979 
give me manufacturing and you know you
just<00:03:01.640> wanna<00:03:01.820> be<00:03:01.850> able<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.060> do<00:03:02.239> this<00:03:02.420> stuff<00:03:02.720> and

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
just wanna be able to do this stuff and

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.870 
just wanna be able to do this stuff and
then<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:04.130> know<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.610> what<00:03:04.760> we're

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
then you know so this is what we're

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.729 
then you know so this is what we're
thinking<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.239> doing<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:05.870> we<00:03:06.320> started<00:03:06.650> this

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
thinking of doing so we started this

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.530 
thinking of doing so we started this
company<00:03:07.070> plethora<00:03:07.550> essentially<00:03:08.209> with<00:03:08.360> two

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
company plethora essentially with two

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.850 
company plethora essentially with two
different<00:03:08.720> things<00:03:08.900> we<00:03:09.080> want<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.290> do<00:03:09.470> we<00:03:09.650> want

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
different things we want to do we want

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.199 
different things we want to do we want
to<00:03:10.100> do<00:03:10.190> this<00:03:10.310> kind<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.580> design<00:03:10.760> validation

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
to do this kind of design validation

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.210 
to do this kind of design validation
which<00:03:11.630> some<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.320> no<00:03:12.440> like<00:03:12.680> design<00:03:13.040> for

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
which some of you is no like design for

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.770 
which some of you is no like design for
manufacturability<00:03:13.790> knowing<00:03:14.450> if<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.630> can

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
manufacturability knowing if you can

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.540 
manufacturability knowing if you can
actually<00:03:15.110> make<00:03:15.260> something<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.860> then<00:03:16.400> once

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
actually make something and then once

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.590 
actually make something and then once
you<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:16.850> we're<00:03:17.120> gonna<00:03:17.269> actually<00:03:17.360> have

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
you have that we're gonna actually have

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.479 
you have that we're gonna actually have
a<00:03:17.630> factory<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.230> make<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> kind

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
a factory to make it so this is the kind

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.110 
a factory to make it so this is the kind
of<00:03:19.550> big<00:03:19.730> long-term<00:03:20.150> goal<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:20.989> us<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:22.910> let's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
of big long-term goal for us so let's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.670 
of big long-term goal for us so let's
actually<00:03:23.269> try<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.080> kind<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.290> risky

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
actually try it this is kind of risky

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.080 
actually try it this is kind of risky
but<00:03:24.890> Jeremy<00:03:25.519> is<00:03:25.580> actually<00:03:25.790> going<00:03:25.880> to<00:03:25.970> run

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
but Jeremy is actually going to run

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.670 
but Jeremy is actually going to run
through<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.330> demo<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:26.959> then<00:03:27.170> I'll<00:03:27.320> sort<00:03:27.560> of

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
through a demo and then I'll sort of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:36.400 
through a demo and then I'll sort of
just<00:03:27.860> give<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.310> play-by-play<00:03:30.250> cool<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:35.410> now

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
just give the play-by-play cool so now

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:52.980 
just give the play-by-play cool so now
you're<00:03:36.560> good

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.230 

oh<00:03:53.050> is<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:53.950> powerpoint<00:03:54.670> mode<00:03:57.000> it's<00:03:58.000> cool

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
oh is it the powerpoint mode it's cool

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.820 
oh is it the powerpoint mode it's cool
this<00:03:58.720> is<00:03:58.840> what<00:03:58.990> happens<00:03:59.260> when<00:03:59.320> you<00:03:59.440> live<00:03:59.590> demo

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
this is what happens when you live demo

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.800 
this is what happens when you live demo
something<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:01.150> essentially<00:04:01.450> we're<00:04:01.540> going<00:04:01.720> to

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
something so essentially we're going to

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.620 
something so essentially we're going to
be<00:04:01.900> seeing<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:02.730> autodesk<00:04:03.730> starting<00:04:04.180> up<00:04:04.360> and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
be seeing is autodesk starting up and

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:18.379 
be seeing is autodesk starting up and
then

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.860 

okay<00:04:19.169> sweet<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:21.120> we're<00:04:21.329> saying<00:04:21.599> here<00:04:21.719> that

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
okay sweet so we're saying here that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.510 
okay sweet so we're saying here that
we're<00:04:22.049> making<00:04:22.379> some<00:04:22.590> like<00:04:22.770> camera<00:04:23.280> mount

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
we're making some like camera mount

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.830 
we're making some like camera mount
essentially<00:04:24.060> we're<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:24.330> thinking<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.719> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
essentially we're just thinking to the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.379 
essentially we're just thinking to the
design<00:04:25.080> process<00:04:25.259> as<00:04:25.800> we're<00:04:26.729> doing<00:04:26.879> this<00:04:27.120> so

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
design process as we're doing this so

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.909 
design process as we're doing this so
Jeremy's<00:04:28.199> going<00:04:28.319> to<00:04:28.379> actually<00:04:28.499> start<00:04:28.800> by

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
Jeremy's going to actually start by

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.719 
Jeremy's going to actually start by
making<00:04:29.039> kind<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.460> base<00:04:29.639> block<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:32.610> gonna

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
making kind of a base block you gonna

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.850 
making kind of a base block you gonna
have<00:04:32.849> to<00:04:32.909> plug<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.210> up<00:04:33.300> okay<00:04:34.139> cool<00:04:34.379> sweet<00:04:34.740> so

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
have to plug it up okay cool sweet so

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.140 
have to plug it up okay cool sweet so
you<00:04:34.949> open<00:04:35.159> the<00:04:35.189> plug-in<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.550> we<00:04:35.699> made<00:04:35.909> and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
you open the plug-in that we made and

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.760 
you open the plug-in that we made and
you<00:04:36.509> can<00:04:36.659> see<00:04:36.870> right<00:04:36.900> now<00:04:37.080> it's<00:04:37.379> having<00:04:37.680> this

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
you can see right now it's having this

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.409 
you can see right now it's having this
wasteful<00:04:38.279> stock<00:04:38.610> thickness<00:04:38.969> so<00:04:39.060> essentially

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
wasteful stock thickness so essentially

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.790 
wasteful stock thickness so essentially
what<00:04:39.539> he's<00:04:39.689> done<00:04:39.930> when<00:04:40.139> he<00:04:40.169> made<00:04:40.439> it<00:04:40.560> he<00:04:40.620> says

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
what he's done when he made it he says

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.140 
what he's done when he made it he says
oh<00:04:41.009> this<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.430> actually<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:41.699> little<00:04:41.789> bit<00:04:41.969> bigger

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
oh this is actually a little bit bigger

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.510 
oh this is actually a little bit bigger
than<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.360> standard<00:04:42.810> sized<00:04:43.110> stuck<00:04:43.949> if<00:04:44.189> you<00:04:44.279> trim

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
than a standard sized stuck if you trim

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.830 
than a standard sized stuck if you trim
that<00:04:44.639> down<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:44.909> little<00:04:45.029> bit<00:04:45.300> you're<00:04:45.659> actually

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
that down a little bit you're actually

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.929 
that down a little bit you're actually
going<00:04:46.139> to<00:04:46.259> be<00:04:46.319> able<00:04:46.439> like<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.669> actually

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
going to be able like this to actually

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:49.249 
going to be able like this to actually
have<00:04:48.029> a<00:04:48.060> centerpiece<00:04:48.539> of<00:04:48.599> saw<00:04:48.719> can<00:04:48.900> save<00:04:49.050> some

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
have a centerpiece of saw can save some

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.360 
have a centerpiece of saw can save some
money<00:04:49.379> essentially<00:04:49.949> so<00:04:50.129> it's<00:04:50.249> something

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
money essentially so it's something

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.469 
money essentially so it's something
someone<00:04:50.669> would<00:04:50.699> tell<00:04:50.909> you<00:04:51.000> if<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.240> were<00:04:51.330> going

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
someone would tell you if you were going

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.360 
someone would tell you if you were going
through<00:04:51.779> this<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.620> in<00:04:52.740> Jeremy<00:04:53.009> is<00:04:53.069> now<00:04:53.159> putting

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
through this so in Jeremy is now putting

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.760 
through this so in Jeremy is now putting
some<00:04:53.610> holes<00:04:53.819> through<00:04:54.150> here<00:04:54.389> just<00:04:54.689> to<00:04:54.779> say<00:04:54.990> what

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
some holes through here just to say what

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.170 
some holes through here just to say what
you<00:04:56.069> know<00:04:56.159> add<00:04:56.279> some<00:04:56.520> holes<00:04:56.699> of<00:04:56.819> the<00:04:56.849> figure

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
you know add some holes of the figure

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.640 
you know add some holes of the figure
and<00:04:57.330> we<00:04:57.419> can<00:04:57.539> see<00:04:57.779> what<00:04:57.810> actually<00:04:58.349> happens

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
and we can see what actually happens

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.839 
and we can see what actually happens
when<00:04:58.860> you're<00:04:59.039> thinking<00:04:59.370> about<00:04:59.460> doing<00:04:59.580> some

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
when you're thinking about doing some

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.619 
when you're thinking about doing some
holes<00:05:00.000> ways<00:05:00.180> you<00:05:00.360> know<00:05:00.449> defining<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.930> holes

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
holes ways you know defining the holes

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.760 
holes ways you know defining the holes
okay<00:05:03.629> so<00:05:03.689> you<00:05:03.840> see<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.080> whole<00:05:04.229> turns<00:05:04.439> red

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
okay so you see the whole turns red

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.409 
okay so you see the whole turns red
indicating<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:05.550> know<00:05:05.639> something<00:05:06.060> like<00:05:06.210> red

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
indicating you know something like red

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.420 
indicating you know something like red
means<00:05:06.659> you<00:05:06.870> cannot<00:05:07.110> do<00:05:07.319> this<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:08.189> right

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
means you cannot do this and this right

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.010 
means you cannot do this and this right
now<00:05:08.550> is<00:05:08.729> it's<00:05:08.939> saying<00:05:09.180> hole<00:05:09.569> diameter<00:05:09.900> too

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
now is it's saying hole diameter too

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.450 
now is it's saying hole diameter too
small<00:05:10.349> so<00:05:10.620> essentially<00:05:11.009> you<00:05:11.129> know<00:05:11.189> you<00:05:11.279> can't

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
small so essentially you know you can't

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.070 
small so essentially you know you can't
get<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.580> drill<00:05:11.819> bit<00:05:11.969> this<00:05:12.150> small<00:05:12.449> it's<00:05:12.900> two

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
get a drill bit this small it's two

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.420 
get a drill bit this small it's two
millimeters<00:05:13.589> you<00:05:13.680> just<00:05:13.830> can't<00:05:14.009> do<00:05:14.129> this<00:05:14.279> so

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
millimeters you just can't do this so

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.619 
millimeters you just can't do this so
then<00:05:14.550> generally<00:05:14.819> goes<00:05:14.939> in<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.180> edit<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.449> this

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
then generally goes in and edit to this

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.450 
then generally goes in and edit to this
and<00:05:15.930> then<00:05:16.499> you<00:05:16.589> can<00:05:16.740> see<00:05:16.919> it<00:05:17.039> you<00:05:17.129> know<00:05:17.219> in<00:05:17.310> real

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
and then you can see it you know in real

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.950 
and then you can see it you know in real
time<00:05:17.699> okay<00:05:17.939> now<00:05:17.969> there's<00:05:18.330> no<00:05:18.449> longer<00:05:18.659> an<00:05:18.779> error

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
time okay now there's no longer an error

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.290 
time okay now there's no longer an error
and<00:05:19.199> then<00:05:19.589> you're<00:05:19.740> good<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:20.310> same<00:05:21.270> thing

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
and then you're good and same thing

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.019 
and then you're good and same thing
another<00:05:21.689> hole<00:05:21.900> we<00:05:22.050> copied<00:05:22.409> it<00:05:22.500> cool<00:05:25.729> so<00:05:26.729> also

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
another hole we copied it cool so also

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.730 
another hole we copied it cool so also
you<00:05:27.210> can<00:05:27.389> see<00:05:27.539> over<00:05:27.689> here<00:05:27.719> the<00:05:28.289> pricing

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
you can see over here the pricing

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.350 
you can see over here the pricing
dynamically<00:05:29.189> changes<00:05:29.610> so<00:05:29.699> every<00:05:29.909> feature<00:05:30.120> you

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
dynamically changes so every feature you

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.029 
dynamically changes so every feature you
can<00:05:30.479> tell<00:05:30.689> like<00:05:30.779> this<00:05:30.960> whole<00:05:31.169> cost<00:05:31.469> five<00:05:31.740> cents

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
can tell like this whole cost five cents

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.679 
can tell like this whole cost five cents
so<00:05:32.580> if<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.729> wanted<00:05:32.939> to<00:05:33.000> delete<00:05:33.180> features<00:05:33.599> you

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
so if you wanted to delete features you

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:35.119 
so if you wanted to delete features you
can<00:05:33.719> actually<00:05:33.930> real<00:05:34.169> time<00:05:34.379> see<00:05:34.560> every<00:05:34.919> feature

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:35.129 
can actually real time see every feature

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.129 
can actually real time see every feature
cost<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.759> this<00:05:35.819> as<00:05:36.000> well<00:05:36.120> as<00:05:36.300> like<00:05:36.449> your<00:05:36.810> set<00:05:37.050> up

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
cost of this as well as like your set up

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.950 
cost of this as well as like your set up
in<00:05:37.259> the<00:05:37.289> new<00:05:37.349> unit<00:05:37.649> cost<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:38.339> is<00:05:38.490> dfm<00:05:39.000> against

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
in the new unit cost this is dfm against

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.540 
in the new unit cost this is dfm against
the<00:05:40.349> line<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.710> we<00:05:40.830> have<00:05:41.039> so<00:05:41.279> this<00:05:41.430> actually

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
the line that we have so this actually

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.800 
the line that we have so this actually
knows<00:05:41.849> all<00:05:41.969> the<00:05:42.029> drill<00:05:42.240> bits<00:05:42.389> we<00:05:42.479> have<00:05:42.599> all<00:05:42.719> the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
knows all the drill bits we have all the

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.300 
knows all the drill bits we have all the
taps<00:05:43.020> we<00:05:43.259> have<00:05:43.409> all<00:05:43.620> that<00:05:43.710> kind<00:05:43.919> of<00:05:43.949> stuff<00:05:44.009> and

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
taps we have all that kind of stuff and

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.010 
taps we have all that kind of stuff and
it's<00:05:44.490> feeding<00:05:44.669> into<00:05:45.000> how<00:05:45.120> expensive<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:45.719> is<00:05:45.810> so

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
it's feeding into how expensive it is so

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.629 
it's feeding into how expensive it is so
you<00:05:46.439> can't<00:05:46.710> get<00:05:46.770> yourself<00:05:47.129> in<00:05:47.250> trouble<00:05:47.279> with

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
you can't get yourself in trouble with

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.429 
you can't get yourself in trouble with
this<00:05:47.759> so<00:05:47.879> you<00:05:47.939> see<00:05:48.089> right<00:05:48.270> now<00:05:48.300> making<00:05:49.229> this

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:49.439 
this so you see right now making this

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:50.600 
this so you see right now making this
you<00:05:49.680> know<00:05:49.770> hold<00:05:49.979> that<00:05:50.039> goes<00:05:50.219> all<00:05:50.399> the<00:05:50.430> way

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
you know hold that goes all the way

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.170 
you know hold that goes all the way
through<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:52.250> finding<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.430> then<00:05:53.849> it<00:05:53.939> turns

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
through the finding and then it turns

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.579 
through the finding and then it turns
red<00:05:54.449> and<00:05:54.509> essentially<00:05:55.020> this<00:05:55.080> is<00:05:55.139> because<00:05:55.439> it's

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:55.589 
red and essentially this is because it's

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.170 
red and essentially this is because it's
too<00:05:55.800> long<00:05:55.979> for<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.339> drill<00:05:56.550> bit<00:05:56.669> to<00:05:56.699> go<00:05:56.879> through

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
too long for the drill bit to go through

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.459 
too long for the drill bit to go through
so<00:05:57.689> you<00:05:57.750> wouldn't<00:05:57.990> really<00:05:58.080> know<00:05:58.229> that<00:05:58.379> you

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
so you wouldn't really know that you

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:59.749 
so you wouldn't really know that you
wouldn't<00:05:58.680> know<00:05:58.830> like<00:05:59.009> Oh<00:05:59.129> what<00:05:59.159> drill<00:05:59.490> bits<00:05:59.639> is

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
wouldn't know like Oh what drill bits is

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.800 
wouldn't know like Oh what drill bits is
your<00:05:59.879> company<00:06:00.180> using<00:06:00.389> that's<00:06:00.509> kind<00:06:00.689> of<00:06:00.719> a

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
your company using that's kind of a

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.480 
your company using that's kind of a
low-end<00:06:01.169> thing<00:06:01.500> and<00:06:01.770> it<00:06:02.009> might<00:06:02.159> tell<00:06:02.310> you<00:06:02.370> you

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
low-end thing and it might tell you you

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.939 
low-end thing and it might tell you you
can't<00:06:02.729> do<00:06:02.909> this<00:06:03.089> so<00:06:03.870> then<00:06:04.050> you<00:06:04.409> can<00:06:04.560> go<00:06:04.680> in<00:06:04.830> and

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
can't do this so then you can go in and

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:05.990 
can't do this so then you can go in and
actually<00:06:05.069> see<00:06:05.370> you<00:06:05.490> know<00:06:05.550> there's<00:06:05.759> an<00:06:05.849> error

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
actually see you know there's an error

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.909 
actually see you know there's an error
and<00:06:06.330> then<00:06:06.659> it<00:06:06.750> just<00:06:06.839> keeps<00:06:07.050> you<00:06:07.589> know<00:06:07.680> you<00:06:07.740> can

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
and then it just keeps you know you can

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.529 
and then it just keeps you know you can
define<00:06:08.189> this<00:06:08.399> and<00:06:08.729> you<00:06:09.000> can<00:06:09.120> make<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.270> pocket

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
define this and you can make a pocket

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.059 
define this and you can make a pocket
like<00:06:09.899> Jeremy's<00:06:10.259> doing<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:10.649> say<00:06:10.770> okay<00:06:10.919> let's

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
like Jeremy's doing to say okay let's

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.290 
like Jeremy's doing to say okay let's
actually<00:06:11.310> make<00:06:11.520> it<00:06:11.639> so<00:06:11.729> we<00:06:11.789> can<00:06:11.939> get<00:06:12.029> in<00:06:12.149> from

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
actually make it so we can get in from

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:26.239 
actually make it so we can get in from
both<00:06:12.449> sides

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:26.249 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:34.549 

and<00:06:26.369> then<00:06:26.939> we<00:06:27.029> run<00:06:27.149> into<00:06:27.359> oh<00:06:30.499> no<00:06:33.319> okay<00:06:34.319> three

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:34.559 
and then we run into oh no okay three

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:36.949 
and then we run into oh no okay three
minutes<00:06:34.589> okay<00:06:35.549> so<00:06:35.609> I'm<00:06:35.969> going<00:06:36.089> to<00:06:36.149> ad-lib<00:06:36.359> this

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:36.959 
minutes okay so I'm going to ad-lib this

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.499 
minutes okay so I'm going to ad-lib this
entire<00:06:37.259> thing<00:06:37.559> so<00:06:38.459> essentially<00:06:38.909> what<00:06:39.089> happens

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509 
entire thing so essentially what happens

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:41.869 
entire thing so essentially what happens
is<00:06:39.689> is<00:06:40.019> we're<00:06:40.979> going<00:06:41.099> to<00:06:41.159> have<00:06:41.339> you<00:06:41.579> look<00:06:41.759> at<00:06:41.819> a

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:41.879 
is is we're going to have you look at a

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:44.089 
is is we're going to have you look at a
pocket<00:06:42.359> and<00:06:42.509> the<00:06:42.569> pocket<00:06:42.749> turns<00:06:43.169> red<00:06:43.589> like

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099 
pocket and the pocket turns red like

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.429 
pocket and the pocket turns red like
this<00:06:44.369> showing<00:06:45.029> like<00:06:45.479> the<00:06:45.659> inside<00:06:45.959> 90s<00:06:46.379> you

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:46.439 
this showing like the inside 90s you

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.809 
this showing like the inside 90s you
can't<00:06:46.649> do<00:06:46.769> that<00:06:46.889> because<00:06:46.949> the<00:06:47.189> bit<00:06:47.369> is<00:06:47.519> round

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 
can't do that because the bit is round

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.669 
can't do that because the bit is round
this<00:06:48.209> is<00:06:48.329> like<00:06:48.449> a<00:06:48.479> classical<00:06:49.049> thing<00:06:49.229> people

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:49.679 
this is like a classical thing people

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:51.409 
this is like a classical thing people
make<00:06:49.799> mistakes<00:06:49.919> on<00:06:50.429> so<00:06:50.909> then<00:06:51.029> you<00:06:51.089> can<00:06:51.209> go<00:06:51.299> in

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
make mistakes on so then you can go in

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:52.369 
make mistakes on so then you can go in
there<00:06:51.509> and<00:06:51.569> actually<00:06:51.689> round<00:06:52.019> it<00:06:52.139> out<00:06:52.199> and

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
there and actually round it out and

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.049 
there and actually round it out and
it'll<00:06:52.469> tell<00:06:52.649> you<00:06:52.769> that<00:06:52.979> so<00:06:53.489> essentially<00:06:53.849> this

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:54.059 
it'll tell you that so essentially this

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:56.179 
it'll tell you that so essentially this
entire<00:06:54.389> thing<00:06:54.659> is<00:06:54.719> that<00:06:54.959> in<00:06:55.049> real<00:06:55.289> time<00:06:55.649> you

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:56.189 
entire thing is that in real time you

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:57.499 
entire thing is that in real time you
can<00:06:56.369> be<00:06:56.459> designing<00:06:56.789> something<00:06:57.149> and<00:06:57.359> some

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509 
can be designing something and some

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:59.539 
can be designing something and some
feature<00:06:57.749> you<00:06:58.049> make<00:06:58.259> can<00:06:58.409> be<00:06:58.589> evaluated<00:06:58.829> for

00:06:59.539 --> 00:06:59.549 
feature you make can be evaluated for

00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:01.639 
feature you make can be evaluated for
its<00:06:59.879> manufacturability<00:07:00.659> and<00:07:01.079> its<00:07:01.259> cost<00:07:01.499> you

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:01.649 
its manufacturability and its cost you

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:03.350 
its manufacturability and its cost you
do<00:07:01.739> your<00:07:01.860> cost<00:07:02.069> engineering<00:07:02.519> and<00:07:02.819> the<00:07:03.209> other

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
do your cost engineering and the other

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.689 
do your cost engineering and the other
stuff<00:07:03.509> in<00:07:03.569> real<00:07:03.719> time<00:07:03.959> and<00:07:04.229> then<00:07:04.799> you<00:07:05.189> press<00:07:05.399> go

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 
stuff in real time and then you press go

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:07.399 
stuff in real time and then you press go
and<00:07:05.729> then<00:07:06.449> it<00:07:06.569> goes<00:07:06.689> to<00:07:06.719> the<00:07:06.839> factory<00:07:07.169> in<00:07:07.289> this

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:07.409 
and then it goes to the factory in this

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:09.109 
and then it goes to the factory in this
Factory<00:07:07.829> is<00:07:07.889> not<00:07:08.249> like<00:07:08.369> a<00:07:08.429> regular<00:07:08.549> factory

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:09.119 
Factory is not like a regular factory

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:10.369 
Factory is not like a regular factory
it's<00:07:09.299> not<00:07:09.419> like<00:07:09.539> oh<00:07:09.659> we<00:07:09.839> have<00:07:09.929> to<00:07:10.019> like<00:07:10.169> do<00:07:10.259> all

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:10.379 
it's not like oh we have to like do all

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.079 
it's not like oh we have to like do all
this<00:07:10.499> manual<00:07:10.949> stuff<00:07:11.219> essentially<00:07:11.909> the

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:12.089 
this manual stuff essentially the

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:13.699 
this manual stuff essentially the
factory<00:07:12.389> is<00:07:12.509> reconfiguring<00:07:13.049> itself<00:07:13.469> so<00:07:13.619> the

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:13.709 
factory is reconfiguring itself so the

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:15.049 
factory is reconfiguring itself so the
fixturing<00:07:14.129> the<00:07:14.339> g-code<00:07:14.639> all<00:07:14.819> that<00:07:14.909> kind<00:07:15.029> of

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:15.059 
fixturing the g-code all that kind of

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:17.299 
fixturing the g-code all that kind of
stuff<00:07:15.119> is<00:07:15.360> generated<00:07:15.779> dynamically<00:07:16.259> and<00:07:17.159> then

00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:17.309 
stuff is generated dynamically and then

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:18.889 
stuff is generated dynamically and then
it's<00:07:17.459> produced<00:07:17.789> so<00:07:17.939> we<00:07:18.119> makers<00:07:18.479> can<00:07:18.659> actually

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:18.899 
it's produced so we makers can actually

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:19.969 
it's produced so we makers can actually
have<00:07:18.989> access<00:07:19.289> to<00:07:19.379> kind<00:07:19.529> of<00:07:19.589> professional

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
have access to kind of professional

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.979 
have access to kind of professional
grade<00:07:20.189> equipment<00:07:20.459> but<00:07:21.269> this<00:07:21.449> equipment<00:07:21.899> is

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:21.989 
grade equipment but this equipment is

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:24.079 
grade equipment but this equipment is
reconfigurable<00:07:22.949> so<00:07:23.189> the<00:07:23.309> setup<00:07:23.610> times<00:07:23.849> don't

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:24.089 
reconfigurable so the setup times don't

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:25.309 
reconfigurable so the setup times don't
kill<00:07:24.359> you<00:07:24.509> which<00:07:24.659> is<00:07:24.689> the<00:07:24.869> normal<00:07:24.959> you<00:07:25.289> know

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 
kill you which is the normal you know

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:26.929 
kill you which is the normal you know
problem<00:07:25.769> is<00:07:25.889> a<00:07:26.009> lot<00:07:26.369> of<00:07:26.459> engineering<00:07:26.729> work

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:26.939 
problem is a lot of engineering work

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:28.729 
problem is a lot of engineering work
goes<00:07:27.119> into<00:07:27.149> making<00:07:27.419> this<00:07:27.629> fixtures<00:07:28.079> we<00:07:28.529> still

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:28.739 
goes into making this fixtures we still

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.079 
goes into making this fixtures we still
have<00:07:28.889> some<00:07:29.069> of<00:07:29.189> that<00:07:29.219> but<00:07:29.489> the<00:07:29.549> computer<00:07:29.909> can

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:30.089 
have some of that but the computer can

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:31.759 
have some of that but the computer can
take<00:07:30.269> care<00:07:30.449> of<00:07:30.509> a<00:07:30.629> lot<00:07:30.719> of<00:07:30.779> that<00:07:30.959> stuff<00:07:31.229> so<00:07:31.649> it's

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:31.769 
take care of a lot of that stuff so it's

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:34.069 
take care of a lot of that stuff so it's
kind<00:07:31.919> of<00:07:31.949> a<00:07:32.039> hybrid<00:07:32.249> approach<00:07:32.629> so<00:07:33.629> I<00:07:33.899> think

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:34.079 
kind of a hybrid approach so I think

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:36.619 
kind of a hybrid approach so I think
we're<00:07:34.319> at<00:07:34.379> a<00:07:34.439> time<00:07:34.649> but<00:07:35.360> you<00:07:36.360> have<00:07:36.449> the<00:07:36.479> end

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:36.629 
we're at a time but you have the end

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:38.600 
we're at a time but you have the end
slide<00:07:36.899> yeah<00:07:37.649> if<00:07:37.919> you<00:07:38.099> want<00:07:38.219> to<00:07:38.279> get<00:07:38.339> into<00:07:38.459> our

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.610
