00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.270 
and if not i pod take the hard drive out
there's<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:30.929> thing<00:01:31.319> i<00:01:31.469> like<00:01:31.710> about<00:01:31.740> these<00:01:32.219> is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
there's one thing i like about these is

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.889 
there's one thing i like about these is
that<00:01:32.719> the<00:01:33.719> hard<00:01:33.960> drive<00:01:34.139> itself<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.889> a

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
that the hard drive itself is a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.809 
that the hard drive itself is a
removable<00:01:36.899> if<00:01:36.990> i<00:01:37.079> zoom<00:01:37.109> in<00:01:37.499> here<00:01:37.700> now<00:01:38.700> our

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
removable if i zoom in here now our

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.529
