really<00:02:28.480> big<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.750> synthesizing<00:02:29.319> items<00:02:29.860> list<00:02:30.160> if

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
really big on synthesizing items list if

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.750 
really big on synthesizing items list if
they're<00:02:30.489> like<00:02:30.640> keyblades<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.420> all<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.690> but

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.390 
do the sort of you charred you put that
and<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.510> updates<00:02:43.959> what<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.799> so<00:02:45.070> that<00:02:45.250> way
