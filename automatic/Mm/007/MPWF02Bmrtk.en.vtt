00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
the part where I say that I can never
capture<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.450> moment<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.899> i<00:01:46.049> did<00:01:46.229> modern

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
capture that moment like i did modern

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
capture that moment like i did modern
warfare<00:01:46.799> 2<00:01:47.189> where<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:48.000> i<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.329> couldn't

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
warfare 2 where you know i just couldn't

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
warfare 2 where you know i just couldn't
wait<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.049> play<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.829> know<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.100> my

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
