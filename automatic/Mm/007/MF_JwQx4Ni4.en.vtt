00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.600

 to step on one of these fish its poison

 will cause a huge pain known as 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.959
 the worst pain in the world is so strong 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.849
 that the victims of this animal 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.400
 they prefer that they amputate the part 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.930
 affected to continue with the pain without 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.310
 doubt one of the animals more

 number 5 golden scorpion 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.689
 you have the popular belief that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.099
 all scorpions do not have a 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.260
 poison so powerful 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.959
 Unfortunately this issue is not 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.879
 at the moment of biting a living being it would be 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.430
 a pain equivalent to being hit 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.709
 with a very strong hammer its 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.430
 poison produces extreme paralysis fever 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.599
 seizures and even get to coma 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.950
 fortunately there are not many 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.950
 deaths by his sting 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.680
 number 4 blue rings octopus 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.439
 definitely my favorite is a 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.540
 small octopus the size of a ball 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.150
 of golf with some incredible rings 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.010
 blue his bite is painless but it is 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.650
 so powerful that it can kill a man 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.720
 adult in a matter of minutes as soon as 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.879
 this animal injects its poison produces 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.190
 tachycardias that stop breathing in 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.840
 very little time to this day 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.190
 it has been possible to develop an antidote 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.190
 for the poison of this animal 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.030
 number 3 marble cone snail 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.580
 a drop of the poison of this animal is 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.500
 able to kill 20 adult men is 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.050
 one of the most deadly poisons as 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.820
 it is practically unpredictable 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.880
 symptoms can be immediate or 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.919
 be delayed days currently there is no 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.280
 antidote or how to diagnose your 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.280
 poison 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.009
 number 2 charges king 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.259
 the largest poisonous snake in the 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.180
 world can measure more than 6 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.819
 meters long and is able to kill a 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.469
 elephant with its bite its poison not 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.689
 it is the most powerful but it can 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.069
 inject 5 times more poison than others 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.849
 snakes what makes impossible 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.849
 treat it 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.160
 number 1 I like 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.400
 and without a doubt the most poisonous animal 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.230
 of the world its poison is extremely strong 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.810
 since it attacks the nervous system in 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.430
 matter of seconds its sting is so 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.710
 painful that its victims normally 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.020
 drowned by pain before 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.830
 get to the shore undoubtedly an animal 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.830
