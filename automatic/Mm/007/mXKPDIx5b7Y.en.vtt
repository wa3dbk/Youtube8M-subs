are now on the engineering deck and

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.330 
are now on the engineering deck and
apparently<00:06:10.020> we<00:06:10.140> just<00:06:10.320> crushed<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.950> guy<00:06:11.100> with

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
this platform oh that's not happy news

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.040 
this platform oh that's not happy news
but<00:06:14.700> hey<00:06:14.790> there's<00:06:14.970> a<00:06:15.030> radiation<00:06:15.510> hypo<00:06:15.810> right

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
but hey there's a radiation hypo right

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.370 
but hey there's a radiation hypo right
here<00:06:16.440> wait<00:06:16.980> a<00:06:17.070> minute<00:06:17.220> radiation<00:06:18.030> hypos

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
here wait a minute radiation hypos

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.270 
here wait a minute radiation hypos
wasn't<00:06:19.380> there<00:06:19.470> all<00:06:19.590> that<00:06:19.620> business<00:06:19.950> before

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
wasn't there all that business before

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.160 
wasn't there all that business before
about<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:20.760> engineering<00:06:21.390> section<00:06:21.630> being<00:06:21.960> way

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
about the engineering section being way

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.540 
about the engineering section being way
too<00:06:22.200> hot<00:06:22.560> needing<00:06:22.950> a<00:06:23.010> whole<00:06:23.130> bunch<00:06:23.310> of<00:06:23.400> rat

too hot needing a whole bunch of rat
hypos<00:06:23.880> wonder<00:06:24.570> what<00:06:24.660> that's<00:06:24.810> about<00:06:24.900> I<00:06:27.350> just

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
hypos wonder what that's about I just

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.620 
hypos wonder what that's about I just
said<00:06:28.560> that<00:06:28.590> find<00:06:29.130> the<00:06:29.340> engine<00:06:29.670> core<00:06:29.910> and<00:06:30.060> reset

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
said that find the engine core and reset

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.630 
said that find the engine core and reset
it<00:06:30.780> this<00:06:31.380> will<00:06:31.560> restore<00:06:31.800> power<00:06:32.280> to<00:06:32.490> the

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
it this will restore power to the

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.910 
it this will restore power to the
elevators<00:06:33.240> I'm<00:06:34.080> getting<00:06:34.440> some<00:06:34.620> kind<00:06:34.770> of

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
elevators I'm getting some kind of

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.250 
elevators I'm getting some kind of
strange<00:06:35.280> readings<00:06:35.730> from<00:06:35.880> down<00:06:36.150> there<00:06:36.390> so<00:06:37.110> keep

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
strange readings from down there so keep

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.310 
strange readings from down there so keep
your<00:06:37.410> eyes<00:06:37.590> open<00:06:38.390> huh<00:06:39.390> strange<00:06:39.930> readings

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
your eyes open huh strange readings

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.950 
your eyes open huh strange readings
guess<00:06:41.190> it<00:06:41.310> must<00:06:41.460> be<00:06:41.520> the<00:06:41.670> radiation<00:06:42.180> we<00:06:42.840> also

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
guess it must be the radiation we also

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.430 
guess it must be the radiation we also
found<00:06:43.260> a<00:06:43.590> log<00:06:43.920> from<00:06:44.160> Curt<00:06:44.430> even<00:06:44.850> oh<00:06:45.140> I<00:06:46.140> guess

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
found a log from Curt even oh I guess

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.340 
found a log from Curt even oh I guess
that<00:06:46.740> was<00:06:46.950> kurties<00:06:47.720> man<00:06:48.720> I<00:06:48.750> feel<00:06:49.080> terrible

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
that was kurties man I feel terrible

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.380 
that was kurties man I feel terrible
about<00:06:49.710> that<00:06:49.860> but<00:06:50.610> what<00:06:50.700> wasn't<00:06:50.910> it<00:06:51.090> was<00:06:51.180> dying

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.390 
about that but what wasn't it was dying

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.580 
about that but what wasn't it was dying
words<00:06:52.040> just<00:06:53.040> down<00:06:53.310> to<00:06:53.430> just<00:06:53.580> a<00:06:53.760> few<00:06:53.790> of<00:06:54.030> us<00:06:54.240> now

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
words just down to just a few of us now

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.800 
words just down to just a few of us now
right<00:06:55.590> after<00:06:55.710> Valdez<00:06:56.280> died<00:06:56.610> I<00:06:56.640> I<00:06:57.060> guess<00:06:57.540> I<00:06:57.690> went

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
right after Valdez died I I guess I went

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.600 
right after Valdez died I I guess I went
a<00:06:57.900> little<00:06:58.050> nuts<00:06:58.470> and<00:06:58.740> started<00:06:59.130> tearing<00:06:59.340> things

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
a little nuts and started tearing things

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.090 
a little nuts and started tearing things
apart<00:06:59.790> but<00:07:00.750> what<00:07:00.930> do<00:07:00.990> you<00:07:01.080> know<00:07:01.230> I<00:07:01.260> found<00:07:01.860> two

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
apart but what do you know I found two

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.070 
apart but what do you know I found two
more<00:07:02.250> rad<00:07:02.520> hypes<00:07:02.820> hopefully<00:07:03.570> that'll<00:07:03.810> keep<00:07:03.900> me

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
more rad hypes hopefully that'll keep me

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.260 
more rad hypes hopefully that'll keep me
going<00:07:04.440> on<00:07:04.650> enough<00:07:04.890> to<00:07:05.070> figure<00:07:05.310> way<00:07:05.670> past<00:07:06.060> that

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
going on enough to figure way past that

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.270 
going on enough to figure way past that
damn<00:07:06.780> turret

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
damn turret

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.060 
damn turret
who<00:07:09.030> is<00:07:09.150> that<00:07:09.800> delacroix<00:07:11.180> sanger<00:07:12.180> huh<00:07:13.170> so<00:07:14.040> I

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
who is that delacroix sanger huh so I

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.070 
who is that delacroix sanger huh so I
guess<00:07:14.220> maybe<00:07:14.520> turkeys<00:07:15.000> died<00:07:15.240> some<00:07:15.540> other<00:07:15.780> way

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
guess maybe turkeys died some other way

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.620 
guess maybe turkeys died some other way
but<00:07:17.070> like<00:07:17.820> you<00:07:17.850> saw<00:07:18.090> there's<00:07:18.330> a<00:07:18.389> whole<00:07:18.540> bunch

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
but like you saw there's a whole bunch

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.180 
but like you saw there's a whole bunch
of<00:07:18.780> radiation<00:07:19.290> out<00:07:19.410> there<00:07:19.620> so<00:07:19.860> let's<00:07:20.040> get

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
of radiation out there so let's get

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.080 
of radiation out there so let's get
ready<00:07:20.340> to<00:07:20.580> tackle<00:07:20.880> the<00:07:21.270> engineering<00:07:21.870> deck
