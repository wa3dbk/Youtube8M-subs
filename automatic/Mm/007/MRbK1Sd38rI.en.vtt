00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
so you know if you need to disconnect go

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.889 
so you know if you need to disconnect go
you<00:00:05.790> know<00:00:05.910> come<00:00:06.240> back<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.509> get<00:00:06.569> your<00:00:06.720> set

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
you know come back and get your set

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.370 
you know come back and get your set
never<00:00:07.890> you're<00:00:08.040> done<00:00:08.929> like<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.960> said<00:00:10.230> whenever

never you're done like I said whenever
you're<00:00:10.530> done<00:00:11.990> grab<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.679> wrap<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:17.779> back<00:00:18.779> up

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:49.330 

now<00:00:33.469> that's<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.680> setup<00:00:42.140> okay

this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> yak<00:00:52.890> gear<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.489> katralla<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.829> could

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
this is a yak gear and katralla I could

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.220 
this is a yak gear and katralla I could
have<00:00:56.690> went<00:00:57.690> through<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.079> bit<00:00:58.199> extra

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
have went through a little bit extra

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.439 
have went through a little bit extra
pain<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.690> got<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.840> end<00:01:00.989> mounts<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.859> pulleys

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
pain and got the end mounts the pulleys

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
pain and got the end mounts the pulleys
up<00:01:03.449> farther<00:01:03.809> toward<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> ends<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:04.860> this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
up farther toward the ends but this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.090 
up farther toward the ends but this
seems<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> work<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.119> pretty<00:01:06.240> good<00:01:06.890> I've<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
seems to work out pretty good I've got a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
seems to work out pretty good I've got a
pretty<00:01:08.250> good<00:01:08.340> spread<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:09.420> front<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.689> back<00:01:09.780> on

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pretty good spread from front to back on

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.080 
pretty good spread from front to back on
the<00:01:10.110> poise<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.729> able<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
the poise and I was able to just get a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.140 
the poise and I was able to just get a
longer<00:01:15.090> screw<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:16.159> put<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> right<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
longer screw and put it right into the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.520 
longer screw and put it right into the
existing<00:01:18.600> hardware<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.170> arguing<00:01:19.470> on

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
existing hardware that was arguing on

existing hardware that was arguing on
the<00:01:19.619> kayak<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:21.200> did<00:01:22.200> put<00:01:22.380> these<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:23.689> there

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the kayak I did put these on there

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.560 
the kayak I did put these on there
gooped<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.500> pop<00:01:25.950> rivet<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.360> what's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
gooped and pop rivet it in that what's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.050 
gooped and pop rivet it in that what's
that<00:01:27.659> bottom<00:01:28.080> line<00:01:28.400> then<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> loop<00:01:29.820> on

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that bottom line then want the loop on

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.130 
that bottom line then want the loop on
it<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.450> metal<00:01:30.689> ring

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it the metal ring

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
it the metal ring
stay<00:01:32.070> down<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> bit<00:01:32.490> lower<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.119> trying

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
stay down a bit lower so it's not trying

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.210 
stay down a bit lower so it's not trying
to<00:01:33.479> ride<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> side<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.290> kayak

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.770 

here's<00:01:38.220> pretty<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> center<00:01:38.939> portion<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
here's pretty much the center portion of

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.039 
here's pretty much the center portion of
it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.160 
it
these<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.829> plastic<00:01:40.920> hooks<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.430> put<00:01:41.610> on

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
these are little plastic hooks I put on

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
these are little plastic hooks I put on
and<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.829> far<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.159> don't<00:01:44.460> seem<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.850> any

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and so far they don't seem to be any

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.230 
and so far they don't seem to be any
problem<00:01:46.280> they're<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.670> smooth<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
problem they're really smooth and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
problem they're really smooth and
rounded<00:01:48.509> over<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> end<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.680> they<00:01:49.799> don't

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
rounded over on the end so they don't

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.200 
rounded over on the end so they don't
whenever<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.579> throw<00:01:50.670> your<00:01:50.820> legs<00:01:50.970> over<00:01:51.119> side

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
whenever you throw your legs over side

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.929 
whenever you throw your legs over side
for<00:01:51.659> balance<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:52.200> whatever<00:01:52.460> they<00:01:53.460> seem<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
for balance or whatever they seem to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.709 
for balance or whatever they seem to
cause<00:01:54.090> any<00:01:54.270> problems<00:01:56.000> I'm<00:01:57.000> big<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.509> heat

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
cause any problems I'm big on heat

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.880 
cause any problems I'm big on heat
shrink<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:59.509> not<00:02:00.509> having<00:02:00.689> knot<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.649> see

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
shrink and not having knot you can see

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
shrink and not having knot you can see
there<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:02.909> several<00:02:03.149> knots<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:03.960> they're

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
there are several knots here but they're

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.039 
there are several knots here but they're
clean<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.299> this

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
clean and that's just for if this

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.889 
clean and that's just for if this
loosens<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.590> over<00:02:07.860> time

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
loosens up over time

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.389 
loosens up over time
and<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.349> probably<00:02:09.500> will<00:02:09.770> probably<00:02:10.190> stretch

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
and it probably will probably stretch

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.309 
and it probably will probably stretch
out<00:02:10.610> then<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.060> can<00:02:11.239> untie<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.690> talk<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.170> back

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
out then I can untie it and talk it back

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.370 
out then I can untie it and talk it back
down<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.650> retie<00:02:12.920> with<00:02:13.489> this<00:02:13.640> end<00:02:13.849> here<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.810> use

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
down and retie with this end here I use

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.690 
down and retie with this end here I use
a<00:02:16.060> heavy<00:02:17.170> industrial<00:02:18.580> thread<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:21.580> stitch<00:02:22.580> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
a heavy industrial thread and stitch it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.559 
a heavy industrial thread and stitch it
up<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.270> then<00:02:24.020> heat<00:02:24.739> shrink<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.550> that's<00:02:26.390> as

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
up and then heat shrink it and that's as

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.930 
up and then heat shrink it and that's as
strong<00:02:26.900> as<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.099> imagine<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.640> mean<00:02:28.790> it's

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
strong as you can imagine I mean it's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.360 
strong as you can imagine I mean it's
really<00:02:29.510> strong

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
really strong

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.250 
really strong
and<00:02:31.370> on<00:02:31.550> back<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.209> back<00:02:32.239> was<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
and on back here to the back was the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.500 
and on back here to the back was the
same<00:02:33.470> as<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.680> front<00:02:35.470> same<00:02:36.470> point<00:02:37.150> same<00:02:38.150> eye

same as the front same point same eye

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.740 
same as the front same point same eye
there<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:41.739> one<00:02:42.739> thing<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.360> really<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:44.600> like

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
there and one thing I really really like

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:59.020 
there and one thing I really really like
about<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.140> connector<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.870> rod<00:02:48.260> pot<00:02:58.030> I've

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
about this connector is the rod pot I've

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.059 
about this connector is the rod pot I've
got<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.500> I<00:03:00.760> got<00:03:01.760> here<00:03:01.940> one<00:03:02.180> two<00:03:02.450> three<00:03:03.200> four<00:03:03.560> five

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
to be getting upgraded fairly soon

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.250 
to be getting upgraded fairly soon
that's<00:05:28.210> just<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.600> one<00:05:28.750> that<00:05:28.900> came<00:05:29.050> with<00:05:29.080> it

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
that's just the one that came with it

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.240 
that's just the one that came with it
and<00:05:30.039> it's<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.340> seat<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:31.360> does<00:05:31.479> job<00:05:31.950> what<00:05:32.950> I<00:05:32.979> did

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
and it's a seat it does job what I did

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.630 
and it's a seat it does job what I did
do<00:05:33.600> in<00:05:34.600> the<00:05:34.900> molding<00:05:35.320> of<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:36.070> kayak<00:05:36.430> there's

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
do in the molding of the kayak there's

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.240 
do in the molding of the kayak there's
two<00:05:36.970> I'm<00:05:37.750> calling<00:05:38.200> them<00:05:38.260> built<00:05:38.620> in<00:05:38.770> well<00:05:38.979> nuts

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
two I'm calling them built in well nuts

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.880 
two I'm calling them built in well nuts
I<00:05:39.430> guess<00:05:39.640> they're<00:05:40.060> molded<00:05:42.090> nuts<00:05:43.090> into<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:43.890> end

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
I guess they're molded nuts into the end

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.760 
I guess they're molded nuts into the end
of<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.130> hole<00:05:45.600> they<00:05:46.600> were<00:05:46.660> already<00:05:46.840> there<00:05:47.110> so<00:05:47.350> I

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
of the hole they were already there so I

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.350 
of the hole they were already there so I
just<00:05:47.860> drilled<00:05:48.580> a<00:05:48.639> couple<00:05:48.669> holes<00:05:49.030> into<00:05:49.240> the

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
just drilled a couple holes into the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.650 
just drilled a couple holes into the
seat<00:05:50.039> to<00:05:51.039> go<00:05:51.160> hide<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.520> both<00:05:51.729> ends<00:05:51.940> to<00:05:52.210> kind<00:05:52.570> of

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
seat to go hide the both ends to kind of

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.960 
seat to go hide the both ends to kind of
sear<00:05:52.870> it<00:05:53.020> so<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.470> unravel<00:05:53.740> and<00:05:54.070> then<00:05:54.700> I<00:05:54.760> ran<00:05:54.940> a

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
sear it so and unravel and then I ran a

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.430 
sear it so and unravel and then I ran a
couple<00:05:55.030> stainless<00:05:55.570> steel<00:05:55.750> bolts<00:05:56.139> with

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
couple stainless steel bolts with

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.650 
couple stainless steel bolts with
washers<00:05:56.860> into<00:05:57.070> it<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.430> that<00:05:58.030> keeps<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.389> seat

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
washers into it and that keeps the seat

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.950 
washers into it and that keeps the seat
from<00:05:59.050> riding<00:05:59.770> forward<00:06:00.250> which<00:06:00.880> is<00:06:00.910> a<00:06:01.090> seem<00:06:01.840> to

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
from riding forward which is a seem to

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.270 
from riding forward which is a seem to
be<00:06:02.050> like<00:06:02.229> it's<00:06:02.380> gonna<00:06:02.470> be<00:06:02.620> a<00:06:02.650> big<00:06:02.830> problem

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
be like it's gonna be a big problem

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.040 
be like it's gonna be a big problem
so<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:04.330> keeps<00:06:04.690> it<00:06:04.840> placed<00:06:05.139> really<00:06:05.440> well<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:06.030> I

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
so it keeps it placed really well and I

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.690 
so it keeps it placed really well and I
don't<00:06:08.050> have<00:06:08.320> to<00:06:08.470> take<00:06:08.650> it<00:06:08.680> off<00:06:08.919> when<00:06:09.430> I'm<00:06:09.520> tray

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
don't have to take it off when I'm tray

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.779 
don't have to take it off when I'm tray
learned<00:06:09.990> it<00:06:10.990> just<00:06:11.200> stays<00:06:11.710> real<00:06:11.919> nice<00:06:12.100> even

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
learned it just stays real nice even

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.270 
learned it just stays real nice even

going down the interstate this piece of
the<00:06:15.370> bottom<00:06:15.520> part<00:06:15.760> might<00:06:16.000> flap<00:06:16.240> up<00:06:16.419> and<00:06:16.539> sit

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
the bottom part might flap up and sit

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.379 
the bottom part might flap up and sit
right<00:06:16.810> here<00:06:16.960> but<00:06:17.590> that's<00:06:17.770> all<00:06:17.889> it<00:06:17.979> does<00:06:18.389> and

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
right here but that's all it does and

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.300

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
pieces of foam that seem to be working

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.089 
pieces of foam that seem to be working
pretty<00:06:25.240> good<00:06:25.419> for<00:06:25.539> now<00:06:25.800> I'm<00:06:26.800> going<00:06:26.950> to<00:06:27.010> upgrade
