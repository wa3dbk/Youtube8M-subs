on this is you're gonna take your wire
cutters<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.400> these<00:00:08.610> are<00:00:08.760> your<00:00:08.849> wire<00:00:09.090> cutters

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
cutters and these are your wire cutters

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.150 
cutters and these are your wire cutters
you're<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.080> go<00:00:10.230> ahead<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.740> you're

you're going to go ahead and you're

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.520 
you're going to go ahead and you're
gonna<00:00:11.280> cut<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> wire<00:00:11.940> usually<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.750> go<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> about

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
gonna cut the wire usually I go to about

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.300 
gonna cut the wire usually I go to about
an<00:00:13.920> inch<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.429> where<00:00:15.330> I'm<00:00:15.540> using<00:00:15.830> 26<00:00:16.830> gauge

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
an inch and where I'm using 26 gauge

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.510 
an inch and where I'm using 26 gauge
wire<00:00:17.510> it's<00:00:18.510> sterling<00:00:19.050> silver<00:00:19.439> wire<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.100> I'm

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
wire it's sterling silver wire and I'm

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.460 
wire it's sterling silver wire and I'm
using<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.000> wire<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.260> one

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
using this wire because it is the one

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
using this wire because it is the one
size<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.250> get<00:00:23.430> through<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> lot<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
size I can get through a lot of the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.689 
size I can get through a lot of the
different<00:00:24.720> gemstones<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.609> I

different gemstones so what I do is I

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.900 
different gemstones so what I do is I
cut<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> few<00:00:27.320> strands<00:00:28.320> at<00:00:28.710> an<00:00:28.830> inch<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
cut a few strands at an inch because I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.189

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.040 
want to have them handy when I'm ready
to<00:00:31.349> wire<00:00:31.560> wrap<00:00:31.640> now<00:00:32.640> after<00:00:33.030> I've<00:00:33.180> cut<00:00:33.480> this

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to wire wrap now after I've cut this

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.270 
to wire wrap now after I've cut this
wire<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.800> go<00:00:35.340> ahead<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.329> take<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.200> gem<00:00:37.500> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
wire I go ahead and I take the gem that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.830 
wire I go ahead and I take the gem that
I<00:00:38.340> am<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> use<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> I'll<00:00:39.480> stick<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I am about to use and I'll stick the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.560 
I am about to use and I'll stick the
wire<00:00:39.989> through<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.850> then<00:00:41.850> I'll<00:00:42.000> take<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
wire through it and then I'll take it to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.750 
wire through it and then I'll take it to
the<00:00:42.690> piece<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.260> am<00:00:43.410> connecting<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.129> I'll

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the piece I am connecting it with I'll

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.799 
the piece I am connecting it with I'll
again<00:00:45.600> go<00:00:45.989> through<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:47.300> section<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> gem

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
again go through the section of the gem

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.810 
again go through the section of the gem
chain<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:50.539> charm<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:51.930> using<00:00:52.260> Oh<00:00:52.820> bend

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
chain or charm that I'm using Oh bend

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.740 
chain or charm that I'm using Oh bend
the<00:00:54.210> wire<00:00:54.420> over<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.590> charm<00:00:56.239> now<00:00:57.239> I'll<00:00:57.510> take

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the wire over that charm now I'll take

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.099 
the wire over that charm now I'll take
some<00:00:58.020> round<00:00:58.320> nose<00:00:58.590> pliers<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.520> I'll<00:01:00.390> grab<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
some round nose pliers and I'll grab the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.189 
some round nose pliers and I'll grab the
end<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> wire<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.370> I'll<00:01:03.300> wrap<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.049> around

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
end of the wire and I'll wrap it around

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.250 
end of the wire and I'll wrap it around
usually<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.820> fingers<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.810> start

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
usually I use my fingers just to start

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
usually I use my fingers just to start
it<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> take<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> round<00:01:08.850> nose<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
it then I take the round nose and I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.260 
it then I take the round nose and I
stick<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> nose<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> plier<00:01:10.880> inside<00:01:11.880> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
stick the nose of the plier inside of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.120 
stick the nose of the plier inside of
that<00:01:12.659> loop<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.920> I'll<00:01:14.070> take<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:15.890> straight<00:01:16.890> nose

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
that loop then I'll take a straight nose

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.330 
that loop then I'll take a straight nose
plier<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.970> I'll<00:01:18.810> wrap<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.950> I'm<00:01:20.100> actually

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
plier and I'll wrap it so I'm actually

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.600 
plier and I'll wrap it so I'm actually
using<00:01:20.700> two<00:01:21.299> pliers<00:01:21.770> one<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.189> through<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
using two pliers one to go through the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.420 
using two pliers one to go through the
hole<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.200> formed<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> another

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
hole that I have now formed and another

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.749 
hole that I have now formed and another
one<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.540> wrap<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.170> wire<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.159> I'll<00:01:29.340> take<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
one to wrap the wire so I'll take the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.620 
one to wrap the wire so I'll take the
wrapping<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.479> I'll<00:01:30.990> move<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.380> around<00:01:32.360> as<00:01:33.360> many

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
wrapping and I'll move it around as many

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.580 
wrapping and I'll move it around as many
times<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.320> can

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
times as I can

utilizing my finger and the tool so that
I<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> nice<00:01:38.570> strong<00:01:40.670> secure<00:01:42.470> wrap<00:01:44.600> now<00:01:45.600> what

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
I get a nice strong secure wrap now what

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.969 
I get a nice strong secure wrap now what
I'll<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> I'll<00:01:46.470> connect<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> next<00:01:47.549> side<00:01:48.979> to
