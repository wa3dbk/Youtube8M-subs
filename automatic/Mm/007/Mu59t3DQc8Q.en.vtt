00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
will send up new growth every spring and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.730 
will send up new growth every spring and
that<00:00:22.039> cane<00:00:22.580> will<00:00:23.029> grow<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.300> its<00:00:23.539> full<00:00:23.929> size<00:00:23.960> in

get taller than that so the size of your

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.870 
get taller than that so the size of your
bamboo<00:00:31.849> is<00:00:32.360> under<00:00:32.870> strict<00:00:33.380> genetic<00:00:34.250> control

edge it will get it off the sidewalk you

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.120 
edge it will get it off the sidewalk you
can<00:01:22.220> take<00:01:22.430> up<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.640> 50%<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.630> your<00:01:23.690> bamboo<00:01:24.050> out<00:01:24.470> so

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
can take up to 50% of your bamboo out so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.740 
can take up to 50% of your bamboo out so
that<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.430> can<00:01:25.610> see<00:01:25.910> what's<00:01:26.150> left<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.660> it

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
that you can see what's left and it

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.470 
that you can see what's left and it
looks<00:01:26.990> delicate<00:01:27.940> people<00:01:28.940> also<00:01:29.150> have<00:01:29.450> a

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
looks delicate people also have a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.600 
looks delicate people also have a
problem<00:01:29.990> with<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.290> leading<00:01:30.560> edge<00:01:30.890> flopping

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
problem with the leading edge flopping

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.410 
problem with the leading edge flopping
over<00:01:31.760> in<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.480> rain<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:33.770> nature<00:01:34.340> your<00:01:35.000> bamboo

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
over in the rain in nature your bamboo

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.810 
over in the rain in nature your bamboo
stand<00:01:35.810> will<00:01:36.260> fold<00:01:36.650> down<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.250> ground<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:37.730> if

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
stand will fold down to the ground so if

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.370 
stand will fold down to the ground so if
you<00:01:37.940> have<00:01:38.090> room<00:01:38.420> for<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.780> go<00:01:38.990> ahead<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.290> let

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
you have room for that go ahead and let

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.530 
you have room for that go ahead and let
it<00:01:39.410> do<00:01:39.650> that<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.550> if<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:40.760> right<00:01:41.000> next<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.450> the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
it do that but if it's right next to the

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.290 
it do that but if it's right next to the
walkway<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:42.950> cut<00:01:43.190> those<00:01:43.370> canes<00:01:43.760> to<00:01:44.120> the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
walkway you can cut those canes to the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.220 
walkway you can cut those canes to the
ground<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.730> you<00:01:46.730> can<00:01:46.910> even<00:01:47.180> use<00:01:47.450> fishing<00:01:47.990> line

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
ground and you can even use fishing line

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.350 
ground and you can even use fishing line
to<00:01:48.560> tie<00:01:49.160> it<00:01:49.220> back<00:01:49.840> because<00:01:50.840> unlike<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:52.160> tree<00:01:53.090> it

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
to tie it back because unlike a tree it

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.660 
to tie it back because unlike a tree it
will<00:01:53.660> not<00:01:53.840> get<00:01:54.110> girdled<00:01:54.620> the<00:01:54.890> girth<00:01:55.160> never

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
will not get girdled the girth never

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.210 
will not get girdled the girth never
increases<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.380> can<00:01:57.590> actually<00:01:57.800> tie<00:01:58.160> it

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
increases so you can actually tie it

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.840 
increases so you can actually tie it
back<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.880> wall<00:01:59.680> something<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:01.010> like<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.400> do<00:02:01.580> is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
back to a wall something I like to do is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.990 
back to a wall something I like to do is
make<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.600> little<00:02:02.720> handrail<00:02:03.650> out<00:02:04.610> of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
make like a little handrail out of

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.390 
make like a little handrail out of
bamboo<00:02:05.360> stakes<00:02:06.050> so<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.770> when<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.040> rain<00:02:07.250> of

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
bamboo stakes so that when the rain of

the snow hits it it doesn't it can't

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.510 
the snow hits it it doesn't it can't
flop<00:02:10.250> clear<00:02:10.729> over<00:02:11.530> if<00:02:12.530> you're<00:02:12.830> going<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.220> thin
