I barely tasted the shredded chicken
it's<00:03:59.220> there<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.940> very<00:04:00.680> it's<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.770> the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
it's there is this very it's not the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.070 
it's there is this very it's not the
star<00:04:02.480> that's<00:04:03.480> what<00:04:03.600> I'm<00:04:03.660> trying<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.900> get<00:04:04.020> at

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
star that's what I'm trying to get at

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.770 
star that's what I'm trying to get at
yeah<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.640> think<00:04:08.640> as<00:04:08.940> far<00:04:09.000> as<00:04:09.120> improvements<00:04:09.720> they

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
yeah I think as far as improvements they

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.760 
yeah I think as far as improvements they
should<00:04:09.960> put<00:04:10.050> a<00:04:10.110> bit<00:04:10.260> more<00:04:10.290> shredded<00:04:10.650> chicken

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
should put a bit more shredded chicken

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.070 
should put a bit more shredded chicken
in<00:04:11.010> there<00:04:11.390> probably<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.570> little<00:04:12.720> bit<00:04:12.930> less

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
in there probably a little bit less

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.690 
in there probably a little bit less
beans<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.650> put<00:04:13.830> more<00:04:13.920> shared<00:04:14.160> chicken<00:04:14.520> I

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
beans and put more shared chicken I

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.520 
beans and put more shared chicken I
think<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.300> ratio<00:04:15.510> will<00:04:15.780> be<00:04:15.900> much<00:04:16.290> better

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
think that ratio will be much better

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.539 
think that ratio will be much better
overall<00:04:17.459> great<00:04:18.150> tasting<00:04:18.600> burrito
