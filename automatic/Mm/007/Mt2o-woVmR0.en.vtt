00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.630 
to nada homo tech is probably a bit
better<00:03:18.350> than<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.620> khaki<00:03:18.920> last<00:03:19.130> few<00:03:19.310> games<00:03:19.430> and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
better than the khaki last few games and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.610 
better than the khaki last few games and
this<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.720> fact<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:20.990> he<00:03:21.110> seems<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.410> bit<00:03:21.530> of

this is the fact that he seems a bit of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.470 
this is the fact that he seems a bit of
stronger<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.190> he<00:03:22.790> seems<00:03:23.000> better<00:03:23.180> at

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
stronger and he seems better at

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.570 
stronger and he seems better at

playing<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.480> it<00:03:57.200> just<00:03:57.350> seems<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.530> be<00:03:57.590> quite

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
playing and it just seems to be quite

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.979 
playing and it just seems to be quite
saying<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.489> what<00:03:58.820> child<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.300> imagine<00:03:59.750> as<00:03:59.840> well

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
saying to what child I imagine as well

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.690 
saying to what child I imagine as well
because<00:04:00.230> it's<00:04:00.590> all<00:04:00.709> my<00:04:00.830> action<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:01.400> world<00:04:01.580> it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
because it's all my action this world it

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.220 
because it's all my action this world it
seems<00:04:01.820> because<00:04:02.060> I'm<00:04:02.270> on<00:04:02.390> single<00:04:02.750> matches<00:04:03.080> and

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
seems because I'm on single matches and

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.440 
seems because I'm on single matches and
I've<00:04:04.010> actually<00:04:04.160> quite<00:04:04.580> decent<00:04:04.940> team<00:04:05.060> now<00:04:05.239> so

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
I've actually quite decent team now so

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.390 
I've actually quite decent team now so
are<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.080> opponent's<00:04:06.500> where<00:04:06.980> I've<00:04:07.070> kept

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
are the the opponent's where I've kept

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.420 
are the the opponent's where I've kept
good<00:04:07.910> teams<00:04:08.120> also<00:04:08.450> but<00:04:09.170> benteke<00:04:09.590> Owens<00:04:10.280> back

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
good teams also but benteke Owens back

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.250 
good teams also but benteke Owens back
on<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.670> gameplay<00:04:11.000> he's<00:04:11.360> cause<00:04:11.600> I<00:04:11.690> corner<00:04:12.050> and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
on the gameplay he's cause I corner and

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.620 
on the gameplay he's cause I corner and
then<00:04:12.470> this<00:04:12.920> match<00:04:13.220> was<00:04:13.880> filled<00:04:14.239> with<00:04:14.330> gold

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
then this match was filled with gold

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.090 
then this match was filled with gold
hence<00:04:14.870> why<00:04:15.020> I<00:04:15.050> has<00:04:15.140> no<00:04:15.260> highlights<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.830> is<00:04:15.950> just

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
hence why I has no highlights it is just

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.250 
hence why I has no highlights it is just
pure<00:04:16.340> goals<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:16.940> dad<00:04:17.090> Ron<00:04:17.630> don't<00:04:17.870> get<00:04:18.020> to<00:04:18.109> go
