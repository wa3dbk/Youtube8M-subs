performance art group on campus and it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.740 
performance art group on campus and it's
using<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.110> idea<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:10.000> electromyogram<00:02:11.000> which

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
using the idea of electromyogram which

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.080 
using the idea of electromyogram which
measures<00:02:12.290> your<00:02:12.620> nerve<00:02:13.010> impulses<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:14.060> the

measures your nerve impulses to the
motor<00:02:14.390> endplate<00:02:14.690> swiss<00:02:15.170> contract<00:02:15.650> your

motor endplate swiss contract your
skeletal<00:02:16.220> muscles<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.230> my<00:02:18.620> adviser<00:02:19.190> in

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
skeletal muscles and so my adviser in

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.800 
skeletal muscles and so my adviser in
the<00:02:19.430> bio<00:02:19.610> department<00:02:20.150> runs<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.540> animal

the bio department runs the animal
physiology<00:02:20.960> lab<00:02:21.530> where<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.800> can<00:02:22.010> record<00:02:22.280> EMG

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
physiology lab where you can record EMG

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.700 
physiology lab where you can record EMG
but<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.750> can<00:02:23.900> actually<00:02:24.140> convert<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.560> into

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
but you can actually convert it into

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.670 
but you can actually convert it into
sound<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.520> then<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.210> sound<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.990> shape<00:02:27.530> this

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
sound and then that sound to shape this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.320 
sound and then that sound to shape this
dance<00:02:27.920> piece<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.340> I'm<00:02:28.430> making<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.970> think

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
dance piece that I'm making I think

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.060 
dance piece that I'm making I think
what's<00:02:29.480> distinctive<00:02:29.810> about<00:02:30.050> Barnard<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.710> just

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
what's distinctive about Barnard is just

the really unique combination of
intellectual<00:02:35.360> work<00:02:35.390> critical<00:02:36.140> work<00:02:36.320> and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
intellectual work critical work and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.680 
intellectual work critical work and
theoretical<00:02:37.190> work<00:02:37.400> everything<00:02:38.180> about<00:02:38.390> your

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
theoretical work everything about your

personality and everything that you've
learned<00:02:40.340> really<00:02:40.850> influences<00:02:41.540> how<00:02:41.720> you

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
learned really influences how you

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.220 
learned really influences how you
interact<00:02:42.830> with<00:02:43.040> whatever<00:02:43.730> you're<00:02:43.910> performing

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.770 

and<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:48.530> if<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.740> come<00:02:48.980> with<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:50.450> know<00:02:50.540> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
and so if you come with you know a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.000 
and so if you come with you know a
climate<00:02:51.230> class<00:02:51.410> or<00:02:51.620> something<00:02:51.860> like<00:02:51.950> that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
climate class or something like that

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.620 
climate class or something like that
even<00:02:52.370> though<00:02:52.460> it<00:02:52.550> doesn't<00:02:52.700> directly<00:02:52.910> relate<00:02:53.210> I

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
even though it doesn't directly relate I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.630 
even though it doesn't directly relate I
feel<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:53.990> you<00:02:54.590> getting<00:02:54.920> rounders<00:02:55.610> and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
feel like you getting rounders and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.090 
feel like you getting rounders and
individual<00:02:56.380> knowing<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.500> worlds<00:02:57.860> more

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
individual knowing the worlds more

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.070 
individual knowing the worlds more
knowing<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.090> problems<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.660> world<00:02:59.810> you're

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
knowing the problems of the world you're

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.840 
knowing the problems of the world you're
able<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.470> approach<00:03:00.830> music<00:03:01.070> with<00:03:01.489> just<00:03:01.790> a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
able to approach music with just a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
able to approach music with just a
deeper<00:03:02.120> understanding<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.840> are

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
deeper understanding that you are

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.229 
deeper understanding that you are
otherwise<00:03:03.350> I've<00:03:03.800> had<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.190> think<00:03:04.370> through<00:03:04.820> how

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
otherwise I've had to think through how

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.300 
otherwise I've had to think through how
I'm<00:03:05.630> approaching<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.320> actual<00:03:06.650> acting<00:03:07.070> and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
I'm approaching the actual acting and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.630 
I'm approaching the actual acting and
the<00:03:07.370> directing<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.450> there's<00:03:08.660> specific

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
the directing so there's specific

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.280 
the directing so there's specific
theorists<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.730> I'm<00:03:10.850> looking<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:12.110> I've

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
theorists that I'm looking to that I've

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.740 
theorists that I'm looking to that I've
researched<00:03:12.709> in<00:03:13.160> order<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.790> influence<00:03:14.209> how<00:03:14.630> I'm

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
researched in order to influence how I'm

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.210 
researched in order to influence how I'm
gonna<00:03:14.870> present<00:03:15.200> my<00:03:15.500> acting<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:15.950> how<00:03:16.160> I'm

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
gonna present my acting and how I'm

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.100 
gonna present my acting and how I'm
going<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.430> present<00:03:16.550> my<00:03:16.910> directing<00:03:17.420> one<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.050> the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
going to present my directing one of the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.470 
going to present my directing one of the
things<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.440> think<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.709> people<00:03:19.190> would<00:03:20.180> expect

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
things I think that people would expect

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.720 
things I think that people would expect
if<00:03:20.690> they<00:03:20.840> come<00:03:20.989> upon<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.800> that<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.340> kind<00:03:22.640> of

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
if they come upon it is that the kind of

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.400 
if they come upon it is that the kind of
work<00:03:22.910> they<00:03:23.090> will<00:03:23.209> be<00:03:23.330> doing<00:03:23.480> here<00:03:23.900> both<00:03:24.140> in

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
work they will be doing here both in

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.470 
work they will be doing here both in
academic<00:03:24.800> classes<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.489> artistic<00:03:26.060> classes
