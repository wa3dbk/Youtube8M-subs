what's up in this tutorial we're going
to<00:00:08.570> learn<00:00:08.749> how<00:00:08.809> to<00:00:08.990> do<00:00:09.200> multiple<00:00:09.679> half<00:00:09.919> around

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
to learn how to do multiple half around

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:25.380 
to learn how to do multiple half around
the<00:00:10.400> walls<00:00:10.549> check<00:00:11.179> it<00:00:11.299> out

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.279 

firstly<00:00:26.390> we're<00:00:26.599> gonna<00:00:26.689> have<00:00:26.839> to<00:00:26.960> learn<00:00:27.079> how<00:00:27.259> to

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
firstly we're gonna have to learn how to

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.960 
firstly we're gonna have to learn how to
do<00:00:27.470> half<00:00:27.650> round<00:00:28.009> the<00:00:28.070> water<00:00:28.249> consistently

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
do half round the water consistently

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.609 
do half round the water consistently
with<00:00:29.269> both<00:00:29.480> feet<00:00:29.750> there's<00:00:30.079> no<00:00:30.199> point<00:00:30.470> being

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
with both feet there's no point being

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.350 
with both feet there's no point being
able<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:30.949> do<00:00:31.070> it<00:00:31.160> our<00:00:31.399> ten<00:00:31.699> times<00:00:31.910> on<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.119> right

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
able to do it our ten times on a right

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.970 
able to do it our ten times on a right
foot<00:00:32.570> by<00:00:32.809> only<00:00:32.930> four<00:00:33.260> out<00:00:33.379> of<00:00:33.410> ten<00:00:33.620> times<00:00:33.829> on

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.770 
foot by only four out of ten times on
the<00:00:34.040> left<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:34.640> make<00:00:34.820> sure<00:00:34.850> you<00:00:35.059> get<00:00:35.180> consistent

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
the left so make sure you get consistent

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.020 
the left so make sure you get consistent
both<00:00:36.079> start<00:00:36.620> off<00:00:36.769> by<00:00:36.949> trying<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.399> in<00:00:37.489> a<00:00:37.579> row<00:00:37.760> and

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
both start off by trying to in a row and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.579 
both start off by trying to in a row and
alternate<00:00:38.600> your<00:00:38.719> style<00:00:39.019> in<00:00:39.110> third<00:00:39.290> with<00:00:39.440> each

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
try it from the left to right we're

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.319 
try it from the left to right we're
going<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.070> keep<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.309> ball<00:00:43.460> very<00:00:43.640> central<00:00:44.149> and

try not to move the ball side to side

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.950 
try not to move the ball side to side
too<00:00:46.040> much<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.909> way<00:00:47.030> we<00:00:47.059> spin<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.629> ball<00:00:47.809> after

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
too much the way we spin the ball after

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.600 
too much the way we spin the ball after
every<00:00:48.320> half<00:00:48.440> around<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:48.890> world<00:00:49.070> will<00:00:49.309> help<00:00:49.489> us

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
every half around the world will help us

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.040 
every half around the world will help us
achieve<00:00:49.699> this<00:00:50.089> as<00:00:50.540> soon<00:00:50.720> as<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:50.960> have

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
achieve this as soon as we have

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.299 
achieve this as soon as we have
three-quarters<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.589> way<00:00:51.680> around<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.129> ball

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
three-quarters the way around the ball

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.829 
three-quarters the way around the ball
we're<00:00:52.519> going<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.699> do<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.790> slight<00:00:53.149> hop<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.629> switch

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
we're going to do a slight hop to switch

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.540 
we're going to do a slight hop to switch
feet<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:54.589> I<00:00:54.620> start<00:00:54.979> in<00:00:55.040> foot<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:55.370> going<00:00:55.489> to

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
feet so I start in foot it's going to

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.070 
feet so I start in foot it's going to
land<00:00:55.699> on<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:55.879> floor<00:00:56.089> and<00:00:56.360> our<00:00:56.509> other<00:00:56.629> foot<00:00:56.930> is

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
land on the floor and our other foot is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.479 
land on the floor and our other foot is
going<00:00:57.229> to<00:00:57.320> come<00:00:57.379> up<00:00:57.559> into<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.890> air<00:00:58.009> to<00:00:58.189> prepare

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
going to come up into the air to prepare

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.399 
going to come up into the air to prepare
for<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.820> next<00:00:58.939> half<00:00:59.180> round<00:00:59.479> a<00:00:59.540> lot<00:00:59.689> this<00:01:00.140> quick

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
for the next half round a lot this quick

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.869 
for the next half round a lot this quick
change<00:01:00.619> of<00:01:00.739> feet<00:01:00.949> helps<00:01:01.280> us<00:01:01.400> keep<00:01:01.549> our<00:01:01.699> balance

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
change of feet helps us keep our balance

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.820 
change of feet helps us keep our balance
and<00:01:02.239> our<00:01:02.360> rhythm<00:01:02.720> when<00:01:03.049> doing<00:01:03.259> consecutive

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
and our rhythm when doing consecutive

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.439 
and our rhythm when doing consecutive
around<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.129> walls<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:04.580> keep<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.879> ball<00:01:05.030> fairly

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
around the walls we keep the ball fairly

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.179 
around the walls we keep the ball fairly
low<00:01:05.600> with<00:01:06.110> half<00:01:06.290> round<00:01:06.560> Walter<00:01:06.950> we're<00:01:07.070> going

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
low with half round Walter we're going

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.649 
low with half round Walter we're going
to<00:01:07.250> do<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.549> same<00:01:07.759> except<00:01:08.270> we're<00:01:08.360> gonna<00:01:08.450> lift

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
to do the same except we're gonna lift

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.600 
to do the same except we're gonna lift
the<00:01:08.750> ball<00:01:08.930> up<00:01:09.020> marginally<00:01:09.680> higher<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.369> give<00:01:10.520> us

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
the ball up marginally higher to give us

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.000 
the ball up marginally higher to give us
more<00:01:10.790> time<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.090> go<00:01:11.420> around<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.750> ball

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
remember we're only going to lift the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.460 
remember we're only going to lift the
ball<00:01:18.940> slightly<00:01:18.970> if<00:01:19.630> we<00:01:19.810> lift<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.110> ball<00:01:20.260> too

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
ball slightly if we lift the ball too

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.930 
ball slightly if we lift the ball too
high<00:01:20.680> we're<00:01:20.980> going<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.160> have<00:01:21.280> trouble<00:01:21.460> doing<00:01:21.820> a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
high we're going to have trouble doing a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.610 
high we're going to have trouble doing a
