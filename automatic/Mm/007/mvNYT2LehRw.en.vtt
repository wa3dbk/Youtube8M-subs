00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.200
 when we have a cat at home we should 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.880
 have at least one scraper that also 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.429
 be in the right place so that 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.680
 our cat will use it however 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.920
 some people do not have it in the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.830
 most indicated site or they do not have 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.750
 enough scraper as they should because 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.480
 they do not want them to interfere in the design 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.429
 or in the aesthetics of your house then it is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.710
 when we should consider using 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.570
 a design scraper we can have a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.730
 main scraper if we want in another 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 room of the house and the scraper of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.629
 design in that place where you see or 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.430
 we can simply use this 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.260
 scrapers as main scraper yes 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.180
 for our cat is enough 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.700
 these are the scrapers shaped like 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.280
 vase of the cat brand and as you can see 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.460
 They are two different models but very 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.949
 similarities differ basically in 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.829
 the width the height and the shape the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.770
 scraper is made up of two pieces one is 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.300
 the base as you can see circular and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.310
 pretty big with a strip 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.770
 that prevents our cat from going to 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.820
 dump the scrape while the part 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.880
 higher 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.280
 that as you can see is hollow the fact 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.470
 that is hollow will allow us not 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.229
 just put flowers or some element 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.720
 decorative as if it were a vase but 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.030
 that we can add stones or some other 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.950
 heavy material if we want to give it a 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.020
 extra weight to prevent the cat from 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.630
 overturn this is the second model of 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.030
 scraper as you can see has the same 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.090
 base that the previous model and this is 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.270
 slightly narrower and taller 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.890
 about 42 centimeters 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.440
 just as the other model is hollow and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.450
 can be filled with weight or with some 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.910
 decorative element as for example 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.160
 flowers as you can see the scraper is 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.710
 of design are a good alternative if 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.750
 we have to add a scraper in one 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.430
 area that is busier than 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.530
 usual or in a room that has 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.630
 a special decoration because these are 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.460
 The scraper is design I hope that you 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.350
 have liked and that they serve you to do 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.069
 your house much better for your 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.939
 home 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.939
 the cats
