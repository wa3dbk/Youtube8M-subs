00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.980
 review of a great sky wars map 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.200
 for minecraft and 0.12 point 1 the truth 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.940
 that this map is very cool I know 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.130
 I recommend that you play with your friends 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.560
 cousins ​​brothers that you want 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.270
 because the truth is not going to regret 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.370
 good guys let's go with what 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.130
 would be the spawn point for 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.960
 see more about this map and good 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.550
 friends we are already here in what 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 would be the spawn point where 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.090
 there are the posters and a little more 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.309
 information about this map and well then 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.530
 the map was created by juan jose su 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.140
 YouTube channel for me and storage rooms and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.819
 'the and good credits are for me from 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 storage rooms and you down here in the 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.760
 description of the video will be all 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.519
 credits along with the download link 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.920
 of this magnificent map the truth that no 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.440
 you will regret it and you will spend hours 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.390
 of fun playing since they are not yet 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.359
 the sky wards servers of no 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.609
 server for steel point 12.1 this 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.010
 map replaces a server because the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.450
 true that it is very great and apart 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.150
 it's very good you could play with your 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.670
 friends brothers cousins ​​or with you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.540
 want and well, let's go with 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.580
 what would be 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.680
 in survival mode for you to see 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 more better everything inside the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.120
 chests good friends by magic and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.040
 I put it in what would be the way 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.590
 Survival is are not lies but good 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.880
 let's see as you know from 0.11 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 point x then we can put the world 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.290
 modify it or put it survival or 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.240
 creative and so good this map comes in 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.729
 creative but you can put it in 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.820
 survival easily and well we're going to 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.040
 see up here in the chests we have 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.330
 many kits like the food kit the kit 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.600
 of construction that would come 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.600
 blocks the kit the iron golem kit 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 for example here you can all iron and 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.350
 well let's see what we have here 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.330
 we have more chests the truth that they have 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.720
 lots of kit as we see here the kit 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.670
 food the tnt kit and well, what 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.530
 let's do now now once 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.930
 let's be here with our friends every 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.600
 who is going to position himself in some way 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.520
 since then it has eight islands it 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.870
 which is very, very cool right now 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.270
 I'm going to show you what it contains 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.640
 some islands because the truth that they are 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.840
 of wonder has enchanted things what 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.519
 which is very cool 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.489
 one of the new things that they added in 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.950
 minecraft 0.12 point 1 and well then 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.620
 let's take a path and we will get there 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.629
 to a part like this and well 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.550
 friends once you've routed what 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.379
 enough to get like this part 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.090
 they're just going to jump and they're going to fall 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.730
 in a part how are they going to break 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.140
 this part and then here they are going to make a 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.720
 little damage but then simply 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.019
 they grab cake and it was the same 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.489
 hunger bar will regenerate them let's go 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.340
 to see here there is a chest as we see 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.349
 we have things taken away or charmed like 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.849
 you want to say let's grab this 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.250
 that the truth is quite good 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.709
 good but now I'm alone but 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.049
 so when I play with friends or with my 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.060
 sister, I'm just going to win 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.890
 obviously I'm fine but anna true 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.569
 I'm fine loop but then here I go to 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.760
 practice in this since I the truth 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.280
 that I am very no but it does not matter we are going to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.110
 see here this one is lucky the truth 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.510
 that is very good is they are delighted 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.730
 as we see here we have some blocks 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.500
 which obviously will be useful for us 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.569
 get to what would be the island 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.040
 on the other side and well let's see here 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.540
 we have some diamonds that we 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.310
 they could serve let's go 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.859
 to see how we see there when we break what 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.269
 that would be a block of diamond 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.879
 gives us experience that the truth that 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.590
 It's pretty cool and we're going to 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.290
 move on to what would be the other 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.209
 island let's see let me get on and we 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.909
 let's go to that island that is there 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.790
 so let's see how you already know in the 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.129
 version 0 point 12.1 added what 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.989
 it would be for tiar chips like 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.720
 we see we can put blocks like in 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.180
 pc no no we are not going to fall because the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.730
 it's really fine this is 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.250
 way to put blocks but then to me 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.170
 Personally, it does not convince me much anymore 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.909
 that I already got used to putting the 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.189
 blocks in this way and it's much more 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.099
 fast let's see let's go back when 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:10.799
 already on the other island two thousand years more 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.840
 late and good friends finally we arrived 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.000
 what would be the other island 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.070
 as we see then let's see what it contains 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.900
 this island we are going to eat a little so that 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.880
 do not fill what would be the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.400
 hunger bar as we see here there 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.289
 much more things cited as we see we are going 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.139
 to put what would be armor 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.270
 let's see very well the truth 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.900
 that looks very cool all this what 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.610
 at 0.12 point one is pretty cool and 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.640
 well let's break this to see that 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.230
 it's not with what it contains we're going to see it 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.260
 let's see very well very well let's 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.830
 see what contains contains chops meat 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.720
 apples a shovel and that thing that no longer 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.390
 I remember what is called a lighter 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.070
 but well let's get out and well 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.380
 In this it is what would be 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.660
 this map more than anything because the truth 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.150
 which is very cool on the middle island 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.400
 we can find a lot more chests than 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.200
 they contain golden apples and other things 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.390
 very important that the truth that you 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.860
 They serve a lot in sky guard good friend me 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.530
