to<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:17.130> think<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> best<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
to I think the best one to do is the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.519 
to I think the best one to do is the
beans<00:00:19.980> because<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.449> get<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.930> hundred<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
beans because you get a hundred and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.910 
beans because you get a hundred and
forty<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.880> good<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> have<00:00:24.449> multiple

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
forty and it's good if you have multiple

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.230 
forty and it's good if you have multiple
Sims<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.279> are<00:00:26.400> getting<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> same

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
the beans are done and it usually takes

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.039 
the beans are done and it usually takes
12<00:01:54.110> hours<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:54.619> just<00:01:54.830> gonna<00:01:55.990> get<00:01:56.990> money<00:01:59.049> that's

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
12 hours so just gonna get money that's

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.450 
12 hours so just gonna get money that's
how<00:02:00.259> you<00:02:00.320> do<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.880> also<00:02:02.710> can<00:02:03.710> sometimes<00:02:04.190> give

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
that long just skip it if you're

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.550 
that long just skip it if you're
building<00:02:13.310> something<00:02:13.540> don't<00:02:14.540> waste<00:02:14.780> your<00:02:14.989> life

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
building something don't waste your life

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.699 
building something don't waste your life
points<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.130> just<00:02:16.519> do<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.620> you

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
points on it just do it like that so you

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.539 
points on it just do it like that so you
can<00:02:19.720> like<00:02:20.720> for<00:02:21.200> example<00:02:21.380> if<00:02:22.100> you're<00:02:22.250> building

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
can like for example if you're building

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.170 
can like for example if you're building
the<00:02:23.480> science<00:02:23.900> building<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:25.160> want<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.819> takes

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the science building you want it takes

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.320 
the science building you want it takes
like<00:02:26.420> 12<00:02:26.900> hours<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.640> do<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:29.030> and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
like 12 hours so you just do that and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.780
