they<00:05:03.800> could<00:05:03.980> have<00:05:04.010> picked<00:05:04.190> something<00:05:04.430> else<00:05:04.760> I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
they could have picked something else I

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.330 
they could have picked something else I
also<00:05:05.750> feel<00:05:06.110> that<00:05:06.140> all<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.470> songs<00:05:06.800> are<00:05:07.010> good

also feel that all the songs are good
but<00:05:08.150> they<00:05:08.300> do<00:05:08.360> not<00:05:08.600> particularly<00:05:08.990> stand<00:05:09.590> out

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
but they do not particularly stand out

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
on a brighter note the songs in this

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.530 
on a brighter note the songs in this
album<00:05:12.320> are<00:05:12.800> arranged<00:05:13.400> nicely<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:14.060> gives<00:05:14.360> off

a<00:05:14.570> very<00:05:14.870> seasonable<00:05:15.500> mood<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:16.330> my<00:05:17.330> own

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
a very seasonable mood and my own

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.510 
a very seasonable mood and my own
interpretation<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.560> starts<00:05:18.890> off<00:05:19.040> where<00:05:19.370> you

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
interpretation it starts off where you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.130 
interpretation it starts off where you
