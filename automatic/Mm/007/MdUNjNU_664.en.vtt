team<00:05:19.240> really<00:05:19.570> we<00:05:19.720> still<00:05:19.960> got<00:05:20.110> number<00:05:20.500> four<00:05:20.830> is

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
team really we still got number four is

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.310 
team really we still got number four is
no<00:05:21.220> it's<00:05:21.370> actually<00:05:21.490> Josh<00:05:21.910> Huff<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:22.570> he<00:05:23.110> might

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
no it's actually Josh Huff so he might

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.409 
no it's actually Josh Huff so he might
be<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.740> target<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.669> look<00:05:24.880> for<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.090> little<00:05:25.270> bit

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
be a target that I look for a little bit

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.480 
be a target that I look for a little bit
more<00:05:25.630> he's<00:05:25.810> more<00:05:26.020> of<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.200> slot<00:05:26.470> tight<00:05:26.770> doesn't

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
more he's more of a slot tight doesn't

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.550 
more he's more of a slot tight doesn't
get<00:05:27.729> open<00:05:27.970> downfield<00:05:28.150> as<00:05:28.540> much<00:05:28.720> but<00:05:29.110> still

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
get open downfield as much but still

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.290 
get open downfield as much but still
have<00:05:29.770> this<00:05:29.889> tight<00:05:30.130> on<00:05:30.280> number<00:05:30.550> 42<00:05:30.970> he<00:05:31.060> dropped

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
have this tight on number 42 he dropped

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.810 
have this tight on number 42 he dropped
a<00:05:31.419> lot<00:05:31.600> of<00:05:31.780> wide-open<00:05:31.960> passes<00:05:32.710> but<00:05:33.520> we'll<00:05:33.669> see

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
a lot of wide-open passes but we'll see

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.540 
a lot of wide-open passes but we'll see
how<00:05:33.850> its<00:05:34.030> progression<00:05:34.360> is<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:35.400> moving<00:05:36.400> under

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
how its progression is and moving under

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.760 
how its progression is and moving under
the<00:05:36.580> offensive<00:05:37.090> line<00:05:37.120> which<00:05:37.600> sometimes<00:05:38.229> just

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
the offensive line which sometimes just

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.409 
the offensive line which sometimes just
played<00:05:38.979> amazing<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:39.700> sometimes<00:05:40.030> just<00:05:40.240> did

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
played amazing and sometimes just did

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.240 
played amazing and sometimes just did
alright<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.380> know<00:05:41.470> let<00:05:41.620> some<00:05:41.830> guys<00:05:42.010> in

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
alright and you know let some guys in

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.740 
alright and you know let some guys in
but<00:05:42.430> it's<00:05:42.580> hard<00:05:42.729> to<00:05:42.760> block<00:05:43.030> for<00:05:43.270> a<00:05:43.300> scrambling

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
but it's hard to block for a scrambling

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.840 
but it's hard to block for a scrambling
quarterback<00:05:44.229> and<00:05:44.500> how<00:05:45.280> to<00:05:45.340> respect<00:05:45.640> their

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
quarterback and how to respect their

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.940 
quarterback and how to respect their
performance<00:05:46.360> definitely<00:05:46.840> held<00:05:47.410> the<00:05:47.530> pocket<00:05:47.860> a

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
performance definitely held the pocket a

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.860 
performance definitely held the pocket a
lot<00:05:48.130> but<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.520> right<00:05:48.700> side<00:05:49.000> appears<00:05:49.570> to<00:05:49.750> be<00:05:49.840> a

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
lot but the right side appears to be a

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.420 
lot but the right side appears to be a
little<00:05:50.110> bit<00:05:50.260> weaker<00:05:50.500> than<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:50.710> left<00:05:50.950> like<00:05:51.310> it

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
little bit weaker than the left like it

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.210 
little bit weaker than the left like it
was<00:05:51.520> similar<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.880> last<00:05:52.210> year<00:05:52.950> you<00:05:53.950> can<00:05:54.070> take<00:05:54.190> a

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
was similar to last year you can take a

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.409 
was similar to last year you can take a
look<00:05:54.370> at<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.580> defense<00:05:54.700> here<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.180> little<00:05:55.270> bit

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
look at the defense here a little bit

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.880 
look at the defense here a little bit
yourself<00:05:55.840> we<00:05:55.990> never<00:05:56.140> actually<00:05:56.289> see<00:05:56.560> in<00:05:56.650> play

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
yourself we never actually see in play

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.950 
yourself we never actually see in play
so<00:05:56.950> we'll<00:05:57.280> just<00:05:57.310> assume<00:05:57.669> they're<00:05:57.910> doing<00:05:58.780> well

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
so we'll just assume they're doing well

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.710 
so we'll just assume they're doing well
every<00:05:59.260> game<00:05:59.640> but<00:06:00.640> we<00:06:00.760> had<00:06:00.850> a<00:06:00.880> very<00:06:01.360> interesting

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
every game but we had a very interesting

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.870 
every game but we had a very interesting
