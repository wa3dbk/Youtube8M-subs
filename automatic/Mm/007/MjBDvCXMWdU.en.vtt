current moment in time nothing is
looking<00:03:23.340> too<00:03:23.489> likely<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.300> we<00:03:24.360> would<00:03:24.450> not

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
looking too likely so we would not

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.850 
looking too likely so we would not
expect<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.959> service<00:03:25.230> me<00:03:25.350> back<00:03:25.500> up<00:03:25.650> online

so<00:03:29.070> anyway<00:03:29.400> my<00:03:29.580> only<00:03:29.790> recommendation<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.570> to

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
so anyway my only recommendation is to

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.210 
so anyway my only recommendation is to
ignore<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.080> listen<00:03:31.320> squad<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.769> do<00:03:32.070> not

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
ignore the listen squad and do not

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
ignore the listen squad and do not
support<00:03:32.340> anything<00:03:32.910> they<00:03:33.030> do<00:03:33.090> all<00:03:33.450> they<00:03:33.780> want

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
support anything they do all they want

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.750
