00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 one could be educated that way 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.929
 go out that already six or 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.360
 seven is but it is not strong 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.509
 is still weak is good though 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.270
 filled looks good but he is in 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.300
 his whole structure still too weak 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.859
 if we assume that a horse 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.859
 78 years old is fully grown 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.079
 if the horses are still 30 40 years old 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.149
 not so physically perfect 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.660
 were trained as for example 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 This type of full drive then went on 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.100
 worked that one did that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.219
 but not the horses 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.680
 quickly broken because the easy long 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.399
 Longer time took to get there 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.620
 come 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.489
 the horses were not like that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.340
 example, great biologists already said 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.500
 actually do not like that for ours 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.420
 good riding sometimes today are the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.520
 Guilty guilty one wonders 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.250
 Of course the breeders are so good 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.810
 horses have bred where it is easy 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.650
 is in the one particular form 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.260
 bring in 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.720
 But where is it easy? 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.470
 horse 1 4 yawning or five every everything 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.360
 teach 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.000
 You can see a young horse inside 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.680
 shortest time in two three years everything 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.620
 to teach up to the grand prix 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.080
 then they have but 78 years or 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.540
 new ones you can see these horses so rarely 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.520
 then they populate the clinics 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:42.190
 the horse's body simply does not think so 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.320
 So people have those at the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.100
 camera school have been there 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.400
 have learned their horses as younger 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.580
 monte train as an aging monte 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.520
 kept their horses long lasting 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.880
 that means that they have to be long synonymous 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.770
 hold because you also another type 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.970
 drive that means they had many 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.410
 kilometer run 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.790
 they had to go yes I never know where 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.420
 Russia everywhere they have been this 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.520
 horses 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.860
 they were then bred the 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.390
 the horses did not have to be patented 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 Run movements but long 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.260
 third make you had to gain space 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.120
 flat on the ground just do not stay that way 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.970
 load a lot but always forward 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.130
 forward in rough terrain 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.740
 and everywhere the younger monte 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.600
 got used to the rider 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.850
 environment was used in one 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.590
 ridden and never allowed 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.020
 they are touched in front 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.970
 that is no longer conceivable today 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.480
 Today the young horses will be in the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.940
 track and blocked accordingly 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.540
 be prepared and then they will 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.910
 ridden 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.040
 you have no clue anything new 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.010
 things that can bring problems 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.110
 stress situation of young horses during 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.330
 the rider does not take so much 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.210
 time something has to happen 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.680
 and that's the wrong way it is 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.870
 nothing has to happen 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.110
 the horse has to find a way that 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.540
 It means I have to go under the rider 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.930
 For the first time, balance it with you 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.030
 balance the rider 2 after two 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.770
 Years old became the muntean 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.960
 used to curb if it can in 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:26.590
 haifa there was the horse but already 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.850
 45 years old not before 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.240
 Today , three-year-olds go 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.990
 even in equestrian exams , this must be done 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.030
 Best to go in a pack 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.170
 that means the horses can not anymore 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.400
 So they have to go free then somewhere 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.650
 are they handled it not for the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.930
 tempo too high then they will be too 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.710
 according to the regulations you have to go to the command 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.470
 gallop 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.150
 So you have to fish right 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.280
 making should not lured in cross 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.230
 at kingson point deduction dogs all that 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.340
 So that really looks like things 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.580
 a young horse too much too much 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.209
 a lot of training actually requires 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.880
 should have lengthy training after 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.880
 Two years for me would not be 3g s 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.130
 goes to the tournament at the end of the 13th 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.859
 like this one drives now that would be 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.020
 okay but it should be there too 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.330
 now do not belong to spend the highest 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.580
 the front step the more press notes 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.130
 he gets those are for me the things in 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.020
 the development of sports is not so good 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.590
 I mean my personal 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.590
 opinions 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.960
 where I have to say when I go to 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.030
 auction then I would like synonymous times 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.310
 See what's up in this horse? 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.440
 this is not a problem if the boy 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.530
 is prepared accordingly 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.930
 that means that knows what it should do that 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.550
 is not overwhelmed but also 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.960
 there done accordingly is because 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.270
 what is it ultimately about? 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.460
 it's all about the money he has to spend a lot 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.530
 bring money and only money brings 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.430
 of the high-tearing the legs up to the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.800
 no longer works 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.289
 and those are not necessarily the things 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.810
 are always right for right 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.060
 Education can go and have that 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.360
 We'll experienced in the past 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.340
 the normal ryder not even tackled 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.199
 who were totally crazy too 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.479
 but not everyone was like that 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.370
 but then I remember rembrandt 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.650
 who do not enjoy two years themselves 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.910
 Risk could be as well 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.910
 Small to sixties type
