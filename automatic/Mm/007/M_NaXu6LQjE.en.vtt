00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
object you want as you can see over here

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.930 
object you want as you can see over here
you<00:00:44.820> press<00:00:45.180> shift<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.559> press<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
you press shift and then you press the
brackets<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.420> maybe<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.350> doesn't<00:00:49.530> work

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
brackets but maybe it doesn't work

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.340 
brackets but maybe it doesn't work
directly<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.940> actually<00:00:51.840> move

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
directly then you have to actually move

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.080 
directly then you have to actually move
around<00:00:52.770> your<00:00:52.980> mouse<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> will<00:00:53.910> work

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
around your mouse and then it will work

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.590 
around your mouse and then it will work
so<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.219> move<00:00:57.030> around<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.420> mouse

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
so there you go move around your mouse

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.520 
so there you go move around your mouse
and<00:00:57.840> we've<00:00:58.050> got<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.440> huge<00:00:58.770> elephant<00:01:00.350> there<00:01:01.350> we

and we've got a huge elephant there we

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.619 
and we've got a huge elephant there we
go<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.520> way<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:03.270> make

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
go and in this way we can actually make

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.170 
go and in this way we can actually make
some<00:01:03.989> crazy<00:01:04.460> huge<00:01:05.810> objects<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.930> mean<00:01:08.180> this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
some crazy huge objects I mean this

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.750 
some crazy huge objects I mean this
makes<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.080> world<00:01:10.680> actually<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.310> best<00:01:11.520> place

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
makes this world actually the best place

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.780 
makes this world actually the best place
ever<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:12.930> there's<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.350> huge<00:01:13.950> almost

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
ever because there's a huge almost

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.039 
ever because there's a huge almost
lively<00:01:15.720> way<00:01:16.350> too<00:01:16.409> big<00:01:16.770> looking<00:01:17.159> elephant<00:01:18.049> but

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
lively way too big looking elephant but

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.780 
lively way too big looking elephant but
we<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.350> also<00:01:19.530> make<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.950> smaller<00:01:20.280> again<00:01:20.580> by

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
we can also make it smaller again by

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.910 
we can also make it smaller again by
just<00:01:20.820> putting<00:01:21.240> shift<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.140> pressing<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
just putting shift and pressing the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.039 
just putting shift and pressing the
other<00:01:23.100> brackets<00:01:23.610> moving<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.420> around<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.900> bit

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
other brackets moving it around a bit

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.249 
other brackets moving it around a bit
and<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.830> will<00:01:26.270> work<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> might

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
and then it will work so if you might

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.010 
and then it will work so if you might
think<00:01:28.530> well<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.369> pressing<00:01:30.090> why<00:01:30.299> doesn't<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
think well I'm pressing why doesn't the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
think well I'm pressing why doesn't the
size<00:01:31.350> change<00:01:31.770> well<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.310> move<00:01:32.850> around<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
size change well just move around the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 
size change well just move around the
object<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.350> will<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:35.070> ok<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.579> can't

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
object and it will be ok you can't

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.810 
object and it will be ok you can't
unfortunately<00:01:36.710> make<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> object<00:01:38.430> smaller

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
unfortunately make the object smaller

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.870 
unfortunately make the object smaller
than<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> originally<00:01:39.540> was<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.549> because

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
than it originally was and just because

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.420 
than it originally was and just because
yeah<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.570> doesn't<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.710> game<00:01:43.920> doesn't

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

see<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.210> something<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
see that as something that you can do so

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.399 
see that as something that you can do so
as<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.930> grabbed<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
as you can see here I just grabbed the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.789 
as you can see here I just grabbed the
same<00:01:49.619> object<00:01:50.100> again<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:52.049> try<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.409> make<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
same object again and I try to make it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.800 
same object again and I try to make it
smaller<00:01:53.070> right<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.240> doesn't<00:01:54.270> work

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
smaller right now but that doesn't work

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420 
smaller right now but that doesn't work
and<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.470> would<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:55.950> been<00:01:56.130> great<00:01:56.369> for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and that would have been great for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
and that would have been great for
plants<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> believe<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.689> plants<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
plants but I believe the plants are a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.179 
plants but I believe the plants are a
little<00:01:58.890> bit<00:01:59.070> smaller<00:01:59.430> than<00:01:59.759> normally<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.649> than

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
little bit smaller than normally so than

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.359 
little bit smaller than normally so than
in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.430> sims<00:02:03.119> 3<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.350> they're<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.040> too<00:02:05.159> big

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
in the sims 3 so now they're not too big

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.889 
in the sims 3 so now they're not too big
with<00:02:05.520> actually<00:02:05.820> too<00:02:05.939> small<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.540> just

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
with actually too small but you can just

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.529 
with actually too small but you can just
resize<00:02:07.350> them<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.580> we've<00:02:08.759> got<00:02:08.819> some<00:02:09.209> crazy

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
resize them so here we've got some crazy

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.660 
resize them so here we've got some crazy
examples<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> with

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
examples but you can do that with

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.930 
examples but you can do that with
basically<00:02:12.209> everything

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
basically everything

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.110 
basically everything
so<00:02:13.060> let's<00:02:13.270> see<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.620> we<00:02:14.740> don't<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.370> cars<00:02:15.850> in

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
so let's see so we don't have a cars in

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.250 
so let's see so we don't have a cars in
the<00:02:16.480> Sims<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:18.180> sims<00:02:19.180> 4<00:02:19.450> or<00:02:19.660> at<00:02:19.780> least<00:02:19.990> not

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the Sims and the sims 4 or at least not

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.580 
the Sims and the sims 4 or at least not
yet

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
yet

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.910 
yet
so<00:02:21.460> now<00:02:21.700> we<00:02:21.760> can<00:02:22.210> go<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.780> toy<00:02:22.990> section<00:02:23.380> I've

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
so now we can go to the toy section I've

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.250 
so now we can go to the toy section I've
not<00:02:24.370> been<00:02:24.550> here<00:02:24.700> yet<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.150> then<00:02:25.690> let's<00:02:25.990> say

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
not been here yet and then let's say

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.750 
not been here yet and then let's say
we've<00:02:26.560> got<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:27.090> wait<00:02:28.090> we've<00:02:28.510> got<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.750> helicopter

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
we've got a wait we've got a helicopter

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.610 
we've got a wait we've got a helicopter
well<00:02:30.760> let's<00:02:31.330> just<00:02:31.630> maybe<00:02:31.990> make<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.470> little

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
well let's just maybe make this a little

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.440 
well let's just maybe make this a little
bit<00:02:32.770> bigger<00:02:34.290> there<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.470> go<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:37.060> must<00:02:37.300> say

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
bit bigger there we go and I must say

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.450 
bit bigger there we go and I must say
that<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.810> texture<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.380> course<00:02:38.650> becomes<00:02:39.160> very

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
that the texture of course becomes very

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.670 
that the texture of course becomes very
blurry<00:02:39.880> but<00:02:40.210> that's<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.480> expectable<00:02:41.200> because

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
blurry but that's a expectable because

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.130 
blurry but that's a expectable because
you<00:02:42.430> don't<00:02:42.640> seriously<00:02:43.270> want<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:43.960> your

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
you don't seriously want this in your

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.130 
you don't seriously want this in your
house<00:02:44.350> but<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.770> can<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:46.240> especially<00:02:46.870> because

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
house but you can and especially because

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.770 
house but you can and especially because
this<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.740> very<00:02:48.040> small<00:02:48.430> object<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
this is like a very small object the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.640 
this is like a very small object the
texture<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.650> very<00:02:51.240> bad<00:02:52.240> actually<00:02:52.570> but<00:02:52.930> as<00:02:53.170> you

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
texture is very bad actually but as you

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.260 
texture is very bad actually but as you
can<00:02:53.740> see<00:02:53.800> this<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.250> little<00:02:54.520> bit<00:02:54.610> bigger<00:02:54.880> and

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
can see this is a little bit bigger and

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.420 
can see this is a little bit bigger and
the<00:02:55.810> texture<00:02:56.380> also<00:02:56.560> seems<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.130> be<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.250> little

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
the texture also seems to be a little

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.430 
the texture also seems to be a little
bit<00:02:57.610> better<00:02:57.820> because<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.660> detailed<00:02:59.200> and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
bit better because it's a detailed and

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.020 
bit better because it's a detailed and
there<00:03:00.310> we<00:03:00.460> go<00:03:00.640> we've<00:03:00.880> got<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.530> lively<00:03:02.530> full

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
there we go we've got a lively full

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.390 
there we go we've got a lively full
castle<00:03:04.030> without<00:03:04.840> doing<00:03:05.350> anything<00:03:05.620> we<00:03:05.950> didn't

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
castle without doing anything we didn't

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.060 
castle without doing anything we didn't
even<00:03:06.580> have<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.880> build<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.300> if<00:03:08.290> they're<00:03:08.590> usable

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
even have to build it if they're usable

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.190 
even have to build it if they're usable
I<00:03:09.370> actually<00:03:09.640> don't<00:03:09.940> know<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:10.420> if<00:03:10.600> they<00:03:10.960> are

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
I actually don't know but if they are

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.090 
I actually don't know but if they are
please<00:03:11.620> well<00:03:12.520> show<00:03:13.510> me<00:03:13.540> some<00:03:14.080> Sims<00:03:14.440> using<00:03:14.950> this

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
please well show me some Sims using this

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.850 
please well show me some Sims using this
because<00:03:15.460> that<00:03:16.090> would<00:03:16.270> be<00:03:16.390> awesome<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.680> on

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
examples are just this the steady bear

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.330 
examples are just this the steady bear

and then pressing the brackets and shift
together<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:25.000> there<00:03:25.720> we<00:03:25.870> go<00:03:26.050> we've<00:03:26.440> got<00:03:26.470> some

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
together and there we go we've got some

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.550

enjoyed<00:03:29.920> watching<00:03:30.459> this<00:03:30.760> tutorial<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:31.690> very

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
enjoyed watching this tutorial it's very

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.320 
enjoyed watching this tutorial it's very
short<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.350> no<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:32.770> it's<00:03:33.010> pretty<00:03:33.280> helpful<00:03:33.940> I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
short and no but it's pretty helpful I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.300 
short and no but it's pretty helpful I
think<00:03:34.360> if<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:35.260> didn't<00:03:35.560> know<00:03:35.680> how<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.920> do<00:03:36.160> it

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
think if you didn't know how to do it

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.250 
think if you didn't know how to do it
and<00:03:36.489> it's<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:36.820> very<00:03:37.120> cool<00:03:37.660> feature

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
and it's a very cool feature

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.720 
and it's a very cool feature
so<00:03:39.010> yeah<00:03:39.910> let's<00:03:40.270> see<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:41.440> cannot<00:03:41.730> basically

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
so yeah let's see we cannot basically

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.410 
so yeah let's see we cannot basically
just<00:03:42.910> enlarge<00:03:43.420> every<00:03:44.080> object<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:45.700> works<00:03:46.090> with

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
just enlarge every object it works with

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.220 
just enlarge every object it works with
Windows<00:03:46.660> -<00:03:47.170> I<00:03:47.410> heard<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:48.400> let's<00:03:48.670> see<00:03:49.000> if<00:03:49.510> it

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
Windows - I heard so let's see if it

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.750 
Windows - I heard so let's see if it
does<00:03:51.810> there<00:03:52.810> we<00:03:52.989> go<00:03:53.200> then<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.739> think<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.459> can

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
does there we go then I think I can

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.479 
does there we go then I think I can
better<00:03:54.940> make<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.150> room<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.340> make<00:03:57.340> it

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
better make a room of it to make it

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.130 
better make a room of it to make it
higher<00:03:57.910> oh<00:03:58.180> that's<00:03:58.930> too<00:03:59.230> far

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
higher oh that's too far

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.210 
higher oh that's too far
yep<00:04:02.140> that's<00:04:02.590> right<00:04:02.680> then<00:04:03.519> we<00:04:04.060> make<00:04:04.269> bigger<00:04:05.220> it

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
yep that's right then we make bigger it

I<00:04:12.820> said<00:04:13.330> that's<00:04:13.480> pretty<00:04:13.630> logical<00:04:14.200> I'm<00:04:14.530> not

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
I said that's pretty logical I'm not

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.280 
I said that's pretty logical I'm not
sure<00:04:15.130> if<00:04:15.370> they<00:04:15.610> will<00:04:15.820> stay<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.510> same<00:04:16.540> if<00:04:17.109> you

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
sure if they will stay the same if you

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.890 
sure if they will stay the same if you
open<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.709> game<00:04:17.890> again<00:04:18.220> after<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:19.359> did<00:04:19.660> this

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
open the game again after you did this

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.400
