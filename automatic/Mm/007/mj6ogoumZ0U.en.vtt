00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
to do and obviously if you want to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.150 
to do and obviously if you want to
change<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.140> transparency<00:02:36.319> level<00:02:36.860> which<00:02:37.069> you

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
change the transparency level which you

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.000 
change the transparency level which you
just<00:02:37.340> go<00:02:37.459> from<00:02:37.610> control<00:02:38.209> shift<00:02:38.450> nine<00:02:38.810> all<00:02:39.410> the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
just go from control shift nine all the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.850 
just go from control shift nine all the
way<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.160> one<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:42.170> naught<00:02:42.379> turns<00:02:42.680> off

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
way to one now I think naught turns off

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.860 
way to one now I think naught turns off
completely<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.610> goes<00:02:43.730> back<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.060> opaque<00:02:44.569> but

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
completely so it goes back to opaque but

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.660 
completely so it goes back to opaque but
129<00:02:45.319> does<00:02:45.560> all<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.739> transparency<00:02:46.280> settings

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
129 does all the transparency settings

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.820 
129 does all the transparency settings
now<00:02:47.330> if<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.989> don't<00:02:48.140> want<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.349> use<00:02:48.470> keyboard

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
now if you don't want to use keyboard

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.589 
now if you don't want to use keyboard
shortcuts<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.580> believe<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.569> just

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
shortcuts I believe you can just

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.130 
shortcuts I believe you can just
right-click<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.230> top<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.329> it<00:02:53.329> should<00:02:53.690> it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
right-click the top and it should it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.180

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
but normally I think perhaps it's a

open up another firefox it opens up
behind<00:03:42.319> this<00:03:42.609> window<00:03:43.609> so<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.389> always<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.440> top

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650

mix this on top functionality and have

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.180 
mix this on top functionality and have
transparency<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.440> can<00:03:51.560> have<00:03:51.680> this<00:03:51.799> on<00:03:51.980> top

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
transparency so you can have this on top

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.900 
transparency so you can have this on top
in<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.609> corner<00:03:52.940> or<00:03:53.060> something<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:54.910> with

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910

whatever<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.389> want<00:03:56.599> like<00:03:56.780> messenger<00:03:57.200> or

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
whatever you want like messenger or

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.289 
whatever you want like messenger or
something<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.639> can<00:03:58.670> have<00:03:58.849> that<00:03:58.970> on<00:03:59.120> top

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
something and you can have that on top

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.789 
something and you can have that on top
in<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.540> corner<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.019> then<00:04:00.319> you<00:04:00.410> can<00:04:00.590> still

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
in the corner and then you can still

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:01.809 
in the corner and then you can still
work<00:04:01.010> on<00:04:01.160> what<00:04:01.280> you're<00:04:01.400> doing<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.790> the

work on what you're doing in the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.509 
work on what you're doing in the

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
background so there's quite good program

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.670 
background so there's quite good program
to<00:04:04.549> have<00:04:04.849> and<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.569> think<00:04:05.660> I've<00:04:06.440> stopped

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
to have and I think I've stopped

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.470 
to have and I think I've stopped
developing<00:04:06.829> it<00:04:07.250> now<00:04:07.400> but<00:04:07.639> it's<00:04:07.730> still<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:07.970> very

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
developing it now but it's still a very

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.690 
developing it now but it's still a very
good<00:04:08.750> program<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.079> use<00:04:09.200> now<00:04:09.950> obviously<00:04:10.370> as

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
good program to use now obviously as

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.190 
good program to use now obviously as
this<00:04:11.209> stop<00:04:11.419> developing<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.959> there<00:04:12.079> may<00:04:12.169> be

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
this stop developing it there may be

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.229 
this stop developing it there may be
bugs<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.709> it<00:04:12.829> and<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.099> may<00:04:13.220> be<00:04:13.280> old<00:04:13.519> software<00:04:13.880> so

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
bugs in it and it may be old software so

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
used in the transformation pack that you

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.770 
used in the transformation pack that you
can<00:05:20.530> get<00:05:20.680> from<00:05:20.830> windows<00:05:21.160> apps<00:05:21.400> but<00:05:22.090> as<00:05:22.600> you<00:05:22.690> can

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
can get from windows apps but as you can

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.240 
can get from windows apps but as you can
see<00:05:22.930> it's<00:05:23.020> just<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.410> just<00:05:23.500> transforms<00:05:24.160> your

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
see it's just it just transforms your

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.129 
see it's just it just transforms your
visual<00:05:24.610> style<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:25.449> look<00:05:25.630> more<00:05:25.900> like<00:05:27.389> arrow<00:05:28.389> now

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
visual style to look more like arrow now

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.930 
visual style to look more like arrow now
if<00:05:29.320> you<00:05:29.440> I'm<00:05:29.620> not<00:05:29.800> sure<00:05:30.070> if<00:05:30.250> it's<00:05:30.370> worth<00:05:30.610> trying

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
if you I'm not sure if it's worth trying

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.460 
if you I'm not sure if it's worth trying
but<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.360> might<00:05:31.510> want<00:05:31.660> to<00:05:31.720> try<00:05:31.810> both<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.260> them

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.750 
but you might want to try both of them
