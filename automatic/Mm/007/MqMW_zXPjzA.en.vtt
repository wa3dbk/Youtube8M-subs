00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
stay the deep color that it is when it's
wet<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:01:59.399> gonna<00:01:59.520> put<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.030> straight<00:02:00.360> on

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
wet so I'm gonna put this straight on

wet so I'm gonna put this straight on
her<00:02:00.689> skin<00:02:01.020> now

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.100 

now<00:02:05.970> there's<00:02:06.150> putting<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> base<00:02:06.600> down<00:02:06.840> first

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
now there's putting a base down first

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.540 
now there's putting a base down first
I'm<00:02:07.350> actually<00:02:07.440> going<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:07.740> use<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:08.070> shadows<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
I'm actually going to use a shadows and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.410 
I'm actually going to use a shadows and
pigments<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.090> shade<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.630> set<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.960> color

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
pigments to shade and to set the color

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.520 
pigments to shade and to set the color
well<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.450> think<00:02:12.570> I've<00:02:12.780> given<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.200> all<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
well I think I've given you all of the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.170 
well I think I've given you all of the
essential<00:02:14.010> information<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.610> wanted<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.970> pass

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
essential information I wanted to pass

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.120 
essential information I wanted to pass
forward<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.170> now<00:02:16.290> we're<00:02:16.440> going<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.770> move<00:02:16.950> into

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
forward and now we're going to move into

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.130 
forward and now we're going to move into
fast<00:02:17.430> motion<00:02:17.940> through<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.540> shading<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
fast motion through the shading of the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.230 
fast motion through the shading of the
flower<00:02:19.440> right<00:02:20.160> through<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.670> as<00:02:20.790> closely<00:02:21.120> we

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
flower right through to as closely we

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:30.310 
flower right through to as closely we
can<00:02:21.270> get<00:02:21.690> this<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.110> finished<00:02:22.380> product

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.780 

the<00:02:31.320> reason<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.620> core<00:02:31.800> body<00:02:31.950> piglets<00:02:32.459> little

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the reason the core body piglets little

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.760 
the reason the core body piglets little
secret<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.420> largely<00:02:33.990> because<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.410> mean<00:02:34.560> not

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
secret is largely because they mean not

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.260 
secret is largely because they mean not
all<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:34.980> them<00:02:35.190> can<00:02:35.340> be<00:02:35.459> used<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.760> every<00:02:35.910> part<00:02:36.180> of

all of them can be used on every part of

all of them can be used on every part of
the<00:02:36.360> face<00:02:37.280> when<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.400> are<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.580> store<00:02:38.850> all<00:02:39.150> of

any of these bodies pigments on the eyes
it's<00:02:57.870> very<00:02:58.080> important<00:02:58.500> under<00:02:59.130> eye<00:02:59.160> makeup

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
staining because the pigment is so

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.199 
staining because the pigment is so
strong<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.220> mean<00:03:05.489> that's<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.790> great<00:03:05.880> thing
