00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.480
 ah 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.480
 some false myths about wine 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.250
 white wine is for fish and 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.079
 red wine for cheese and ham takes 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.809
 Topical does not have to be always like this 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.329
 examples of goat cheese cured wine 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.769
 white with body and aging the camembert 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.339
 instead it goes perfect with a red 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.320
 fruity fish the white wine makes the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.539
 Ideal pairing is true but with the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.089
 tuna or with turbot is better a 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.330
 red without a lot of soft wood and 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.640
 last my favorite topic the ham the 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.460
 fat of ham and red do not coexist 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.409
 well it's better a white with wood not 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.429
 you have more the flavor of ham make me 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.429
 case you will see 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 a reservation is better than a parenting 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.390
 lie 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.060
 as we already said a wine is only better or 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.829
 worse depending on our tastes a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.290
 red of 15 years is better than one of 5 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.939
 If we value fruit we prefer 1 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.220
 young a parent 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.470
 if we want to notice touches smoked or 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.450
 roasted is that we want the red 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.110
 spend time here inside for likes 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.110
 colors let's go 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.190
 the red wine is served at temperature 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.740
 ambient 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.160
 to see take note 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.910
 red wine between 13 and 15 degrees for 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.000
 young people between 16 and 18 for the upbringing 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.060
 white wine is served cold between 10 and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.710
 12 degrees and whenever you have doubts 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.350
 take a look at the chop and serve 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.160
 is the wine at its ideal temperature 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.160
 favor 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.800
 wine is only for connoisseurs 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.550
