00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.120 

kind<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:19.909> tough<00:01:20.509> yeah<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:21.770> actually<00:01:22.100> a

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
kind of tough yeah it's actually a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.490 
kind of tough yeah it's actually a
little<00:01:22.250> bit<00:01:22.430> flimsy<00:01:23.140> anyway<00:01:24.140> let's<00:01:24.320> go<00:01:24.409> ahead

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
little bit flimsy anyway let's go ahead

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.200 
little bit flimsy anyway let's go ahead
and<00:01:24.590> get<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:24.920> thing<00:01:24.979> inside<00:01:25.549> of<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.939> case

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
and get this thing inside of the case

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.999 
and get this thing inside of the case
here<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:26.990> I'm<00:01:27.079> going<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.229> go<00:01:27.350> left<00:01:27.590> side<00:01:27.770> first

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
here so I'm going to go left side first

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.270 
here so I'm going to go left side first
it's<00:01:28.310> got<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.610> most<00:01:28.820> buttons<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:30.280> everything

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
pretty much pops in pretty easily so

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.850 
pretty much pops in pretty easily so
immediately<00:01:35.149> I<00:01:35.479> notice<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:36.020> does<00:01:36.289> add<00:01:36.500> just<00:01:36.770> a

little<00:01:36.890> bit<00:01:37.189> extra<00:01:37.369> bulk<00:01:37.759> but<00:01:37.939> it's<00:01:38.060> going<00:01:38.210> to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
little bit extra bulk but it's going to

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.029 
little bit extra bulk but it's going to
give<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.479> some<00:01:38.659> pretty<00:01:38.990> decent<00:01:39.350> protection

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
these corners are pretty beefy here so

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.859

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.349 
got to say I really like the design of
this<00:02:36.709> case<00:02:36.950> i<00:02:37.069> don't<00:02:37.250> think<00:02:37.579> i've<00:02:37.730> ever<00:02:37.760> used

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
this case i don't think i've ever used

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.259 
this case i don't think i've ever used
one<00:02:39.079> of<00:02:39.200> these<00:02:39.350> before<00:02:39.410> but<00:02:40.040> it's<00:02:40.549> kind<00:02:41.180> of

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
one of these before but it's kind of

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.180 
one of these before but it's kind of
becoming<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.930> my<00:02:42.109> favorite<00:02:42.590> cases<00:02:42.799> by

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
becoming one of my favorite cases by

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.800 
becoming one of my favorite cases by
speaking<00:02:43.549> already<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.150> from<00:02:44.269> holding<00:02:44.780> this

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
speaking already just from holding this

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.979 
speaking already just from holding this
thing<00:02:45.019> in<00:02:45.889> my<00:02:45.920> hand<00:02:46.310> feels<00:02:46.579> absolutely

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
thing in my hand feels absolutely

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.080 
thing in my hand feels absolutely
fantastic<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:49.130> overall<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.549> think<00:02:49.609> this<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
fantastic so overall I think this is a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.550 
fantastic so overall I think this is a
great<00:02:50.420> case<00:02:50.690> with<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> lot<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.290> great

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.000 
functionality with some pretty good
protection<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.840> doesn't<00:02:54.319> add<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.769> lot<00:02:54.799> of

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
protection that doesn't add a lot of

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.390 
protection that doesn't add a lot of
