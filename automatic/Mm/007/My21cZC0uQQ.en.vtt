00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.529
 hello nerds who access design games 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.050
 here and talk to you is the fall and how much 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.689
 time is not even almost a year a year 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.090
 maybe because we have had some hindrances 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.680
 to keep saying in lines in your 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.750

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.000
 back this first video back right 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.760

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.530
 Requiem great hackintoshes tip will be 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.210

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.230
 hackintoshes tutorial with versions 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.579
 updated here with a torch is the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.379
 last operating system we're going 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.750
 teach how to install the ones we have 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.649
 one mg of the yacht lion mount 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.410
 club 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.030
 You'll see that you have not left yet. 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.730

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.989
 could all in 80 hd decent camera 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.300
 with microphones and felt fine 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.310
 It's really explained, we'll see each 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.619
 detail who but for now i go 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.830
 bring these videos tips that you 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.509
 they ask for much and you ask for much 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.250
 like how the devil convent one of mg 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.050
 paradise and today I'll show you 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.330
 It's simpler than you think here. 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.450
 the question of our desktop 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.550
 ok the pro the image should be here like 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.590
 You'll get her as I already told you. 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.459
 complete your work if you go 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.709
 buy from apple store lower and 17 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.920
 here are alternatives that are 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.720
 provided by them and also mg or 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.729
 either I can not record I'm 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.190
 simulating this situation in an environment 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.259
 here in Mexico you have two 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.479
 possible options for working with this 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.950
 so here we are like mg is not e 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.750
 I can not record promised to invest 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.819
 banking because I like him very much simple 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.610
 and fast and knows no relation at night 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.009
 with snow nothing so write isos direct 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.450
 on dvd in a remarkable way but the bmg 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.830
 Ours is not accepted by the cheaper 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.380
 then you need a program 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.360
 convert cdma to this and we have 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.420
 a program for this is called treviso 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.190
 it's free times a trial of it 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.390
 Just like what you need is alcohol 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.720
 always important who remembers the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.069
 program and have also returned to 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 Mountain Spain does this function 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.900
 this is good, this is personal here - free 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.550
 otherwise i dont know if you will 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.470
 need the trial version or not complete 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.500
 I have the full version 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.930
 Okay, because I use it a lot then you. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.670
 will see another one or other that we are 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.230
 This complete person I hope because if I 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.390
 I 'm not mistaken, the trial version can only 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.880
 convert files up to 300 megs ok 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.520
 So without curling, come on, you live. 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.910
 on tools convert images time 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.040
 English will entered without invitation from the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.410
 question, will you select your fiancÃ©e? 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.330
 worked and atticus m2 will leave the 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.380
 use in the desktop format file 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.770
 iso ok we have several formats were only 15 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.410
 and iso and convert 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.080
 it will take your suspicions ten minutes 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.209
 to talk talk talk talk 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.620
 here and from there you will get your iso image 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.360
 that you will be able to use English 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.510
 I'll show you how it's recorded here. 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.010
 for doubts not even while the image 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.080
 I'll give some reservations 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.060
 about design games here our portal 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.340
 2014 has production we'll create something 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.260

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.060
 1 we start from scratch with my 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:29.240
 concepts normally speaking showing 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:31.700
 what we 're going to do is try to keep everything 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.830
 the content better this more quality 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.020

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.720

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:58.220
 has another channel detonated and led a 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.930
 time and come on, it 's as soon as you have 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.260
 finished and I see you in some 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.510
 seconds here and the image has been converted and 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.010
 enough to our desktop file iso 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.840
 What do you want to do, I do not have to give 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.310
 a dvd on my drive this time then 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.710
 Let's open the mind cloth and let's go 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.849
 again how will you know what it is? 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.320
 completely free 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.419
 and I really like this program can be 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.940
 free to be so good to record images to 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.599
 disc this option you will want to go 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.470
 at source 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:27.910
 here in the work area and I'm going to 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.320
 review all spaces in the new video 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.500
 that we are afraid of losing and do not have to 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.120
 stay on record would like to do that 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.700
 here in the steady state so do not 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.890
 worry about it then that's it 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.500
 enough need to do your duty 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:47.360
 do not forget to put it in hc 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.770
 and then you guys next in the nerd area will not 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.680
 forget to write on the 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.289
 games is very good to come back with the videos 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.030
 so it 's good for you, you can follow 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.860
 so this is what I need to transform the average 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.729
 and bye a hug and do not forget to 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.729
