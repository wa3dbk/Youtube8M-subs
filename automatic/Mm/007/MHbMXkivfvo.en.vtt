00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
mini bike if you have to it's a lot

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
mini bike if you have to it's a lot
easier<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.119> slower<00:01:24.299> you're<00:01:24.659> not

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
easier you're going slower you're not

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
easier you're going slower you're not
going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.200> hurt<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.619> he<00:01:26.159> said<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
going to get hurt and he said that's the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
going to get hurt and he said that's the
way<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.060> learn<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.290> ride

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
way you learn so get out here and ride

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
way you learn so get out here and ride
and<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.400> created<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.970> environment<00:01:30.180> kind

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and so we created this environment kind
