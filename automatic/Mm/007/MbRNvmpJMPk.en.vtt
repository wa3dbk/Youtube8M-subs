00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
it's just a small can hang on a second

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.080 
it's just a small can hang on a second
like<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:20.269> just<00:04:20.540> a<00:04:20.630> small<00:04:20.900> canisters<00:04:21.380> hunt

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090

dilute it a little bit with water so you

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.570 
dilute it a little bit with water so you
just<00:04:26.180> pour<00:04:26.390> all<00:04:26.420> that<00:04:26.570> in<00:04:28.300> then<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.390> mix<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:29.750> up

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580

what<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.479> can<00:04:33.659> do<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:37.139> you<00:04:37.289> can<00:04:37.439> go<00:04:37.590> ahead<00:04:37.680> and

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
what you can do is you can go ahead and

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.640 
what you can do is you can go ahead and
add<00:04:38.849> just<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.150> extra<00:04:39.449> katfoe<00:04:39.870> oil<00:04:40.199> not<00:04:40.470> too

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
much just put it in there and also just

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:55.740 
much just put it in there and also just
add<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> little<00:04:47.699> tiny<00:04:47.879> bit<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.120> water

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.250 

I'll<00:04:56.750> make<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.200> more<00:04:57.350> loose<00:04:58.960> I'm<00:04:59.960> more<00:05:00.110> like<00:05:00.230> a
