00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.580 
that same stagger technique as I
mentioned<00:02:37.240> before<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.930> make<00:02:38.050> sure<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.410> he

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
mentioned before to make sure the he

00:02:38.590 --> 00:03:15.950 
mentioned before to make sure the he
receives<00:02:38.980> very<00:02:39.490> secure

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.030 

so<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.050> can<00:03:17.170> actually<00:03:17.230> go<00:03:17.590> through<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.860> add

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
so you can actually go through and add

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.500 
so you can actually go through and add
further<00:03:18.310> bobby<00:03:18.580> pins<00:03:18.850> if<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.150> miss<00:03:19.300> any

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
further bobby pins if you miss any

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.720 
further bobby pins if you miss any
sections<00:03:19.990> this<00:03:20.590> tercel<00:03:21.070> work<00:03:21.280> best<00:03:21.550> with

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
sections this tercel work best with

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.730 
sections this tercel work best with
banana<00:03:22.120> clips<00:03:22.480> if<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.960> medium<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.590> high

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
banana clips if you have medium to high

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.010

have<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.320> settle<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:26.860> using<00:03:27.430> bobby<00:03:27.670> pins

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
have to settle for using bobby pins

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.660 
have to settle for using bobby pins
instead<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:32.530> once<00:03:32.770> you've<00:03:32.920> added<00:03:33.040> all<00:03:33.340> the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
instead so once you've added all the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.040 
instead so once you've added all the
bobby<00:03:33.850> pins<00:03:34.120> then<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.480> can<00:03:34.630> go<00:03:34.780> through<00:03:34.810> and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
bobby pins then you can go through and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.870 
bobby pins then you can go through and
