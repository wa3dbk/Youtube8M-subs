00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.580 
caught a couple on the crawl dead color
crankbait<00:04:02.669> he<00:04:03.540> was<00:04:03.630> using<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.959> banded<00:04:04.349> and<00:04:04.500> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
crankbait he was using a banded and the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.089 
crankbait he was using a banded and the
matte<00:04:04.829> color<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:05.849> I<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.030> just<00:04:06.120> using<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.419> KVD

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
matte color and I was just using a KVD

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.559 
matte color and I was just using a KVD
and<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.190> crowd<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.430> colored<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:09.209> reason<00:04:09.480> why

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
and the crowd I colored the reason why

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.020 
and the crowd I colored the reason why
is<00:04:09.690> because<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:10.079> was<00:04:10.230> pretty<00:04:10.500> muddy<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.030> I

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
is because this was pretty muddy and I

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.840 
is because this was pretty muddy and I
think<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.780> orange<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.169> to<00:04:13.290> shown<00:04:13.500> up<00:04:13.709> better

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
think the orange is to shown up better

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.490 
think the orange is to shown up better
