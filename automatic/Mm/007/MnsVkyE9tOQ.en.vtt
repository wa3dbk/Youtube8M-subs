00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.090
 It 's been a long time. 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.210
 What 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.450
 Today's product

 I'm not a professional virgin resin control power is not a new 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:27.320
 Uh, now you know it's boxing, but Samsung's Galaxy s4 is active 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:31.610
 You know what everyone rugged phones slip out even products called waterproof phone number 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:37.820
 I 'm running a little bit now . 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:43.130
 So now, from the shoulder, I go through the skt around October. 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.190
 Itgoyo and such speculation, then that would like to help him Altibase

 Two of the Galaxy s4 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:56.810
 I have heard a lot of news that it's coming out as a third-party product. 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:59.600
 So I think I can show you the product now. 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:05.210
 It's a product you can buy. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:08.270
 Uh, I'll show you the opening. 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.810
 Actually, it's Jung-gu. 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:19.939
 Actually, it's not like you're tearing up a product that's completely sealed . 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:24.350
 I 'm just saying that I'm boxing. 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.730
 Simply looking at the visa 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.410
 Let's take a look at Galaxy s4 Acti 5. 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:37.210
 Well , as you can see, Park is like this. 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:43.150
 This is a little bit of a used product . 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:49.330
 So once the waxing has changed since the Galaxy s4 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:54.160
 Something a little bit confident that the Samsung is doing something eco-friendly luck a little bit 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.560
 That paper is called recycled paper, but I changed a lot that way. 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.450
 This time I got a prize now. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.510
 Hey skin is the same as the material ppaksin Like 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:09.610
 Once you open it, 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:13.840
 Now, the original is now here with a sticker, 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.250
 Anyway, uh slip galaxy s twisted zoom 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.860
 Ah 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:23.330
 Well, then and in there. I'll ask. 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.390
 The contents in the table are um well what documentation 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.020
 What is the product 5 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.020
 Then , 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.080
 5 pin usb phone proud 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:43.410
 Even then we ditch this scale it is now As I said some of 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.410
 Because the product is a product to buy , 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.060
 Aomos 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.560
 That can be written this way 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.520
 Uh, and then the bundled earphones 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.300
 Upload 5p just what configuration control 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.450
 I would like to have Galaxy products. 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:09.840
 It ends too soon 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.670
 ant That Galaxy s4 of a Cable Excluded Looking at the Now Brief 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.500
 I'll explain. 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.150
 Well, as you can see , it really looks like the Galaxy s4. 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.000
 It looks similar. 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.350
 I feel the securities are different. The bottom part is now the physical button. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.489
 Button 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:34.980
 I have this formula, so I think the physical button is right when I see it. 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:40.080
 Outdoor or whether kkideon gloves because the product is that Lloyd products 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:45.930
 Now , in situations where touch is not possible in the worst case, 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:49.440
 I think it's okay if you can wake up . 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.230
 Well then 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.459
 The rest of us are now no different. 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:00.989
 If you look at the back, it's a little different on the back. 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.950
 So do you see this little sweet something honeycomb 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.950
 Honeycomb name 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:18.590
 There's a monkey on it, and then he 's on the bottom and top 2 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.699
 This part of the top is now what you are doing and extending your life from installation to now 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.880
 Part 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:26.840
 That you can not soft material that can absorb the shock of this party 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.520
 Article 10 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:39.350
 Paper that I think the name is Anna doing something like this in anyway 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:43.160
 How lodged and even after looking at is that the Galaxy s Galaxy Cover x 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.800
 Becks Likes'll be covered if you do not know that x cover 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.849
 Yes . 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:54.039
 What happens then what to say Well 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:05:00.009
 Some say that Becks do you need to cover such as industrial 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:03.009
 I've a bit to be written in the field in real bad condition and bad snacks site 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:07.689
 It's made almost like that . 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:11.229
 For now, I itneyo waging topic ramble 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:14.379
 Oh and all 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.069
 You'll notice, but something like this 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:20.040
 That 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:26.340
 To be waterproof , 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:33.200
 Then go itguyo've seen what the power button and the volume is outside 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:36.930
 The Galaxy s4 is almost nothing much different from the affair 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:44.550
 It's a different product of design . 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:48.170
 Yeah, the 4.99 inch has a 5 inch screen. 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:51.000
 Galaxy s Forum The difference is that Galaxy s bold play hd Super Amol Red 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:55.710
 I could display it . 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.900
 Galaxy s4 active if ips like ips lcd so anyhow 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:03.220
 If you want to 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:08.610
 In a way, I think it could be a more attractive point. 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.610
 Then the cpu ap 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:17.270
 The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 is 1.9 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.010
 Quad core processor give lte one-chip to water so l um in domestic 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:26.090
 To support 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:29.630
 Uh, once in the middle of now, broadband lte 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.230
 I do not get lta out of lte-a. 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:37.730
 Broadband lte is catching, but now kt is only commercialized. 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:43.070
 So I think I can get a lot of opportunities on that side . 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:47.750
 However, if you leave the skt mode alone, 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:50.690
 Ltm'm've seen when we support only seems to say something anyway 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:54.590
 What do you think of the spectators at the end of the year skt 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:57.920
 By the time the frenetic nt has become the Bible, 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:02.450
 Ah, it's not going to pack up down 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:06.520
 I seem to be able to speed it up by bp so simply Galaxy 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.520
 s4 I've been looking at your skin.
