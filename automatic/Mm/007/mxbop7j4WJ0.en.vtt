00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
of the mowers in the front and most of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.030 
of the mowers in the front and most of
them<00:03:15.470> today<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.160> battery<00:03:16.610> in<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.450> back

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
them today have the battery in the back

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.940 
them today have the battery in the back
I'm<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.250> gonna<00:03:19.370> hand<00:03:19.700> tighten<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.950> thing

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
I'm just gonna hand tighten the thing

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.500 
I'm just gonna hand tighten the thing
and<00:03:22.130> there<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.550> there's<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.000> battery

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
and there it is there's the battery

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.460 
and there it is there's the battery

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
replace battery in the Aaron's mower

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.199 
replace battery in the Aaron's mower
this<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.650> an<00:03:30.770> hour<00:03:30.890> meter<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.550> I'm<00:03:31.760> not<00:03:31.910> using

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
this is an hour meter that I'm not using

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.390 
this is an hour meter that I'm not using
right<00:03:32.540> now<00:03:32.800> this<00:03:33.800> is<00:03:34.010> another<00:03:34.280> one<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.550> put<00:03:34.940> in

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
right now this is another one I put in

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.570 
right now this is another one I put in
that<00:03:37.400> actually<00:03:37.850> works<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:39.770> tied<00:03:40.100> up<00:03:40.130> to

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
that actually works and it's tied up to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.400 
that actually works and it's tied up to
a<00:03:40.610> wire<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.480> when<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.900> engine<00:03:42.320> is

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
a wire so that when the engine is

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.500 
a wire so that when the engine is

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
number of hours this has got about 27

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.050 
number of hours this has got about 27
hours<00:03:53.470> on<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.740> about<00:03:54.890> tuning<00:03:55.459> if<00:03:55.550> there's<00:03:55.760> not

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
hours on it about tuning if there's not

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:15.840 
hours on it about tuning if there's not
very<00:03:56.090> much

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.670

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
no for kicks are reversed the battery

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.610 
no for kicks are reversed the battery
here<00:04:18.950> this<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.120> called<00:04:20.330> a<00:04:20.600> reverse<00:04:20.900> battery

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
here this is called a reverse battery

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.730 
here this is called a reverse battery
the<00:04:21.800> positive<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.460> on<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:22.820> side<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.510> do<00:04:23.990> that

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
the positive is on this side I do that

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.500 
the positive is on this side I do that
of<00:04:25.100> course<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.640> terminals<00:04:26.060> aren't<00:04:26.300> going<00:04:26.450> to

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
of course the terminals aren't going to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.210 
of course the terminals aren't going to
reach<00:04:26.660> but<00:04:26.990> if<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.200> would<00:04:27.380> have<00:04:27.500> bought<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.920> new

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
reach but if I would have bought a new

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.380 
reach but if I would have bought a new
non<00:04:29.060> reverse<00:04:29.480> battery<00:04:30.050> then<00:04:31.060> this<00:04:32.060> could<00:04:32.270> be

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
non reverse battery then this could be

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.200 
non reverse battery then this could be
the<00:04:32.510> negative<00:04:32.990> here<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.530> positive<00:04:34.210> will

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
the negative here and the positive will

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.450 
the negative here and the positive will
reach<00:04:35.450> guns<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:36.140> them<00:04:36.350> it's<00:04:36.860> going<00:04:37.010> to<00:04:37.070> be<00:04:37.220> kind

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
reach guns be them it's going to be kind

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.280 
reach guns be them it's going to be kind
of<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.640> stretch<00:04:37.970> but<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.360> will<00:04:38.510> reach<00:04:38.810> I'm<00:04:39.110> not

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
of a stretch but it will reach I'm not

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.270 
of a stretch but it will reach I'm not
sure<00:04:39.500> why<00:04:39.710> they<00:04:39.920> didn't<00:04:40.220> put<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:40.400> in<00:04:40.760> there

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
sure why they didn't put that in there

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.940 
sure why they didn't put that in there
looks<00:04:43.280> like<00:04:43.370> it'll<00:04:43.700> work<00:04:44.770> there's<00:04:45.770> the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
looks like it'll work there's the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.380 
looks like it'll work there's the
battery<00:04:46.160> box<00:04:48.310> it's<00:04:49.310> kind<00:04:49.550> of<00:04:49.640> just<00:04:49.820> loose<00:04:50.060> in

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
battery box it's kind of just loose in

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.780 
battery box it's kind of just loose in
there<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:52.540> must<00:04:53.540> put<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:54.020> in<00:04:54.290> before<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:55.550> put

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
there I must put this in before to put

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.050 
there I must put this in before to put
the<00:04:55.910> trout<00:04:56.270> on<00:04:56.570> here<00:04:57.280> because<00:04:58.280> it<00:04:58.520> won't<00:04:58.730> come

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
the trout on here because it won't come

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.960 
the trout on here because it won't come
out<00:04:59.240> of<00:04:59.420> there<00:05:00.010> maybe<00:05:01.010> it<00:05:01.220> will<00:05:01.400> with<00:05:01.640> kind<00:05:01.880> of

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
out of there maybe it will with kind of

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.880 
out of there maybe it will with kind of
a<00:05:02.090> Rubik's<00:05:02.540> Cube<00:05:02.660> type<00:05:03.320> of<00:05:03.530> thing<00:05:05.650> there's<00:05:06.650> the

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
a Rubik's Cube type of thing there's the

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.450 
a Rubik's Cube type of thing there's the
ground<00:05:07.070> water<00:05:08.620> goes<00:05:09.620> down<00:05:09.890> there<00:05:10.100> under<00:05:10.340> the

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
ground water goes down there under the

ground water goes down there under the
frame<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.960> could<00:05:12.170> be<00:05:12.350> easily<00:05:12.470> be<00:05:12.680> lengthened

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.510 

but<00:05:17.570> if<00:05:17.690> it<00:05:17.810> had<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:17.990> non<00:05:18.290> reversed<00:05:18.710> battery

room for a non rotated battery this is
kind<00:05:38.030> of<00:05:38.150> interesting<00:05:38.270> that<00:05:39.310> they<00:05:40.310> put<00:05:40.550> a

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
kind of interesting that they put a

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.300 
kind of interesting that they put a
rotated<00:05:41.660> battering<00:05:42.140> on<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:42.650> maybe<00:05:42.860> it's<00:05:43.100> too

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
rotated battering on and maybe it's too

new this shroud which comes down which

new this shroud which comes down which
would<00:05:48.440> be<00:05:49.030> about<00:05:50.030> here<00:05:54.610> that<00:05:55.610> feels<00:05:55.880> like<00:05:56.060> it's

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
would be about here that feels like it's

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.450 
would be about here that feels like it's
plastics<00:05:57.110> I<00:05:57.290> can't<00:05:57.590> imagine<00:05:57.710> that's<00:05:58.160> going<00:05:58.400> to

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
short off on the battery here it looks

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.860 
short off on the battery here it looks
like<00:06:03.080> you<00:06:03.290> could<00:06:03.440> undo<00:06:03.830> this<00:06:04.040> terminal<00:06:04.870> rotate

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
like you could undo this terminal rotate

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.630 
like you could undo this terminal rotate
the<00:06:06.050> positive<00:06:06.560> terminal<00:06:07.040> around<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:07.430> get<00:06:07.550> an

an on our aversion battery on easily so

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.900 
an on our aversion battery on easily so
I'm<00:06:18.200> not<00:06:18.320> sure<00:06:18.380> what<00:06:18.980> the<00:06:19.220> purpose<00:06:19.460> is<00:06:19.850> of

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
I'm not sure what the purpose is of

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.650 
I'm not sure what the purpose is of
having<00:06:20.510> the<00:06:20.600> rotated<00:06:21.140> battery<00:06:21.590> around<00:06:22.660> the

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
having the rotated battery around the

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.620 
having the rotated battery around the
type<00:06:23.930> hour<00:06:24.200> version<00:06:25.060> that's<00:06:26.060> what<00:06:26.330> it<00:06:26.419> came

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
type hour version that's what it came

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
type hour version that's what it came
with<00:06:26.900> so<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.200> terminals<00:06:27.680> are<00:06:27.830> in<00:06:27.890> the<00:06:28.010> back

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.260 

it<00:06:31.650> looks<00:06:31.860> like<00:06:32.070> if<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.310> put<00:06:32.640> the<00:06:32.760> non<00:06:32.940> our

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
it looks like if you put the non our

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.380 
it looks like if you put the non our
version<00:06:33.920> the<00:06:34.920> positive<00:06:35.460> over<00:06:35.790> here<00:06:35.820> that

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
version the positive over here that

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.650 
version the positive over here that
would<00:06:36.540> plenty<00:06:37.470> of<00:06:37.560> space<00:06:37.830> over<00:06:38.250> here<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:40.080> one

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
would plenty of space over here this one

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.340 
would plenty of space over here this one
done<00:06:42.660> do<00:06:42.930> this<00:06:43.170> rotated<00:06:43.890> around<00:06:45.080> it'll<00:06:46.080> fit

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
done do this rotated around it'll fit

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.890 
done do this rotated around it'll fit
pretty<00:06:46.560> well
