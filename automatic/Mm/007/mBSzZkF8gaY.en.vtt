00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.210 
have two from series 2 and three from
series<00:00:15.179> one<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:16.170> if<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.289> take<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> look<00:00:16.920> at<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
series one but if you take a look at the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.490 
series one but if you take a look at the
front<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.060> looks<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.660> they<00:00:18.990> are<00:00:19.020> all

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
front of them it looks like they are all

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.300 
front of them it looks like they are all
the<00:00:20.279> same<00:00:21.029> mass<00:00:21.480> shows<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.710> we'll<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.189> do

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the same mass shows so we'll have to do

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
the same mass shows so we'll have to do
a<00:00:23.340> comparison<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.630> may<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.500> little

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
a comparison and see it may be a little

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.070 
a comparison and see it may be a little
bit<00:00:26.039> different<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> coloring<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.810> we'll

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
bit different in the coloring so we'll

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.380 
bit different in the coloring so we'll
have<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.470> while<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.010> open<00:00:29.220> them<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.730> so
