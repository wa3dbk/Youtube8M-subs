bay now let me just illustrate how

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
bay now let me just illustrate how
things<00:01:14.910> get<00:01:15.120> connected<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:16.260> power

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
things get connected here the power

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.920 
things get connected here the power
cable<00:01:16.980> first<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.370> all<00:01:17.460> goes<00:01:17.670> connected<00:01:18.180> into

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
cable first of all goes connected into

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740 
cable first of all goes connected into
the<00:01:19.710> fan<00:01:20.009> controller<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:20.909> plug<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the fan controller and then plug the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.340 
the fan controller and then plug the
other<00:01:22.140> end<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.920> your<00:01:23.670> power<00:01:23.909> supply<00:01:24.509> once

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
other end into your power supply once

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.520 
other end into your power supply once
that<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.340> firmly<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.360> place<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.409> ahead

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that is firmly in place then go ahead

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.700 
that is firmly in place then go ahead
and<00:01:28.890> use<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:30.149> cables<00:01:30.979> plug<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.220> end<00:01:32.280> into

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
and use these cables plug this end into

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.190 
and use these cables plug this end into
the<00:01:34.710> fan<00:01:35.220> controller<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.930> doesn't<00:01:37.140> really

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the fan controller and it doesn't really

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.300 
the fan controller and it doesn't really
matter<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.619> when<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> put<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.130> here

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
matter which when you put it in here

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.120 
matter which when you put it in here
just<00:01:38.340> remember<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.899> are<00:01:39.950> labeled<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
just remember that they are labeled so

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.880 
just remember that they are labeled so
fed<00:01:41.399> one<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.000> fan<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.479> fan<00:01:42.750> three<00:01:43.259> fan<00:01:43.530> for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
control the speed of the fan or fans at

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.120 
control the speed of the fan or fans at
the<00:01:58.829> front<00:01:59.219> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.180> here<00:02:00.950> when<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.039> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the front you can see here when it is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.060 
the front you can see here when it is
lit<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.640> looks<00:02:02.820> quite<00:02:03.390> cool<00:02:03.659> looking<00:02:04.289> and<00:02:04.469> I

lit up it looks quite cool looking and I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.219 
lit up it looks quite cool looking and I
have<00:02:05.310> found<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.329> connected<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:06.960> can

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
have found one here connected so I can

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.740
