00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.650 
verdict just because that 10% less
damage<00:06:38.590> really<00:06:38.830> helps<00:06:39.190> sealers<00:06:39.460> at<00:06:39.610> times<00:06:39.820> so

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
damage really helps sealers at times so

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.879 
damage really helps sealers at times so
the<00:06:40.780> third<00:06:40.960> one<00:06:41.139> I<00:06:41.289> was<00:06:41.410> going<00:06:41.590> through<00:06:41.800> a

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
the third one I was going through a

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.080 
the third one I was going through a
bunch<00:06:42.070> trying<00:06:42.400> to<00:06:42.460> figure<00:06:42.639> out<00:06:42.729> which<00:06:42.849> one<00:06:43.060> I

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
bunch trying to figure out which one I

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.500 
bunch trying to figure out which one I
actually<00:06:43.389> thought<00:06:44.260> would<00:06:44.470> be<00:06:44.590> useful<00:06:44.620> and<00:06:45.510> in

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
actually thought would be useful and in

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.830 
actually thought would be useful and in
the<00:06:46.630> end<00:06:46.840> I<00:06:47.080> can<00:06:47.229> only<00:06:47.349> narrow<00:06:47.950> it<00:06:48.160> down<00:06:48.190> to<00:06:48.370> one

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
the end I can only narrow it down to one

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.430 
the end I can only narrow it down to one
maybe<00:06:49.840> to<00:06:50.200> mass<00:06:50.889> exorcism<00:06:51.729> if<00:06:51.970> it's<00:06:52.479> all<00:06:52.840> melee

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
maybe to mass exorcism if it's all melee

maybe to mass exorcism if it's all melee

I<00:06:55.539> like<00:06:55.840> having<00:06:56.139> that<00:06:56.289> ranged<00:06:56.680> attack<00:06:57.010> let's

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
I like having that ranged attack let's

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.800 
I like having that ranged attack let's
say<00:06:57.520> a<00:06:57.550> dragon<00:06:57.849> flies<00:06:58.180> in<00:06:58.360> the<00:06:58.419> air<00:06:58.510> you<00:06:58.630> got<00:06:58.750> to

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
say a dragon flies in the air you got to

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.060 
say a dragon flies in the air you got to
be<00:06:58.870> able<00:06:58.930> to<00:06:59.020> hit<00:06:59.139> it<00:06:59.229> somehow<00:06:59.410> and<00:06:59.740> that<00:06:59.770> as<00:07:00.039> a

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
be able to hit it somehow and that as a

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.219 
be able to hit it somehow and that as a
rep<00:07:00.310> paladin<00:07:00.639> is<00:07:00.700> one<00:07:00.849> of<00:07:00.940> our<00:07:01.030> three<00:07:01.300> ways<00:07:01.479> if

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:02.229 
rep paladin is one of our three ways if

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.820 
rep paladin is one of our three ways if
you<00:07:02.500> include<00:07:02.919> your<00:07:03.669> holy<00:07:03.880> prism<00:07:04.300> and<00:07:04.830> the

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
you include your holy prism and the

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.560 
you include your holy prism and the
third<00:07:06.010> option<00:07:06.190> I<00:07:06.490> use<00:07:06.729> glyph<00:07:07.090> of<00:07:07.120> avenging

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
third option I use glyph of avenging

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.830 
third option I use glyph of avenging
wrath<00:07:07.630> just<00:07:08.229> because<00:07:09.030> it's<00:07:10.030> a<00:07:10.150> nice<00:07:10.300> help<00:07:10.570> and

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
wrath just because it's a nice help and

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.240 
wrath just because it's a nice help and
it<00:07:11.229> makes<00:07:11.440> it<00:07:11.590> look<00:07:11.650> a<00:07:11.830> little<00:07:12.070> cool

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
it makes it look a little cool

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.710 
it makes it look a little cool
especially<00:07:12.610> when<00:07:12.910> you<00:07:13.000> team<00:07:13.150> it<00:07:13.180> up<00:07:13.360> with<00:07:13.419> the

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
especially when you team it up with the

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.210 
especially when you team it up with the
winged<00:07:14.289> vengeance<00:07:14.710> I'm<00:07:14.889> not<00:07:15.039> sure<00:07:15.130> if

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
winged vengeance I'm not sure if

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.040 
winged vengeance I'm not sure if
avenging<00:07:15.580> wrath<00:07:15.610> glyph<00:07:16.000> actually<00:07:16.330> changes<00:07:16.900> it

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
avenging wrath glyph actually changes it

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.740 
avenging wrath glyph actually changes it
