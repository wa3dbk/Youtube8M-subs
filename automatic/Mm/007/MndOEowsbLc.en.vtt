00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.889
 The take-away shoots through the Champagne like an arrow 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.730
 The French want to set a new speed record 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.089
 540 km / h 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.209
 significantly more than his Japanese acquisition songs reached in 1990 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.630
 only a bad plane is fast enough 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.900
 to deliver these pictures 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.400
 but the speedometer continues to climb 568 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.419
 69 70 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.589
 he is slow at 574 point 8 km strike of train drivers on the brakes 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.140
 and also the braking distance is record-breaking ten kilometers 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.930
 needs the 25,000 hp powerhouse to come to a halt 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.500
 For the record ride a normal high-speed train became special 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.460
 prepared 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.839
 Shipowner and chassis strengthened 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.839
 additional engines distributed to the cars 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.860
 the voltage in the power supply had to be doubled 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.100
 The trackbed was also specially protected against vibrations 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.040
 just like that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.420
 like the contact wire 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.670
 was exposed to enormous forces and heat 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.829
 Prosser cheers among the technicians 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.350
 when the new record mark was reached 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 only a few kilometers were missing to the world record of 581 kilometers 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.049
 However, from a Japanese maglev train we hold DÃ¼lmen the 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.550
 Test Pilot is modest 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.620
 I'm not just Superman a simple engine driver but it was great and 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.870
 a great honor to have set such a mark 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.030
 30 million euros has cost the spectacle the French do with it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580
 Advertising their trains 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.190
 which are pretty tight and spartan but fast 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.480
 From summer they are imposed Paris with Strasbourg and Germany 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.770
 in direct competition to the German ICE 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.450
 Dr is slower 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.769
 "But the roomier and more comfortable with better service the pace 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.739
 Today, however, the travelers are no longer experienced 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.120
 If the trains on the new east-west route first scheduled on May 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.309
 run is maximum speed 320 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:29.899
 but having the fastest train on wheels was therefore the Frenchman's 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.249
 ever a bottle of champagne
