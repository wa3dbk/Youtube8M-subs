 welcome to episode 12 of my never 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.340
 ending glory 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.420
 and we blow the really through on the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.100
 screen in the team where we are the first 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.080
 competition of this mega episode 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.550
 and where we played the previous episode 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.770
 if you can still do that 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.380
 Remember that we are in every position 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.720
 have at least two players and neither 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.340
 just two players me also players who 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.380
 almost as good as if you are 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.450
 substitutes uses the quality to 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.640
 go down because that's important to you 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.230
 does not want to play with players in a forced way 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.030
 those that are less good I have them too 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.380
 okazaki now in the rush hour 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.340
 some law say yes you know who can 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.260
 also not being good does not have whole 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.579
 special town but it is he does 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.290
 and this competition is certainly going well 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.300
 centuries of goals for us 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.860
 team is ridiculously good at the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.630
 Here you can see how quickly to 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.000
 going forward the ball in our half 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.980
 interested depth ball on sun that one 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.720
 perfectly finishes mezzo chocolate leg 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.930
 because he has no chocolate wine 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.519
 five stars were sweet and yes it went 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.200
 really tough this game also matter here 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.940
 beautiful head like i have them ramos 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.680
 note comes very good hefty man 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.420
 and is that badly defending or good? 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.500
 purchased does not matter we are here 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.909
 0 2 for 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.400
 and then another cross comes in 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.560
 castro this time on the pole and then the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.090
 three bolt head that even just inside it 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.950
 don't shield very much 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.390
 and if I get up early I know 3 0 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.640
 you know what's going to happen 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.290
 I'll know kind of off 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.060
 It has often been said if I am 3 Hilhorst 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.650
 I am going to watch some movies there by now 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.510
 youtube and listen to some music 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.430
 he then not over the top type the 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.560
 balls are going to spam and with luck 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 under the legs of the keeper by knowing 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.810
 to score 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.130
 that's kind of a week about me too 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.380
 I wake up again, we score badly 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.180
 nice home score four doubles and for rest 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.189
 even scored once he worked 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.200
 ball did not get completely bad or the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.939
 Messiah's ethical assumption is poor 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.920
 we get the ball back at sam want 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.600
 first try to score but decorate 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.860
 nothing goes back so calmly 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.360
 his defenders go out a little 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.970
 and lure 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.830
 van is alias to such what is called such 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.479
 thing you go outside i know 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.549
 not what that trick is called i already use it 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.150
 Opt every day for 4 years 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.220
 but I don't know what its name is 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.810
 I might just touch the other one 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.760
 youtuber wife how hot or how he called 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.860
 ie skill you just saw me with sunday 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.300
 what's that later he is also to it 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.130
 about 8 I'm curious I don't know 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.750
 exactly the name but we still use it 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.580
 more skill moves with sam 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.220
 get from the kick-off and depth 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.310
 know the ball on okazaki and okazaki 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.650
 easy to get through and shoot the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.240
 ball in again then it is 6 2 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.850
 The work is serious because a 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.560
 Roulette with cooler than and a deadly 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.440
 shot he has two episodes back 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.430
 quite a nice foil that already scored 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.740
 was then 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.840
 beautiful man from the corne and now 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.030
 again and I don't know why I don't 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.380
 have more often with green tree or year 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.790
 more often than not say because 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.310
 this opportunity that you are about to see is 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.440
 another great goal, he shoots him again 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.000
 from far beyond the sixteen in it but me 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.320
 mean on another account used in 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.270
 google me quite often 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.060
 l he links well with roy he links well 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.870
 with la my link with other bundesliga 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.880
 players 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.380
 so it's a cm mark what a fan of mine 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.880
 evening that proposal has skills or that 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.490
 rituals to have fewer spaces on you 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.930
 but then he never strikes me when I see him 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.030
 along with roy's in the team got him there 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.250
 never do anything about it except he whole 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.690
 quickly empty or very quickly they fitness there 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.519
 through it is because he has little starina 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.860
 but he has not scored for the rest 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.900
 never such big goals for me on one 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.769
 another account or another series such as 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.090
 you do now 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.100
 then I'll show you some statistics 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.810
 because we are already promoted 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.060
 we only need one or two 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.830
 grab points for the title 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.420
 we are still unbeaten despite 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.400
 that there are two separate but you 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.720
 know you can see it for yourself 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.709
 two separate heavy disconnects where we 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.170
 nothing we could do we have one 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.030
 goal balance of plus 86 or score 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.780
 on average abyss 4 goals per 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.459
 contest 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.680
 we get the average one against 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.190
 goal in that vision 7 is that best 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.290
 fine 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.700
 you see our records 2602 of which those 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.900
 two disconnect 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.209
 and then it all seems whole 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.930
 to go flawlessly the first challenges 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.570
 have yet to come 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.760
 like i said i am going next 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.739
 do gracious delivery first for 10k 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.739
 see if I win that for more because 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.060
 we are at that moment when would like 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.140
 want a new team 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.030
 and we could do that team 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.310
 obtain by playing but also by 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.950
 to know your annoying is that from this 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.750
 jar which I also have in millions of hunts 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.280
 said if that sound nuisance 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.239
 started to get internet from me 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.070
 and that was because we are wet type after type 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.690
 has to say but that is the openness through 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.790
 Internet you opium strict your dirt 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.380
 strictly speaking you can't do very well 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.940
 connects with your opponents 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.590
 or make your opponents 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.510
 connection with idea service and then 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.880
 then you make through your opponent 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.560
 connection to providing a service instead 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.060
 that you do the same and that's why there is 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.860
 some sort of delay 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.210
 and this jar was that too 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.440
 my opponent and bad with that 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.540
 sometimes i see 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.760
 time tackles I miss time I base mix 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.410
 walk now you also saw that i walk with me 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.700
 play forward while more the behind 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.380
 and that does not delay it 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.300
 a few milliseconds that it contains 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.340
 sometimes such a can be half a second can 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.350
 sometimes 0.10 seconds are also not 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.200
 very much but that ensures that 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.240
 I never make certain mistakes normally 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.410
 do so and there until the next 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.150
 delivery until the next 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.440
 delivery bothered 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.640
 and million yacht so also now 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.650
 fixed that but I have a few 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.330
 played around for days and it sounds 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.820
 really as a cheap excuse 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.320
 but it is not and he must now 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.090
 but from the contractor we score here the 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.130
 nice and familiar again for three centuries 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.810
 standing with ramos is also a celtic 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.890
 rest because what are indeed indeed 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.080
 those players a little bit around 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.550
 and from here it went 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.940
 actually very easy 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.890
 ramos that our defenders set up then luiz 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.150
 gustavo passing by and a bar limit 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.530
 a bit back and forth and that's what i am 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.870
 say with latency it goes normally 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.190
 all fairly stable but now running 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.780
 it all not as flawless and as 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.340
 I always know that what happened to me is okay 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.690
 I just have to look name internet I 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.740
 You need to go here and repent and 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.200
 open up 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.430
 because it is not going well the way it is now 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.990
 is going 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.520
 sometimes short last goal for us we 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.990
 We win four or a year with it 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.289
 with four one 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.669
 this moment I was done with 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.740
 flying we have all that we know 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.419
 we inside a pot with four a mine 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.000
 internet has been stable all the time 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.590
 done least stable that latency was the 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.330
 previous example was some delay 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.380
 but we win we watch that 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.580
 repetitions 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.460
 We see that with over a 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.780
 and then it means that we have the 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.470
 have won the title 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.260
 would you think because we get one yes 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.700
 kind of screen now see the ring 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.950
 it's in the are but the fifa 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.770
 green or that and we get it 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.919
