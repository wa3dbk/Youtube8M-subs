00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.119 

now<00:00:00.719> I'm<00:00:00.900> going<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.110> discuss<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.680> shin<00:00:01.949> lock

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
now I'm going to discuss the shin lock

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.849 
now I'm going to discuss the shin lock
and<00:00:02.659> that<00:00:03.659> first<00:00:03.899> before<00:00:04.080> we<00:00:04.290> get<00:00:04.500> into<00:00:04.740> the

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
and that first before we get into the

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.579 
and that first before we get into the
mechanics<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:06.390> how<00:00:06.450> some<00:00:06.960> people<00:00:07.109> are<00:00:07.319> doing

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
mechanics of how some people are doing

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.339 
mechanics of how some people are doing
it<00:00:07.710> it's<00:00:08.179> how<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.240> can<00:00:09.480> take<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:09.960> make<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
it it's how we can take it up make it a

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.440 
it it's how we can take it up make it a
little<00:00:10.469> more<00:00:10.710> effective<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.240> one<00:00:12.420> of

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
little more effective this is one of

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.879 
little more effective this is one of
those<00:00:12.570> holes<00:00:12.840> especially<00:00:12.990> if<00:00:13.380> it's<00:00:13.500> done<00:00:13.710> from

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
those holes especially if it's done from

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:14.539 
those holes especially if it's done from
behind

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
behind

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.260 
behind
I<00:00:15.080> would<00:00:16.080> never<00:00:16.350> advocate<00:00:16.650> ever<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:18.210> a

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
I would never advocate ever on in a

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.790 
I would never advocate ever on in a
million<00:00:18.600> years<00:00:18.750> purposely<00:00:19.410> allowing

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
million years purposely allowing

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.460 
million years purposely allowing
yourself<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.570> get<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.869> position<00:00:22.140> where

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
yourself to get it in a position where

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.890 
yourself to get it in a position where
somebody's<00:00:22.980> behind<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.570> especially<00:00:24.570> once

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
somebody's behind you especially once

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.650 
somebody's behind you especially once
when<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.619> got<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> chokehold<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:27.180> you're

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
when they got a chokehold on and you're

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.089 
when they got a chokehold on and you're
going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.260> shin<00:00:28.470> Locker

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
going to use this shin Locker

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.150 
going to use this shin Locker
when<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.910> done<00:00:30.090> from<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.300> position<00:00:31.160> it's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
when it's done from that position it's

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.950 
when it's done from that position it's
because<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.640> made<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> blunder<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.480> screwed

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
because you made a blunder you screwed

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
because you made a blunder you screwed
up<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.770> forth<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.239> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
up so on and so forth this is not a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.959 
up so on and so forth this is not a
position<00:00:37.230> where<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> would<00:00:37.739> advocate<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
position where I would advocate you you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.740 
position where I would advocate you you
think<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.360> going

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
think about going

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.139 
think about going
however<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.010> mechanics<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.700> shin<00:00:41.969> lock

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
however the mechanics that the shin lock

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.299 
however the mechanics that the shin lock
could<00:00:42.270> work<00:00:42.510> could<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.200> work<00:00:43.379> from<00:00:43.649> many<00:00:44.100> many

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
could work could be work from many many

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.139 
could work could be work from many many
positions<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> again<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> need<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> sound<00:00:48.000> like

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
positions and again I need to sound like

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.340 
positions and again I need to sound like
I'm<00:00:48.270> plugging<00:00:48.480> products<00:00:48.930> we'll<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> my

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I'm plugging products we'll go to my

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.080 
I'm plugging products we'll go to my
website<00:00:49.559> Cairo<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.460> count<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> ball

started<00:00:51.390> hooking<00:00:51.539> you'll<00:00:51.899> see<00:00:52.110> them<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.500> there

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
started hooking you'll see them on there

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.020 
started hooking you'll see them on there
boy<00:00:55.800> there's<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> lot<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.280> people<00:00:56.460> who<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.850> this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
boy there's a lot of people who do this

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.119 
boy there's a lot of people who do this
wrong<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.109> shame<00:00:58.350> because<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
wrong and it's a shame because it is a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.929 
wrong and it's a shame because it is a
brilliant<00:01:00.680> move<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:05.010> pressure<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
brilliant move and the pressure of the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
brilliant move and the pressure of the
pain<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.689> extraordinary<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.950> we're

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
pain can be extraordinary now we're

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.830 
pain can be extraordinary now we're
going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> we're<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.180> an<00:01:09.510> applied

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
going to we're going to have an applied

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
going to we're going to have an applied
on<00:01:10.049> me<00:01:10.260> first<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> improper<00:01:11.549> way<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:13.580> the

on me first the improper way and the
secret<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.619> once<00:01:16.619> what's<00:01:16.860> happening

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
secret here is once what's happening

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.130 
secret here is once what's happening
here<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> lady's<00:01:18.000> applying<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.600> may<00:01:18.869> look

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
here the lady's applying it may look

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.320 
here the lady's applying it may look
fine<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.799> forget<00:01:20.369> about<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.670> chokes<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.210> all

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
fine now forget about the chokes and all

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.780 
fine now forget about the chokes and all
that<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.310> problem<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.520> there's<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that but the problem here is there's a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
that but the problem here is there's a
lot<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.119> space<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.600> turn<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.080> slightly<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
lot of space if we turn just slightly to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.130 
lot of space if we turn just slightly to
the<00:01:25.619> left<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.659> folks<00:01:27.900> at<00:01:28.049> home

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the left I want I want the folks at home

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.770 
the left I want I want the folks at home
to<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.610> when<00:01:29.610> he's<00:01:29.790> trapping<00:01:30.150> around<00:01:30.390> my

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to see is when he's trapping around my

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.499 
to see is when he's trapping around my
knee<00:01:31.020> area<00:01:31.610> okay<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.329> line

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
knee area okay to do the line

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.780 
knee area okay to do the line
there's<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.740> much<00:01:34.890> space<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.280> okay

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
there's just so much space here okay

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.310 
there's just so much space here okay
regardless<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.540> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> try<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> stay

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
regardless of if I want to try to stay

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.510 
regardless of if I want to try to stay
with<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> children<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.130> how<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.369> would

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
with the children out of how they would

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
with the children out of how they would

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
because of the shin line still can work

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219 
because of the shin line still can work
from<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.610> clinging<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.540> him<00:01:45.689> he's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
from here if I'm clinging to him he's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.020 
from here if I'm clinging to him he's
going<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.560> eventually<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.340> okay<00:01:47.610> he's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
going to eventually get it okay he's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.819 
going to eventually get it okay he's
going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> get<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
going to get it

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.059 
for me before he starts to kill me I'm
going<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.659> discuss<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.229> and<00:03:47.260> describe<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.739> and

going to discuss it and describe it and
then<00:03:48.340> I'm<00:03:48.459> going<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.609> go<00:03:48.909> ahead<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.269> do<00:03:49.359> it

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
then I'm going to go ahead and do it

the ground in into the ground and as
he's<00:03:56.859> pulling<00:03:57.099> up<00:03:57.310> on<00:03:57.459> my<00:03:57.579> toes<00:03:57.819> fire<00:03:58.750> that's

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
he's pulling up on my toes fire that's

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.369 
he's pulling up on my toes fire that's
how<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.799> lot<00:04:00.010> of<00:04:00.040> people<00:04:00.430> do<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.870> but<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:02.049> make<00:04:02.229> it

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
how a lot of people do it but to make it

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.319 
how a lot of people do it but to make it
more<00:04:02.530> effective<00:04:02.889> he's<00:04:03.459> going<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.849> shift<00:04:04.120> with

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
more effective he's going to shift with

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.240 
more effective he's going to shift with
his<00:04:04.479> hips<00:04:04.750> as<00:04:05.260> he's<00:04:05.530> keeping<00:04:05.889> that

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
his hips as he's keeping that

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.670 
his hips as he's keeping that
my<00:04:07.030> thought<00:04:07.300> I'm<00:04:07.510> going<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.720> be<00:04:07.780> out<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.410> my<00:04:08.470> leg

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
my thought I'm going to be out of my leg

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.220 
my thought I'm going to be out of my leg
trap<00:04:09.150> again<00:04:10.150> he's<00:04:10.330> putting<00:04:10.660> his<00:04:10.810> whole<00:04:10.960> body

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
trap again he's putting his whole body

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.470 
trap again he's putting his whole body
weight<00:04:11.500> using<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.280> strength<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.850> its<00:04:13.000> legs<00:04:13.240> as

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
weight using the strength of its legs as

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.480 
weight using the strength of its legs as
he's<00:04:13.660> pulling<00:04:14.020> into<00:04:14.170> driving<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.340> is

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
he's pulling into driving and this is

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.599 
he's pulling into driving and this is
going<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.700> snap<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.260> if<00:04:17.260> he<00:04:17.410> went<00:04:17.590> will<00:04:17.829> in<00:04:18.489> a

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
going to snap it if he went will in a

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.440 
going to snap it if he went will in a
full<00:04:18.850> speed<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:20.140> this<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.680> hook<00:04:21.210> again<00:04:22.210> I

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
full speed so this is a hook again I

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.900 
full speed so this is a hook again I
mean<00:04:22.630> if<00:04:23.320> he<00:04:23.470> went<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.830> park<00:04:24.100> full<00:04:24.520> full

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
mean if he went to a park full full

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.030 
mean if he went to a park full full
board<00:04:25.320> tell<00:04:26.320> my<00:04:26.440> name<00:04:26.590> he<00:04:26.650> would<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.860> telling

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
board tell my name he would be telling

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.440 
board tell my name he would be telling
me<00:04:27.400> it's<00:04:27.490> gonna<00:04:27.550> be<00:04:27.640> broken<00:04:27.910> before<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.300> can

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
me it's gonna be broken before I can

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.870 
me it's gonna be broken before I can
tell<00:04:28.630> me<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:28.990> I'm<00:04:29.050> gonna<00:04:29.260> put<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:29.860> me<00:04:30.010> go

be had you want to basically go right in

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.600 
be had you want to basically go right in
the<00:04:40.840> middle<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.200> calf<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.370> want<00:04:42.520> to

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
the middle of the calf and you want to

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.310 
the middle of the calf and you want to
go<00:04:42.700> right<00:04:42.910> between<00:04:43.060> right<00:04:43.810> where<00:04:44.020> the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
go right between right where the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.460 
go right between right where the

moma in the calf muscle arm right there
you<00:04:47.470> can<00:04:47.650> feel<00:04:47.860> it<00:04:48.010> yourself<00:04:48.130> there<00:04:49.060> are<00:04:49.090> some

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
you can feel it yourself there are some

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.510 
you can feel it yourself there are some
variations<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.410> mean<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.650> can<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:51.010> can<00:04:51.190> very

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
variations I mean you can you can very

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.000 
variations I mean you can you can very
despite<00:04:51.940> you<00:04:52.000> want<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.210> be<00:04:52.300> exactly<00:04:52.750> right<00:04:53.010> but

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
despite you want to be exactly right but

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.140 
despite you want to be exactly right but
the<00:04:54.940> key<00:04:55.630> is<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:56.260> worst<00:04:56.669> mechanics<00:04:57.669> you<00:04:57.880> use

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
the key is the worst mechanics you use

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.540 
the key is the worst mechanics you use
the<00:04:58.600> more<00:04:58.780> precise<00:04:59.230> you<00:04:59.410> have<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.740> be<00:04:59.890> here<00:05:00.220> I

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
the more precise you have to be here I

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.540 
the more precise you have to be here I
like<00:05:01.210> to<00:05:01.360> go<00:05:01.570> for<00:05:02.290> precision<00:05:02.680> just<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.370> begin

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
like to go for precision just to begin

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.980 
like to go for precision just to begin
with<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.990> center<00:05:05.380> of<00:05:05.500> that<00:05:05.680> shin<00:05:06.990> you

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
with and the center of that shin you

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.500 
with and the center of that shin you
know<00:05:08.110> from<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.530> ankle<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.980> the<00:05:09.010> knee<00:05:09.130> is<00:05:09.669> is<00:05:10.090> is

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
know from the ankle to the knee is is is

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.760 
know from the ankle to the knee is is is
where<00:05:10.690> you<00:05:10.810> want<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.080> go<00:05:11.200> for<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:11.680> just

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
where you want to go for it and just

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.380 
where you want to go for it and just
like<00:05:12.610> again<00:05:12.880> pull<00:05:13.390> in<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.820> you're<00:05:15.970> here<00:05:16.180> you're

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
like again pull in so you're here you're

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.390 
like again pull in so you're here you're
you're<00:05:17.320> pulling<00:05:17.680> up<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.979> toes<00:05:18.160> you're

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
you're pulling up the toes you're

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.010 
you're pulling up the toes you're
driving<00:05:18.910> forward<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.390> you're<00:05:19.479> moving<00:05:19.900> with

driving forward and you're moving with

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.080 
driving forward and you're moving with
your<00:05:20.169> hips<00:05:20.380> but<00:05:20.830> as<00:05:21.280> you<00:05:21.550> move<00:05:21.729> in<00:05:21.850> you're

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
your hips but as you move in you're

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.360 
your hips but as you move in you're
keeping<00:05:22.510> all<00:05:22.600> your<00:05:22.780> weight<00:05:22.960> again<00:05:23.680> on<00:05:23.919> the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
keeping all your weight again on the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.070 
keeping all your weight again on the
inner<00:05:24.580> part<00:05:25.120> of<00:05:25.210> my<00:05:25.390> thigh

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
inner part of my thigh

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.760 
inner part of my thigh
trapping<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:27.010> so<00:05:27.430> making<00:05:27.640> a<00:05:27.850> roll<00:05:28.090> out<00:05:28.770> is

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
trapping it so making a roll out is

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.520 
trapping it so making a roll out is
impossible
