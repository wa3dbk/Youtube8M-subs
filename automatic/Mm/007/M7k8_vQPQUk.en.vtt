00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
better than anything that I've seen and

better than anything that I've seen and
all<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.100> other<00:02:10.280> kind<00:02:10.460> of<00:02:10.580> stuff<00:02:10.640> but<00:02:10.940> at<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
all this other kind of stuff but at the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.540 
all this other kind of stuff but at the
same<00:02:11.270> time<00:02:11.680> there's<00:02:12.680> something<00:02:12.860> ironic<00:02:13.430> about

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
same time there's something ironic about

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.030 
same time there's something ironic about
these<00:02:14.300> characters<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.590> don't<00:02:15.830> want

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
these characters and that you don't want

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.430 
these characters and that you don't want
them<00:02:16.190> quite<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.730> real<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.840> uncertain<00:02:18.200> is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
them quite to be real so uncertain is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.020 
them quite to be real so uncertain is
this<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.800> when<00:02:18.950> they<00:02:19.100> are<00:02:19.130> over-the-top<00:02:19.640> you

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
this is when they are over-the-top you

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.480 
this is when they are over-the-top you
like<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> even<00:02:20.450> more

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.670

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.580 
where it's a whole other thing that
takes<00:02:29.400> some<00:02:29.580> adjusting<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.210> get<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.600> example

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
takes some adjusting to get to example

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.059 
takes some adjusting to get to example
just<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.860> simple<00:02:32.250> thing<00:02:32.400> like
