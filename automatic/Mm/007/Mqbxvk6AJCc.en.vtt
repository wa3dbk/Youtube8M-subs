think<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.409> will<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.250> problem<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
think that will be a problem and here is

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
also the YouTube application works well

00:02:32.090 --> 00:03:00.870

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.190 

and<00:03:01.330> here<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.470> gallery<00:03:02.800> application<00:03:07.200> it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
and here is the gallery application it

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:17.940
