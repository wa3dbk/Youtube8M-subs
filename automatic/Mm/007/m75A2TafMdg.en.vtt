00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.369
 our baby carriers the benefits to 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.559
 part of which are used since infants 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.080
 newborns is the kangaroo method in 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.129
 few words can support up to 18 kilos 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.080
 that is up to a baby of about 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.059
 3 years old 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.190
 you can give the evening discreetly is 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.960
 something very different and more versatile because 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.570
 you can use it in more than five 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.879
 positions work with 100% 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.350
 pima cotton we do not work with anyone for 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.510
 be very synthetic because we work 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.110
 directly with a baby and apart from 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.520
 have of these baby carriers are also 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.230
 very good for moms who have had 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.579
 given them by means of a cesarean because 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.170
 makes that having the thong bands and 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.089
 it is distributed evenly in the part 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.950
 from your shoulders apart from this too 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.259
 has something very important that 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.289
 we mentioned to the parents that reinforces what 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.569
 is the attachment bond so is this part 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.210
 of the physical benefits as you say 

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.280
 for the mamis store 2 that 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.290
 and that also suddenly prevents you 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.570
 shoulder discomfort and without figure of 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.030
 neck position are also these 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.810
 Benefits of attachment to tell us about others 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.430
 dads who ask me not him but everything 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.869
 the rest I will be with the baby close 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.270
 but they are small babies that need 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.000
 just have to be close to 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.470
 listen to Mommy's heart and they are 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.690
 babies that have been for nine months 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.690
 in the womb of the mother and therefore 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.310
 they need to have more body heat than 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.229
 mom and dad and also because 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.759
 also the potato uses it and the inah that 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.619
 that's why they look to spoil like that 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.619
 sometimes you think the same so it is 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.230
 in contrast the material is 100% cotton 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.300

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.950

 We have specialized a lot in scarves 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.720

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.550
 I want the baby's name with 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.740
 a design of buoys of some visitors 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.870
 of a pps and maybe the name comes out 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.910
 from fabricio matÃ­as the name happened to 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.360
 the sides and those are just in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.360
 the thumb 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.900

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.210

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.820
 clear scarf that if there are more than five 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.190
 positions is changing less I had going 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.670
 growing we started from the cradle position 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.960
 what you can breastfeed discreetly 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.870
 then we go with the position that is 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.390
 twig which is what we like the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.520
 dads until I also use it well 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.190
 in the traditional position and the 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.959
 traditional at the hip and finally the 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.880
 back so you can also do 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.590
 Do chores with your baby or pour 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.660

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.140
