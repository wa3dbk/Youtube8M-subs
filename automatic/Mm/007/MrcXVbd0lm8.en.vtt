00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:11.789
 hello how are we going to make a recipe 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:15.139
 very easy and that show that it is good 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:18.240
 let's make a breakfast like that for 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.610
 travelers to have for the trip yes 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.820
 then let's make a mix in 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.850
 dry to store a bag and carry it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.850
 of travel for when we want and look 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.510
 let's make a mixture of seeds 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.790
 Chia and raisins and almond then 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.730
 We're going to have half a cup of seed 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.489
 chía a cup of raisins and a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.090
 quarter cup of almonds if we go 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.579
 to flavor with a little clove of cinnamon 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.640
 of smell and cardamom three nuggets of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 cardamom two 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 clove sticks and two 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.500
 teaspoons cinnamon powder 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.350
 we are going to make salt and when everything in 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.079
 dry if we go the same in the blender 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.549
 of house that you all have 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.549
 a day 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.180
 let's put the raisin raisin 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.180
 without seed and we are going to put the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
 almonds 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.900
 the condiments 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.870
 let's 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.250
 very then to said let's say 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.720
 because it warms a little bit and takes out 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.540
 a little more chia oil but nothing 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.090
 So if they have half a warm left 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.250
 let it cool down a bit then once 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.740
 that is cold 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:00.150
 in a cycle the idea is that you 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 have like this in the backpack 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.640
 in a suitcase with they go on a trip or if 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.700
 they have to have a quick breakfast in the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.030
 work is like a breakfast like this half of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.170
 Bell 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.950
 in the places where it is difficult 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.120
 get a breakfast then what 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.120
 they keep there is a bag 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.110
 what they simply make some fruits that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:39.170
 it can be an apple cut in 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.170
 squares a little hand too 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.709
 short 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:51.700
 and if they are geeks like me they can also 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.700
 be according to hand pin so fast 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.250
 and a manzanita that wants to be rich is scratched 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.250
 if it gives an interesting texture 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.990
 yes 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.970
 then good occasion 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.599
 have breakfast from the bag then it gets 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.599
 more or less 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.640
 three tablespoons 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.750
 of the chia seed three or four 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.750
 depends on the hunger they have 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.340
 mix it with a little warm water 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.959
 or cold water what they like most 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.959
 but a little warm water 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.580
 so more warm 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.099
 and mix well to dilute 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.330
 although they can throw a grated apple 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.930
 they throw me the mañanitas 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.000
 and a few apples and they have simply 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.600
 with having a little water on hand 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.610
 hot and some fruits 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.540
 you can already do anywhere 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.739
 powerful nutritious breakfast 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.739
 and nothing and fast 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.590
 Enjoy your breakfasts even when 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.220
 they are traveling see you next 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.220
