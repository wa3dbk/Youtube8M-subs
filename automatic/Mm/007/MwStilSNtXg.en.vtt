00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.089
 mingozzi are here with the new ones of succivo 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.980
 today we were practically teaching you 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.740
 like so many players do 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 those teams that are worth millions 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.580
 millions of credits but before 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.820
 start the monster all the changes of 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.140
 role that issued yesterday with a value of 5000 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.720
 finely raga for those who did not know 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.580
 I lied to all the players who 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.260
 common with the video practically I say 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.900
 this video I put put and ronaldo 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.320
 ibrahimovic at the minimum price I tell him 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 the time my writings and of course the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.250
 I give you the opportunity to buy at the price 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.010
 minimum this player you put yesterday 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.290
 from this guy came the idea of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.120
 make a park that ing where everything 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.129
 what I find I put at the price 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.559
 minimum, however, it is not that I find myself 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.719
 ronaldo in that moment like the mind the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.360
 minimum price however I inform you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.910
 then I say the day after tomorrow guys there 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.600
 I put at the minimum price and you after tomorrow 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.399
 at 9 for example go and searched and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.789
 ronaldo at the minimum price and nothing though 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.670
 however to judge everything here also vi 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.760
 I remember that this evening at 9pm I put it on 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.979
 doumbia rose doumbia oscar then to the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.330
 above to be in g minimum then mi 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.970
 I recommend I want so many for 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.400
 buy it anyway we come 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.210
 to the topic of the day you are 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.390
 watching this video 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.640
 so like so many people do 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.790
 players to make millions of credits 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.860
 to say then the answer is only one 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.750
 buying and selling the thing 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.329
 more effective to make millions and millions 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.930
 of credits if you want to calculate we need 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.970
 the beauty of 6 thousand games at 400 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.380
 credits to buy a Christian 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.290
 ronaldo or messi 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.350
 we will never leave 6,000 of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.149
 year round guys don't even have 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.149
 not even a thousand not made as you can 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.950
 see from my historian so it is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.350
 obligatory to make the sale if 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.930
 you don't want to shock then there are two 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.329
 ways of doing with presale 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.250
 buying and selling for the price with the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.439
 Buy now and trading with 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.820
 offers which I now show you this with 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.590
 myself 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.119
 I buy gold practically boys 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.880
 let us look for a player for example 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.290
 boateng then there are targeted players for 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.330
 make the purchase so if not 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.120
 know if you can't make trades 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.370
 I suggest you rely on youtuber that 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.209
 there is a lot of buying and selling 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.040
 as areas I am, etc. 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.720
 practically we pass to us there are like 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.790
 said there are two ways to buy now 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.080
 and for the current offer 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.360
 the best is that of buying gold 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.810
 those I'm showing you now ago 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.600
 well rhyme but oh well now we have this 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.560
 giron player boateng defender of the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.450
 Bayern Monaco 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.390
 as you can see above the trench 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.580
 minimum of 7900 we must 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.739
 look for it for a price lower than 7 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.690
 thousand 9 15 flight we seek the 7 2004 7500 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.790
 7400 7500 week 4 on the team the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.140
 added we will have to do so quickly 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.820
 when he doesn't come out, he does n't come out on 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.080
 player at this price I felt 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.480
 practically guys we always do 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.190
 so not by varying the maximum price 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.190
 now I will never find it 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.720
 ok let's move to the more gettonato method 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.420
 from those who delight in making trades 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.820
 then practically where you will have to do 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.380
 anything else that can make you an offer to a 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.829
 player type know with silva le 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.500
 console ends 5 make the offer of 3 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.870
 However, 3,000 are judged to sell it 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.030
 at 3500 everything here and calculates dredge 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.780
 only with one player will you succeed in 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.000
 earn the money you make a 15 minutes 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.370
 for a game to take I have 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.110
 also earned 300 thousand with one 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.180
 player doing trades but 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.500
 those are purchase details 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.530
 very advanced 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.440
 over time you will learn to do another 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.900
 trick that I reveal raga but it is not 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.660
 always working and practically 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.579
 but now I teach there are these 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.860
 accent packages these parking lots 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:05.230
 silver sometimes come out kind of players 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.550
 which are very rare that are not there 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.459
 in this case type has not even come out 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.019
 but a gold player is worse when c 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.879
 is on the gold player must exit 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.700
 silver players now go well that 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.190
 sent to the club I was wrong though 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.010
 do type comparison to price see the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.530
 their maximum price is based on that 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.669
 of these 150 and there are not even two 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.500
 pages of this player 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.240
 which means this player is 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.580
 very rare 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.430
 everything here enters look at the price 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.979
 maximum and this type the maximum price 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.380
 500 but you can put it very well 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.910
 700 this player 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.860
 I felt not if they take it to the first 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.510
 shot on the second shot on the third shot if 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.680
 they will surely take it on the fourth 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.190
 anyway it was I hope this video there 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.630
 both liked it 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.120
 I as usual invite you to leave a 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.500
 nice I like and invite you to join if 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.150
 He has not yet entered here by a 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.169
 gaming and everything we do tomorrow with a 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.169
 another beautiful air
