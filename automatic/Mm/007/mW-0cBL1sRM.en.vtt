with them an exacto knife or something

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.819 
with them an exacto knife or something
um<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.430> might<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.989> nice<00:00:58.230> slips

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
um I think I might like the nice slips

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.910 
um I think I might like the nice slips
so<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.210> i<00:01:00.300> mighta<00:01:00.329> cut<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> wire<00:01:01.140> but

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so I think i mighta cut a wire but

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.000 
so I think i mighta cut a wire but
nothing<00:01:02.730> seemed<00:01:03.149> damaged<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.890> like

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
nothing seemed damaged so I was like

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
nothing seemed damaged so I was like
okay<00:01:05.189> let's<00:01:05.519> go<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.390> um<00:01:08.600> but<00:01:10.760> now<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
okay let's go on this um but now as you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.980 
okay let's go on this um but now as you
can<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.729> looking<00:01:15.920> um<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.990> don't

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
can see that is not looking um and don't

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.249 
can see that is not looking um and don't
suggest<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.890> d-pad<00:01:20.310> sensor<00:01:20.930> because<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
suggest the d-pad sensor because I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.190 
suggest the d-pad sensor because I
bought<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.950> new<00:01:23.280> d<00:01:23.460> pad<00:01:23.700> sensor<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.420> ebay<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
bought a new d pad sensor on ebay and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.740 
bought a new d pad sensor on ebay and
spent<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.250> whole<00:01:26.670> 20<00:01:27.090> minutes<00:01:27.390> installing

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
spent like a whole 20 minutes installing

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.190 
spent like a whole 20 minutes installing
that<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.460> that<00:01:29.460> didn't<00:01:29.880> work<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.360> i<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.990> i

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that and that didn't work so i think i

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.620 
that and that didn't work so i think i
might<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.500> messed<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:32.400> my<00:01:33.329> um<00:01:35.540> there's<00:01:36.540> this

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
might have messed up my um there's this

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.990 
might have messed up my um there's this
little<00:01:36.900> slot<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.740> holds<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.280> deep<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.700> sit

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000

motherboard because i don't know it's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
motherboard because i don't know it's
either<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.659> motherboard<00:01:49.200> itself<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
either the motherboard itself for that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340

little slot holding the d-pad since we i

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.620 
little slot holding the d-pad since we i
have<00:01:53.009> no<00:01:53.220> idea<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:54.829> i<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.329> something

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
d-pad sensor well i changed it and it's

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.260 
d-pad sensor well i changed it and it's
pretty<00:02:04.740> much<00:02:04.950> blind

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.770 

um<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.530> was<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.709> brand<00:02:09.039> new<00:02:09.190> d-pad<00:02:09.580> center<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.410> uh

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
um it was a brand new d-pad center so uh

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.530 
um it was a brand new d-pad center so uh
I'm<00:02:13.780> not<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.610> buy<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> new<00:02:16.330> nut

I'm not going to buy a new nut
motherboard<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.610> would<00:02:18.610> just<00:02:18.849> be<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
motherboard that would just be a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.180 
motherboard that would just be a
complete<00:02:19.540> waste<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:19.959> money<00:02:20.110> I've<00:02:20.830> had<00:02:21.010> this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
PSP for a while so I guess the good news

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.259 
PSP for a while so I guess the good news
is<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.349> have<00:02:29.769> like<00:02:30.190> forty<00:02:30.730> dollars<00:02:31.060> in

gamestop credit and I have a lot of

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.449 
gamestop credit and I have a lot of
money<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.930> I'm<00:02:37.930> probably<00:02:38.140> going<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.530> buy<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:39.040> PSP
