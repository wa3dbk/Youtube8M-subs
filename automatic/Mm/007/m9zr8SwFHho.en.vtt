organic organism
we'll<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.559> watering<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.960> then<00:00:36.960> we

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
we'll be watering that in and then we

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
we'll be watering that in and then we
have<00:00:39.110> iron<00:00:40.110> phosphate<00:00:40.800> basically<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.520> what

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
have iron phosphate basically is what

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
have iron phosphate basically is what
this<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> simply<00:00:43.020> iron<00:00:43.260> phosphate

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
this is this is a simply iron phosphate

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.240 
this is this is a simply iron phosphate
that<00:00:43.890> kills<00:00:44.340> snails<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.180> slugs<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.770> next

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that kills snails and slugs and the next

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.420 
that kills snails and slugs and the next
is<00:00:47.430> diatomaceous<00:00:48.239> earth<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> very

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
is diatomaceous earth this is a very

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.110 
is diatomaceous earth this is a very
fine<00:00:50.730> powder<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:52.050> scrapes<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.250> bellies<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
fine powder that scrapes the bellies of

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.110 
fine powder that scrapes the bellies of
any<00:00:54.600> insect<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.699> crosses<00:00:56.699> over<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
any insect that crosses over it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.360 
any insect that crosses over it
including<00:00:57.600> earwigs

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370

water in here and I'm going to put a cap
full<00:01:24.060> let's<00:01:25.049> find<00:01:25.259> us<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.560> into<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.299> it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
full let's find us out into here it's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.120 
full let's find us out into here it's
completely<00:01:27.420> non-toxic<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.799> worried

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
completely non-toxic so I'm not worried

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.330 
completely non-toxic so I'm not worried
about<00:01:29.159> using<00:01:29.640> gloves<00:01:30.619> mix<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.189> I'm

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
about using gloves mix it in and now I'm

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670 
about using gloves mix it in and now I'm
going<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.790> simply<00:01:33.210> water<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.350> leaves

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
going to simply water it on the leaves

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.420 
going to simply water it on the leaves
on<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.189> foliage<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.780> plants<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
on the foliage of my plants so that the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
on the foliage of my plants so that the
worms<00:01:38.930> will<00:01:39.930> eat<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.100> die<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:42.600> does<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
worms will eat it and die it does have a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530 
worms will eat it and die it does have a
residual<00:01:43.560> effect<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> will<00:01:44.369> stay<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.670> after

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
residual effect so it will stay on after

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.080 
residual effect so it will stay on after
a<00:01:45.570> rain<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.009> happen<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> notice<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.850> white

allergic reaction to iron phosphate and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.700 
allergic reaction to iron phosphate and
I<00:02:05.460> throw<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.850> throughout<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> garden<00:02:07.380> because

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
I throw it throughout the garden because

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
I throw it throughout the garden because
snails<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> slugs<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:09.030> live<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.330> leaves<00:02:09.660> of

snails and slugs can live on leaves of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.199 
snails and slugs can live on leaves of
plants<00:02:10.459> then<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.239> other<00:02:12.629> pests<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
plants then we have other pests in the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.089 
plants then we have other pests in the
and<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.420> used<00:02:15.689> the<00:02:15.840> diatomaceous<00:02:16.230> earth<00:02:16.319> for

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
and I used the diatomaceous earth for

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.899 
and I used the diatomaceous earth for
that<00:02:17.900> diatomaceous<00:02:18.900> earth<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.739> for<00:02:20.189> ants<00:02:20.430> and

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
that diatomaceous earth is for ants and

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.410 
that diatomaceous earth is for ants and
