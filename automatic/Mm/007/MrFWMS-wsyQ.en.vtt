00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
it is indicated for those fine lines and

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.950 
it is indicated for those fine lines and
you<00:06:39.790> can<00:06:39.940> use<00:06:40.060> it<00:06:40.180> for<00:06:40.270> the<00:06:40.390> entire<00:06:40.510> face

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960
