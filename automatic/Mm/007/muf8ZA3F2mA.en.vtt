to<00:00:05.130> understand<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:05.880> can<00:00:06.060> better<00:00:06.330> feed

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
to understand how we can better feed

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.440 
to understand how we can better feed
cows<00:00:06.990> it<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.889> key<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.189> having<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.910> basic

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
cows it is key to having a basic

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.270 
cows it is key to having a basic
understanding<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:10.110> how<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.349> rumen<00:00:10.889> actually

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
understanding of how the rumen actually

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.600 
understanding of how the rumen actually
works<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:12.570> I've<00:00:12.690> drawn<00:00:13.049> up<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.379> rough<00:00:13.769> rumen<00:00:14.249> you

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
works so I've drawn up a rough rumen you

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.359 
works so I've drawn up a rough rumen you
can<00:00:14.759> see<00:00:14.999> that<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> cows<00:00:16.200> got<00:00:16.470> consists

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
can see that that the cows got consists

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.790 
can see that that the cows got consists
of<00:00:17.460> four<00:00:17.760> main<00:00:18.090> compartments<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> room

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
of four main compartments with the room

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.439 
of four main compartments with the room
and<00:00:20.010> being<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.369> largest<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.420> largest

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and being the largest the largest

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.320 
and being the largest the largest
compartment<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.619> feeds<00:00:23.310> directly<00:00:23.519> into<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
compartment it feeds directly into the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.040 
compartment it feeds directly into the
reticulum

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
reticulum

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.560 
reticulum
so<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> reticulum<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.189> actually<00:00:26.550> still<00:00:26.880> part

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
so the reticulum is actually still part

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.929 
so the reticulum is actually still part
of<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.750> same<00:00:27.960> chamber<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.949> rumen<00:00:29.310> but

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
of the same chamber as the rumen but

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.600 
of the same chamber as the rumen but
performs<00:00:30.359> slightly<00:00:31.019> specialized<00:00:31.529> draw<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
performs slightly specialized draw the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
performs slightly specialized draw the
reticulum<00:00:33.150> feeds<00:00:33.420> into<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.930> Mason<00:00:34.260> which

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
reticulum feeds into the I Mason which

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
reticulum feeds into the I Mason which
then<00:00:35.400> feeds<00:00:35.670> through<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> other<00:00:36.360> Mason

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
then feeds through to the other Mason

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
then feeds through to the other Mason
now<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> upper<00:00:37.800> Mason<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> true

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
now the upper Mason is like a true

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
now the upper Mason is like a true
stomach<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> stomach<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> human

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
stomach it's like the stomach of a human

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.610 
stomach it's like the stomach of a human
or<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.370> stomach<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> monogastric<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.469> where

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
or the stomach of a monogastric to where

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.799 
or the stomach of a monogastric to where
there<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.280> digestive<00:00:44.820> juices<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.420> acids

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
there are digestive juices and acids

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
there are digestive juices and acids
secreted<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> true<00:00:47.370> site<00:00:47.610> for

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
secreted and it's the true site for

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.180 
secreted and it's the true site for
digestion<00:00:48.649> what<00:00:49.649> we're<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:49.980> concerned

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
digestion what we're more concerned

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.849 
digestion what we're more concerned
about<00:00:50.430> today<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:52.020> role<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.500> rumen

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
about today is the role that the rumen

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:54.680 
about today is the role that the rumen
plays<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> fermentation<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.270> occurs

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
plays and the fermentation that occurs

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.290 
plays and the fermentation that occurs
in<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:56.519> if<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> look<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> room

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
in here so if we have a look at the room

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.110 
in here so if we have a look at the room
to<00:00:58.019> a<00:00:58.050> liquid<00:00:58.440> phase<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> bottom<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.640> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to a liquid phase down the bottom and a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
to a liquid phase down the bottom and a
gas<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.600> gaspé<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.649> sitting<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:01.980> above<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
gas for gaspé is sitting up above and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
gas for gaspé is sitting up above and
there's<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.300> fiber<00:01:03.570> raft<00:01:03.929> that<00:01:04.230> sits<00:01:04.590> along<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
there's a fiber raft that sits along the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.160 
there's a fiber raft that sits along the
top<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.340> that<00:01:05.970> liquid<00:01:06.180> phase<00:01:06.510> floats<00:01:06.870> on

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
top of that that liquid phase floats on

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.240 
top of that that liquid phase floats on
the<00:01:07.380> liquid<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.799> like

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the liquid if you like

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730 
the liquid if you like
now<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> v<00:01:09.090> erupted<00:01:09.450> plays<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> couple<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> key

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
now this v erupted plays a couple of key

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.310 
now this v erupted plays a couple of key
roles<00:01:11.009> one<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.119> food<00:01:12.420> from<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> mouth

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
roles one is that food from the mouth

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
roles one is that food from the mouth
tends<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.009> trapped<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.759> from<00:01:15.509> there

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
tends to get trapped here and from there

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.600 
tends to get trapped here and from there
the<00:01:16.259> bacteria<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:17.009> jump<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the bacteria can jump on it and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.960 
the bacteria can jump on it and
fermentation<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.420> probably<00:01:18.689> properly<00:01:19.680> begin

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
fermentation can probably properly begin

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.179 
fermentation can probably properly begin
the<00:01:20.970> second<00:01:21.329> thing<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.869> room<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.710> fiber

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the second thing the room the fiber

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
the second thing the room the fiber
actually<00:01:23.490> helps<00:01:23.880> scratch<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.689> wall<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
actually helps scratch the wall of the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.859 
actually helps scratch the wall of the
rumen<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.220> room<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.549> will<00:01:26.640> contract<00:01:27.090> now

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
rumen and the room and will contract now

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
rumen and the room and will contract now
you<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> Romans<00:01:28.770> sort<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.250> split

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you see that the Romans sort of split

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.090 
you see that the Romans sort of split
into<00:01:29.729> sacks<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.509> these<00:01:31.140> sacks<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.619> divided

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
into sacks and these sacks are divided

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.980 
into sacks and these sacks are divided
by<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:32.850> call<00:01:33.030> pillars<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
by what they call pillars and it's the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
by what they call pillars and it's the
shortening<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> these<00:01:34.799> pillars<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
shortening of these pillars that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.149 
shortening of these pillars that
actually<00:01:36.210> cause<00:01:36.390> contractions<00:01:37.159> so

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
actually cause contractions so

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.830 
actually cause contractions so
contractions<00:01:38.700> generally<00:01:39.180> start<00:01:39.479> from<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
contractions generally start from the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.380 
contractions generally start from the
bottom<00:01:40.079> left<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.799> move<00:01:41.490> upwards<00:01:42.180> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
bottom left here and move upwards that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.410 
bottom left here and move upwards that
way<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> look<00:01:44.220> at<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.820> bolus<00:01:45.270> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
way so if we have a look at a bolus of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
way so if we have a look at a bolus of
food<00:01:45.659> which<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.229> chewed-up<00:01:46.469> full<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> food

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
food which is a chewed-up full of food

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.539 
food which is a chewed-up full of food
will<00:01:48.119> come<00:01:48.299> from<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> mouth<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.049> come<00:01:49.290> down

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
will come from the mouth and come down

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.600 
will come from the mouth and come down

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
and gets lodged in the fiber raft here

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
and gets lodged in the fiber raft here
when<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> rumen<00:01:54.119> contracts<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.500> will

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
when the rumen contracts it will

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
when the rumen contracts it will
actually<00:01:56.040> lift<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.759> liquid<00:01:57.149> phase<00:01:57.180> there's

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
actually lift this liquid phase there's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480 
actually lift this liquid phase there's
less<00:01:57.930> space<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.680> liquid<00:01:58.950> all<00:01:59.189> moves

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
less space here so the liquid all moves

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.630 
less space here so the liquid all moves
up<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.329> effectively<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.649> bolus<00:02:02.039> is<00:02:02.219> dunked

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
up and effectively that bolus is dunked

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.510 
up and effectively that bolus is dunked
into<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.390> liquid<00:02:03.570> part<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> Roman<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
into the liquid part of the Roman the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.069 
into the liquid part of the Roman the
liquid<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.090> where<00:02:06.420> most<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
liquid is actually where most the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
microbes within the rumen lives a few

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.230 
microbes within the rumen lives a few
will<00:02:10.320> live<00:02:10.530> along<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.740> wall

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
will live along the wall

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.970 
will live along the wall
since<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.600> in<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.810> fiber<00:02:12.020> but<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.650> majority

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
since it in the fiber but the majority

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.650 
since it in the fiber but the majority
of<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.370> microflora<00:02:13.970> are<00:02:14.090> here<00:02:14.360> within<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
of the microflora are here within the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.510 
of the microflora are here within the
liquid<00:02:14.810> phase<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:15.980> will<00:02:16.310> include

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
liquid phase so this will include

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.490

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.200 
bacteria protozoa funghi the bacteria
will<00:02:23.440> basically<00:02:24.440> jump<00:02:25.370> onto<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.730> food<00:02:25.940> and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
will basically jump onto the food and

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.470 
will basically jump onto the food and
begin<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.290> process<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.740> fermentation<00:02:28.480> now

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
begin the process of fermentation now

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.960 
begin the process of fermentation now
when<00:02:29.660> they<00:02:29.810> ferment<00:02:30.080> any<00:02:30.830> carbohydrates<00:02:31.700> or

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
when they ferment any carbohydrates or

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.940 
when they ferment any carbohydrates or
what<00:02:32.150> we<00:02:32.270> think<00:02:32.300> of<00:02:32.570> as<00:02:32.630> energy<00:02:33.620> within<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
food is turned into volatile fatty acids

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.440 
food is turned into volatile fatty acids
which<00:02:40.010> are<00:02:40.160> actually<00:02:40.490> metabolizable<00:02:41.270> energy

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
which are actually metabolizable energy

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.690 
which are actually metabolizable energy
for<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.020> cow<00:02:42.260> these<00:02:42.890> are<00:02:43.130> absorbed<00:02:43.580> through

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
for the cow these are absorbed through

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.240 
for the cow these are absorbed through
the<00:02:43.880> room<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.240> wall<00:02:44.570> primarily<00:02:45.230> they<00:02:46.100> will

the room and wall primarily they will

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.650 
the room and wall primarily they will
also<00:02:47.110> reshuffle<00:02:48.110> protein<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.090> break<00:02:50.510> it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
also reshuffle protein and and break it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.200 
also reshuffle protein and and break it
down<00:02:50.690> into<00:02:50.840> amino<00:02:51.410> acids<00:02:52.240> woops<00:02:53.710> amino<00:02:54.710> acids

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.210 
down into amino acids woops amino acids
and<00:02:56.210> ammonia<00:02:59.200> ammonia<00:03:00.200> can<00:03:00.410> also<00:03:00.560> be<00:03:00.860> absorbed

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
and ammonia ammonia can also be absorbed

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.580 
and ammonia ammonia can also be absorbed
through<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.490> room<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:01.760> wall<00:03:02.030> here<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:03.350> amino

through the room and wall here the amino

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.770 
through the room and wall here the amino
acids<00:03:04.040> are<00:03:04.610> basically<00:03:05.090> used<00:03:05.360> for<00:03:05.540> their<00:03:05.660> own

reshuffle<00:03:08.270> them<00:03:08.420> into<00:03:08.810> sequences<00:03:09.140> think<00:03:09.710> that

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
reshuffle them into sequences think that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.820 
reshuffle them into sequences think that
they<00:03:10.550> need<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.150> they<00:03:11.810> themselves<00:03:12.260> will

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
they need and they themselves will

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.100 
they need and they themselves will
reproduce<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.670> grow

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
reproduce and grow

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.810 
reproduce and grow
now<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.170> bugs<00:03:15.470> play<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:16.070> very<00:03:16.370> important<00:03:16.790> role

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
now the bugs play a very important role

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.540 
now the bugs play a very important role
in<00:03:16.940> all<00:03:17.150> these<00:03:17.300> from<00:03:17.570> all<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:18.110> fermentation

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
in all these from all this fermentation

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.330 
in all these from all this fermentation
but<00:03:19.550> they<00:03:19.670> play<00:03:20.380> equally<00:03:21.380> or<00:03:21.530> or<00:03:21.770> perhaps<00:03:21.980> even

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
but they play equally or or perhaps even

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.580 
but they play equally or or perhaps even
greater<00:03:22.580> importance<00:03:23.210> in<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.900> fact<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.230> they

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
greater importance in the fact that they

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.670 
greater importance in the fact that they
themselves<00:03:25.240> become<00:03:26.240> food<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.750> cow<00:03:26.960> so

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
themselves become food for the cow so

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.950 
themselves become food for the cow so
when<00:03:27.890> when<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.550> rumen<00:03:28.850> contracts<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.630> this

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
when when the rumen contracts and this

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.120 
when when the rumen contracts and this
liquid<00:03:30.350> phase<00:03:30.640> lifts<00:03:31.640> up<00:03:31.820> not<00:03:32.420> only<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.750> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
liquid phase lifts up not only is the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.340 
liquid phase lifts up not only is the
food<00:03:34.130> bolus<00:03:34.430> dunked<00:03:35.000> but<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.720> lot<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.050> liquid

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
food bolus dunked but a lot of liquid

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.780 
food bolus dunked but a lot of liquid
will<00:03:36.500> actually<00:03:36.830> escape<00:03:37.190> through<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.700> the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
will actually escape through to the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.630 
will actually escape through to the
reticulum<00:03:38.650> now<00:03:39.650> as<00:03:39.710> I<00:03:39.890> said<00:03:39.950> before<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
reticulum now as I said before the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.940 
reticulum now as I said before the
reticulum<00:03:41.210> is<00:03:41.420> part<00:03:41.900> of<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:42.110> same<00:03:42.350> chamber<00:03:42.680> as

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
reticulum is part of the same chamber as

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.790 
reticulum is part of the same chamber as
the<00:03:43.160> rumen<00:03:43.520> but<00:03:44.090> its<00:03:44.240> role<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.870> actually<00:03:45.500> to

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
the rumen but its role is actually to

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.070 
the rumen but its role is actually to
act<00:03:45.920> as<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.100> bit<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.430> filter<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.660> anything

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
act as a bit of a filter so anything

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.140 
act as a bit of a filter so anything
that<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.260> small<00:03:48.710> enough<00:03:48.890> will<00:03:49.670> make<00:03:49.850> its<00:03:50.030> way

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
that is small enough will make its way

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.790 
that is small enough will make its way
through<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.540> reticulum<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.230> into<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.770> Oh
