main components of the actual exhausting
station<00:00:54.680> from<00:00:55.100> here<00:00:55.309> this<00:00:55.430> can<00:00:55.579> be<00:00:55.670> a<00:00:55.730> tabletop

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
station from here this can be a tabletop

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.270 
station from here this can be a tabletop
unit<00:00:56.480> we<00:00:56.989> have<00:00:57.110> leg<00:00:57.380> mounts<00:00:57.710> on<00:00:57.800> this<00:00:57.950> one<00:00:58.129> and

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
unit we have leg mounts on this one and

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.760 
unit we have leg mounts on this one and
we<00:00:58.340> have<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.850> gun<00:00:59.120> stand<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.200> this<00:01:00.379> is<00:01:00.500> great

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
we have a gun stand so this is great

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.049 
we have a gun stand so this is great
because<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:01.100> keeps<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.370> gun<00:01:01.550> out<00:01:01.700> of<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.910> way

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
because it keeps the gun out of the way

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.970 
because it keeps the gun out of the way
and<00:01:02.300> it's<00:01:02.960> actually<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.320> lot<00:01:03.410> easier<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.829> use

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
and it's actually a lot easier to use

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.830 
and it's actually a lot easier to use
this<00:01:04.100> way<00:01:04.280> basically<00:01:04.789> how<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:04.999> works<00:01:05.059> is<00:01:05.479> it

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
this way basically how this works is it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.719 
this way basically how this works is it
has<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.079> metal<00:01:06.350> grid<00:01:06.679> we've<00:01:06.889> actually<00:01:07.039> put<00:01:07.520> some

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
has a metal grid we've actually put some

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.179 
has a metal grid we've actually put some
a<00:01:07.880> very<00:01:08.179> coarse<00:01:08.600> mesh<00:01:08.990> over<00:01:09.259> that<00:01:09.380> as<00:01:09.530> well<00:01:09.740> to

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:11.959 
keep the shirt up on top of that grid

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.480 
keep the shirt up on top of that grid
you're<00:01:12.409> going<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.619> put<00:01:12.829> your<00:01:12.950> shirt<00:01:13.219> or<00:01:13.429> your
