00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you do this now this is a 64 gigabyte

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.689 
you do this now this is a 64 gigabyte
variant<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.989> gold<00:00:57.989> s6<00:00:58.469> edge<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.550> see

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
variant I gold s6 edge and you can see

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.959 
variant I gold s6 edge and you can see
here<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> got<00:01:00.059> 42<00:01:00.480> gigs<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.899> available<00:01:01.350> storage

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
here I got 42 gigs of available storage

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.690 
here I got 42 gigs of available storage
and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.989> USB<00:01:04.379> OTG<00:01:04.739> storage<00:01:05.549> it's

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and then I have USB OTG storage it's

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.429 
and then I have USB OTG storage it's
almost<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> micro<00:01:06.450> SD<00:01:06.750> card<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.260> guys

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
almost like a micro SD card for you guys

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.080 
almost like a micro SD card for you guys
that<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.680> missing<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.189> micro<00:01:08.520> SD<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that are missing that micro SD and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
that are missing that micro SD and
basically<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> does<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.770> says<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.010> have

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
basically what it does is it says I have

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.480 
basically what it does is it says I have
almost<00:01:11.640> 20<00:01:11.880> gigabytes<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.450> available<00:01:12.930> storage

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
almost 20 gigabytes of available storage

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
almost 20 gigabytes of available storage
so<00:01:14.490> basically<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.630> I'll<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.560> like

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so basically what I do is I'll get like

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.920 
so basically what I do is I'll get like
a<00:01:16.740> piece<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.310> velcro<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.360> sticky<00:01:18.750> velcro

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
a piece of velcro like sticky velcro

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.719 
a piece of velcro like sticky velcro
whatnot<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> case<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.189> stick<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> on

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
whatnot for a case like this stick it on

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
whatnot for a case like this stick it on
here<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.750> stick<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.140> right<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.470> there

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
here and then stick this right on there

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
here and then stick this right on there
okay<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.820> gonna<00:01:23.970> interfere<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.479> my

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
okay it's not gonna interfere with my

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
okay it's not gonna interfere with my
camera<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.380> shot<00:01:25.710> how<00:01:26.100> I'm<00:01:26.250> holding<00:01:26.430> it
