00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
in it just enough to catch it with my

deeper<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.149> hole<00:01:27.179> the<00:01:27.539> easier<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
deeper the hole the easier it will be to

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.300 
deeper the hole the easier it will be to
get<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.859> clip<00:01:29.070> off<00:01:29.249> if<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:31.310> decent

sized<00:01:32.490> hole<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> way<00:01:33.479> through<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.409> can

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
sized hole all the way through you can

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800 
sized hole all the way through you can
use<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.039> pointy<00:01:35.460> nail<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> clip<00:01:36.659> off

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
use a pointy nail to get the clip off

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.989 
use a pointy nail to get the clip off
fairly<00:01:37.109> easily<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.429> I<00:01:38.579> had<00:01:38.789> made<00:01:38.969> to

trouble because my drill wasn't sharp
and<00:01:42.179> I<00:01:42.240> couldn't<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> depth<00:01:44.039> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and I couldn't get in to the depth that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.690 
and I couldn't get in to the depth that
I<00:01:44.310> needed

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I needed

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.929 
I needed
I<00:01:45.380> even<00:01:46.380> tried<00:01:46.590> using<00:01:46.859> a<00:01:47.039> dremel<00:01:47.280> tool<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
I even tried using a dremel tool and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.580 
I even tried using a dremel tool and
that<00:01:48.060> doesn't<00:01:48.420> hardly<00:01:48.929> even<00:01:48.990> touches<00:01:49.499> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that doesn't hardly even touches it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.999 
that doesn't hardly even touches it
either

just inside the lip here there's a small
clip<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.090> see<00:02:51.270> one<00:02:51.480> end<00:02:51.660> there<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
clip you can just see one end there and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.840 
clip you can just see one end there and
the<00:02:52.290> other<00:02:52.410> end<00:02:52.680> there<00:02:54.080> this<00:02:55.220> clip<00:02:56.220> holds<00:02:56.670> the

the other end there this clip holds the
whole<00:02:57.030> assembly<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.680> then<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.430> ends<00:02:59.790> are

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
whole assembly so then the ends are

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.910 
whole assembly so then the ends are
