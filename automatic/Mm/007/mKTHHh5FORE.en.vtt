00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that now inside this a second pocket

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.999 
that now inside this a second pocket
here<00:01:28.229> we've<00:01:28.680> got<00:01:28.920> another<00:01:29.430> pocket<00:01:30.049> which<00:01:31.049> just

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
here we've got another pocket which just

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.940 
here we've got another pocket which just
opens<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.640> its<00:01:33.150> fairly<00:01:33.450> deep<00:01:33.750> same<00:01:34.560> depth<00:01:34.860> as

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
opens up its fairly deep same depth as

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.190 
opens up its fairly deep same depth as
this<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> goes<00:01:37.020> down

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this one right here so it goes down

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.679 
this one right here so it goes down
pretty<00:01:37.380> far<00:01:37.650> however<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.909> fairly<00:01:39.390> tight

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
pretty far however it is a fairly tight

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.910 
pretty far however it is a fairly tight
fit<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.229> won't<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.590> able<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> get

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
fit so you won't be able to get

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
fit so you won't be able to get
something<00:01:41.100> big<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.520> bulky<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:42.030> there<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.869> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
something big and bulky in there but it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.480 
something big and bulky in there but it
