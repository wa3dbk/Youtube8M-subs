attached to this peg before you start

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.830 
attached to this peg before you start
tuning<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> make<00:00:24.000> sure<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.689> your

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
tuning you want to make sure that your

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.520 
tuning you want to make sure that your
tuner<00:00:25.169> is<00:00:25.349> calibrated<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:25.980> 440

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.950 

start<00:00:30.520> by<00:00:30.670> playing<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.330> a<00:00:31.360> string<00:00:31.810> and

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
start by playing the a string and

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.900 
start by playing the a string and
checking<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.710> make<00:00:32.740> sure<00:00:32.920> that<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.490> needle<00:00:33.820> on

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
checking to make sure that the needle on

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.090 
checking to make sure that the needle on
the<00:00:33.970> tuner<00:00:34.390> is<00:00:34.540> pointing<00:00:35.320> towards<00:00:35.770> the<00:00:35.950> middle

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
the tuner is pointing towards the middle

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.939 
the tuner is pointing towards the middle
and<00:00:36.310> the<00:00:36.490> green<00:00:36.700> light<00:00:36.880> will<00:00:37.060> come<00:00:37.090> on

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.979 

now<00:00:42.949> my<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.160> string<00:00:43.610> is<00:00:43.760> very<00:00:44.030> flat<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:44.809> what<00:00:44.960> I

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
now my a string is very flat so what I

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.319 
now my a string is very flat so what I
need<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.260> do<00:00:45.530> is<00:00:45.739> turn<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.399> tuning<00:00:46.730> peg<00:00:46.910> to

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
need to do is turn the tuning peg to

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:56.020 
need to do is turn the tuning peg to
make<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.629> string<00:00:47.899> higher

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.369 

when<00:00:57.030> you're<00:00:57.210> tuning<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.839> to<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.050> really

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
when you're tuning you want to be really

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.919 
when you're tuning you want to be really
careful<00:00:58.589> not<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.370> turn<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> peg<00:01:00.329> too<00:01:00.600> fast

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
careful not to turn the peg too fast

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.070 
careful not to turn the peg too fast
because<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.409> might<00:01:01.679> break<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.100> string<00:01:02.339> after

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
because you might break the string after

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.329 
because you might break the string after
you<00:01:04.080> tune<00:01:04.259> the<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.500> string<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.009> want<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.250> go

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you tune the a string you want to go

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.830 
you tune the a string you want to go
down<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.759> next<00:01:05.909> string<00:01:06.180> which<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.689> D

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
down to the next string which is the D

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:17.860 
down to the next string which is the D
string

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.270 

so<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.050> next<00:01:19.230> string<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.620> want<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.920> tune<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
so the next string you want to tune is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
so the next string you want to tune is
the<00:01:20.490> g<00:01:20.700> string<00:01:20.940> when<00:01:21.690> you're<00:01:21.870> tuning<00:01:22.230> you<00:01:22.590> want

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the g string when you're tuning you want

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
the g string when you're tuning you want
to<00:01:22.950> try<00:01:23.160> and<00:01:23.460> keep<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> sound<00:01:24.150> sustained

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
to try and keep the sound sustained

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.830 
to try and keep the sound sustained
while<00:01:25.440> you're<00:01:25.740> turning<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.250> peg

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.910 

Oh

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:47.160 

and<00:01:34.750> finally<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.080> c-string

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.810 

you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.710 

as<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.979> final<00:01:52.280> check<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:53.060> should<00:01:53.240> go<00:01:53.330> back<00:01:53.479> to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
as a final check you should go back to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.300 
as a final check you should go back to
the<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.870> string<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.470> make<00:01:54.650> sure<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.190> is

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
the a string and make sure that it is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:07.120 
the a string and make sure that it is
still<00:01:55.550> in<00:01:55.700> two<00:02:03.220> as<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:06.170> can<00:02:06.290> see<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.740> tuner

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
still in two as you can see the tuner

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.580 
still in two as you can see the tuner
makes<00:02:07.610> tuning<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.209> lot<00:02:08.479> faster<00:02:08.990> which<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.320> great

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
makes tuning a lot faster which is great

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:18.180 
makes tuning a lot faster which is great
in<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.860> classroom<00:02:10.100> setting

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.250 

you
