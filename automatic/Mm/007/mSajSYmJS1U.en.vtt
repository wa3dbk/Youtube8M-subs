00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.130 
working on it there's sketches of every
song<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.970> it's<00:02:54.090> essentially<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.720> body<00:02:54.990> of

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
song and it's essentially the body of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.680 
song and it's essentially the body of
work<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.320> essentially<00:02:55.890> conceived<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:56.690> you'd

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
work is essentially conceived but you'd

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.200 
work is essentially conceived but you'd
be<00:02:57.780> surprised<00:02:58.340> with<00:02:59.340> what<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.760> could<00:02:59.910> do<00:03:00.180> to

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
be surprised with what you could do to

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.210 
be surprised with what you could do to
represent<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.990> song<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.560> like<00:03:01.830> final

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
represent a song and the like final

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.240 
represent a song and the like final
stages<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.640> production<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.710> layers<00:03:04.980> you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
stages of production like the layers you

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.970 
stages of production like the layers you
add<00:03:05.430> synthetic<00:03:06.270> layers<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:07.110> your

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
add synthetic layers like your

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.100 
add synthetic layers like your
instrumentation<00:03:08.610> how<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.480> play<00:03:09.810> parts

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
instrumentation how you play parts

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.320 
instrumentation how you play parts
dynamically<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.190> there's<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.820> bulk<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.240> the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
dynamically so there's the bulk of the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.300 
dynamically so there's the bulk of the
work<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.630> done<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:13.140> we're<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> take<00:03:14.250> our

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
work is done but we're going to take our

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.040 
work is done but we're going to take our
time<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.790> really<00:03:14.970> try<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.240> represent<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
time to really try to represent the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.690 
time to really try to represent the
songs<00:03:16.290> creatively<00:03:17.160> as<00:03:17.250> opposed<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.640> just

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
songs creatively as opposed to just

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.480 
songs creatively as opposed to just
straight<00:03:18.240> ahead<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:19.080> it'll<00:03:19.950> definitely<00:03:20.130> sound

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
straight ahead so it'll definitely sound

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.370 
straight ahead so it'll definitely sound
like<00:03:20.610> animals<00:03:20.940> as<00:03:21.060> leaders<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.840> think

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
like animals as leaders but I think

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:34.180 
like animals as leaders but I think
it'll<00:03:22.620> sound<00:03:22.860> like<00:03:22.980> where<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.370> are<00:03:23.550> now
