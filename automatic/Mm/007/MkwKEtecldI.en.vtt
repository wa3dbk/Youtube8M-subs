plant<00:00:35.250> grafting<00:00:37.250> typical<00:00:38.250> red<00:00:38.460> color<00:00:38.879> and

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
plant grafting typical red color and

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.760 
plant grafting typical red color and
there<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.129> some<00:00:41.690> hormones<00:00:42.690> inside<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
there is some hormones inside in that

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.450 
there is some hormones inside in that
wax<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.730> helps<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.989> grow<00:00:46.260> together<00:00:46.559> these

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
wax that helps to grow together these

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.389 
wax that helps to grow together these
two<00:00:47.730> parts<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.600> how<00:00:49.410> long<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.070> have

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
two parts of that how long do you have

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.090 
two parts of that how long do you have
the<00:00:50.730> grafting<00:00:51.300> zin<00:00:51.510> into<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> wax<00:00:52.379> show<00:00:52.860> us

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the grafting zin into the wax show us

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.510 
the grafting zin into the wax show us
well<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.730> only<00:00:54.090> very<00:00:54.570> short<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
well it's only very short because it's a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.240 
well it's only very short because it's a
temperature<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.360> 75<00:00:58.199> degrees<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.039> wax

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
temperature of about 75 degrees the wax

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
temperature of about 75 degrees the wax
and<00:00:59.609> those<00:01:00.390> use<00:01:00.629> Celsius<00:01:01.170> yes<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:03.080> it<00:01:04.080> would

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and those use Celsius yes and it would

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.620 
and those use Celsius yes and it would
damage<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.890> plants<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.180> wood<00:01:07.760> if<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> keep

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
damage the plants the wood if you keep

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.830 
damage the plants the wood if you keep
it<00:01:09.780> longer<00:01:10.080> inside<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> why<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> use<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:12.030> XY

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it longer inside and why to use of XY

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
it longer inside and why to use of XY
why<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.470> plant<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.549> outside

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
why do you plant them like this outside

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.179 
why do you plant them like this outside
well<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> protect<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.979> whole

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
well we have to protect the whole

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.240 
well we have to protect the whole
grafting<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.080> both<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.950> don't

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
grafting if we if we both if you don't

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.830 
grafting if we if we both if you don't
wax<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:23.070> dry<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.689> whole

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
wax it it will dry out it will the whole

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
wax it it will dry out it will the whole
grafting<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.560> dry<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.430> has<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> be

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
grafting will dry out so it has to be

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.270 
grafting will dry out so it has to be
protected<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.290> imagine<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.710> like

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
protected but you can imagine like like

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.969 
protected but you can imagine like like
if<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.000> cut<00:01:30.270> yourself<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> finger<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
if you cut yourself into the finger and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.719 
if you cut yourself into the finger and
it's<00:01:32.610> better<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:34.079> protect<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.799> somehow<00:01:35.100> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
it's better to to protect it somehow so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.660 
it's better to to protect it somehow so
it<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:36.990> heal<00:01:37.259> better<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it it will heal better and here it's the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.289 
it it will heal better and here it's the
same<00:01:39.560> yeah<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.670> are<00:01:41.759> cutting<00:01:42.119> our

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
same yeah but if we are cutting our

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
same yeah but if we are cutting our
finger<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.840> are<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.140> dying<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.130> think

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
finger we are not dying but you think

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.080 
finger we are not dying but you think
that<00:01:44.729> without<00:01:45.180> waxing<00:01:45.960> these<00:01:46.170> plants<00:01:47.090> would

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that without waxing these plants would

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.929 
that without waxing these plants would
die<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.689> at<00:01:48.960> least<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.829> grafting<00:01:50.399> would<00:01:50.640> die

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
die or at least the grafting would die

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.380 
die or at least the grafting would die
yeah<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.470> grafting<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
yeah the grafting actually that the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
yeah the grafting actually that the
upper<00:01:54.659> part<00:01:54.689> would<00:01:55.259> die<00:01:55.530> would<00:01:55.890> try<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.340> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
upper part would die would try out of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.990 
upper part would die would try out of
course<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.899> rootstock<00:01:58.409> voles<00:01:58.829> die<00:01:59.250> but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
course the the rootstock voles die but

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.210 
course the the rootstock voles die but
actually<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.570> need

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
actually we need

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.890 
actually we need
we<00:02:01.310> want<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.970> grafting<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.720> don't

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900
