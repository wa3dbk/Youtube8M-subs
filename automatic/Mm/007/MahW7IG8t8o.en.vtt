problems that's created some deaths and
this<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.240> has<00:01:57.329> had<00:01:57.420> some<00:01:57.630> sticking

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this one here has had some sticking

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.499 
this one here has had some sticking

corrected<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.159> different<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.240> when

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
corrected but it's different and so when

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.020 
corrected but it's different and so when
you're<00:02:04.350> manufacturing<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.219> same<00:02:05.460> car<00:02:05.729> why<00:02:05.969> is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you're manufacturing the same car why is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.029 
you're manufacturing the same car why is
it<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:06.659> don't<00:02:06.810> meet<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.140> same<00:02:07.590> exact

it that they don't meet the same exact

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.460 
it that they don't meet the same exact
specification<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.660> seems<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.080> me<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.229> would

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
specification it seems to me that would

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.680 
specification it seems to me that would
be<00:02:10.619> easier<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.220> correct<00:02:11.550> than<00:02:12.090> having<00:02:12.480> one

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
be easier to correct than having one

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.940 
be easier to correct than having one
