technique I found out that if you have
nine<00:01:46.500> magic<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.190> less<00:01:47.720> we<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.050> going<00:01:49.200> to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.040 
me to is kind of too long so yeah I'm
just<00:02:53.460> gonna<00:02:53.790> run<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.240> like<00:02:54.480> three<00:02:54.810> four

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
just gonna run this like three four

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.980 
just gonna run this like three four
times<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.710> show<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.510> what<00:02:57.510> do<00:02:57.600> take<00:02:57.810> note<00:02:57.960> that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
times to show you what do take note that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.710 
times to show you what do take note that
this<00:02:58.260> technique<00:02:58.680> has<00:02:58.950> its<00:02:59.190> own<00:02:59.480> normally<00:03:00.480> like

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
this technique has its own normally like

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.830 
this technique has its own normally like
sometimes<00:03:01.110> she<00:03:01.200> uses<00:03:01.620> random<00:03:02.010> magic<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:03.480> I

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
sometimes she uses random magic but I

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.500 
sometimes she uses random magic but I
found<00:03:04.710> out<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.370> occurs<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.940> ten

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
found out that it occurs like ten

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.770 
found out that it occurs like ten
percent<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:06.990> time<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.970> let's<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.510> put<00:03:09.630> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
percent of the time so let's just put it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.020 
percent of the time so let's just put it
all<00:03:10.020> Tina<00:03:10.350> again

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.540 

whoo<00:03:18.530> this<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.760> one<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.240> anomalies

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
whoo this is just one of the anomalies

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.460 
whoo this is just one of the anomalies
that<00:03:23.550> has<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.480> very<00:03:24.870> low<00:03:25.080> rate<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.350> mercury

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
that has a very low rate of mercury

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.930 
that has a very low rate of mercury
that's<00:03:28.470> gonna<00:03:28.650> keep<00:03:28.890> doing<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.760> maybe

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
that's gonna keep doing this like maybe

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.060 
that's gonna keep doing this like maybe
two<00:03:30.660> three<00:03:31.050> more<00:03:31.230> times<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:34.230> show<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.530> that

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
two three more times to show you that

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.670 
two three more times to show you that
the<00:03:35.490> manipulation<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.420> actually<00:03:36.930> possible<00:03:37.200> is

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
the manipulation is actually possible is

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.990 
the manipulation is actually possible is
actually<00:03:38.130> successful<00:03:40.880> this

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
actually successful this

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.740 
actually successful this
having<00:03:42.510> my<00:03:42.630> character<00:03:43.050> kill<00:03:43.290> himself<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:43.770> I<00:03:43.920> a

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
having my character kill himself so I a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.960 
having my character kill himself so I a
neighbor<00:03:45.750> will<00:03:46.050> introduce<00:03:46.950> we<00:03:47.430> know<00:03:47.610> as<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
neighbor will introduce we know as the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.850 
neighbor will introduce we know as the
brick<00:03:48.360> wall<00:03:50.030> our<00:03:51.030> team<00:03:51.420> our<00:03:51.630> baby<00:03:51.870> there<00:03:52.830> you

brick wall our team our baby there you
go

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:32.790 

let's<00:04:06.500> go<00:04:06.710> one<00:04:07.010> more<00:04:07.040> better

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.710 

Oh<00:04:32.830> Tina<00:04:33.550> Tina

there<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.530> go<00:04:39.740> altameyer<00:04:40.310> game

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.609 

let's<00:04:57.570> just<00:04:58.110> go<00:04:58.320> for<00:04:58.500> one<00:04:58.740> more<00:04:58.950> battle

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:02.619 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.439 

to<00:05:03.619> show<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.889> the<00:05:04.099> success<00:05:04.490> rate<00:05:04.849> of<00:05:04.879> this<00:05:05.210> our

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
to show you the success rate of this our

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.920 
to show you the success rate of this our
technique<00:05:05.839> this<00:05:06.499> manipulation<00:05:07.449> all<00:05:08.449> right

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
technique this manipulation all right

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:19.469 
technique this manipulation all right
scroll<00:05:09.319> finally<00:05:09.860> dies

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.830 

I'll<00:05:20.479> TiVo

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.870 

as<00:05:23.840> you<00:05:24.050> can<00:05:24.170> see<00:05:24.410> by<00:05:24.620> now<00:05:24.830> this<00:05:25.280> tablet<00:05:25.550> is

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
as you can see by now this tablet is

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.510 
as you can see by now this tablet is
quite<00:05:26.510> reliable

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
quite reliable

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.749 
quite reliable
I'll<00:05:28.970> say<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:29.569> magnificent<00:05:30.259> reliable<00:05:30.800> we

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
I'll say it's magnificent reliable we

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.460 
I'll say it's magnificent reliable we
are<00:05:31.910> mobile<00:05:32.180> economy<00:05:32.389> around<00:05:33.169> 10%<00:05:35.080> it's<00:05:36.080> very

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
are mobile economy around 10% it's very

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.059 
are mobile economy around 10% it's very
very<00:05:39.130> right<00:05:40.130> right<00:05:40.400> now<00:05:40.639> I'm<00:05:40.699> just<00:05:40.880> gonna<00:05:42.069> make

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
very right right now I'm just gonna make

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.930 
very right right now I'm just gonna make
this<00:05:43.400> slightly<00:05:44.229> stronger<00:05:45.229> so<00:05:46.099> when<00:05:46.370> we<00:05:46.520> find

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
this slightly stronger so when we find

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.320 
this slightly stronger so when we find
some<00:05:47.419> fire<00:05:47.750> magic<00:05:48.050> for<00:05:48.440> rinoa<00:05:48.880> which<00:05:49.880> I<00:05:50.120> will

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
some fire magic for rinoa which I will

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.290 
some fire magic for rinoa which I will
cause<00:05:50.569> her<00:05:50.840> to<00:05:51.020> use<00:05:51.229> in<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.560> in<00:05:51.710> juvie<00:05:52.160> mode<00:05:52.430> so

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
cause her to use in the in juvie mode so

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.650 
cause her to use in the in juvie mode so
just<00:05:53.630> get<00:05:53.840> rid<00:05:53.990> of<00:05:54.050> an<00:05:54.229> ounce<00:05:54.349> even<00:05:54.740> give<00:05:55.130> it<00:05:55.250> to

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
just get rid of an ounce even give it to

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.839 
just get rid of an ounce even give it to
say<00:05:56.660> I<00:05:56.690> think<00:05:59.169> we<00:06:00.169> arranged<00:06:00.530> a<00:06:00.919> fire<00:06:01.340> to<00:06:01.729> the

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
say I think we arranged a fire to the

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.550 
say I think we arranged a fire to the
first<00:06:02.090> slide<00:06:05.199> all<00:06:06.199> right

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
first slide all right

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:17.020 
first slide all right
at<00:06:06.740> a<00:06:06.770> time<00:06:14.680> now<00:06:15.680> guess<00:06:16.070> what<00:06:16.340> magic<00:06:16.820> she's

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
at a time now guess what magic she's

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.170 
at a time now guess what magic she's
going<00:06:17.300> to<00:06:17.419> use

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:29.670 

they'll<00:06:22.180> guess<00:06:22.480> it<00:06:24.510> fire<00:06:27.780> Z<00:06:28.780> this<00:06:28.960> becomes<00:06:29.470> so

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
they'll guess it fire Z this becomes so

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.120 
they'll guess it fire Z this becomes so
much<00:06:29.710> more<00:06:29.889> predictable<00:06:31.230> so<00:06:34.680> what<00:06:35.680> is<00:06:35.830> the<00:06:36.010> end

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
much more predictable so what is the end

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.560 
much more predictable so what is the end
of<00:06:36.250> a<00:06:36.310> demonstration<00:06:36.970> I'm<00:06:37.180> just<00:06:37.210> going<00:06:37.419> to

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
of a demonstration I'm just going to

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:43.560 
of a demonstration I'm just going to
summarize<00:06:40.530> this<00:06:41.530> technique<00:06:42.190> okay<00:06:42.790> the<00:06:43.389> first

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
summarize this technique okay the first

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.470 
summarize this technique okay the first
step<00:06:43.870> is<00:06:44.020> you<00:06:44.610> obviously<00:06:45.610> you<00:06:45.760> strip<00:06:46.180> you<00:06:46.330> know

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
step is you obviously you strip you know

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.060 
step is you obviously you strip you know
of<00:06:46.630> every<00:06:46.960> single<00:06:47.230> magic<00:06:47.350> she<00:06:47.620> has<00:06:47.770> to<00:06:47.950> make

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
of every single magic she has to make

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.310 
of every single magic she has to make
things<00:06:48.340> easier<00:06:48.940> for<00:06:48.970> you<00:06:49.270> then<00:06:49.780> you<00:06:49.900> give<00:06:50.110> her

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
things easier for you then you give her

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.680 
things easier for you then you give her
the<00:06:51.160> magic<00:06:51.280> that<00:06:51.610> you<00:06:51.639> want<00:06:52.000> her<00:06:52.120> to<00:06:52.240> have<00:06:52.450> like

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
the magic that you want her to have like

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.110 
the magic that you want her to have like
maybe<00:06:52.900> lime<00:06:53.410> is<00:06:53.620> the<00:06:53.770> best<00:06:54.010> because<00:06:54.700> there's

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
maybe lime is the best because there's

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.650 
maybe lime is the best because there's
nine<00:06:55.450> slots<00:06:55.810> of<00:06:56.050> Junction<00:06:57.210> we<00:06:58.210> actually<00:06:58.510> do

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
nine slots of Junction we actually do

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.790 
nine slots of Junction we actually do
need<00:06:58.780> die<00:06:59.139> in<00:06:59.260> two<00:06:59.380> Junction<00:06:59.800> so<00:07:01.800> yeah

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
need die in two Junction so yeah
