00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.100
 at the anime expo 2013 here in the city 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.779
 from pachuca and well, I have a great 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.420
 act of dubbing as I always bring 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.939
 good interviews many can know 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.669
 does he touched others to the dragon of this 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.200
 simple but they know everything better 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.850
 that he presents himself now as is to be 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.700
 ricardo mendoza alias fall courage of 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.000
 dragon and many more many more and those who 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.500
 come true really tell us a little 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.750
 of you before you start this one to talk 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.520
 a while like not doing ricardo mendoza in 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.180
 what is the world of dubbing as nazi 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
 I look for him to make hop Radio 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.199
 novels from very young start to sos 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.059
 at age 11 doing radio soap operas at 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.519
 side of Mr. Raul of Junior Field 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:08.689
 cheito muñoz ledo leap to dub 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.979
 ten years later by means of my 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.780
 sister also one with her mendoza that 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.880
 does dubbing we started getting into 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.000
 dabble in the dubbing as we bring 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 I've already put it on as the teaching says 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.679
 of what it is to know how to act as we enter 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.000
 very easily to dub although it's a 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.270
 technique very different from what it is 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.700
 acting in radio or acting in cinema 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.799
 the technique is very difficult but we achieve 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.350
 in quickly functioning in the dubbing 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.939
 natural identity for the same reason that 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.520
 many that I have touched 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.229
 interview like this mainly 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.000
 humberto vélez has told me a lot that 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.189
 before being a double actor that one should 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.110
 be this professional actor or so 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.179
 less have notions of good acting 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.039
 what there is no dubbing actor nor is there 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.349
 no film actor or television actor 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.110
 that is, there is an actor, you are an actor and you 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.399
 you must mold to different branches if 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.479
 you're not an actor, you do not have anything 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.619
 do in this business 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.679
 I think that we must mainly be 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.569
 actor and being able to transmit having that 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.579
 sensitivity to convey something to 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.009
 public because even if you see a 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.819
 caricature that is already done when I put 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.590
 my voice 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.969
 I am transmitting the same my 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.040
 feelings 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.290
 and what I feel at that moment for 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.959
 that the people also feel it although 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.790
 that does not make someone completely from 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.400
 agreement and already talking a little bit of what 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.689
 that you are what is of this now I do believe 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.599
 that matters to us at this moment that is 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.769
 dubbing because you dedicate yourself a bit like the 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.599
 which are the characters that have most 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.969
 I personally liked me personally 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.790
 I love Cayba is a character that I admire 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.439
 you saw him for a while in fact this but 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.909
 apart from these which are the ones that 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.180
 you have done and which ones have you 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.709
 liked anime television this cinema of 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.319
 what, yes, look, I do not have any 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.870
 character 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.799
 favorite me all the characters that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.599
 I make 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.450
 The truth is that I love them, so be it 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.700
 of a look be a stellar I do it 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.980
 With a lot of love, I do not have a favorite 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.959
 but the one I really like is the dog 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.769
 courage I like a lot for the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.439
 fuck more or less courage speaks and I'm 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.469
 trying to see if the paper says that 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.770
 I'm very afraid, help me please

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.330
 confidentiality in which we can not 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.430

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.050
