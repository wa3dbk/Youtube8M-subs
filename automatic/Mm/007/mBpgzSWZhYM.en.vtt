00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 this is the general mobile discovery 2 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.009
 mini and 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.379
 as the name suggests it is the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.080
 smaller variant of the discovery 2 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.639
 and the successor to the first discovery 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.230
 well if we just go to the device itself 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.630
 go and look he is indeed more 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.890
 mini it just feels great 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.600
 the hand has a four and a half inches 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
 screen which makes it nice and compact 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160
 he has also been doing through to the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.619
 back also to use one 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.000
 little rubber-like plastic yes you have 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.070
 also a good grip on the device we 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.060
 see that we come back to more and more often 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.740
 different smartphones 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 we also see a chrome border around it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.610
 device back and on that gram of fire 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.300
 we add a micro usb at the bottom 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.730
 port wine 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.410
 we find nothing on the left side of the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.329
 top only find the headset port 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.469
 as usual and on the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.149
 on the right side find all the buttons 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.719
 namely the volume button and the on and 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.579
 power button 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.190
 after the back we find the rest 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.070
 another speaker chip and and of course the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.210
 camera with flash and then also for side 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.129
 you actually just find it 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.020
 screen front-facing camera and one 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.359
 speaker grill then give the idea 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.550
 how great discovery 2 is then i have here 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.110
 stand one behind the other and then you will see that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.540
 the discovery 2 with its 5 inch screen 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.619
 slightly larger in thickness, they are almost 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.150
 the same 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.380
 and in appearance they just seem too 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.119
 very much alike certainly the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.700
 backside yes that's just real 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 in which the well substantially to each other the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.830
 nice thing about the mini is that you like it too 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.270
 you can choose whether you want the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.979
 grayish blue backside 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.360
 or you could use the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.369
 white back and you get it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.080
 the white rear suitcase in the ordinary 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.180
 the packaging so that you can do it yourself 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960
 yes choose the best at that time 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.610
 it suits you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.990
 well if the device just turn on then 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.670
 We see that it runs on Android 4 point 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.740
 four point 2 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.659
 yes there is a small layer over it 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.009
 from general mobile itself 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.190
 I do n't find that school disturbing 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.650
 not him 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.090
 ugly or something in that direction 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.020
 even that nice additions 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.120
 like another 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.070
 speed-selection menu you can also see for example 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.860
 how full ram memory is has one 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.870
 gigabyte ram and if you can 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.580
 you possibly of course flush with the 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.310
 just multitask certain things 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.320
 close by swiping them away for the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.570
 rest time to see if zuko that too 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.700
 widgets have changed and can of course 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.380
 install all kinds of applications 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.940
 please note that you have 8 gigabytes internally 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.320
 have that internal rumor you can 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.880
 also expand through a 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.950
 micro sd card 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.750
 he is also duosim so you can 2 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.370
 SIM cards ring that you too 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.500
 are available on 2 numbers and can 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.480
 call with two numbers so before the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.950
 one who finds it is a fine option 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.090
 that is also a good addition 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.980
 it has a comma three 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.560
 gigahertz quadcore processor 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.050
 yes that processor that is slightly less 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.480
 strong than the toe octa-core that is in the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.950
 discovery 2 only finds you care 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800
 always for that use of it 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.930
 device reasonable to do is it 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.060
 opening applications never takes too long 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.550
 long and really only when 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.470
 notice that it is not a complete one 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.200
 octa-core is or a little less fast 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.280
 quad core then yes that's if you really 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.170
 for example 5 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.140
 applications simultaneously to it 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.090
 real time and multitasker and if you 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.380
 for example, opens a really big app 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.940
 or a great game that makes him 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.300
 takes a little more time to settle in 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.130
 load 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.620
 but not in itself disturbing and sure 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.450
 for this price range in the somewhat lower 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.620
 I really like the segments very much 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.580
 achieve 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.519
 after the screen itself has a resolution 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.709
 of 480 by 854 pixels 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.209
 yes that is also not a full hd resolution 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.580
 but you still see preview it 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.920
 smaller text fairly well 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.720
 reading and there in itself is not disturbing 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.340
 is an eps panel so it can also be tasty 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.780
 bright has an eighteen hundred mini 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.010
 jan per hour battery 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.110
 and he also has a 2 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.480
 megapixel selfie camera in the front 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.980
 and an 8 megapixel camera on the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.050
 back with a flash 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.330
 now also at the camera at the camera 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.489
 part we actually find here 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.540
 yes some minor modifications of them 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.120
 pretty clear 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.310
 you can change what settings you can 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.180
 also add whatever filters you can 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.980
 of course just easy it 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.989
 shift the focus point and the front facing 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.450
 camera that is actually nice to take a moment 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.069
 take a snapshot quickly, but certainly 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.860
 in the dark light conditions 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.010
 here actually 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.420
 pretty little to yes I have finally 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.950
 a number of useful gestures that are possible 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.360
 in the settings menu 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.800
 sint setting menu sits and goes to 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.270
 smart than to find some here 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.040
 gestures that you can set 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.870
 but also some smart 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.250
 management things so you can 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.140
 example is that it is automatically 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.430
 in skate mode that skates you 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.320
 can not receive calls or torch can be 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.140
 be made but also one 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.570
 just have a yes alarms in the morning 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.100
 and what it just does and you can still do it 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.680
 tweaking some nice things 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.060
 to yes you live with this smartphone 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.550
 what easier to make 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.810
 since the discovery 2 is mini is normal 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.250
 a great smartphone for everyone 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.140
 is just looking for an android 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.270
 smartphone that should not be too expensive 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.200
 and that just still looks great 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.700
 can carry 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.650
 and also its compact size 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.120
 taken along it is yes it is nice 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.710
 thing 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.540
 you want more information about or in there
