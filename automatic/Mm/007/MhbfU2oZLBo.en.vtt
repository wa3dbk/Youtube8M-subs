00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
plugs on a 2007 marina and so this is

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.370 
plugs on a 2007 marina and so this is
how<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> first<00:00:12.210> off<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.290> have

to remove some some and the hex head

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.519 
to remove some some and the hex head
screws<00:00:16.109> or<00:00:16.710> Ellen<00:00:17.130> key<00:00:17.279> screws<00:00:17.640> out<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.970> here

here as simple as that
let's<00:01:03.750> take<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.019> finger<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.530> just

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
let's take your finger down and just

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
let's take your finger down and just
down<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.820> pull<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.090> cover<00:01:06.360> up

just like that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:18.260 
just like that
okay<00:01:08.420> cover<00:01:09.420> I'll<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.750> cut<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.090> which

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
okay cover I'll just cut off and which

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.630 
okay cover I'll just cut off and which
sometimes<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> clip<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> backbone<00:01:19.770> hugs

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
sometimes it clip down the backbone hugs

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
sometimes it clip down the backbone hugs
down<00:01:21.540> again<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:25.340> six<00:01:27.200> spark

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
down again and there we go six spark

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.060 
down again and there we go six spark
plugs<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.200> get<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.680> leads<00:01:31.920> on

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
plugs all in here and get your leads on

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.990 
plugs all in here and get your leads on
the<00:01:32.189> side<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:34.040> come<00:01:35.040> back<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the side so come back and do that in a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.140 
the side so come back and do that in a
minute<00:01:37.250> okay<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.610> we're<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.970> remove

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
minute okay so now we're going to remove

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.560 
minute okay so now we're going to remove
the<00:01:39.869> spark<00:01:40.110> plugs<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.009> suggest<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.790> do

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the spark plugs so what I suggest is do

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.670 
the spark plugs so what I suggest is do
them<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.170> time

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
them one at a time

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.050 
them one at a time
don't<00:01:43.860> pull<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> leads<00:01:44.640> off<00:01:44.850> because

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
don't pull all the leads off because

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.560 
don't pull all the leads off because
you'll<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.390> them<00:01:45.680> mixed<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:48.270> simply

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you'll get them mixed up so just simply

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.840 
you'll get them mixed up so just simply
grab<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.799> twist<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.520> bit<00:01:50.700> each

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
grab it just twist it a little bit each

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.340 
grab it just twist it a little bit each
way<00:01:51.799> give<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.180> tug<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:57.290> okay<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
way give it a tug and that's it okay so

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.399 
way give it a tug and that's it okay so
I<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.219> let<00:01:59.490> lead<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.869> side<00:02:01.170> there

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
I just let lead that just a side there

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.510 
I just let lead that just a side there
and<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:04.000> we've<00:02:04.689> got<00:02:04.960> just<00:02:05.259> this<00:02:05.890> bug<00:02:06.189> plug

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
and and we've got just this bug plug

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.100 
and and we've got just this bug plug
lead<00:02:06.729> in<00:02:06.880> there<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.299> there's<00:02:07.479> four<00:02:07.659> there<00:02:07.869> so

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
lead in there so there's four there so

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.610 
lead in there so there's four there so
like<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:08.770> said<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:09.220> always<00:02:10.149> do<00:02:10.420> one<00:02:11.170> at<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.410> time

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
like I said I always do one at a time

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.640 
like I said I always do one at a time
and<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:13.810> as<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:14.230> see<00:02:14.610> I've<00:02:15.610> got<00:02:15.910> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and now as you can see I've got a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.229 
and now as you can see I've got a
ratchet<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:17.860> with<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> spark<00:02:18.519> plug<00:02:18.610> remover

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
ratchet here with a spark plug remover

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.180 
ratchet here with a spark plug remover
on<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.480> end<00:02:19.630> see<00:02:19.900> new<00:02:20.110> quite<00:02:20.410> quite<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> long

on the end see new quite quite a long

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.870 
on the end see new quite quite a long
run<00:02:21.430> due<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:23.260> long<00:02:23.470> distance<00:02:24.280> down<00:02:24.550> into

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
run due to the long distance down into

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.259 
run due to the long distance down into
there<00:02:25.319> when<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.410> put<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.709> in<00:02:26.860> just<00:02:27.730> ensure

just like that and you'll pull up and
pull<00:03:00.549> up<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.849> spark<00:03:01.150> plug<00:03:01.390> there<00:03:02.040> there's<00:03:03.040> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
pull up the spark plug there there's a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.589 
pull up the spark plug there there's a
little<00:03:03.400> bit<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.700> oil<00:03:03.819> down<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:04.209> but<00:03:04.540> that's

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
little bit of oil down there but that's

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.110 
little bit of oil down there but that's
okay<00:03:04.810> because<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.440> plugs<00:03:05.709> okay<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.880> end<00:03:07.030> of

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
okay because the plugs okay the end of

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.220 
okay because the plugs okay the end of
the<00:03:07.209> plug<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.480> when<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.810> make<00:03:10.989> sure

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
the plug and just when you make sure

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:23.050 
the plug and just when you make sure
that<00:03:11.380> it

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.930 

okay<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.120> we've<00:03:24.660> got<00:03:24.690> our<00:03:25.340> new<00:03:26.340> spark<00:03:26.730> plug

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
okay so we've got our new spark plug

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.100 
okay so we've got our new spark plug
here<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:28.010> champion<00:03:29.010> plug<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.520> tends

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
here so it's a champion plug it tends

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
here so it's a champion plug it tends
arc-8<00:03:31.280> yc4<00:03:32.280> plug<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.300> we<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.600> put<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.130> in

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
arc-8 yc4 plug so we just put that in

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.590 
arc-8 yc4 plug so we just put that in
the<00:03:35.340> end<00:03:35.520> here<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:40.680> letting<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.570> seat<00:03:42.570> that

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
the end here just letting the seat that

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.390 
the end here just letting the seat that
in<00:03:42.900> nicely<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:46.350> we<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.130> put<00:03:47.310> it

in nicely and and we just put it

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.480 
in nicely and and we just put it
straight<00:03:47.580> down<00:03:48.030> into<00:03:48.390> there<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.950> do

straight down into there and just do

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.640 
straight down into there and just do
anti-clockwise<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.330> couple<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.780> times<00:03:52.050> just<00:03:52.320> to

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
anti-clockwise a couple of times just to

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
you will break the the plug off that in

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.930 
you will break the the plug off that in
there<00:04:35.920> grab<00:04:36.850> your<00:04:37.060> plug<00:04:38.460> straight<00:04:39.460> back<00:04:39.700> down

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
there grab your plug straight back down

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.610 
there grab your plug straight back down
in<00:04:40.120> there<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.690> push<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.620> on<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.730> but<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.620> make

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
in there and push it on the but the make

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.410 
in there and push it on the but the make
sure<00:04:44.800> that's<00:04:44.950> okay<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.760> that's<00:04:45.940> it<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.330> then

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
sure that's okay and that's it and then

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.370 
sure that's okay and that's it and then
just<00:04:46.570> repeat<00:04:46.780> for<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.260> for<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.920> other<00:04:48.040> three
