the<00:02:31.150> base<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.510> just<00:02:31.740> too<00:02:32.740> good<00:02:32.950> I'm<00:02:33.790> going<00:02:34.060> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the base is just too good I'm going to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.280 
the base is just too good I'm going to
say<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.570> base<00:02:34.720> just<00:02:35.140> too<00:02:35.290> good<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:41.140> you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
say the base just too good and as you

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.750 
say the base just too good and as you
can<00:02:41.380> see<00:02:41.440> they're<00:02:41.860> just<00:02:41.890> getting<00:02:42.160> Splash

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
can see they're just getting Splash

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.120 
can see they're just getting Splash
Damage<00:02:42.910> like<00:02:43.840> crazy<00:02:45.989> it's<00:02:46.989> working<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.980> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
Damage like crazy it's working just the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.030 
Damage like crazy it's working just the
way<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.459> wanted<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.630> having<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.800> break

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
way I wanted it to having to break

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.620 
way I wanted it to having to break
through<00:02:51.250> multiple<00:02:51.760> walls<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.270> get<00:02:52.330> into<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
through multiple walls to get into the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.320 
through multiple walls to get into the
middle<00:02:52.870> taking<00:02:53.670> costing<00:02:54.670> them<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> lot<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.060> time

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
middle taking costing them a lot of time

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.650 
middle taking costing them a lot of time
flying<00:02:56.020> my<00:02:56.470> splash<00:02:56.920> damage<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.790> take<00:02:58.450> down

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
flying my splash damage to take down

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.720 
flying my splash damage to take down
their<00:02:58.900> life<00:02:59.280> substantially<00:03:01.530> his<00:03:02.530> spell<00:03:03.010> he

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
their life substantially his spell he

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.600 
their life substantially his spell he
throws<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.239> there<00:03:04.709> hopefully<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:06.250> try<00:03:06.489> and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
throws in there hopefully to try and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.660 
throws in there hopefully to try and
give<00:03:06.730> himself<00:03:06.910> some<00:03:07.209> sort<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:08.310> upper<00:03:09.310> hand<00:03:09.519> I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
give himself some sort of upper hand I

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.100 
give himself some sort of upper hand I
guess<00:03:09.880> but<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.360> doesn't<00:03:10.660> do<00:03:10.750> him<00:03:10.900> much<00:03:11.049> good

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
guess but it doesn't do him much good

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.259 
guess but it doesn't do him much good
and<00:03:13.769> that's<00:03:14.769> pretty<00:03:15.130> much<00:03:15.250> it

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
and that's pretty much it

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.960 
and that's pretty much it
clan<00:03:16.900> castle<00:03:17.560> there<00:03:17.769> I<00:03:17.799> guess<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.790> last

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
clan castle there I guess in the last

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.770 
clan castle there I guess in the last
ditch<00:03:19.269> effort<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:21.430> don't<00:03:21.970> know<00:03:22.060> what<00:03:22.630> he<00:03:22.720> was

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
ditch effort to I don't know what he was

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.820 
ditch effort to I don't know what he was
going<00:03:23.049> for<00:03:23.370> really<00:03:25.470> but<00:03:26.470> we<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.430> how<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.760> ends

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
going for really but we know how it ends

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.569 
going for really but we know how it ends
not<00:03:29.830> in<00:03:30.040> his<00:03:30.220> favor<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.829> he<00:03:33.310> didn't<00:03:33.549> even

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
not in his favor and he didn't even

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.630 
not in his favor and he didn't even
really<00:03:33.820> get<00:03:34.000> any<00:03:34.150> loot<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:35.310> pretty<00:03:36.310> sure<00:03:36.489> it's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
really get any loot so pretty sure it's

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.160 
really get any loot so pretty sure it's
safe<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:36.970> say<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.329> not<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.989> way<00:03:38.140> he

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
safe to say this is not the way he

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.360 
safe to say this is not the way he
planned<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:38.920> having<00:03:39.549> this<00:03:39.850> raid<00:03:40.090> go<00:03:41.049> for<00:03:41.380> go

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
planned on having this raid go for go

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.640 
planned on having this raid go for go
for<00:03:42.400> him<00:03:44.160> let's<00:03:45.160> go<00:03:45.340> ahead<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.510> check<00:03:47.470> out

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
for him let's go ahead and check out

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.610 
for him let's go ahead and check out
another<00:03:47.709> one<00:03:48.370> here<00:03:48.900> this<00:03:49.900> one<00:03:49.959> they<00:03:50.320> actually

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
another one here this one they actually

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.180 
another one here this one they actually
sent<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:51.040> balloons<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:53.170> an<00:03:53.350> assortment<00:03:53.890> of

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
sent in balloons and an assortment of

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.670 
sent in balloons and an assortment of
units<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.660> one<00:03:55.959> should<00:03:55.989> be<00:03:56.140> interesting

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
units so that one should be interesting

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.850 
units so that one should be interesting
he<00:03:56.920> actually<00:03:57.310> only<00:03:57.519> got<00:03:57.820> 11<00:03:58.120> percent<00:03:59.019> which<00:03:59.650> is

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
he actually only got 11 percent which is

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.480 
he actually only got 11 percent which is
pretty<00:04:00.280> sad<00:04:00.730> if<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.420> ask<00:04:01.630> me<00:04:01.900> but

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490

they all got taken out so bad timing on
the<00:04:15.890> wall<00:04:16.040> breakers<00:04:16.549> that<00:04:16.579> was<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.419> first

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
the wall breakers that was the first

the wall breakers that was the first
nail<00:04:17.989> on<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:18.200> coffin<00:04:19.239> basically<00:04:20.239> he<00:04:20.389> just

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
nail on the coffin basically he just

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.680 
nail on the coffin basically he just
served<00:04:21.250> just<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.340> dessert<00:04:22.730> on<00:04:23.030> two<00:04:23.360> fronts

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
served just a dessert on two fronts

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.970 
served just a dessert on two fronts
there<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:28.000> mistimed<00:04:29.000> everything<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.440> terms

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
there and mistimed everything in terms

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.970 
there and mistimed everything in terms
of<00:04:31.190> getting<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.490> most<00:04:31.669> out<00:04:31.910> of<00:04:31.970> his<00:04:32.150> units

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
of getting the most out of his units

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.110 
of getting the most out of his units
there<00:04:33.980> you<00:04:34.070> can<00:04:34.190> see<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.430> air<00:04:34.550> defense<00:04:34.880> going

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
there you can see the air defense going

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.120 
there you can see the air defense going
to<00:04:35.300> work<00:04:35.479> blowing<00:04:35.960> down<00:04:36.080> those<00:04:36.350> balloons<00:04:36.770> in

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
to work blowing down those balloons in

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.860 
to work blowing down those balloons in
two<00:04:37.940> seconds<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:40.180> looks<00:04:41.180> like<00:04:41.419> he's<00:04:41.630> not<00:04:41.810> even

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
two seconds and looks like he's not even

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.740 
two seconds and looks like he's not even
going<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.350> break<00:04:42.710> through<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.190> wall<00:04:43.460> that<00:04:44.800> is

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
going to break through the wall that is

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:55.270 
going to break through the wall that is
pretty<00:04:47.750> sad<00:04:50.770> yeah<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:53.000> looks<00:04:53.210> like<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:55.250> end

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
pretty sad yeah that looks like the end

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.810

you<00:05:17.360> can<00:05:17.479> see<00:05:17.720> a<00:05:17.750> little<00:05:18.050> weakness<00:05:18.530> here<00:05:18.770> since

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
you can see a little weakness here since

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.969 
you can see a little weakness here since
he<00:05:19.250> actually<00:05:19.640> got<00:05:19.789> up<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.000> 35%<00:05:23.770> starts<00:05:24.770> off

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
he actually got up to 35% starts off

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:32.400 
he actually got up to 35% starts off
with<00:05:25.160> the<00:05:25.310> lightning<00:05:25.850> spell<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:27.940> a<00:05:30.460> bit<00:05:31.460> of<00:05:31.789> a

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
with the lightning spell and a bit of a

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.670 
with the lightning spell and a bit of a
zerg<00:05:33.410> in<00:05:33.890> a<00:05:34.160> one<00:05:34.610> spot<00:05:36.130> seems<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.370> be<00:05:37.610> just

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
zerg in a one spot seems to be just

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.310 
zerg in a one spot seems to be just
actually<00:05:39.680> attacking<00:05:40.310> all<00:05:40.870> basically<00:05:41.870> one

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
actually attacking all basically one

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.400 
actually attacking all basically one
front<00:05:42.770> here

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.450 

possibly<00:05:46.370> his<00:05:47.330> goal<00:05:47.690> was<00:05:47.990> just<00:05:48.220> dilute<00:05:49.220> in

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
possibly his goal was just dilute in

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:59.130 
possibly his goal was just dilute in
this<00:05:49.670> case<00:05:49.970> and<00:05:51.310> not<00:05:52.310> so<00:05:52.610> much<00:05:52.850> a<00:05:54.490> win<00:05:57.610> based<00:05:58.610> on

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
this case and not so much a win based on

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.870 
this case and not so much a win based on
where<00:06:00.140> he<00:06:00.260> deployed<00:06:00.740> all<00:06:00.980> his<00:06:01.160> troops<00:06:03.880> again

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
where he deployed all his troops again

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.130 
where he deployed all his troops again
you<00:06:05.120> see<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.510> Splash<00:06:05.870> Damage<00:06:07.990> hammering<00:06:08.990> the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
you see the Splash Damage hammering the

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.420 
you see the Splash Damage hammering the
Giants<00:06:10.990> but<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.380> Giants<00:06:12.890> doing<00:06:13.190> a<00:06:13.220> good<00:06:13.370> job

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
Giants but the Giants doing a good job

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.850 
Giants but the Giants doing a good job
of<00:06:13.760> distracting<00:06:14.540> while<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.170> archers<00:06:15.620> are

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
of distracting while the archers are

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.360 
of distracting while the archers are
able<00:06:16.160> to<00:06:17.140> go<00:06:18.140> for<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:18.500> lead<00:06:18.710> there

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.560 

speed<00:06:22.370> it<00:06:22.490> up<00:06:22.610> a<00:06:22.730> little<00:06:22.820> bit<00:06:25.030> he<00:06:26.030> sends<00:06:26.480> in

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
speed it up a little bit he sends in

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.680 
speed it up a little bit he sends in
another<00:06:26.960> wave<00:06:27.380> of<00:06:27.410> Giants<00:06:28.190> I'm<00:06:29.090> assuming

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
another wave of Giants I'm assuming

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.750 
another wave of Giants I'm assuming
again<00:06:30.560> as<00:06:30.920> a<00:06:31.370> bit<00:06:31.790> of<00:06:31.880> a<00:06:31.940> distraction<00:06:32.330> and

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
again as a bit of a distraction and

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.980 
again as a bit of a distraction and
let's<00:06:34.760> the<00:06:34.880> archers<00:06:35.240> go<00:06:35.390> to<00:06:35.450> work<00:06:35.720> and<00:06:35.900> he

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
let's the archers go to work and he

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.920 
let's the archers go to work and he
actually<00:06:36.170> gets<00:06:36.470> quite<00:06:37.010> a<00:06:37.040> bit<00:06:37.310> of<00:06:37.400> loot<00:06:37.550> here

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
actually gets quite a bit of loot here

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.620 
actually gets quite a bit of loot here
yeah<00:06:38.930> he<00:06:39.530> does<00:06:39.890> a<00:06:39.920> good<00:06:40.490> job<00:06:40.550> of<00:06:40.910> getting<00:06:41.030> lit<00:06:41.330> I

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
yeah he does a good job of getting lit I

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.730 
yeah he does a good job of getting lit I
cannot<00:06:42.560> hold<00:06:42.800> that<00:06:42.980> against<00:06:43.430> him<00:06:43.840> but<00:06:44.840> again<00:06:45.260> I

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
cannot hold that against him but again I

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.480 
cannot hold that against him but again I
come<00:06:46.640> out<00:06:46.850> victorious<00:06:47.330> in<00:06:47.990> the<00:06:48.110> end<00:06:49.180> so<00:06:51.490> there

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
come out victorious in the end so there

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.370 
come out victorious in the end so there
you<00:06:52.790> have<00:06:52.820> it<00:06:53.090> three<00:06:54.040> defenses<00:06:55.990> where<00:06:56.990> I<00:06:57.020> won

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
you have it three defenses where I won

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.790 
you have it three defenses where I won
all<00:06:57.710> of<00:06:58.040> them<00:06:58.510> decisively<00:06:59.510> and<00:07:00.760> this<00:07:01.760> base<00:07:02.060> is

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
all of them decisively and this base is

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.340 
all of them decisively and this base is
it's<00:07:03.800> got<00:07:04.070> it<00:07:04.220> going<00:07:04.460> on<00:07:05.050> totally<00:07:06.050> got<00:07:06.230> it

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
it's got it going on totally got it

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.880 
it's got it going on totally got it
going<00:07:06.590> on<00:07:06.710> I<00:07:06.920> think<00:07:08.470> the<00:07:09.470> next<00:07:09.710> thing<00:07:09.830> I'm

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
going on I think the next thing I'm

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.240 
going on I think the next thing I'm
going<00:07:10.010> to<00:07:10.100> do<00:07:10.280> is<00:07:10.520> a<00:07:11.530> trophy<00:07:12.530> push<00:07:12.710> before<00:07:12.980> we

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
going to do is a trophy push before we

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.790 
going to do is a trophy push before we
upgrade<00:07:13.550> to<00:07:13.640> level<00:07:13.910> 6<00:07:14.210> just<00:07:14.630> to<00:07:15.290> kind<00:07:15.500> of<00:07:15.590> see

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
upgrade to level 6 just to kind of see

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.390 
upgrade to level 6 just to kind of see
how<00:07:16.490> high<00:07:16.730> I<00:07:16.760> can<00:07:16.880> get<00:07:17.210> with<00:07:17.720> you<00:07:18.410> know<00:07:18.500> attack

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
how high I can get with you know attack

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.950 
how high I can get with you know attack
how<00:07:19.550> level<00:07:19.760> 5<00:07:20.470> I've<00:07:21.470> had<00:07:22.280> the<00:07:22.490> plenty<00:07:23.270> of<00:07:23.420> gold

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
how level 5 I've had the plenty of gold

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.900 
how level 5 I've had the plenty of gold
to<00:07:24.320> upgrade<00:07:24.470> for<00:07:24.890> a<00:07:24.980> while<00:07:25.130> now<00:07:25.370> I've<00:07:25.700> actually

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 
to upgrade for a while now I've actually

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.640 
to upgrade for a while now I've actually
been<00:07:26.150> leaving<00:07:26.510> it<00:07:26.630> to<00:07:26.780> try<00:07:27.020> and<00:07:27.170> lure<00:07:27.320> people

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
been leaving it to try and lure people

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.610 
been leaving it to try and lure people
and<00:07:28.070> to<00:07:28.580> attack<00:07:29.060> my<00:07:29.270> base<00:07:29.540> to<00:07:29.780> see<00:07:30.050> how<00:07:30.200> it<00:07:30.380> does

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620 
and to attack my base to see how it does

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.930 
and to attack my base to see how it does
so<00:07:31.840> that's<00:07:32.840> a<00:07:33.230> tactic<00:07:33.830> that<00:07:34.040> seems<00:07:34.310> that<00:07:34.580> works

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940 
so that's a tactic that seems that works

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.990 
so that's a tactic that seems that works
pretty<00:07:35.150> well<00:07:35.300> actually

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.810 

and<00:07:38.590> that<00:07:39.590> does<00:07:39.770> it<00:07:39.920> for<00:07:39.950> this<00:07:40.130> video<00:07:40.460> thanks

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820
