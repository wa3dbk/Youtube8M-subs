00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 speaks happily on the 7th of December 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.390
 2012 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.080
 valve fixed several players 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.030
 strong teams were tearing out the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.139
 hair that was day care 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.600
 the wd map and the game closed hl2 point x is 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.460
 to function and etc. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.390
 fortunately this was fixed then 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.710
 I decided to do 37 different actions for 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.990
 the weak graphics 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.150
 those people who do not have it are 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.230
 then the very weak 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.820
 computer 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.680
 the median charts for those 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.450
 people who have a computer but 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.719
 bacaninha who wants to take advantage of the graph 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.170
 tf and also enjoy the gain fps 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.539
 and the personal breakdown graph has 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.489
 Online computer and enjoy top 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.850
 the maximum that the team is strong and can 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.980
 provide in the game standard is not 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 enabled right good 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.609
 the links are in the description of the three and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.739
 so choose which one you want 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.949
 useful for your computer installation 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.049
 works like the others I've already done I'll get 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.909
 that of the weak and oppressed 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.619
 So will this little girl leave and what will 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.119
 three files is the helm is good you read 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.680
 here written 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.090
 the high and zac points fg and already the file 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.320
 What are you going to do with the folder? 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 configured 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.610
 but in case you want to configure come here 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.950
 edit preconfigured cef is here 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.049
 You'll be at your taste. 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.000
 It's okay to separate spray on such 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.009
 pressures for facial detail and case 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.880
 wanted to modify and has already modified vim 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:53.790
 here in file save as and we are going to 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.049
 open pampas to dictate high 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.340
 zac points and fg closes quotes 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.100
 the qualification is to us is to save nothing of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.820
 I work here 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.350
 You'll see how it is that's right here. 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.620
 and to send this high and zac is just 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.720
 pass steaua on 62 points 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:27.020
 program files achem sting sting 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:33.020
 maps your name on steam team fortress 2 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.950
 tf cfg then you will only drag 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.750
 for there 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.190
 If you have any, delete them and you're done. 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.260
 The second step you have to do 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.239
 this here รณ catch this is only 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.310
 command scheme full screen one window 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.580
 every sfg has a command the indifferent 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.620
 so be aware of that then 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.790
 when I was full or here to get the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.350
 full screen 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.500
 I copy open your sting 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.610
 I came here in team fortress 2 button 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.480
 right properties nothing general comes 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.030
 set boot options in this 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.340
 space here you will paste the command 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.630
 now the attention has lots of people coming 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.320
 here o 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.230
 this command here รณ - these level 81 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.359
 that's the command I got him it goes 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.470
 be used only once 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:34.519
 okay in which means it'll give ok 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.290
 here close and now you will tighten 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.019
 I 'm not going to press here in play. 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.470
 It might take a little time when 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:46.760
 open the game screen you will play 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:50.030
 nothing you guys are going to stay out come come 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.100
 again quint fortress 2 properties 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.760
 same place set 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.870
 start and will take this command the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.819
 took off soon 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.380
 ok close and now you can play 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.340
 quietly 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.549
 this is the basics of each cfg installation 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.639
 should be for everyone only watch out for the 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.930
 command command and that's it. 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.150
 I hope you guys have 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.460
 been quietly young without the 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:28.330
 crash problem that's it folks 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.330
 Thanks for the next video
