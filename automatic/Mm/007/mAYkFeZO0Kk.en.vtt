00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.170
 hello, let's make a paper pig 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.170
 we start from a square paper better pink 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.300
 clear and fold it in half you open it 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.630
 and fold again in half towards the 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.630
 center 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.000
 we will be this way you see with three 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.910
 folds inside 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.740
 well then now with the opening towards 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.630
 up we are going to go bending the tips 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.130
 inward to the center until the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.770
 opening 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.990
 the 4 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.170
 tighten well in the folds so that 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.649
 it is well closed and well folded 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.079
 Now look at the open and the folded 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.409
 this way 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.570
 I'm going to repeat it, we open it and we go back to 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.110
 paste so that a kind is formed 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.160
 of rhombus 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 with both sides 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.080
 and on the other side we have exactly what 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080
 same 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.800
 well next step is to fold it by the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.260
 half 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.990
 in this way 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.690
 and now the inside part of the triangle 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.130
 good if we double the triangle as 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.570
 you are seeing half of it so that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.810
 do not protrude below and these will be 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.280
 the legs 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.280
 we do it on both sides 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.730
 ok let's do now the tail for 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.830
 that we're going to fold the tip in half 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.720
 towards both sides to leave the form 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.360
 so that it is well marked 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.490
 open we push with the thumb towards 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.950
 in this is a little bit more 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.250
 complicated and we let the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.480
 puntita nothing more out 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.480
 to see a tail you see 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.960
 and now let's do something similar in the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.409
 front part to make the snout 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.409
 of the pig 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.320
 we double 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.740
 we open 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.689
 we take it to the center 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.789
 and we push back so that it 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.690
 has formed our snout I will repeat 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.760
 so you can see it we open 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.300
 and we take it to the center and push 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.910
 backwards so that it is centered 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.620
 just a little bit there is 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.300
 Well, we would have our little pig 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.460
 only in the absence of putting some eyes 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.460
 for example you can do with 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.170
 marker or how am I doing these 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.060
 3d eyes that move that seem to me 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.330
 very fun 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.040
 and here we have our paper piglet 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.870
 I leave you two other suggestions 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.970
 piggy but cardboard with a tube 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.950
 toilet paper and a horse if you 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.730
 like the videos subscribe and let me 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.120
 your comments 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.120
 goodbye
