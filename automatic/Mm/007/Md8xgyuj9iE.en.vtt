and i'm going to be taking my glue this
one<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> best<00:00:48.899> glue<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.860> I've<00:00:50.010> tried

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
one is not the best glue that I've tried

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.920 
one is not the best glue that I've tried
so<00:00:50.309> far<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.820> best<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.149> I've<00:00:51.329> used<00:00:51.360> was

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so far the best one that I've used was

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.459 
so far the best one that I've used was
doable<00:00:52.520> but<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.480> bought<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.260> I'm

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
doable but this one I bought it so I'm

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.560 
doable but this one I bought it so I'm
just<00:00:55.710> using<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.300> wouldn't

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
just using that so that way it wouldn't

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.069 
just using that so that way it wouldn't
make<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> waste<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.230> money<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
make a waste of money so what you do is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.509 
make a waste of money so what you do is
you<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> glue<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.609> put<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> on

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
you just get the glue and you put it on

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:21.680 
you just get the glue and you put it on
the<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:09.360> lash

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.850 

so<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:24.150> put<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> lash<00:01:24.900> appearance<00:01:25.680> on

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
so you put it on the lash appearance on

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.370 
so you put it on the lash appearance on
the<00:01:25.950> top<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.660> just<00:01:27.840> wait<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.290> dry

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the top and you just wait for it to dry

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.430 
the top and you just wait for it to dry
a<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.650> bit

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.290 

now<00:01:35.980> what<00:01:36.160> you<00:01:36.280> do<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.760> just<00:01:36.820> like<00:01:37.120> wait

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
now what you do is you just like wait

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.270 
now what you do is you just like wait
for<00:01:37.480> it<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.570> get<00:01:37.780> tacky<00:01:38.080> that<00:01:38.770> way<00:01:38.950> it's<00:01:39.100> more

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
for it to get tacky that way it's more

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.370 
for it to get tacky that way it's more
sticky<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:39.970> it'll<00:01:40.270> stick<00:01:40.510> better<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.050> ILA

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
sticky and it'll stick better to the ILA

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.220 
sticky and it'll stick better to the ILA
of<00:01:41.560> your<00:01:42.010> eyelid<00:01:42.400> because<00:01:42.640> if<00:01:42.760> not<00:01:42.910> then<00:01:43.750> it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
of your eyelid because if not then it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.620 
of your eyelid because if not then it
will<00:01:44.680> be<00:01:45.220> wet<00:01:45.520> still<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.090> it'll<00:01:46.270> just<00:01:46.480> be

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
will be wet still and it'll just be

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.350 
will be wet still and it'll just be
moving<00:01:46.930> all<00:01:46.990> over<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.290> place<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:48.120> then<00:01:49.120> if<00:01:49.270> it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
moving all over the place and then if it

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.510 
moving all over the place and then if it
gets<00:01:49.540> too<00:01:49.750> dry<00:01:50.020> then<00:01:50.710> it's<00:01:51.040> not<00:01:51.280> going<00:01:51.430> to

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
gets too dry then it's not going to

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.460 
gets too dry then it's not going to
stick<00:01:52.950> so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.490 

I<00:01:59.560> like<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.250> bend<00:02:00.670> mine<00:02:01.050> that<00:02:02.050> way<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.320> goes

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
I like to bend mine that way it goes

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.410 
I like to bend mine that way it goes
like<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:05.680> not<00:02:05.920> straight<00:02:06.490> when<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.030> goes<00:02:07.240> on

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
like it's not straight when it goes on

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:25.090 
like it's not straight when it goes on
the<00:02:07.480> eye

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.760 

ok

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
ok

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.810 
ok
so<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.800> as<00:02:29.950> close<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> lash<00:02:30.640> line

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
so just get it as close to the lash line

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.000 
so just get it as close to the lash line
as<00:02:31.120> possible<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:32.020> what<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.620> push<00:02:32.860> it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
as possible and what I do is I push it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.440 
as possible and what I do is I push it
on<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.220> middle<00:02:33.370> first<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.820> then<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:34.000> go<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
on the middle first and then I go on the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:49.080 
on the middle first and then I go on the
end<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.840> then<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.080> push<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:35.560> that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.509 

and<00:02:49.209> then<00:02:49.840> once<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:50.349> like<00:02:50.530> all<00:02:50.739> on<00:02:51.010> there<00:02:51.310> I

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
and then once it's like all on there I

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:18.610 
and then once it's like all on there I
just<00:02:52.180> put<00:02:52.900> grab<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.379> lashes<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:53.920> push<00:02:54.220> it

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:36.850 

seems<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:19.640> it's<00:03:19.849> unmask<00:03:20.269> so

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.220 

ok<00:03:37.750> now

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.509 

so<00:03:42.390> now<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.959> way<00:03:44.140> we're<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:45.010> glue<00:03:45.280> went

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
so now that way we're like the glue went

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.030 
so now that way we're like the glue went
over<00:03:45.819> um<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:50.140> what<00:03:50.260> kind<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.530> messes<00:03:50.890> up<00:03:51.010> your

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
over um and what kind of messes up your

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.949 
over um and what kind of messes up your
