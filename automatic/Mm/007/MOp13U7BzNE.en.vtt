00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to you with you and this is my 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.450
 The first tutorial in which I would like for you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.189
 tell like u son faders for 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
 minecraft absolutely on any version 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.809
 absolutely on any texture pack essence 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.880
 The way is that we just 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.400
 we swing standard configuration of shaders 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.050
 On the version we need, let's say I downloaded 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 day 4 5 on 1 4 7 and download my archive 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.359
 I will leave it under the video link in it 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.240
 there will be shaders ultra configuration then 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.309
 repairing shaders from version 125 we just 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.170
 import how to do it i will show you 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.210
 it's very simple and easy 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.110
 for this we go to the wall site 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.460
 maycroft maycro forum. no in section 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.670
 mods forum 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.149
 This is Maykroft mods and go to the list 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.730
 of mods 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 so you come here and you have the police 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.629
 such a huge topic with mods and we 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.469
 we enter we press control of and we enter g 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 hp and we have the same ls-l shader smog 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:10.140
 and g &amp; g and doors of we need to anneal 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.159
 shader of the words we go in there and further we 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.650
 should open the spoiler 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.770
 so in it we will see a dls sasha doors of 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.430
 147 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.549
 but this version of my minecraft if u 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.060
 you version 145 then you need here 145 or 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.100
 146 we download 147 latest version 117 and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 swing optifine under it necessarily 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.090
 see here only work with versions 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.950
 hd b3 b4 this is sure we go there 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.310
 so while we come in we swing the shaders 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.689
 configuration itself standards that is here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.350
 and now open older version 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.729
 so here we will have optifine 146 hd 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.780
 you by 4 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:11.060
 we need it we swing waiting for five seconds 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:15.160
 and swing skip ads swing so 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.860
 Well, we downloaded open both archives 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.620
 so now go to the appdata folder then 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.940
 there is a folder where is the reddest 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.590
 open the minecraft folder 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.380
 open the bin folder and open mikroft i 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.580
 so in it we see the folder my time we delete 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.010
 because without it we cannot 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.620
 run the mod itself so we were shaders 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.340
 so and now we are first with us first 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.360
 deed necessarily optifine so transferable 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:52.180
 all this here and then verbally 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:59.150
 standard shader configuration and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.280
 now test it in the game so and so 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.680
 but we close create randomly 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.000
 generating a generating world and now 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.260
 of the castle i mean i imagine 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.299
 standard configuration standard 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.049
 configuration it is that 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.470
 we have no light effects no shadows no 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.290
 dynamic lighting but we have 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:28.370
 moving foliage and move foliage on 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.590
 trees and everything so well now about whom 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.030
 I wanted to show you what you are 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.840
 ultra config shaders for this we 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.560
 exit minecraft so open 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.220
 minecraft folder itself and open my 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.690
 archive 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:53.600
 pits will leave a link to it under the video there 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:56.900
 there will be two folders texture patch and and daddy 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.780
 ultra config we go into ultra config 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.069
 there will be a folder shader again transferred to 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:09.719
 Minecraft folder replace if we do 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:14.969
 not so move the replacement so everything is so 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:18.150
 now we open the texture patch and guys 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:21.329
 one thing but if you if you use 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.550
 your texture pack more precisely non-standard you 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.210
 capturing the texture pack folder you have 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.800
 minecraft and archive my addon for sure 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.050
 why 10 rs5 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.849
 you open your texture pack on me 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.669
 now there is no fossa with the usual 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.530
 textures are somehow done well and 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.810
 words for now how to do in others 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.740
 textures you open your texture pack 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.900
 archive and just transfer this one more precisely 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.030
 archive contents addon for syoss 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.099
 city ​​1 5 transfer your texture pack and 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.900
 everything 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.580
 if you use standard 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.539
 textures mikroft then you open 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.430
 Mycroft Yar 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:04.440
 and transfer everything there it is done here 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:07.050
 so so all well and now you will see 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.830
 differences between standard config 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.159
 shaders and ultra so again we close 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.280
 this window 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:20.430
 we go our world and we see that we have everything 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.740
 very beautiful lighting moves the grass 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.159
 dynamic shadows dynamic lighting 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.889
 in general everything is very beautiful everything is super well 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:32.159
 this is the way plus y 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.680
 us again nevada as you see here 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.479
 us so beautiful realistic moves 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.370
 the foliage is all super 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:43.470
 but guys and this version of this config 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.020
 for shaders, it requires a very powerful 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.500
 comp and I would not advise becoming a weak 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.530
 car well and that's it 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.539
 on this i say goodbye soon what is 10 15 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.150
 days guys and lower the second card this 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.660
 hunter pj will also be version 10 beta 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.840
 they will have many different quests 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.570
 Dragons will not even be in the typical enpisi 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.760
 buildings and that's all for now 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.220
