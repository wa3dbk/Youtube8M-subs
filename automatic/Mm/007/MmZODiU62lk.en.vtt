Arctic ceremonial indie games and then
these<00:00:47.109> dragons<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.890> technology<00:00:48.609> that<00:00:48.640> we

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
these dragons the technology that we

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.910 
these dragons the technology that we
have<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.089> dinosaurs<00:00:49.629> was<00:00:49.780> outstanding<00:00:50.469> this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
have the dinosaurs was outstanding this

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.000 
have the dinosaurs was outstanding this
is<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.210> much<00:00:52.420> better<00:00:52.660> it's<00:00:53.289> been<00:00:53.530> said<00:00:53.800> by<00:00:53.949> the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
is so much better it's been said by the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.579 
is so much better it's been said by the
design<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.429> the<00:00:54.640> dinosaurs<00:00:55.210> on<00:00:55.390> steroids<00:00:56.050> they

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
design of the dinosaurs on steroids they

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.919 
design of the dinosaurs on steroids they
have<00:00:56.739> so<00:00:57.039> many<00:00:57.070> things<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.820> is<00:00:57.969> so<00:00:58.239> cool<00:00:58.719> and

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
have so many things and is so cool and

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.110 
have so many things and is so cool and
revolutionary<00:00:59.679> about

the roof there's a hundred tons of
equipment<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.860> these<00:01:14.190> concentric<00:01:14.790> circles

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
equipment all these concentric circles

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.930 
equipment all these concentric circles
are<00:01:15.570> saying<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.649> have<00:01:17.009> dragons<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
are saying here all have dragons and

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.930 
are saying here all have dragons and
people<00:01:18.509> vying<00:01:18.930> often<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> dinosaurs<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
people vying often with the dinosaurs I

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.490 
people vying often with the dinosaurs I
think<00:01:21.119> people<00:01:21.270> simply<00:01:21.750> awestruck<00:01:21.990> by<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
think people simply awestruck by the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.100 
think people simply awestruck by the
size<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.399> scale<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> elegance<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
size and the scale and the elegance and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.910 
size and the scale and the elegance and
then<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.830> technology<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.610> guess<00:01:27.259> with<00:01:28.259> dragons

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
then the technology I guess with dragons

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.330 
then the technology I guess with dragons
we've<00:01:29.430> got<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.850> cast<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.659> human<00:01:31.290> beings<00:01:31.710> 24
