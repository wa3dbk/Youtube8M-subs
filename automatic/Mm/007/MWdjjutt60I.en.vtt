00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
stuff wrote all the songs by himself so

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.089 
stuff wrote all the songs by himself so
if<00:00:27.570> there's<00:00:27.750> 10<00:00:27.960> people<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.619> it's

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
if there's 10 people you know it's it's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.470 
if there's 10 people you know it's it's
tough<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.910> know<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> Freddie<00:00:30.420> Mercury

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
tough you know if the Freddie Mercury

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.600 
tough you know if the Freddie Mercury
could<00:00:31.439> write<00:00:31.590> songs<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.160> person<00:00:32.369> but

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
could write songs with one person but

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.240 
could write songs with one person but
these<00:00:32.700> people<00:00:32.910> need<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.239> 10

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
these people need like 10

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
these people need like 10
it's<00:00:35.250> next-level<00:00:35.700> stuff<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.320> pretty

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it's next-level stuff so it's pretty

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
it's next-level stuff so it's pretty
safe<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> assume<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> wanted<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.510> do

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
safe to assume so what I wanted to do

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.209 
safe to assume so what I wanted to do
was<00:00:39.809> show<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.050> guys<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.620> write<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> pop

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
was show you guys how to write a pop

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.540 
was show you guys how to write a pop
song

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
song

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.970 
song
in<00:00:42.210> seconds<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.200> probably<00:00:43.500> hard<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.739> believe

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
in seconds it's probably hard to believe

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.770 
in seconds it's probably hard to believe
I'm<00:00:44.730> sure<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.059> write<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> music<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
I'm sure you write the music to it and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
I'm sure you write the music to it and
this<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> tough<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.700> look<00:00:50.850> at

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
this was a tough one so if you look at

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.160 
this was a tough one so if you look at
the<00:00:51.090> computer<00:00:52.100> screen<00:00:53.120> here<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:55.020> probably

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the computer screen here you probably

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.380 
the computer screen here you probably
can't<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.620> too<00:00:55.860> well<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
can't see it too well but you can see a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.599 
can't see it too well but you can see a
little<00:00:57.539> bit<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.039> literally<00:00:59.489> spent

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
little bit of it now I literally spent

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.660 
little bit of it now I literally spent
10<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:03.239> 15<00:01:03.870> seconds

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
10 to 15 seconds

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330 
10 to 15 seconds
finding<00:01:06.270> these<00:01:06.420> loops<00:01:06.890> like<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.950> said<00:01:08.100> no<00:01:08.220> more

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
finding these loops like I said no more

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
finding these loops like I said no more
instruments<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.240> stuff's<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:10.560> don't<00:01:10.710> need

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
instruments that stuff's we don't need

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.899 
instruments that stuff's we don't need
understand<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.460> show<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.610> how<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.729> play<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
guitar or something like that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.130 
guitar or something like that
ain't<00:01:13.830> nobody<00:01:14.130> got<00:01:14.280> time<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.299> well

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
ain't nobody got time for that so well

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380 
ain't nobody got time for that so well
we<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.650> our<00:01:17.070> two<00:01:17.159> loops<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.909> figured<00:01:18.299> out

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
we have our two loops that I figured out

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.380 
we have our two loops that I figured out
that<00:01:19.110> um<00:01:19.439> sound<00:01:19.979> good<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:21.000> tough<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that um sound good it was really tough I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
that um sound good it was really tough I
clicked<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.229> dragged<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.860> over<00:01:22.979> here

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
clicked it and I dragged it over here

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609 
clicked it and I dragged it over here
and<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.310> dropped<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.140> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.290> our<00:01:25.409> song<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and I dropped it and this is our song I

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.789 
and I dropped it and this is our song I
was<00:01:25.920> gonna<00:01:26.009> add<00:01:26.189> more<00:01:26.369> parts<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.799> you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
was gonna add more parts to it but you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.490 
was gonna add more parts to it but you
know<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.610> seems<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.030> enough<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.380> we

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
know this seems like enough so what we

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.069 
know this seems like enough so what we
do<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.799> once<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.600> we<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.990> over

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
do is once we have it we just go over

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.539 
do is once we have it we just go over
everything<00:01:34.439> more<00:01:34.680> loops<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.310> said<00:01:35.490> this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
everything more loops like I said this

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.670 
everything more loops like I said this
is<00:01:35.670> gonna<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.939> more<00:01:36.270> than<00:01:36.329> enough<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:37.560> gonna

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is gonna be more than enough it's gonna

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.730 
is gonna be more than enough it's gonna
take<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> drag<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.420> don't<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.900> however

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
take it drag it I don't know however

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.260 
take it drag it I don't know however
long<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:43.729> I'll<00:01:44.729> drag<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.090> over<00:01:45.119> here

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
long we want and I'll drag it over here

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.719 
long we want and I'll drag it over here
and<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> make<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.610> crazy<00:01:49.729> I'm

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and I think just to make it crazy I'm

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.530 
and I think just to make it crazy I'm
gonna<00:01:50.909> scoot<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:52.640> three<00:01:53.640> let's<00:01:54.420> do

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
gonna scoot this one out three let's do
