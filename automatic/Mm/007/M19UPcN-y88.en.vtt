particular looks kind of random sitting
up<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.550> does<00:00:59.850> separate<00:01:00.420> it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
up there but it just it does separate it

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.709

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
modifications but it is ever so slightly

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.850 
modifications but it is ever so slightly
power<00:01:15.000> more<00:01:15.299> powerful<00:01:15.780> due<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> fact<00:01:16.770> that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
power more powerful due to the fact that

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.280 
power more powerful due to the fact that
I<00:01:17.009> was<00:01:17.100> different<00:01:17.220> exhaust<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.119> other<00:01:19.020> minor

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
I was different exhaust and other minor

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.090 
I was different exhaust and other minor
changes<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:22.049> other<00:01:22.290> my<00:01:22.530> stove<00:01:22.860> is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
changes like that the other my stove is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
changes like that the other my stove is
I<00:01:24.060> believe<00:01:24.240> orange<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:24.930> that's<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> only

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
I believe orange I think that's the only

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.859 
I believe orange I think that's the only
colour<00:01:25.590> comes<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.150> sold<00:01:27.600> very

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
colour comes in and it's not sold very

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.240 
colour comes in and it's not sold very
often<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.470> more<00:01:28.590> likely<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.950> find<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
often so you're more likely to find the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.520 
often so you're more likely to find the
S<00:01:29.369> tune<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.530> started<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
S tune so if we get started here on the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.760 
S tune so if we get started here on the
outside<00:01:34.530> detail<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.530> head

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
outside detail you can see that head

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
outside detail you can see that head
like<00:01:37.979> there's<00:01:38.310> there's<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.240> peg<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.689> not

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
like there's there's little peg it's not

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.060 
like there's there's little peg it's not
too<00:01:40.850> invasive<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:43.259> sticking

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
too invasive because it's not sticking

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.330 
too invasive because it's not sticking
right<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.780> bulb<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> bulb

you just can't go down you know what I

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.790 
you just can't go down you know what I

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
mean so it does lack very some good

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.390 
mean so it does lack very some good
detail<00:04:41.190> there<00:04:45.110> underneath<00:04:46.110> not<00:04:46.830> lacking<00:04:47.100> any

good<00:04:47.639> detail<00:04:48.000> because<00:04:48.240> it's<00:04:48.620> pretty<00:04:49.620> good<00:04:49.919> the

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
good detail because it's pretty good the
