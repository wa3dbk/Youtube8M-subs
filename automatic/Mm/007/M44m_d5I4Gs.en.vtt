better wildlife photographs get up in

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.519 
better wildlife photographs get up in
the<00:00:27.349> dark<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:28.029> don't<00:00:29.029> expect<00:00:29.419> to<00:00:29.599> go<00:00:29.779> home

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
the dark and don't expect to go home

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.770 
the dark and don't expect to go home
before<00:00:30.829> it's<00:00:31.189> dark<00:00:31.430> some<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.449> most

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
before it's dark some of the most

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.110 
before it's dark some of the most
special<00:00:33.230> light<00:00:33.559> is<00:00:33.829> happening<00:00:34.280> just<00:00:34.730> before

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
special light is happening just before

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.220 
special light is happening just before
sunset<00:00:35.420> in<00:00:35.870> just<00:00:36.710> after<00:00:36.949> sunset<00:00:37.600> often<00:00:38.600> the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
sunset in just after sunset often the

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.899 
sunset in just after sunset often the
light<00:00:39.409> becomes<00:00:39.739> more<00:00:40.070> neutral<00:00:40.610> you<00:00:40.730> don't

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
light becomes more neutral you don't

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.030 
light becomes more neutral you don't
have<00:00:41.089> that<00:00:41.239> extreme<00:00:41.540> contrast<00:00:42.290> anymore<00:00:42.800> and

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
have that extreme contrast anymore and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.729 
have that extreme contrast anymore and
so<00:00:43.610> this<00:00:44.329> will<00:00:44.570> actually<00:00:45.019> give<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.500> beautiful

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
so this will actually give a beautiful

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.210 
so this will actually give a beautiful
alpenglow<00:00:46.579> or<00:00:47.089> just<00:00:47.780> like<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.170> shimmering<00:00:48.829> rose

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
alpenglow or just like a shimmering rose

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.189 
alpenglow or just like a shimmering rose
color<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.879> sky<00:00:50.149> without<00:00:50.570> having<00:00:50.930> harsh

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
color in the sky without having harsh

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.229 
color in the sky without having harsh
contrast<00:00:51.530> on<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.189> landscape<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:53.059> might

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
contrast on the landscape that you might

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.240 
contrast on the landscape that you might
have<00:00:53.449> in<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.659> foreground<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:54.439> I<00:00:54.890> think<00:00:55.129> that's

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
have in the foreground so I think that's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.890 
have in the foreground so I think that's
probably<00:00:55.460> one<00:00:55.729> of<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.939> most<00:00:56.180> important

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
probably one of the most important

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.350 
probably one of the most important
things<00:00:57.080> for<00:00:57.199> me<00:00:57.500> as<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.710> photographer<00:00:58.360> and

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
your own photography what I find really

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.570 
your own photography what I find really
important<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:42.080> analyze<00:01:42.580> images

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
important is that you analyze images

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.130 
important is that you analyze images
that<00:01:43.729> you're<00:01:43.909> really<00:01:44.120> impressed<00:01:44.630> with<00:01:44.900> and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
understand what did the photographer do

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.820 
understand what did the photographer do
here<00:01:48.170> was<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.520> lens<00:01:49.729> he<00:01:49.970> chose<00:01:50.270> was<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.260> you

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
know the composition was it waiting for

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.310 
know the composition was it waiting for
this<00:01:54.680> specific<00:01:55.430> moment<00:01:55.640> what<00:01:56.360> was<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.020> is

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
this specific moment what was it that is

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.620 
this specific moment what was it that is
so<00:01:57.740> appealing<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.370> this<00:01:58.520> image<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.090> then

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
so appealing in this image and then

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.170 
so appealing in this image and then
taking<00:02:00.049> such<00:02:00.260> elements<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.130> bringing<00:02:01.940> them

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
taking such elements and bringing them

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.320 
taking such elements and bringing them
to<00:02:02.840> your<00:02:03.080> photography<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.130> what<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:04.940> think<00:02:05.060> is

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
to your photography and what I think is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.210 
to your photography and what I think is
really<00:02:05.540> important<00:02:06.080> about<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.860> that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
really important about that and that

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.770 
really important about that and that
might<00:02:07.400> sometimes<00:02:08.060> happen<00:02:08.390> often<00:02:08.569> in

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
might sometimes happen often in

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.930 
might sometimes happen often in
landscape<00:02:09.229> photography<00:02:09.379> don't<00:02:10.099> try<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.489> copy

landscape photography don't try to copy

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.380 
landscape photography don't try to copy
in<00:02:11.360> an<00:02:11.989> image<00:02:12.769> exactly<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:13.549> not<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.000> point

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
in an image exactly that's not the point
