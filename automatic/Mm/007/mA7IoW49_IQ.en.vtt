00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 you to want sarrazac so today 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.670
 for a brand new video a pack 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.859
 opening so there are jumbo packs 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.200
 first gold we will try to go 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.150
 why not hayat would have a shape in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.849
 any case I wish for my part 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.170
 so 15,000 credit for a step that I 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.740
 think we're going to eat a lot 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.580
 go it's gone the first pack it 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 we need heavy here because 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.359
 frankly the last steps copied neither 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.250
 it's really shit but frankly 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 it's a phew thing 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.920
 you really have to hit a good little 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.980
 player because frankly that's 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.950
 more possible to the first packs 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.210
 okay so kagawa 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.090
 rotten people prove not that shit 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.010
 frankly it belongs duplicates of 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.600
 sea style cards which frankly 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.280
 after easter of kawa shit it's up to 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.570
 parents thing to go second pack 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.010
 it's gone fucking it belongs fast there 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.720
 we can pack them to the video will last 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.309
 not too long 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.550
 go go go go go we need 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.900
 the heavy second pack ex go to fucking 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.650
 andy carroll waouh 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.320
 great what did we have at tea from the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.500
 constant shit good it's always that and 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.790
 at the level not bad otherwise a second pack 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.060
 shit I think you agree 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.869
 it takes the heavy more possible the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.830
 third pack go there I'm going I'm going 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.210
 leave kinematics because 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.790
 frankly it's more possible in the east 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.220
 williams ah that's not bad that yes yes yes 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.020
 finally a good player there I'm happy 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.330
 or yann hoof know a lot good ben I 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.800
 think are taken to pretty much dropped but 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.259
 it must be within ten fifteen minutes 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.960
 I think that's always it 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.840
 frankly average it's nice 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.030
 after good 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.359
 a money pack will all die in the end 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.270
 video it's a good pack go 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:57.299
 there we continue our momentum 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.509
 fourth pack to fucking must heavy 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:08.489

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:12.599
 ah whore totti the audi two italians no 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.780
 but they do not want to twice in puy 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.239
 it's carts what aulas johnny 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.890
 aubert time so frankly not that 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.440
 it's a crappy pack again been dyed 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.819
 tanned the fifth step we need it 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.370
 must heavy yaya turned a shape so 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.519
 possibiliÃ© it will be a very very very 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.900
 nice gift it'll be hot but it 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.489
 must try it must try 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.690
 frankly there give me something 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.980
 we will leave the kinematics because 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.470
 that apparently with williams had 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.920
 market 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.379

 front pack it's anything it's 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.910
 anything so fucking plus it's worth 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 that dal link times he has two stars of 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.720
 technical gesture is still hot 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.440
 not even even what it was 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.290

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.970
 to eat shit that really gives me 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.500
 not want to all schedules I think 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.840

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.800
 mores 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.860
 damn it's not true that it had to be 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.819
 he forms 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.220

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.180
 azpilicueta okay it's not too bad 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.860
 frankly it's a pleasure to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.769
 to catch 1.85 is not always theirs 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.750
 arrive but it's not worth much 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.640
 frankly me that to parents thing 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.010
 after good it's a good step we will not 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.140
 to hide it because of the sea packs we have 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.459
 more often 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.700
 raphael that's a good little player 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.780
 will keep otherwise the rest his parents 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.420
 things there too so 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.640
 oh fuck it sucks anyway we go 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.480
 leave the kinematics anyway for 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.250
 this last pack 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.319
 I did not even want to smile all your 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.579
 eat shit and we shop in shop 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.200
 ah fucking lead larch good it was 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.959
 it's still not worth it 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.269
 thing but that's still it 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.390
 if the cnl de reuil de julio cesar en 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.960
 toronto version it's up to parents things 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.790
 there too I think 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.080
 we have two thousand credit that's always it 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.450
 and then we're going to finish the video we're going 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.810
 open last to go there last 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.390
 pack 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.760
 well there it feels these pitfalls of the bonus on 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.460
 will not hit the heavy if I type honey for 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.380
 more people that would be anything short 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.650
 go hop last step we have we have we have 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.700
 shit at the passage more luck of 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.830
 find rhythm nor sister and this 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.840
 week I say hello to 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.050
 crime so if I had not seen his 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.940
 pack opening he grabbed that same game at 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.290
 ruud van nistelrooy so played very the 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.000
 link in the description for those who 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.530
 wish to see it 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.930
 frankly it really was luck 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.700
 he had during the packs opening 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.600
 free picked we had offered he has 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.730
 managed to catch anyway 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.200
 congratulations yes because I would have 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.060
 dreamed of beating good people it's not 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.760
 every day that it happens and I think 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.610
 that it will never happen in any case good 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.170
 we will try not worry there 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.860
 pretty rest of time will bring together the 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.060
 heavy in the bins 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.170
 so here I hope it really did 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.760
 more if it's the case invites you to 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.440
