game you have to exit the main menu to

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.979 
game you have to exit the main menu to
change<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.970> resolution<00:02:21.299> i'm<00:02:21.720> going<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
change the resolution i'm going to

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.369 
change the resolution i'm going to
change<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.409> to<00:02:22.650> 1080p<00:02:23.459> right<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:25.170> show

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
change it to 1080p right here to show

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.009 
change it to 1080p right here to show
you<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.950> difference<00:02:26.519> between<00:02:26.720> 1440p<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
you the difference between 1440p and

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.940 
you the difference between 1440p and
1080p<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.430> we're<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.819> look<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.950> guess

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
1080p and we're going to look I guess

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.860 
1080p and we're going to look I guess
we're<00:02:32.160> going<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.370> compare<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.660> this

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
we're going to compare it in this

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.630 
we're going to compare it in this
direction<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:35.040> direction<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:37.640> 6657

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
direction and in this direction so 6657

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.729 
direction and in this direction so 6657
to<00:02:38.730> 60fps<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:40.310> about<00:02:41.310> 30<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.060> 31<00:02:42.989> FPS<00:02:43.560> right

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
to 60fps and about 30 to 31 FPS right

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.710 
to 60fps and about 30 to 31 FPS right
here<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.010> I'll<00:02:44.129> be<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.579> back<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.239> change<00:02:45.569> it

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
here so I'll be right back and change it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.039 
here so I'll be right back and change it
to<00:02:45.780> 1080p<00:02:46.610> alright<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.910> i'm<00:02:47.970> back<00:02:48.329> in<00:02:48.360> pretty

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
to 1080p alright so i'm back in pretty

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.039 
to 1080p alright so i'm back in pretty
much<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.260> exact<00:02:49.950> same<00:02:50.370> spot<00:02:50.609> i<00:02:51.269> think<00:02:51.750> i'm<00:02:51.959> not

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
much the exact same spot i think i'm not

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.470 
much the exact same spot i think i'm not
sure<00:02:52.290> actually<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.950> might<00:02:53.160> not<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:54.359> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
sure actually it might not be but it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.180 
sure actually it might not be but it
doesn't<00:02:54.780> really<00:02:54.870> matter<00:02:55.079> there<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.680> pretty

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
doesn't really matter there it's pretty

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.360 
doesn't really matter there it's pretty
much<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.340> same<00:02:56.640> FPS<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.480> around<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:59.129> as<00:02:59.280> you

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
much the same FPS all around and as you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.650 
much the same FPS all around and as you
can<00:02:59.459> see<00:02:59.489> if<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.060> look<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.329> this<00:03:00.480> direction

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
can see if I look in this direction

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.180 
can see if I look in this direction
which<00:03:01.079> is<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.410> same<00:03:01.620> direction<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:02.010> looked

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
which is the same direction I looked

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.680 
which is the same direction I looked
before<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.549> get<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.569> exact<00:03:03.930> same<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:04.379> in<00:03:04.620> 1440p

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
before I get the exact same as in 1440p

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.490 
before I get the exact same as in 1440p
62<00:03:06.690> FPS<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:07.739> direction<00:03:08.269> 31<00:03:09.269> 32<00:03:09.599> so

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
62 FPS and in this direction 31 32 so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.900 
62 FPS and in this direction 31 32 so
its<00:03:10.790> exact<00:03:11.790> same<00:03:12.060> performance<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:13.220> get<00:03:14.220> when

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
its exact same performance I get when

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.319 
its exact same performance I get when
I'm<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.440> let's<00:03:16.440> see<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:16.889> 1080p<00:03:17.639> you<00:03:18.180> see

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
I'm in let's see here 1080p you see

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.580 
I'm in let's see here 1080p you see
their<00:03:18.510> 1080p<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.519> exact<00:03:20.519> same<00:03:20.669> settings<00:03:21.030> here

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
their 1080p and exact same settings here

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.900 
their 1080p and exact same settings here
so<00:03:22.590> yeah<00:03:22.799> 14<00:03:23.430> 14<00:03:23.639> 1080p<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.389> no<00:03:24.690> difference<00:03:25.230> and

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
so yeah 14 14 1080p is no difference and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.879 
so yeah 14 14 1080p is no difference and
1440p<00:03:26.910> should<00:03:27.900> be<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> huge<00:03:28.380> difference<00:03:28.650> for

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
1440p should be a huge difference for

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.420 
1440p should be a huge difference for
the<00:03:29.099> four<00:03:29.280> piece<00:03:29.510> not<00:03:30.510> entirely<00:03:31.130> double<00:03:32.130> the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the four piece not entirely double the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.199 
the four piece not entirely double the
amount<00:03:33.150> of<00:03:33.450> pixels<00:03:33.630> as<00:03:33.959> 1080p<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.590> almost<00:03:35.209> so

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
amount of pixels as 1080p but almost so

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.050 
amount of pixels as 1080p but almost so
should<00:03:36.450> be<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.569> big<00:03:36.870> difference<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.739> if<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.880> turn

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
should be a big difference and if I turn

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.170 
should be a big difference and if I turn
up<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.359> settings<00:03:39.569> too<00:03:39.810> high<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:40.910> get<00:03:41.910> around

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
up the settings too high I get around

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.920 
up the settings too high I get around
maybe<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.959> 5<00:03:43.230> FPS<00:03:43.470> difference<00:03:44.750> close<00:03:45.750> to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
maybe a 5 FPS difference close to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.110 
maybe a 5 FPS difference close to
nothing<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.519> doesn't<00:03:47.669> really<00:03:47.849> matter

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
nothing so it doesn't really matter

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.440 
nothing so it doesn't really matter
where<00:03:48.569> I<00:03:48.599> have<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.079> settings<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:50.040> it's<00:03:50.849> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
where I have the settings and it's the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.599 
where I have the settings and it's the
same<00:03:51.690> poor<00:03:51.989> performance<00:03:52.590> all<00:03:52.859> around<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:56.370> yeah

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
same poor performance all around so yeah

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.199 
same poor performance all around so yeah
that's<00:03:57.480> not<00:03:58.349> fun<00:03:58.620> at<00:03:58.859> all<00:03:58.919> I<00:03:59.160> would<00:03:59.609> not

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
that's not fun at all I would not

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.819 
that's not fun at all I would not
suggest<00:04:00.419> you<00:04:00.780> buying<00:04:01.169> the<00:04:01.379> game<00:04:01.530> right<00:04:01.769> now

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
suggest you buying the game right now

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.069 
suggest you buying the game right now
I'm<00:04:02.280> hoping<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.389> just<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:05.250> mistake

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
I'm hoping that it's just a mistake

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.020 
I'm hoping that it's just a mistake
obviously<00:04:07.079> it's<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.709> mistake<00:04:08.069> but<00:04:08.430> I'm<00:04:08.669> hoping

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
obviously it's a mistake but I'm hoping

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.640 
obviously it's a mistake but I'm hoping
that<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:10.019> some<00:04:11.389> some<00:04:12.389> launch<00:04:12.900> issue<00:04:13.230> and

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
that the it's some some launch issue and

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.240 
that the it's some some launch issue and
that<00:04:13.680> they<00:04:14.639> didn't<00:04:14.970> know<00:04:15.090> about<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.569> before

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
that they didn't know about it before

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.610 
that they didn't know about it before
because<00:04:17.250> PewDiePie<00:04:18.180> ethics<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.260> other

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620
