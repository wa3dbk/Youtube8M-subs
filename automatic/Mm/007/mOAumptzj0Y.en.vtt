you<00:00:12.809> know<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> spring<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.380> already<00:00:13.530> there

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
you know the spring is already there

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.440 
you know the spring is already there
it's<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.099> 3d<00:00:14.400> printed<00:00:14.759> into<00:00:14.880> one<00:00:15.120> single

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
it's all 3d printed into one single

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.330 
it's all 3d printed into one single
piece<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.320> need<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.949> thing<00:00:16.980> to

piece but you need to do one thing to
make<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.609> work<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.410> will<00:00:19.560> see<00:00:19.740> that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
make it work which is you will see that

make it work which is you will see that
comes<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.789> pre<00:00:21.210> rotated<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:21.900> bit

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
comes with this pre rotated a little bit

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.470 
comes with this pre rotated a little bit
where<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.920> cannot<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.369> any<00:00:23.519> numbers<00:00:23.910> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
will need to lift this tab and pass this

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.960 
will need to lift this tab and pass this
bump<00:00:27.720> underneath<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:29.490> will<00:00:29.609> give<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
bump underneath and that will give it a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.870 
bump underneath and that will give it a
little<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.330> pressure<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.900> whenever<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
little more pressure so whenever you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.270 
little more pressure so whenever you
turn<00:00:32.880> it'll<00:00:33.420> snap<00:00:33.630> right<00:00:33.930> back<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.739> stop

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
turn it'll snap right back and just stop

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.569 
turn it'll snap right back and just stop
right<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:35.969> tab<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.160> made<00:00:38.399> for
