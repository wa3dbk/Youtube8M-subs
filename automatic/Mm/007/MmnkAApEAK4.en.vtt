00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.530
 Los Angeles 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.779
 but my dad 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.939
 rosalie seat is she pulls out of the air that upper lip is most dangerous 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.589
 Oxford have already seen 9 more than half the first half 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:27.980
 with only bigger 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.560
 have the mess 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 multiple errors than good passes 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.820
 but you can also just worry 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.820
 the top of the rankings 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.170
 let go of opportunities it was the first real big chance 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.910
 this match after the anp thus looks reasonable on combination 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.050
 of the so-called waregem life 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 it sat there that among the dealers those boats were before I got those roelandts 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.300
 folder to not touch it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.380
 mabel role as the open shooting opportunity 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.380
 I take the ball at the intersection 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.840
 for my dad you get the comedy and foil and then we have at the moment 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.480
 he has a goal attempt 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.370
 hence her child 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.370
 who doesn't love dibi for the rest 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.250
 thijsse this is true misunderstanding with a win that ball could still support 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.230
 attracts 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.370
 and in it are primarily peacock oil 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.230
 don't push that ball down 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.630
 and so we have in the last five minutes of this 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.630
 awakening the first half a bit 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.330
 thus see in the west corner for the terneuzense of the zulu waregem goalkeeper 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
 bossut without ever being threatened 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.739
 has been a second pole 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.799
 with a pokÃ©mon bull well 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.799
 this was a chance for DJ 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.239
 juliette lewis good plans from barnier 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.489
 to know about that too but this was a real chance the second 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.089
 in a minute and this is how the second half starts 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.709
 a lot more interesting than the whole of the first half has been 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.869
 he plays around them stay 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.039
 he does think it cannot be this the senegalese of Zulu Waregem 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.589
 Experience left my father well and I sharply gave up this afternoon 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:03.059
 touched 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.079
 in that context 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.079
 the penalty kick was for whistle 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.079
 then the violation goes 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.069
 olufade cut down your direct capture and then he has that little bit of stone b 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.939
 can charge and that will not take place 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.269
 this competition is now completely loose 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:27.879
 a small child comes one that just 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.259
 after they hit the market 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.420
 two and good chances 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.529
 we have preud'homme 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.659
 I realized that 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.459
 kempen bit meeval has 4 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.459
 the netherlands occupied by gangs 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.109
 there is for me 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.329
 yes that was the first thing you do known there 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:05.099
 it's great that the ball let the attacker know via e-mail 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.249
 in the bots 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.269
 And then the forest sees a complete no chance 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.569
 and the corpse worked more in this competition 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.699
 less than half an hour to play 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.699
 helena decisive fold 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.479
 the tomb or neighborhood can try the action in the shed 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.550
 how the ball 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.550
 roelandts don't believe it 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.680
 at the finish 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.139
 this was certainly done 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.770
 because the measure was full there 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.190
 and similarly, a waregem is now coming a second time close to the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.150
 connection goal 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.590
 though it has the greatest difficulty getting near you 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.590
 especially the youth casuistry come this was a good chance for some toll 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.830
 full of dj and dam again 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.020
 the title waste 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.249
 Freddie Mac Lucas de Witstraat debate 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.749
 the boss while
