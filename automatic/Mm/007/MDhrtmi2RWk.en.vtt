thing I did is I'm going to be using a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.260 
thing I did is I'm going to be using a
router<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.570> create<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.870> jig<00:00:16.220> so<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.119> my

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
router to create a jig so this is my

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.599 
router to create a jig so this is my
regular<00:00:18.449> Porter<00:00:18.810> cable<00:00:19.140> router<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.590> why<00:00:20.580> I

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
regular Porter cable router and why I

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.670 
regular Porter cable router and why I
chose<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.939> route<00:00:21.150> out<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> base<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.140> attached

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
chose I route out the base and attached

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.000 
chose I route out the base and attached
it<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.039> piece<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.279> plywood<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.920> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it to a piece of plywood and it's just a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
it to a piece of plywood and it's just a
long<00:00:26.160> piece<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.550> plywood<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.449> has<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> little

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
long piece of plywood and has a little

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.800 
long piece of plywood and has a little
extension<00:00:28.199> should<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:28.980> piece<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.810> use

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
extension should be one piece but I use

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.269 
extension should be one piece but I use
it<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.050> something<00:00:31.230> else<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.650> shorter<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it for something else on a shorter I

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.810 
it for something else on a shorter I
measured<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.780> radius<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> want<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.579> want

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
measured my radius that I want so I want

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.310 
measured my radius that I want so I want
34<00:00:36.329> inches<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.730> what<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.760> did<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.660> drilled<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
34 inches and what I did is I drilled a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.709 
34 inches and what I did is I drilled a
hole<00:00:40.350> right<00:00:40.680> there<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:40.950> 34<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.180> put<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> nail<00:00:42.690> in

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
hole right there at 34 and put a nail in

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.260 
hole right there at 34 and put a nail in
through<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:43.920> nail<00:00:44.100> into<00:00:44.370> where<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
through it which I can nail into where I

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.229 
through it which I can nail into where I
want<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.840> center<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> my<00:00:46.860> circle<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.370> nail

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
want the center of my circle to be nail

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.920 
want the center of my circle to be nail
it<00:00:48.390> down<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> voila<00:00:49.649> I'll<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.160> something<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
it down and voila I'll have something to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
it down and voila I'll have something to
rotate<00:00:51.930> amongst<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.640> circular<00:00:54.030> cut

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
rotate amongst and get that circular cut

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.850 
rotate amongst and get that circular cut
with<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.920> router<00:00:55.920> bit<00:00:56.550> by<00:00:56.670> bit

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860

MDF uses the template guide mainly and

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.440 
MDF uses the template guide mainly and
my<00:01:15.860> bender<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:17.510> this<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> hospital<00:01:18.860> bender

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450

the<00:01:20.450> dye<00:01:20.630> I'm<00:01:20.780> using<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.230> actually<00:01:21.380> inch<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:22.250> a

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
the dye I'm using is actually inch and a

the dye I'm using is actually inch and a
half<00:01:22.310> tubing<00:01:23.060> by<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:24.340> 26<00:01:25.340> inch<00:01:25.520> outer<00:01:25.790> diameter

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
half tubing by a 26 inch outer diameter

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.680 
half tubing by a 26 inch outer diameter
which<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.820> quite<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.850> bit<00:01:29.000> smaller<00:01:29.270> than<00:01:29.480> what<00:01:29.630> I

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
which is quite a bit smaller than what I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.450 
which is quite a bit smaller than what I
really<00:01:29.960> want<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.170> bend<00:01:30.350> but<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:31.040> couldn't<00:01:31.340> quite

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
really want to bend but I couldn't quite

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.030 
really want to bend but I couldn't quite
get<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.790> dye<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:31.970> want<00:01:32.300> it<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:33.800> way<00:01:33.830> this

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
get the dye I want it and the way this

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.890 
get the dye I want it and the way this
works<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.700> just<00:01:34.850> don't<00:01:35.360> bend<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.720> all<00:01:35.869> the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
works is you just don't bend it all the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.940 
works is you just don't bend it all the
way<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.880> what<00:01:37.880> I've<00:01:38.000> done<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.780> kind<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.320> set

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
way and what I've done is I kind of set

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.150 
way and what I've done is I kind of set
up<00:01:40.040> an<00:01:40.220> outfeed<00:01:40.700> table<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.800> that<00:01:42.800> way<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.010> can

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
up an outfeed table and that way I can

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.340 
up an outfeed table and that way I can
kind<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.550> keep<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.030> bending<00:01:44.360> straight<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:44.990> on

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
kind of keep the bending straight and on

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.820 
kind of keep the bending straight and on
in<00:01:45.560> feed<00:01:45.830> side<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:46.400> will<00:01:47.390> use<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.440> little

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
in feed side I will use this little

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.650 
in feed side I will use this little
roller<00:01:49.520> guy<00:01:49.760> to<00:01:50.180> kind<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.390> keep<00:01:50.510> it<00:01:50.600> all

still work on the ruse here and here's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.180 
still work on the ruse here and here's
the<00:02:07.850> next<00:02:08.000> step<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.780> now<00:02:09.380> what<00:02:09.530> he<00:02:09.619> did<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.980> on

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
the next step and now what he did is on

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.780 
the next step and now what he did is on
the<00:02:10.280> aluminum<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:12.190> went<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.519> put<00:02:13.730> a

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
the aluminum I went and just put a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.440 
the aluminum I went and just put a
little<00:02:13.970> tick<00:02:14.300> with<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:15.070> permanent<00:02:16.070> marker

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
little tick with a permanent marker

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.050 
little tick with a permanent marker
sharpie<00:02:17.450> every<00:02:18.380> one<00:02:18.530> inch<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:19.610> way<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.760> can

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
sharpie every one inch that way I can

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.210 
sharpie every one inch that way I can
move<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> consistent<00:02:21.080> distance<00:02:21.440> each<00:02:21.920> time

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
move it a consistent distance each time

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.090 
move it a consistent distance each time
I<00:02:22.519> put<00:02:22.850> in<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.030> bender

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
I put in the bender

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.580 
I put in the bender
alright<00:02:25.100> back<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:25.970> working<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.200> project

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
alright back to working on this project

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.340 
alright back to working on this project
again<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:28.360> decided<00:02:29.360> my<00:02:29.510> bender<00:02:29.780> location<00:02:30.200> was

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
again I decided my bender location was

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.509 
again I decided my bender location was
an<00:02:30.440> ideal<00:02:30.709> because<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.550> was<00:02:31.989> over<00:02:32.989> here<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.830> it

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
an ideal because it was over here and it

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.080 
an ideal because it was over here and it
was<00:02:34.730> hitting<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.930> edge<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.950> my<00:02:36.980> other<00:02:37.700> side<00:02:38.000> of

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
was hitting the edge of my other side of

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.210 
was hitting the edge of my other side of
my<00:02:38.180> car<00:02:38.360> parked<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.250> now<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.980> fit<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> nice

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
my car parked so now I can fit a nice

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.240 
my car parked so now I can fit a nice
long<00:02:43.580> piece<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.910> aluminum<00:02:44.480> into<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.930> and

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
long piece of aluminum into it and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.310 
long piece of aluminum into it and
hopefully<00:02:46.250> bend<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.760> involve<00:02:47.540> me<00:02:47.720> moving<00:02:48.260> it

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
hopefully bend it involve me moving it

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.500 
hopefully bend it involve me moving it
and<00:02:48.380> rotating<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.890> slightly<00:02:49.220> from<00:02:49.459> 90<00:02:50.239> degrees

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
and rotating it slightly from 90 degrees

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
and rotating it slightly from 90 degrees
and<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:53.750> begin<00:02:53.989> bending<00:02:54.440> okay<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:57.140> use<00:02:57.350> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
and just begin bending okay so I use the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.920 
and just begin bending okay so I use the
jig<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:58.670> kind<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.000> check<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.269> curve<00:02:59.480> as<00:02:59.690> I<00:02:59.720> go

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
jig to kind of check the curve as I go

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.620 
jig to kind of check the curve as I go
on<00:03:00.280> mostly<00:03:01.280> in<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.580> flat<00:03:01.880> it's<00:03:02.360> one<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.570> the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
on mostly in this flat it's one of the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.900 
on mostly in this flat it's one of the
troubles<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:02.989> had<00:03:03.140> with<00:03:03.290> my<00:03:03.410> original<00:03:03.670> one<00:03:04.670> as

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
troubles I had with my original one as

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.940 
troubles I had with my original one as
the<00:03:05.090> ends<00:03:05.360> kind<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.630> got<00:03:05.750> flat<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.799> was

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
the ends kind of got flat and so it was

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.589 
the ends kind of got flat and so it was
hard<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.220> make<00:03:07.370> seems<00:03:07.700> right<00:03:07.940> there

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
hard to make seems right there

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.149 
hard to make seems right there
so<00:03:09.200> here<00:03:09.349> I'm<00:03:09.409> checking<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.709> curve<00:03:09.890> it's

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
so here I'm checking the curve it's

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.979 
so here I'm checking the curve it's
looking<00:03:10.459> good<00:03:10.819> I'll<00:03:11.030> put<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.299> back<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.599> in<00:03:11.749> and

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
looking good I'll put it back in in and

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.060 
looking good I'll put it back in in and
I<00:03:12.980> keep<00:03:13.700> on<00:03:13.849> bending
