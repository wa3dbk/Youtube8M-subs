00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
what you have to do is undo the two

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.400 
what you have to do is undo the two
little<00:00:19.890> nuts<00:00:20.600> which<00:00:21.600> hold<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.020> glass<00:00:22.199> in

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
little nuts which hold the glass in

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.200 
little nuts which hold the glass in
position<00:00:22.970> but<00:00:23.970> from<00:00:24.630> bitter<00:00:24.869> experience

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
position but from bitter experience

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.370 
position but from bitter experience
they're<00:00:27.210> very<00:00:27.480> difficult<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> undo<00:00:28.050> because

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
they're very difficult to undo because

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.740 
they're very difficult to undo because
the<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.099> been<00:00:29.250> red-hot<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> long<00:00:30.210> time<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the it's been red-hot for a long time so

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.100 
the it's been red-hot for a long time so
simple<00:00:31.679> answer<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.009> just<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.279> grind<00:00:32.520> off<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
simple answer is just to grind off the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.260 
simple answer is just to grind off the
nuts<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.910> steadies

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
nuts and then if you do that it steadies

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.459 
nuts and then if you do that it steadies
just<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> put<00:00:36.750> another<00:00:37.020> couple<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.290> nights

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
just to put another couple of nights

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.740 
just to put another couple of nights
they're<00:00:37.680> only<00:00:37.770> six<00:00:38.219> millimeter<00:00:38.670> metric<00:00:39.030> so

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
they're only six millimeter metric so

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.940 
they're only six millimeter metric so
it's<00:00:39.960> no<00:00:40.440> problem

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it's no problem

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.779 
it's no problem
there's<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:41.969> nut<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> there's<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.730> other

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
there's one nut and there's the other

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.810 
there's one nut and there's the other
nut<00:00:45.000> there<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> that's<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.370> I'll<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.579> I'll

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
nut there so that's what I'll do I'll

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.100 
nut there so that's what I'll do I'll
just<00:00:47.879> attack<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> angle<00:00:49.079> grinder

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
just attack them with the angle grinder

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.279 
just attack them with the angle grinder
and<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.910> grind<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> flat<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.570> each<00:00:51.809> side<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and just grind the flat on each side and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.979 
and just grind the flat on each side and
they'll<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.620> come<00:00:52.860> off<00:00:53.129> dead<00:00:53.610> easy<00:00:53.960> anyway<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
they'll just come off dead easy anyway I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
they'll just come off dead easy anyway I
can't<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.620> video<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.160> I'll<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.699> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
happy with that so I'm going to have

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.140 
happy with that so I'm going to have
another<00:01:25.049> bit<00:01:25.229> ago<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.549> angle<00:01:26.759> grinder<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
another bit ago with the angle grinder I

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.340 
another bit ago with the angle grinder I
don't<00:01:27.360> want<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> share<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> studs<00:01:28.200> off

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
don't want to share the studs off

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.370 
don't want to share the studs off
because<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.890> major<00:01:29.130> hassle<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
because it's a major hassle so not a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.749 
because it's a major hassle so not a
little<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.920> grind<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.400> take<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> right

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
little go down grind and take it right

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.210 
little go down grind and take it right
down<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.299> tops<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> threads<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
down to the tops of the threads and that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
down to the tops of the threads and that
should<00:01:35.430> make<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.640> easier<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.659> right

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
should make it easier to go all right

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.940 
should make it easier to go all right
that's<00:01:37.049> another<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.409> go

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that's another little go

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.330 
that's another little go
I'll<00:01:38.640> ground<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.150> more<00:01:39.329> off<00:01:39.479> each<00:01:39.689> side<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
I'll ground a bit more off each side I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.590 
I'll ground a bit more off each side I
might<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.369> smashed<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.450> glass

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
might just smashed a bit of glass

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.780 
might just smashed a bit of glass
actually<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.549> on<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
actually to get it out of the way on the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.929 
actually to get it out of the way on the
other<00:01:44.820> hand<00:01:45.000> there<00:01:45.090> might<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.890> okay

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.669 

well<00:01:49.600> got<00:01:50.320> some<00:01:50.530> success<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:52.090> one's<00:01:52.270> gone

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
well got some success that one's gone

00:01:52.679 --> 00:02:03.959 
well got some success that one's gone
free<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:58.270> one<00:01:59.670> is<00:02:00.670> mostly<00:02:01.569> free<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:03.250> it's

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
free this one is mostly free but it's

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.690 
free this one is mostly free but it's
important<00:02:04.420> when<00:02:04.630> something's<00:02:05.500> been<00:02:05.700> jammed

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
important when something's been jammed

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.070 
important when something's been jammed
in<00:02:06.850> position<00:02:07.179> for<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.329> long<00:02:07.450> time<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:07.929> so<00:02:08.049> on

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
in position for a long time and so on

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.869 
in position for a long time and so on
actually<00:02:08.860> just<00:02:08.979> tryna<00:02:09.250> unscrew<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.729> because

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
actually just tryna unscrew it because

you<00:02:10.000> will<00:02:10.119> shear<00:02:10.420> off<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.720> stud<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.620> just

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
you will shear off the stud so just

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.280 
you will shear off the stud so just
wiggle<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.519> like<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.150> use<00:02:13.720> lots<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.049> release

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
wiggle it like that use lots of release

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.789 
wiggle it like that use lots of release
oil<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:15.239> just<00:02:16.239> wiggle<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.799> gradually

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
oil and just wiggle it and gradually

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.470 
oil and just wiggle it and gradually
work<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.129> free<00:02:18.340> don't<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.760> force<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.209> all<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
work it free don't just force it all the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.360 
work it free don't just force it all the
way<00:02:19.599> in<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.780> winner<00:02:19.959> just<00:02:20.340> wiggle<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.400> like<00:02:21.549> that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
way in a winner just wiggle it like that

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.940 
way in a winner just wiggle it like that
bit<00:02:24.370> more<00:02:24.519> release<00:02:24.760> well<00:02:24.940> perhaps<00:02:25.120> just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
bit more release well perhaps just

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.080 
bit more release well perhaps just
wiggle<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.379> do<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.620> like<00:02:29.739> that

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.460 

there<00:04:32.650> we<00:04:32.770> have<00:04:32.889> a<00:04:32.919> couple<00:04:33.250> of<00:04:33.310> new<00:04:33.490> nuts

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
there we have a couple of new nuts

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.080 
there we have a couple of new nuts
they're<00:04:36.389> pretty<00:04:37.389> small<00:04:37.569> six<00:04:37.990> millimeter<00:04:38.440> just

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
they're pretty small six millimeter just

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.399 
they're pretty small six millimeter just
reduce<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.240> about<00:04:40.300> half<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.050> previous

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
reduce to about half the previous

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.700 
reduce to about half the previous
thickness<00:04:42.419> there's<00:04:43.419> a<00:04:43.509> few<00:04:43.710> thousands

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
thickness there's a few thousands

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.839 
thickness there's a few thousands
between<00:04:45.039> them<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.340> doesn't<00:04:45.550> really<00:04:45.639> matter

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
between them it doesn't really matter

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.480 
between them it doesn't really matter
because<00:04:46.810> they're<00:04:47.139> they'll<00:04:48.039> probably<00:04:48.190> end<00:04:48.400> up

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
because they're they'll probably end up

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.920 
because they're they'll probably end up
getting<00:04:48.669> cut<00:04:48.909> off<00:04:48.940> as<00:04:49.180> well<00:04:49.330> if<00:04:49.599> we<00:04:49.720> were<00:04:49.780> to

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
getting cut off as well if we were to

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.499 
getting cut off as well if we were to
change<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.229> glass<00:04:50.379> again<00:04:50.940> anyway<00:04:51.970> I'd<00:04:52.479> say<00:04:52.750> it

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
change the glass again anyway I'd say it

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.680 
change the glass again anyway I'd say it
right<00:04:55.509> there's<00:04:55.840> the<00:04:56.020> new<00:04:56.169> nut<00:04:56.379> in<00:04:56.680> position

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
right there's the new nut in position

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.830 
right there's the new nut in position
both<00:04:58.690> sides<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.830> little<00:05:00.039> clips<00:05:00.250> are<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.430> bit

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
both sides the little clips are a bit

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.719 
both sides the little clips are a bit
corroded<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.080> might<00:05:02.259> tie<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.530> make<00:05:03.039> or<00:05:03.340> buy

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
corroded I might tie the make or buy

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.999 
corroded I might tie the make or buy
some<00:05:04.030> new<00:05:04.180> little<00:05:04.300> clips<00:05:04.599> next<00:05:05.530> stage<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.889> to

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
some new little clips next stage is to

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.420 
some new little clips next stage is to
do<00:05:06.159> the<00:05:06.449> gasket<00:05:07.449> stuff<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:09.840> do<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:10.960> really

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
do the gasket stuff and to do it really

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:25.409 
do the gasket stuff and to do it really
okay<00:05:12.460> oh<00:05:20.009> look<00:05:21.009> fly<00:05:21.400> there<00:05:22.740> anyway<00:05:24.270> there's<00:05:25.270> a

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
okay oh look fly there anyway there's a

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.969 
okay oh look fly there anyway there's a
new<00:05:25.690> bit<00:05:25.870> of<00:05:25.900> glass<00:05:26.169> which<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.560> can<00:05:26.710> hardly

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
new bit of glass which you can hardly

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.689 
new bit of glass which you can hardly
see<00:05:27.719> is<00:05:28.719> there<00:05:28.990> see<00:05:29.560> it<00:05:29.650> nicely<00:05:29.770> now<00:05:30.550> if<00:05:30.610> you

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
see is there see it nicely now if you

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:31.920 
see is there see it nicely now if you
want<00:05:30.849> to<00:05:30.940> know<00:05:31.030> if<00:05:31.150> it's<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.419> right<00:05:31.449> kind<00:05:31.629> of

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
want to know if it's the right kind of

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.760 
want to know if it's the right kind of
glass<00:05:32.280> if<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.639> hold<00:05:33.940> it<00:05:34.060> up<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.389> light<00:05:34.770> and

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
glass if you hold it up to the light and

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.480 
glass if you hold it up to the light and
you<00:05:35.830> look<00:05:36.789> through<00:05:37.330> it<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:38.740> should<00:05:39.009> appear

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
you look through it it should appear

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.149 
you look through it it should appear
pink<00:05:39.940> I<00:05:40.409> don't<00:05:41.409> know<00:05:41.469> if<00:05:41.529> you<00:05:41.620> can<00:05:41.800> see<00:05:41.979> that

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
pink I don't know if you can see that

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.570 
pink I don't know if you can see that
but<00:05:42.750> yes<00:05:43.750> I<00:05:43.930> can<00:05:44.110> see<00:05:44.259> it<00:05:44.380> so<00:05:45.099> you<00:05:45.159> should<00:05:45.490> be

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
but yes I can see it so you should be

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.399 
but yes I can see it so you should be
able<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.789> it<00:05:46.330> looks<00:05:46.509> pink<00:05:46.840> it<00:05:46.990> doesn't<00:05:47.289> look

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
able to it looks pink it doesn't look

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.740 
able to it looks pink it doesn't look
clear<00:05:47.889> or<00:05:48.130> green<00:05:48.490> clear<00:05:49.270> or<00:05:49.419> green<00:05:49.630> is

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
ordinary glass pink is borosilicate got

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.820 
ordinary glass pink is borosilicate got
that<00:05:53.669> see<00:05:54.669> it<00:05:54.759> the<00:05:54.849> holy<00:05:55.000> upper<00:05:55.240> light<00:05:55.830> look

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
that see it the holy upper light look

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.749 
that see it the holy upper light look
through<00:05:57.069> it<00:05:57.509> not<00:05:58.509> very<00:05:58.659> clear<00:05:59.020> that<00:05:59.139> hey<00:05:59.759> there

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
through it not very clear that hey there

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.659 
through it not very clear that hey there
you<00:06:00.819> go<00:06:01.409> right<00:06:02.409> return<00:06:03.039> to<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.310> kitchen

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
you go right return to the kitchen

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:04.980 
you go right return to the kitchen
because<00:06:03.909> that's<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.180> best<00:06:04.330> place<00:06:04.569> to<00:06:04.599> do<00:06:04.840> this

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
because that's the best place to do this

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.070 
because that's the best place to do this
sort<00:06:05.229> of<00:06:05.259> thing<00:06:05.440> I've<00:06:06.370> cut<00:06:06.729> some<00:06:07.080> fiberglass

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
sort of thing I've cut some fiberglass

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.680 
sort of thing I've cut some fiberglass
rope<00:06:08.710> six<00:06:09.099> millimeter<00:06:09.520> fiberglass<00:06:09.969> rod<00:06:10.150> it's

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
rope six millimeter fiberglass rod it's

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.559 
rope six millimeter fiberglass rod it's
actually<00:06:11.050> hollow<00:06:11.490> so<00:06:12.490> it's<00:06:13.150> actually<00:06:13.360> quite

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 
actually hollow so it's actually quite

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.360 
actually hollow so it's actually quite
squidgy<00:06:14.050> so<00:06:14.259> although<00:06:14.590> it<00:06:14.680> looks<00:06:14.830> very<00:06:15.039> big<00:06:15.219> it

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
squidgy so although it looks very big it

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.050 
squidgy so although it looks very big it
squishes<00:06:15.639> down<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.990> half<00:06:17.139> its<00:06:17.349> thickness<00:06:18.060> so

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
squishes down to half its thickness so

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.390 
squishes down to half its thickness so
that's<00:06:19.210> roughly<00:06:20.020> cut<00:06:20.379> to<00:06:20.500> length<00:06:20.620> I'll<00:06:20.919> trim

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
that's roughly cut to length I'll trim

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.999 
that's roughly cut to length I'll trim
it<00:06:21.430> to<00:06:21.580> length<00:06:21.729> on<00:06:21.940> to<00:06:22.029> put<00:06:22.210> it<00:06:22.270> in<00:06:22.360> position

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
it to length on to put it in position

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.689 
it to length on to put it in position
there's<00:06:24.009> the<00:06:24.190> gluey<00:06:24.370> stuff<00:06:25.319> which<00:06:26.319> is<00:06:26.699> it's

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
there's the gluey stuff which is it's

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.629 
there's the gluey stuff which is it's
sodium<00:06:28.449> silicate<00:06:28.979> which<00:06:29.979> is<00:06:30.190> a<00:06:30.219> very

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
sodium silicate which is a very

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.939 
sodium silicate which is a very
aggressive<00:06:30.849> very<00:06:31.300> nasty<00:06:31.539> stuff<00:06:31.960> you<00:06:32.770> can<00:06:32.919> use

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
aggressive very nasty stuff you can use

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.649 
aggressive very nasty stuff you can use
silicone<00:06:33.699> rubber<00:06:33.849> if<00:06:33.969> you<00:06:34.060> like<00:06:34.240> as<00:06:34.389> well<00:06:34.419> by

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659 
silicone rubber if you like as well by

the way this is sodium silicate which

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.850 
the way this is sodium silicate which
sets<00:06:37.449> like<00:06:37.629> concrete<00:06:37.900> and<00:06:38.199> it's<00:06:38.440> completely
