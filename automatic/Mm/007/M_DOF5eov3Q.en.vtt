much in a liner with so what I'd like
you<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:38.969> tell<00:00:39.270> us<00:00:40.010> about<00:00:41.010> your

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you to do is tell us about your

you to do is tell us about your
background<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:42.270> how<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:42.989> started

background about how this all started

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.190 
background about how this all started
for<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.190> were<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.910> college<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.719> became<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
for you you were in college you became a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.000 
for you you were in college you became a
doctor<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:48.000> happened<00:00:48.420> after<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.010> well

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
doctor and what happened after that well

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920 
doctor and what happened after that well
actually<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.550> started<00:00:50.910> while<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
actually it started while I was in

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.639 
actually it started while I was in
college<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.500> started<00:00:54.079> working<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> little

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
college I started working at a little

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.610 
college I started working at a little
laboratory<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> Rye<00:00:56.550> called<00:00:56.879> sloan-kettering

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
laboratory in Rye called sloan-kettering

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
laboratory in Rye called sloan-kettering
and<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.489> field<00:00:59.730> called<00:01:00.000> tumor<00:01:00.300> immunology

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and in a field called tumor immunology

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.619 
and in a field called tumor immunology
which<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.410> only<00:01:02.010> occupying<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.789> room<00:01:03.059> there

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
which was only occupying one room there

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
which was only occupying one room there
it's<00:01:03.960> grown<00:01:04.260> logarithmically<00:01:05.040> since<00:01:05.400> but

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it's grown logarithmically since but

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.390 
it's grown logarithmically since but
that<00:01:05.820> got<00:01:06.000> me<00:01:06.150> very<00:01:06.180> interested<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.619> field

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that got me very interested in the field

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.570 
that got me very interested in the field
of<00:01:09.680> lymphocyte<00:01:10.680> studies<00:01:11.159> delayed

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
of lymphocyte studies delayed

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.760 
of lymphocyte studies delayed

hypersensitivity and cellular immunology

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
hypersensitivity and cellular immunology
and<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:15.060> continued<00:01:15.810> those<00:01:15.990> studies<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.650> off

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and I continued those studies on and off

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.230 
and I continued those studies on and off
throughout<00:01:17.040> my<00:01:17.280> medical<00:01:17.670> school<00:01:17.909> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.330 
branch and our work there demonstrated
the<00:01:35.340> nature<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:37.100> recognition<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.159> the

substances we call it cross reactive

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.219 
substances we call it cross reactive
recognition<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.990> that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
recognition and it was that

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.630 
recognition and it was that
understanding<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.009> cross<00:01:47.220> reactive

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
understanding of cross reactive

understanding of cross reactive
recognition<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.780> let<00:01:49.049> me<00:01:49.079> understand<00:01:49.799> how

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
recognition that let me understand how

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.030 
recognition that let me understand how
diet<00:01:50.549> could<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:51.540> change<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
diet could actually change what the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.389 
diet could actually change what the
body's<00:01:53.369> immune<00:01:53.670> system<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:54.270> recognizing<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
body's immune system was recognizing and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.450 
body's immune system was recognizing and
how<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.820> might<00:01:57.090> pertain<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.460> different

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
how that might pertain to different

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.719 
how that might pertain to different
substances<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.479> one's<00:02:00.840> food<00:02:01.729> causing

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
substances in one's food causing

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
substances in one's food causing
inflammation<00:02:03.090> or<00:02:03.719> contributing<00:02:04.290> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
inflammation or contributing to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.320 
inflammation or contributing to
inflammation<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.950> strengthened<00:02:07.950> my

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
inflammation and so that strengthened my

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.759 
inflammation and so that strengthened my
pursuit<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> pathway<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:11.300> diet<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
pursuit of the pathway of diet and

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.030 
pursuit of the pathway of diet and
and<00:02:13.980> disease<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.209> skin<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.439> how<00:02:16.980> many

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and disease in the skin so how many

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.130 
and disease in the skin so how many
years<00:02:17.430> ago<00:02:17.549> was<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.299> year<00:02:18.540> well<00:02:18.870> that

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
years ago was this that year well that

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
response but it was a very difficult

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.379 
response but it was a very difficult
thing<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.519> find<00:03:17.730> people<00:03:18.000> with<00:03:18.269> the

I've been thinking about that haven't
already<00:05:19.680> been<00:05:20.010> taken<00:05:20.570> into<00:05:21.570> account<00:05:21.780> into
