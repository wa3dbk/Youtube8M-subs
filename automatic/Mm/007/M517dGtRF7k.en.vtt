you<00:00:05.759> must<00:00:05.970> be<00:00:06.089> hungry<00:00:10.519> the<00:00:11.519> mirror<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
you must be hungry the mirror is

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.669 
you must be hungry the mirror is
absolutely<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> character<00:00:12.929> into<00:00:13.139> itself<00:00:13.410> and

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
absolutely a character into itself and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.930 
absolutely a character into itself and
the<00:00:14.490> thing<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:14.849> mirrors<00:00:16.400> that<00:00:17.400> creeps<00:00:17.820> me

the thing about mirrors that creeps me

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.010 
the thing about mirrors that creeps me
out<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.730> take<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:20.939> granted<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
out is that we take for granted that a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.470 
out is that we take for granted that a
reflection<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.100> mirror<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.699> objective<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
reflection in a mirror is objective and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.220 
reflection in a mirror is objective and
representative<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:26.150> of<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.750> world<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.140> we

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
much larger than the mirror it's really

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.060 
much larger than the mirror it's really

Mike really liked the original mirror
that<00:02:36.160> he<00:02:36.220> had<00:02:36.310> used<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:36.790> short<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:38.280> we

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
that he had used in as short and we

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.190 
that he had used in as short and we
investigated<00:02:39.880> taking<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.300> into<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> couple<00:02:41.140> of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
investigated taking it into a couple of

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.160 
investigated taking it into a couple of
different<00:02:41.260> directions<00:02:42.420> but<00:02:43.420> he<00:02:43.630> was<00:02:43.720> very

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
different directions but he was very

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.620 
different directions but he was very
attached<00:02:44.530> their<00:02:44.739> initial<00:02:45.160> initial<00:02:45.790> mirror<00:02:46.180> so

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
attached their initial initial mirror so

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.650 
attached their initial initial mirror so
what<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.260> did<00:02:47.350> was<00:02:47.590> tear<00:02:47.800> tupping<00:02:48.660> existing

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
what I did was tear tupping existing

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.890 
what I did was tear tupping existing
design<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.970> altered<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.330> sort<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.690> moved

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
design and altered it and sort of moved

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.440 
design and altered it and sort of moved
it<00:02:53.050> more<00:02:53.290> into<00:02:53.709> what<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.640> mirror<00:02:54.910> needed<00:02:55.239> to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
it more into what the mirror needed to

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.140 
it more into what the mirror needed to
become<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:56.890> film<00:02:57.160> which<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.910> huge

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
become for this film which is a huge

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.930 
become for this film which is a huge
character<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:58.810> itself<00:02:59.200> it's<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.280> fiberglass

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
character in itself it's a fiberglass

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.009 
character in itself it's a fiberglass
mold<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.269> filled<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.660> with<00:03:04.780> foam

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
mold that is then filled in with foam

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.960 
mold that is then filled in with foam
and<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.620> large<00:03:05.860> part<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.250> weight<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.730> that

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
and a large part of the weight of that

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.970 
and a large part of the weight of that
mirror<00:03:07.239> comes<00:03:07.600> from<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.230> backing<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
mirror comes from the backing of the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.490 
mirror comes from the backing of the
glass<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:10.450> gimbal<00:03:10.959> system<00:03:11.110> that's

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
glass and the gimbal system that's

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.650 
glass and the gimbal system that's
involved<00:03:11.769> with<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.610> also<00:03:13.000> has<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.360> steel

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
involved with that it also has a steel

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.900 
involved with that it also has a steel
frame<00:03:13.930> running<00:03:14.500> through<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:14.890> not<00:03:15.519> only<00:03:15.760> for

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
frame running through it not only for

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.390 
frame running through it not only for
strength<00:03:16.180> but<00:03:16.510> also<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:17.560> enable<00:03:17.920> us<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.190> do

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
strength but also to enable us to do

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.710 
strength but also to enable us to do
some<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.670> tricks<00:03:18.880> we<00:03:19.060> wanted<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.420> do<00:03:19.540> I

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
some of the tricks we wanted to do I

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.270 
some of the tricks we wanted to do I
feel<00:03:20.019> like<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.230> mirror<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> great<00:03:20.890> object<00:03:21.040> to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
feel like a mirror is a great object to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.220 
feel like a mirror is a great object to
pick<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.640> lot<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.880> people<00:03:22.090> pick<00:03:22.299> objects<00:03:23.110> that

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
pick a lot of people pick objects that

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.800 
pick a lot of people pick objects that
are<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:24.040> inherently<00:03:24.519> not<00:03:24.760> scary<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.750> do

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
are just inherently not scary and I do

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.539 
are just inherently not scary and I do
think<00:03:26.170> there's<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.410> lot<00:03:26.440> about<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.860> reflection

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
think there's a lot about it reflection

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.880 
think there's a lot about it reflection
that<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:29.049> I<00:03:29.080> think<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.470> really<00:03:29.680> that

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
that is so I think that really that

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:49.000 
that is so I think that really that
really<00:03:30.280> helps

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.200 

in<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.159> devil<00:03:50.549> he<00:03:51.060> hears<00:03:51.900> me
