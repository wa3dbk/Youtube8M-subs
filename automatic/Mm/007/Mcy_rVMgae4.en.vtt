00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello and welcome to sekte 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.430
 some of you have asked me if 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.279
 I do not also use the apple iphone 5 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.010
 the asus padfone 2 in the geekbench 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.779
 benchmark could once compare that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 Of course we want to do that today 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.160
 We also take the google 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.830
 nexus four just to see 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.559
 how is that in the neighborhood benchmark so 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.809
 beats why geekbench just now 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.239
 this is one of the few cpu benchmarks 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.920
 which for both Android OS and for 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.780
 ios are available 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.879
 in advance, I have the equipment 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.590
 Of course, just rebooted the ram 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.510
 So learning is natural 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.770
 all three devices no running 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.329
 applications 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.760
 I'll show you that again fast 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.129
 means the conditions are absolute 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.789
 identical to the pet of 2 we have 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.590
 android 4.1.1 jelly bean you can see yes 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.860
 here in the beginning very good at google 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.280
 nexus 4 already android 4.2.1 jelly bean 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.890
 and at the iphone 5 ios in the very fresh 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.290
 version 6.1 we just start now 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 let's do this benchmark test here 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.130
 yes then at the end of it who is the listener 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.070
 value spit out you see a shorter that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.630
 video because big bands are pretty fast 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.310
 tests the cpu performance as mentioned before 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.860
 the cpu power 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.439
 we have here at nexus 4 and at 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.450
 nexus 4 and asus padfone two 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.229
 in each case the same cdu namely the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 qualcomm snapdragon s4 pro with 1 5 ghz 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.630
 sweep that is a quad-core cpu and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.840
 the iPhone 5, a cpu namely the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 apple asics scored 13 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.189
 But that does not have to mean much because of me 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.280
 most people think that's it 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.299
 really no quad-core cpu yet 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.310
 otherwise needed with these two 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.619
 devices two ram gigabyte here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.270
 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:02.460
 the padfone 2 is now already 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.590
 finished and it has a strong 2149 points 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.729
 brought very possibly very strong too 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.170
 the nexus 4 is finished that has on 2081 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.520
 brought points 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.680
 means we actually have one here 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.090
 difference of less than 100 points 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.400
 I have it all in the course 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.989
 in the beginning also already checked and 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.880
 there are always such fluctuations 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.099
 between these two devices around circa 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.940
 100 points but at the benchmark they are 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.709
 really reasonably yes right away 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.330
 I'm pretty cool because that means that 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.819
 the opponent in the sprint market better with 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.100
 android 4.2.1 rightly it comes to 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.110
 example of the tutu or the quadrant 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.300
 standard you feel so that he 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.790
 not really adapted yet 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.790
 also the iphone 5 is finished of course 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.350
 and that has brought to 1663 points 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.080
 means we already have one here 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.200
 clear difference but I think so 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.450
 was foreseeable because we are here with both 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.850
 a quad-core cpu and with the qualcomm 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.340
 snapdragon s4 pro probably one of the best 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.819
 It will be one of the future in the market 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.769
 prepare 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.410
 And that is my conclusion to this 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.510
 crashtest now shows a couple once 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.510
 again very good as potent this one 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.489
 qualcomm snapdragon s4 pro is real 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.440
 in this sense, of course, I hope like 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.480
 always the video has fallen before you 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.709
 all those who have this video 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.450
 have requested 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.400
 thank you for your help, of course 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.570
 watch and say as always there 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.570
 until next time
