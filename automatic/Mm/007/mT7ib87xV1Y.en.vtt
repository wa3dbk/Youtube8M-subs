you're just going to keep going back and
forth<00:01:06.979> until<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.720> boat

good<00:01:12.330> hard<00:01:12.479> twist<00:01:12.900> push<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.970> helps<00:01:15.150> if

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
good hard twist push it down it helps if

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
good hard twist push it down it helps if
when<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.780> twisting<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.280> give<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
when you twisting it you really give it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420 
when you twisting it you really give it
a<00:01:17.549> hard<00:01:17.759> twist<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> stuff<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.430> otherwise

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
a hard twist and stuff it down otherwise

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
a hard twist and stuff it down otherwise
the<00:01:20.729> twists<00:01:21.000> tend<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.630> Lac<00:01:21.930> so

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the twists tend to get a little Lac so

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.249 
the twists tend to get a little Lac so
they<00:01:22.290> don't<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.590> quite<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.890> clean<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> when

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
they don't get quite as clean so when

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.249 
they don't get quite as clean so when
you<00:01:25.350> get<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.299> two<00:01:28.020> sets

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you get it to here now you have two sets

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
you get it to here now you have two sets
of<00:01:28.409> tails<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.579> decide<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.329> when

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
of tails so you can decide kind of when

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.789 
of tails so you can decide kind of when
you<00:01:30.810> make<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> bow<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.409> want<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.619> tuck

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you make the bow if you want to tuck

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
you make the bow if you want to tuck
those<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.520> let<00:01:32.640> them<00:01:32.759> trail<00:01:33.030> you're

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
those back in or let them trail you're

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
those back in or let them trail you're
just<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> compress<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.890> much<00:01:35.130> as

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
just going to compress it as much as

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.460 
just going to compress it as much as
possible<00:01:35.689> when<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.780> bring<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.290> I'm

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
possible when you bring it up I'm

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.960 
possible when you bring it up I'm
bringing<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:39.030> wire<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> wire<00:01:41.939> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
bringing the wire with it so the wire is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.100 
bringing the wire with it so the wire is
underneath<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.860> hold<00:01:44.130> it
