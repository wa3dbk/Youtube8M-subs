00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.390 
really fast you'll be literally shooting
up<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.390> air<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.860> far<00:01:38.130> away

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
up in the air like you know far away

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.980 
up in the air like you know far away
from<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.729> targets<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> gun<00:01:39.689> kicks

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
from your targets because the gun kicks

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
from your targets because the gun kicks
like<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> mule<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.400> bad<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> recoil<00:01:42.299> is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
like a mule it's that bad the recoil is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
like a mule it's that bad the recoil is
that<00:01:42.630> bad<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> control<00:01:43.950> your

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that bad you really have to control your

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.920 
that bad you really have to control your
shots<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.060> want<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.390> accurate<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
shots if you want to be accurate with a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
shots if you want to be accurate with a
desert<00:01:46.320> eagle<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.860> gets<00:01:47.040> kind<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
desert eagle so that gets kind of a

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.300 
desert eagle so that gets kind of a
nerve<00:01:47.670> from<00:01:47.820> cod4<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:49.079> return<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.799> 44

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
nerve from cod4 and in return the 44

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.580 
nerve from cod4 and in return the 44
magnum<00:01:50.670> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.090> takes<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> place<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.409> what

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
magnum kind of takes the place of what

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.219 
magnum kind of takes the place of what
the<00:01:52.680> deal<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.399> cod4<00:01:53.640> because<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.840> 44

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the deal was in cod4 because the 44

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.139 
the deal was in cod4 because the 44
magnum<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> an<00:01:55.890> ex<00:01:56.040> power<00:01:56.280> pistol<00:01:56.700> still<00:01:56.969> does

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
magnum is an ex power pistol still does

great<00:01:57.450> damage<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.960> bullet<00:01:58.439> kill<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.770> close<00:01:59.000> but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
great damage to bullet kill up close but

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.450 
great damage to bullet kill up close but
it<00:02:00.149> has<00:02:00.299> very<00:02:00.689> low<00:02:01.020> actual<00:02:01.590> recoil<00:02:01.979> still<00:02:02.310> has

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
it has very low actual recoil still has

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.039 
it has very low actual recoil still has
the<00:02:02.670> visual<00:02:03.060> recoil<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.960> be

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the visual recoil but that's to be

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.899 
the visual recoil but that's to be
expected<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> actual<00:02:05.310> recoil<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
expected but the actual recoil is

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.240 
expected but the actual recoil is
actually<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.570> manageable<00:02:06.930> if<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.890> shoot

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
actually very manageable if you shoot

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.119 
actually very manageable if you shoot
all<00:02:08.580> straight<00:02:09.119> six<00:02:09.780> shots<00:02:10.050> straight<00:02:10.349> abs<00:02:10.649> in

all straight six shots straight abs in

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.580 
you
and<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:12.000> those<00:02:12.450> six<00:02:12.780> shots<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.350> same

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and all those six shots on the same

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.710 
and all those six shots on the same
place<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.100> aimed<00:02:14.400> making<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> 44

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
place that you aimed making the 44

place that you aimed making the 44
Magnum<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:16.200> really<00:02:16.500> good<00:02:16.650> weapon<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.250> mana

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
Magnum a really good weapon and mana

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.760 
Magnum a really good weapon and mana
we're<00:02:17.940> 4-3<00:02:18.420> though<00:02:18.690> we<00:02:18.840> are<00:02:18.930> introduced<00:02:19.530> with

we're 4-3 though we are introduced with

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.980 
we're 4-3 though we are introduced with

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
three different power pistols the deagle

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.220 
three different power pistols the deagle
the<00:02:22.530> 44<00:02:23.010> Magnum<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.730> mp412<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.960> among

the 44 Magnum and the mp412 and among

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.050 
the 44 Magnum and the mp412 and among
them<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.650> deagle<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.220> kind<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.640> odd<00:02:26.850> one

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
them the deagle is kind of the odd one

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.060 
them the deagle is kind of the odd one
out<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.390> kind<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.630> comes<00:02:28.020> both<00:02:28.320> if<00:02:28.830> you're

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
out it kind of comes both if you're

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.590 
out it kind of comes both if you're
using<00:02:29.220> single<00:02:29.790> wheel<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.090> that's<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.390> kicker

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
using single wheel and that's the kicker

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.150 
using single wheel and that's the kicker
right<00:02:30.810> here<00:02:30.990> if<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.140> use<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.440> single<00:02:31.920> wield

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
right here if you use it single wield

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.790 
right here if you use it single wield
only<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.210> desert<00:02:33.540> eagle<00:02:33.690> succumbs<00:02:34.260> both<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
only the desert eagle succumbs both to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.640 
only the desert eagle succumbs both to
the<00:02:34.920> mp412<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.390> 44<00:02:36.810> Magnum<00:02:36.840> however

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the mp412 and the 44 Magnum however

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.490 
the mp412 and the 44 Magnum however
here's<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.160> kicker<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.210> use<00:02:39.450> akimbo<00:02:40.110> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
here's the kicker if you use akimbo and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.410 
here's the kicker if you use akimbo and
because<00:02:40.890> these<00:02:41.100> weapons<00:02:41.460> are<00:02:41.640> power<00:02:41.880> pistols

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
because these weapons are power pistols

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.970 
because these weapons are power pistols
meaning<00:02:42.720> they<00:02:42.810> are<00:02:42.960> two<00:02:43.170> bullet<00:02:43.500> kills<00:02:43.740> up

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
meaning they are two bullet kills up

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.550 
meaning they are two bullet kills up
close<00:02:44.340> because<00:02:45.120> they're<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.810> powerful<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
close because they're so powerful the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.500 
close because they're so powerful the
deagle<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.100> actually<00:02:47.610> kill<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.090> like<00:02:48.240> one

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
deagle can actually kill in like one

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.870 
deagle can actually kill in like one
shot<00:02:48.540> or<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.710> burst<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.220> both<00:02:50.370> gun<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.760> your

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
shot or one burst of both gun on your

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.430 
shot or one burst of both gun on your
right<00:02:51.120> hand<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.420> your<00:02:51.660> left<00:02:51.750> hand<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.290> get

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
right hand and your left hand if you get

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.380 
right hand and your left hand if you get
lucky<00:02:52.680> enough<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.190> land<00:02:53.340> both<00:02:53.640> bullets<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.270> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
lucky enough to land both bullets on the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.600 
lucky enough to land both bullets on the
chest<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.840> somebody<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.740> will<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.190> an<00:02:56.310> instant

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
chest of somebody it will be an instant

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.040 
chest of somebody it will be an instant
kill<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.120> they<00:02:57.240> will<00:02:57.360> die<00:02:57.540> almost<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:58.020> a

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
kill and they will die almost like a

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.140 
kill and they will die almost like a
shotgun<00:02:58.410> lethality<00:02:59.070> up<00:02:59.460> close<00:02:59.730> that's<00:02:59.940> why<00:03:00.120> I

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
shotgun lethality up close that's why I

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.240 
shotgun lethality up close that's why I
like<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.450> deagle<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> lot<00:03:01.020> using<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.620> Kimbo<00:03:02.040> I

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
like the deagle a lot using a Kimbo I

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.580 
like the deagle a lot using a Kimbo I
will<00:03:02.700> very<00:03:03.000> rarely<00:03:03.330> use<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.810> single<00:03:04.440> wield

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
will very rarely use it single wield

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.140 
will very rarely use it single wield
because<00:03:04.920> there<00:03:05.100> are<00:03:05.190> better<00:03:05.430> weapons<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.000> use

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
because there are better weapons to use

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.940 
because there are better weapons to use
or<00:03:06.360> battle<00:03:06.600> pistols<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.260> use<00:03:07.410> single<00:03:07.650> wield

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
or battle pistols to use single wield

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.040

and<00:03:08.280> that's<00:03:08.790> what<00:03:09.030> gives<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.450> edge<00:03:09.600> of<00:03:09.960> the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
and that's what gives the edge of the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.840 
and that's what gives the edge of the
desert<00:03:10.320> eagle<00:03:10.500> over<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.040> power<00:03:11.250> pistols<00:03:11.700> is

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
using that akimbo option and that's why

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.740 
using that akimbo option and that's why
I<00:03:14.160> like<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.400> use<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.880> lot<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.330> deagle

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
however when I'm sniping that's a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.790 
however when I'm sniping that's a
different<00:03:18.420> story<00:03:18.660> because<00:03:18.810> when<00:03:19.080> I'm<00:03:19.230> sniping

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
sometimes I get a hitmarker with my

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
sometimes I get a hitmarker with my
primary<00:03:21.810> sniper<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.560> they're<00:03:22.680> only<00:03:22.830> one

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
primary sniper and they're only one

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.340 
primary sniper and they're only one
bullet<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.850> kill<00:03:24.000> any<00:03:24.480> gun<00:03:24.840> really<00:03:25.170> they're

bullet to kill any gun really they're
really<00:03:25.380> close<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.610> dying<00:03:26.850> that's<00:03:27.240> why<00:03:27.480> in<00:03:27.630> that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
really close to dying that's why in that

really close to dying that's why in that
case<00:03:28.050> I'm<00:03:28.740> gonna<00:03:28.890> use<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.070> pistol

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640
