there<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.100> some<00:04:00.250> humidity<00:04:00.519> building<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.060> so

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
there is some humidity building in so

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.000 
there is some humidity building in so
around<00:04:01.390> 31<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.080> will<00:04:02.230> feel<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.650> and

again we're dealing with that low

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
pressure system so that showers will
