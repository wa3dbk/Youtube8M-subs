00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.370
 desing 30 40 byte diet la nuova 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.000
 extraordinary diet of thirty forty 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.870
 bumps in the thirty forty chewed 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.270
 it seems like something we said and laughed at 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.300
 but when things are said more 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.310
 sometimes they have to make people think why they want 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.470
 say they work but maybe you don't 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.289
 never made because no one has read you of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.420
 make them as firmly as I am trying to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.610
 do today then we try to 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.770
 immediately understand that this is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.160
 an extraordinary life because it is based 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.350
 more than anything on how to eat rather 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.969
 what about what to eat so now there 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 we will focus on how to eat 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.140
 I will give you a whole set of rules with 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.539
 a series of videos this is the first one 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.550
 most important because it opens this 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.370
 sequence however you will see that each video 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.850
 will have valuable information on the rule 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.980
 number one for making bartz diet 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.930
 we owe the 30 40 bites diet we must 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.879
 let them sit at the table 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.500
 possibly therefore we do not eat in 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.909
 feet we eat while sitting 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
 I say this because many do 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.320
 put your legs under the table e 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.140
 then put yourself in the position where 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.909
 we should always eat two drink 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.000
 glasses of water two glasses of water 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.549
 before you start eating and this 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.180
 point whatever we decide to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.130
 eat we eat chewing the fra 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.880
 30 and 40 times 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.799
 you have to start counting it's useless of 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.689
 say chew a lot and we say that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.900
 we know that it is right to chew a lot 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.000
 chewed 30 to 40 times 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.939
 moving the food to one side 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.040
 at the other of the teeth and then chew 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.960
 30 40 times you can watch with 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.630
 I've been experimenting with it for several years 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.869
 days is surprisingly effective 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.710
 you will see that there are feelings 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.909
 very remarkable to remind you 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 the importance of this concept 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.140
 remember that the stomach does not have i 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 teeth and not taste buds 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.270
 so the moment you eat 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.040
 you have to think that all that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.640
 send it down as many do of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.099
 swallow is neither tasted nor 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.930
 not even digested the pre management like 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.520
 we will explain in the next episodes and many 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.560
 other things 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.950
 important companies in the mouth then 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.390
 you will see I ask only this 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.000
 experimented for at least seven days 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.980
 do not speak to each time you sit 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.680
 table explain the people you are 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.470
 by doing this, you are happy and chewed 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.650
 chew 30 40 times not only of foods 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.180
 more solid but you will also see those type 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.120
 of rusks but also for 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.100
 example of managed to chew 30 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.070
 sometimes even the cake is here 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.630
 exceptional sensations are to feel 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.020
 light to have more energy 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.070
