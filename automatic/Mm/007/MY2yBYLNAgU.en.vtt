00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.010
 orange are half a cup of sugar a

 6 eggs in a container that we will take 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.450
 to the fire we are going to place the sugar for 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.230
 form the candy 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.230
 but no 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.390
 let's apply our present we're going to 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.960
 add the 6 eggs 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.960
 do not 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.720
 let's add the condensed milk 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.000
 evaporated milk 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.900
 the Orange juice 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.900
 and the orange zest and we're going to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.900
 liquefy 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.509
 once the candy is ready, what 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.439
 let's take the mold we 're going 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.000
 to do it 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.960
 we add it to the mountain that we have in 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 our plan we will try to 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.299
 expand it throughout the mold of this 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.299
 way 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.670
 mix it and when we left of 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.870
 this way now what we have to 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.220
 do is take it to the mold in which 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.220
 we put our candy 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.330
 Once we now have it this way 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.420
 that we are going to discover it with paper 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.360
 aluminum perfectly and put it to bathroom 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.060
 mary in oven at 350 degrees for 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.060
 around 45 to 50 minutes 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.240
 once we unmold we are left with 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.010
 this way the only thing we did was 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.410
 place a slice of orange match in 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.960
 flower shape and well I hope that you 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.760
