00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.570
 hello guys welcome to is very my cut 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.490
 I no longer went crazy just that it is 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.519
 what a good state surfing the net 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.920
 I've seen a lot of videos of girls who 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.869
 they were trying to camouflage dark circles 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.820
 with red lipstick and I thought well 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.640
 let's try going to make a 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.589
 experiment had not yet tested 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.810
 until today so well I wanted to do 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.330
 this experiment at the same time with you 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.990
 so that we can check if it really 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.370
 It works or if not then nothing for you 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.710
 I encourage you to continue watching the video and 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.360
 check if this method really 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.180
 is a good method to camouflage 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.430
 good circles to start with this 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.150
 experiment I'm going to use the lipstick of 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.200
 make up forever is number 45 of Russian 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.940
 artist is supposed to be with this lipstick 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.010
 red will correct me these rustic ones that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.960
 They bother me so much but I doubt it 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.960
 quite let's start with it 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.090
 well this is the result to see according to 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.219
 I've seen in other youtube videos 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.670
 now what is supposed to be that 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.770
 to do is to blur this lipstick and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.920
 then apply over the base of 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.920
 makeup 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.580
 well the truth I do not know about you but 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.390
 at least I do not think it's the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.170
 big correction is not also true that 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.640
 I have stayed like a super pink tone 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.380
 that precisely from the tone that 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.760
 tried to avoid me when when I 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.709
 applied makeup foundations and other 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.319
 because my skin tone is already very pink 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.720
 doubt and I always try to use a 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.480
 makeup is more beige to avoid a 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.750
 little bit the point this one of peggy's 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.190
 pink vita then good 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.230
 another part of the experiment that I want 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 to try with you is to apply 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.860
 simply the concealer as we usually 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.720
 do normally and then 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.220
 we will compare both sides to see 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.220
 what is best for us 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.500
 under my point of view and I think that 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.620
 you will agree with me the side of 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.780
 conventional concealer in beige tone me 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.180
 it is much more illuminated and the ojera 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.950
 more more corrected while where 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.709
 we have applied the red lipstick the truth 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.410
 it seems a little strange maybe as if I 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.620
 would have been hitting or something like that 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.959
 I think that as an idea it is not bad because it is 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.360
 true that in the makeup there are some 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.639
 colors that corrected in others 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.500
 then the red lipstick in this case 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.380
 would go very well surely for furs 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.020
 dark but the girls that you have the 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.360
 skin clarita as I better follow 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.860
 using a conventional corrector 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.960
 Anyway, it seemed like a 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.150
 super fun experiment to try 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.100
 and I do not encourage you too to try it 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.229
 maybe it surprises you and just you 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.180
 we are going perfectly please 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.370
 explain to me your experience if it has 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.470
 liked the video thumbs up and we 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.470
 we see in the next video girls thank you
