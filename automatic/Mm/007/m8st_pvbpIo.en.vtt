00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.040
 and then people will not talk or go 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.810
 think a good video very well different 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.100
 even a little more focused on the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.830
 cell phone personal 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.470
 so let's go there first before 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.599
 I do not blame myself for everything. 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.350

 Use whoever you want and who I believe 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.290
 I trust the guy who made this app 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.820
 so I use the good basically what it is 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.970

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.310
 cell phone 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.210
 so basically i will get it already 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.160
 easy to use simple 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.480
 I 'm finding this application very 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.770

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.269

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.860
 in the first photo it shows connecting 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.600
 etc. and this is not very simple thing has 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.340
 Say hi there pronto 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.039

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.799
 others to comment 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.189

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.369
 put to change and etc. 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.990
 of course there are also themes 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.990
 more ads do what right 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.310
 moving on, there's a window 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.799
 What are you pushing to be playing on the screen? 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.829
 from right to left 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.959
 you look at all the teas you were 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.660
 talking to people and everything else 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.790
 he writes the conversations but shows there 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.720
 all active chatroulette chats and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.720
 things like 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.890
 Good, when you click the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.530
 clinic presses on someone's name 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.230
 holding shows these options saw it would 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.940
 to look at his name changes group and 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.940
 deleted from your list and everything else 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.420
 when you just press the name of it shows 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.060
 That's right it would be the link his name the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.400
 what is he doing you can see until the 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.400
 or start a chat with him 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.540
 looking the click send you to see the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.700
 his history you look at his 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:09.050
 matches that played recently things 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.700
 simple nothing so complex so there I 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.970
 I'm showing some of the window 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.400
 block chat it basically looks like 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.400
 What's going on is she's wearing and everything. 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.790
 there is a bit of skeptics when what 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.860
 I went there in the options I showed but it has 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.090
 many options you tinker and everything else but 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.000
 so it goes 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.830
 and how to change the 2006 status to who 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.090
 Do not want everything else but I'd rather leave it. 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.370
 whenever the person will know that the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.820
 android I will not be able to play because this 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.430
 it's just a game to play 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.500
 I mean, others say it wrong, it does. 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.440
 just writing is not for 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.720
 play is just the uol chat for you 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.050
 talk to other people and such 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:00.050
 thing to finish just showing 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.280
 So, if anyone talks to you and 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.739
 everything else while you're using your cell phone 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.750
 shows on the screen 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.780
 there for you that the person is using the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:14.810
 application in it's normal all basic 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:18.200
 simple things nothing much and there 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.459
 ending or putting a vision into view 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.709
 a normal cell phone because I had 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.360
 put it upside down to have a better 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.280
 image quality for you and your 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.710
 to finish thus summarizing I liked it 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.230
 much of this application uses a lot 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.180
 I do not know 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.440
 but I like to use it that I can 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.480
 talk to people 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.510
 even though I'm not at home and everything else 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.400
 simple things and I think this 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.070
 application has nothing because it's just 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.700
 the game chat to find him is 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:54.350
 I just know in the shop and put it 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:58.100
 man be and simple things and go here 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.860
 I wanted to talk about this good video not 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.200
 There's a lot to talk about. 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.150
 Bonding everything but I do not know but I believe 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.070
 me that has no problem and like me 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.870
 I spoke yesterday at your own risk because 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.510
 to him this program is working 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.090
 so basically you pass your data 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.340
 to someone else and everything else to do 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.260
 That's it get but I see that 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.930
 application is pretty much everything but I 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.090
 I've never seen people complaining about him 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.850
 Like I think it's not going to work. 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.120
 wrong then in the cim goes then who has the 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.530
 android wants this is possible yes 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.360

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.980

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.200
