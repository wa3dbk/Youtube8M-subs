00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
like the Internet it's somewhat common

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.880 
like the Internet it's somewhat common
problem<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:15.870> sometimes<00:00:16.139> fixable

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
problem and it's sometimes fixable

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.939 
problem and it's sometimes fixable
sometimes<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:18.199> so<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.410> me<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:19.770> really

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
sometimes not so for me it was really

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.160 
sometimes not so for me it was really
in-depth<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.910> had<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> really<00:00:21.420> go<00:00:21.720> into<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
in-depth and I had to really go into the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.450 
in-depth and I had to really go into the
system<00:00:22.500> files<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.039> fix<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.460> so

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
system files to fix it so and this is so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.810 
system files to fix it so and this is so
as<00:00:26.930> you<00:00:27.930> know<00:00:28.050> there's<00:00:28.500> two<00:00:28.859> installations<00:00:29.580> of

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
as you know there's two installations of

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.279 
as you know there's two installations of
the<00:00:29.849> Windows<00:00:30.449> Media<00:00:30.599> Player<00:00:30.779> there's<00:00:31.109> one<00:00:31.199> in

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the Windows Media Player there's one in

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.310 
the Windows Media Player there's one in
the<00:00:31.349> Program<00:00:31.769> Files<00:00:32.059> right<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.050> then

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the Program Files right here and then

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.530 
the Program Files right here and then
there's<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> program<00:00:35.219> files<00:00:35.460> 86<00:00:35.700> all

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
there's one in the program files 86 all

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.139 
there's one in the program files 86 all
the<00:00:36.690> way<00:00:36.750> down<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.760> me<00:00:38.910> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the way down right here and for me I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.080 
the way down right here and for me I
figured<00:00:39.660> out<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.530> wouldn't<00:00:40.800> work

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
figured out that this one wouldn't work

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
figured out that this one wouldn't work
if<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.239> click<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> already<00:00:43.320> fixed<00:00:43.710> it

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
if I click on it but I already fixed it

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.700 
if I click on it but I already fixed it
so<00:00:44.010> don't<00:00:44.969> worry<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:48.600> would<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.559> one

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so don't worry so it would that one

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.779 
so don't worry so it would that one
wouldn't<00:00:49.950> work<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> regular

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
wouldn't work for the one the regular

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.590 
wouldn't work for the one the regular
Program<00:00:51.270> Files<00:00:51.480> would<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.699> would<00:00:54.390> just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
Program Files would so I would just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.510 
Program Files would so I would just
assume<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.140> could<00:00:55.289> drag<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.620> over<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
assume that I could drag it over but I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
assume that I could drag it over but I
couldn't<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.930> would<00:00:58.079> say<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> needed

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
couldn't because it would say I needed

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.860 
couldn't because it would say I needed
permission<00:00:58.949> from<00:00:59.430> trusted<00:00:59.969> installers<00:01:00.570> so

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
permission from trusted installers so

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
permission from trusted installers so
that's<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> you're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that's what the thing if you you're

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.700 
that's what the thing if you you're
getting<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> trusted<00:01:03.870> installer<00:01:04.260> error<00:01:04.530> this

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
getting the trusted installer error this

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.130 
getting the trusted installer error this
is<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.189> video<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.049> you're

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
into the this program file then it would

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.520 
into the this program file then it would
get<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.090> trust<00:01:57.600> ins<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:58.170> would<00:01:58.350> need<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
get the trust ins they would need a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.359 
get the trust ins they would need a
trusted<00:01:59.130> installer<00:02:00.259> permission<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:02.219> you're

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
