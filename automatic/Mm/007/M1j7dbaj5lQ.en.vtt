00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.139
 hello today I want you the fur 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.600
 next to s1 show 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.990
 this is not a review that is only for 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.920
 giving one's top view on the knife 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.320
 how that represents what is without 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.310
 specifications without details the better 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.060
 you can order 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.619
 I ordered it in this version 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.489
 as I said that is the only one 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:38.120
 But write that down and came 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.360
 with a page looks to find this 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.110
 model that can be locked here 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.930
 or 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.320
 you can find the knife in here 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.410
 can be secured here 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:03.860
 fix a point on and the belt 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:06.920
 as with a bend this variant so 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:13.929
 ordered or I have then 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:18.229
 another black leather ordered 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:21.619
 that looks like that is actually 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.700
 So, too , is that a qualitative one 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:30.859
 high quality leather 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.840
 you can see that because it depends on when it 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.209
 Fastening belts would also have to be relative 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.899
 deep it is very nice here 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:43.399
 place and is very, very 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.770
 certainly without a fixation that needs 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:49.759
 not with this model now 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.029
 give up comes the leader work is that 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.440
 relatively tight as it should not be 

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.450
 for sure 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.250
 can not get out of these are the ones 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.550
 two options the field next door offers 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.940
 If I remember the knife 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.010
 Part of that, as I said, the specification 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.340
 I save myself for the knife itself 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.650
 and you can do that too the fan event 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.530
 read homepage as mentioned 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.350
 that would flash below later 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.780
 and not only the knife bit 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.610
 Show for those who just 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.210
 get lucky about the knife 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.070
 would like 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.310
 they are not bigger now 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.630
 Specification simply wish over it 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.870
 look that fall evans 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.740
 I thank you for watching and 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.740
 bye
