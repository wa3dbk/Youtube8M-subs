00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
been looking at things ever since he was

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.380 
been looking at things ever since he was
born<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:37.199> I<00:00:37.620> thought<00:00:37.829> well<00:00:38.579> could<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.179> put

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
born and I thought well could we put

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.149 
born and I thought well could we put
these<00:00:39.539> two<00:00:39.749> skills<00:00:40.050> together<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.859> plenty

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
these two skills together we got plenty

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.540 
these two skills together we got plenty
of<00:00:41.269> normal<00:00:42.269> hunting<00:00:42.719> experience<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
of normal hunting experience that it and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.329 
of normal hunting experience that it and
a<00:00:44.699> lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.089> bleeds<00:00:45.329> over<00:00:45.569> into<00:00:46.339> electronics

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
a lot of it bleeds over into electronics

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.450 
a lot of it bleeds over into electronics
hunting<00:00:47.729> but<00:00:47.969> you're<00:00:48.859> say<00:00:49.859> your<00:00:50.010> method

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
hunting but you're say your method

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.689 
hunting but you're say your method
change<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> quite<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.179> bit<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.739> developed<00:00:52.739> an<00:00:53.370> app

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
change is quite a bit I developed an app

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.959 
change is quite a bit I developed an app

magnetic<00:00:57.690> pulse<00:00:58.379> an<00:00:58.620> EMP<00:00:59.159> it'll<00:00:59.789> take<00:00:59.940> those

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
magnetic pulse an EMP it'll take those

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.729 
magnetic pulse an EMP it'll take those
babies<00:01:00.449> right<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.839> the<00:01:00.929> air<00:01:00.960> it's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
babies right out of the air it's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.670 
babies right out of the air it's
invisible<00:01:02.420> it's<00:01:03.420> invisible<00:01:03.719> yeah<00:01:04.320> he<00:01:04.530> just

punches a few little keys right there

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.070 
punches a few little keys right there
into<00:01:06.570> his<00:01:06.690> cell<00:01:06.930> phone<00:01:07.230> and<00:01:08.870> you<00:01:09.870> know<00:01:09.930> in

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
into his cell phone and you know in

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.170 
into his cell phone and you know in
theory<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.950> come<00:01:11.190> right<00:01:11.370> down<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.760> theory

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
theory you come right down in theory

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050 
theory you come right down in theory
they<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:13.080> theory<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.730> now<00:01:14.880> it's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
they do in theory they do right now it's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.630 
they do in theory they do right now it's
mostly<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.630> turning<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> off<00:01:16.440> TVs<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
mostly just turning on and off TVs and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.840 
mostly just turning on and off TVs and
and<00:01:18.300> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.480> fry<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.140> people's<00:01:19.590> cars<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.250> made

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and you know fry in people's cars I made

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.020 
and you know fry in people's cars I made
myself<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.450> card<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:23.160> all<00:01:23.730> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
myself a card here that's got all the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940 
myself a card here that's got all the
different<00:01:24.450> kinds<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.930> drones<00:01:25.260> on<00:01:25.590> those

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
different kinds of drones on those

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.740 
different kinds of drones on those
bigger<00:01:26.190> ones<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.730> might<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:27.060> military<00:01:27.600> or

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
bigger ones that might be military or

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.110 
bigger ones that might be military or
