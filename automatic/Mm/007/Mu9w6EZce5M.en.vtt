00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.770
 triple in is the simplest form 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.280
 of getting and improving it 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.280
 may be full 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.690
 leisurely walk with the ball at the foot 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.270
 the each pass touches with alternating inside 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.140
 and outside of the foot above 100 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.140
 always in direction 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 relaxing in the foreground to walk with 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.619
 take the tree with short taps 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.939
 of course it is also with the weak am 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.579
 practiced 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.759
 awkward and always starting it all the time 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.759
 better 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.430
 finally 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.489
 contact with one leg after four paul 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 the ball take the other leg 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.950
 a move that does take over 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.950
 with the other leg 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.520
 starting the ball with the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.350
 bottom of the forefoot one pass each 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.380
 take a good part with the tip of the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.180
 food hit the ball and every pass to mine 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.360
 to get the receipt with a strong and weak leg 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.360
 take 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.580
 running forward and backward 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.870
 then run in which it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.850
 upper body must remain well balanced 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.880
 not reclining helmet and good on the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.650
 front feet keep moving the knees 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.369
 go straight up with the food ball 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.440
 get it back 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.070
 and then immediately do ahead with 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.070
 inside foot 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.240
 I know that and with outside and inside 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.920
 football back and get that foot 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.610
 quickly brings to the ball straight 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 pushing forward at the time of 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 retrieving the ball I can stand at 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.500
 not stand but must be moving 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.400
 the ball returns and so does the standing leg 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.330
 goes a little backwards always good on the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.330
 moving the front feet 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.300
 well with the weak banks 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.480
 now practiced to every movement 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.709
 always changes my after the forward 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.150
 take 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.150
 goes over to the other leg 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.849
 walking the ball sideways with the food 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.849
 take 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.230
 walk well sideways from 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.650
 the hip and the ball 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:05.680
 hit every passion walking on the forequarters 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:08.350
 and the knees move upward with it 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.480
 strong leg and back with the face 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.820
 same side on the ball with the weak 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.470
 take with you 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.010
 the ball as well as possible a straight line 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.010
 let it roll 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.099
 With the tip of the food the ball 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.659
 play alongside with alternately strong 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:35.860
 and weak base after it for long player 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.860
 always a few between passes 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.730
 pulling the foot carriage and the ball both 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.400
 with the strong when awake tidy 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.859
 to visit me does not halt or 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.370
 play sideways but for along the 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.370
 correct speed 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.780
 bottom foot on the ball and simultaneously with 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.470
 point of the other foot the ball a small 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.290
 give both legs a tap 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.700
 and simultaneously create an action on the right 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.760
 ball left and tap the ball briefly 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:21.310
 not too far away player the ball in it 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.310
 get in the middle and give no effect 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.499
 same as exercise 6 but now 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.439
 pass the ball behind the first leg 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:33.039
 played after having set foot on the ball 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.529
 placed 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.939
 turn the body a quarter turn with the 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.259
 a tap inside the feet 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.580
 to give 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.099
 this movement can be later as 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.180
 pass movements are used 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.129
 the ball on one side of the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.689
 opponent and himself on the other side 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:51.879
 walk past the opponent on the 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.330
 quickly place the bottom of the ball 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:58.360
 the feet touch alternately with strong ones 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.639
 and weak when the ball is hit but 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.529
 stays on the plate 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.120
 not get back on body 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:06.120
 as much as possible above the ball 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.919
 unroll the ball from the tank with the sole of the foot 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.779
 to heel and back with the right 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.279
 diagonally for along to left and with 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:20.439
 left to right well from time to heel 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:23.020
 and roll the ball back 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.659
 slightly expensive and on the ball to one 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:31.089
 leg the body to turn around for 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:32.889
 almost the other with the 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:35.500
 inside of the football are worth it 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.969
 for unrolling along 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.099
 before the foot lands 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.599
 recovered and with the other leg 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.930
 to practise 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:46.330
 group keep in touch with the ball after the 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.770
 exercise to stand still 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.770
 does the standing leg go with it 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.659
 the shore is now 4 to 5 times rolled for 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:03.250
 that the ball is taken over with it 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:04.539
 others when standing still with the inside of the foot 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.669
 or food 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.860
 obliquely rolling forward and out of the ball 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.990
 pretend the ball with the 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.449
 inside of the foot, but is teased 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.759
 over the balloon and back 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.389
 always alternating with the strong and weak 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.389
 with a suitcase
