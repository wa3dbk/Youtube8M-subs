00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.720 
you know who's basically investing in me
even<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.890> doesn't<00:00:56.100> even<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
even it doesn't even have to be a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.340 
even it doesn't even have to be a
business<00:00:57.120> situation<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.050> thought<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
business situation but I thought the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.260 
business situation but I thought the
business<00:00:58.680> rope<00:00:58.890> situation<00:00:59.789> would<00:00:59.940> represent

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
business rope situation would represent

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
business rope situation would represent
things<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.070> beautifully<00:01:02.070> succinct<00:01:02.670> way

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
things in a beautifully succinct way

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.250 
things in a beautifully succinct way
because<00:01:03.180> essentially<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:03.989> what's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
because essentially that's what's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.530 
because essentially that's what's
happening<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.220> an<00:01:05.400> allegory<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.150> what

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
happening it's it's an allegory for what

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.649 
happening it's it's an allegory for what
would<00:01:06.720> happen<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:08.670> real<00:01:08.700> life<00:01:09.090> when<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> girl's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
would happen in real life when a girl's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.780 
would happen in real life when a girl's
basically<00:01:10.409> investing<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> when<00:01:11.549> she's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
basically investing in you when she's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.359 
basically investing in you when she's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
gonna be perfect for the combination

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.920 
gonna be perfect for the combination
but<00:02:14.100> by<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.340> butting<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.060> cutting<00:02:15.570> her<00:02:15.720> off

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930

and then stopping her investment it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.730 
and then stopping her investment it
really<00:02:18.450> doesn't<00:02:18.810> help<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.140> conversation<00:02:19.350> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
really doesn't help the conversation a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.220 
really doesn't help the conversation a
little<00:02:19.880> what's<00:02:20.880> best<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.780> keep<00:02:21.960> quiet

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
little what's best is just to keep quiet

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.680 
little what's best is just to keep quiet
as<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.710> had<00:02:22.830> said<00:02:23.010> wait<00:02:23.310> for<00:02:23.610> later<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.510> just

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
as you had said wait for later but just

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600
