so<00:00:10.820> when<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.849> first<00:00:12.090> decided<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.809> was<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.080> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
so when I first decided I was going to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.310 
so when I first decided I was going to
do<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:15.360> pondering<00:00:15.599> how<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> get<00:00:16.199> all

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
do this I was pondering how to get all

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.220 
do this I was pondering how to get all
these<00:00:16.470> bulb<00:00:16.770> heads<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.199> they're<00:00:19.199> all

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
these bulb heads out and they're all

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.320 
these bulb heads out and they're all
rusted<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.039> it's<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> take<00:00:21.029> me<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> lot

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
rusted and it's going to take me a lot

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.880 
rusted and it's going to take me a lot
of<00:00:21.390> time<00:00:21.689> because<00:00:21.930> there's<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.170> million<00:00:22.410> bolts

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
of time because there's a million bolts

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.849 
of time because there's a million bolts
in<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.160> thing<00:00:23.369> basically<00:00:24.590> we're<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.619> going

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
in this thing basically we're not going

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.870 
in this thing basically we're not going
to<00:00:25.890> take<00:00:26.070> them<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.340> we're<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to take them out we're just going to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.450 
to take them out we're just going to
break<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.269> off<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:29.310> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
break them off and to do that all you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.220 
break them off and to do that all you
need<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.929> handsaw<00:00:30.929> or<00:00:31.460> skill<00:00:32.460> saw<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.230> check

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
need is a handsaw or skill saw so check

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.850 
need is a handsaw or skill saw so check
this<00:00:34.380> out

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
this out

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.770 
this out
what<00:00:35.399> kind<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.670> neath<00:00:35.880> make<00:00:36.239> sure<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.660> you're

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
what kind of neath make sure that you're

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.389 
what kind of neath make sure that you're
not<00:00:36.899> cutting<00:00:37.170> into<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> metal<00:00:37.950> brackets

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
not cutting into the metal brackets

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
not cutting into the metal brackets
here's<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.329> mobile<00:00:39.629> brackets<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.230> see

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
here's the mobile brackets you can see

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.010 
here's the mobile brackets you can see
here<00:00:40.829> there's<00:00:41.790> two<00:00:41.969> axles<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.870> there's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
here there's two axles here and there's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.799 
here there's two axles here and there's
a<00:00:43.079> metal<00:00:43.379> bracket<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> bolts<00:00:45.600> run

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
a metal bracket here and the bolts run

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.750 
a metal bracket here and the bolts run
right<00:00:46.020> through<00:00:46.050> here

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
right through here

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.830 
right through here
and<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.059> you're<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.629> make

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and so all you're going to do is make

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.810 
and so all you're going to do is make
two<00:00:48.870> cuts<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> side<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:50.760> on

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
two cuts one on this side and one on

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.450 
two cuts one on this side and one on
this<00:00:51.059> side<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.770> then<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:53.010> break<00:00:53.190> those

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
this side and then you can break those

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
this side and then you can break those
bolts<00:00:53.879> loops<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.649> get<00:00:55.649> all<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:55.890> wood<00:00:56.070> up

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
bolts loops and get all your wood up

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:07.650 
bolts loops and get all your wood up
pretty<00:00:56.550> quick

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.200 

just<00:01:08.660> like<00:01:08.870> that

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.540 

it<00:01:12.200> really<00:01:12.440> helps<00:01:12.770> if<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.040> do<00:01:13.190> every<00:01:13.520> other

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
it really helps if you do every other

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.280 
it really helps if you do every other
board<00:01:14.350> just<00:01:15.350> like<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:16.690> you<00:01:17.690> can<00:01:17.780> start<00:01:18.080> on

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
board just like this you can start on

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.230 
board just like this you can start on
one<00:01:18.500> end<00:01:18.710> or<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.950> other<00:01:18.980> just<00:01:19.250> do<00:01:19.610> every<00:01:19.880> other

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
one end or the other just do every other

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.710 
one end or the other just do every other
board<00:01:21.020> across<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:22.150> then<00:01:23.150> once<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.570> get<00:01:23.660> that

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
board across and then once you get that

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.140 
board across and then once you get that
done<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.170> start<00:01:24.560> with<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.890> middle<00:01:25.160> board<00:01:25.400> and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
done you start with the middle board and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.310 
done you start with the middle board and
work<00:01:26.960> your<00:01:27.110> way<00:01:27.170> out<00:01:28.600> otherwise<00:01:29.600> what<00:01:30.020> ends<00:01:30.260> up

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
work your way out otherwise what ends up

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.860 
work your way out otherwise what ends up
happening<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:31.010> you<00:01:31.160> get<00:01:31.280> some<00:01:32.270> boards<00:01:32.600> in<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
happening is you get some boards in the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.860 
happening is you get some boards in the
middle<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.380> just<00:01:34.340> bend<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.360> crap<00:01:35.600> out<00:01:35.840> of

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
middle that just bend the crap out of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.100 
middle that just bend the crap out of
these<00:01:36.580> bars<00:01:37.580> on<00:01:37.940> in<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.510> middle<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:38.930> they're

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
these bars on in the middle here they're

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.770 
these bars on in the middle here they're
not<00:01:39.140> real<00:01:39.440> strong<00:01:40.780> but<00:01:42.010> that<00:01:43.010> seems<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.460> work

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
not real strong but that seems to work

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.480 
not real strong but that seems to work
this<00:01:44.780> was<00:01:44.990> my<00:01:45.110> first<00:01:45.350> attempt<00:01:45.920> right<00:01:46.070> here<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
this was my first attempt right here and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.609 
this was my first attempt right here and
as<00:01:46.580> you<00:01:46.729> can<00:01:46.760> see<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:47.300> cut<00:01:47.990> them<00:01:48.110> all<00:01:48.229> at<00:01:48.410> once

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
as you can see I cut them all at once

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.270 
as you can see I cut them all at once
but<00:01:49.490> what<00:01:49.700> happens<00:01:50.060> now<00:01:50.300> is<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.560> entire<00:01:51.890> thing

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
but what happens now is the entire thing

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.469 
but what happens now is the entire thing
moves<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:54.070> if<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.220> pry<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.520> hard<00:01:55.910> on<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.300> it's

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
moves and if I pry to hard on that it's

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.570 
moves and if I pry to hard on that it's
just<00:01:56.720> going<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.900> break<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.290> metal<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:58.250> after

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
just going to break the metal and after

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.690 
just going to break the metal and after
I<00:01:58.610> get<00:01:58.820> all<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.150> boards<00:01:59.720> off<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.520> clean<00:02:01.520> up

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
I get all the boards off and clean up

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.400 
I get all the boards off and clean up
this<00:02:01.880> little<00:02:02.860> heads<00:02:03.860> here's<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:05.229> here's<00:02:06.229> what

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
this little heads here's the here's what

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.919 
this little heads here's the here's what
the<00:02:06.560> old<00:02:07.090> screws<00:02:08.090> look<00:02:08.390> like<00:02:08.570> by<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.810> way

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
the old screws look like by the way
