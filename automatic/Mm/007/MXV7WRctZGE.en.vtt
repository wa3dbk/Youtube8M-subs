00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.640
 Let's see covers. 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:19.160
 The cover chosen for this tutorial, is sheet metal, even the tiles are still used 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.630
 although to a lesser extent, people are already choosing the sheet a lot, for a question 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.810
 of costs. 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:35.500
 Also more modern tastes, for a little more cubic architecture and a little simpler 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.780
 and leaving a little to the traditional chalet a little aside, although still, of course, 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.000
 used. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.650
 For the purposes of this video tutorial, we are going to analyze a sheet metal roof. 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.390
 In this case, we have already climbed the chained, we have the walls raised to hide 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 ceiling. 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.190
 What this house is trying to do is hide the roof and not show it. 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.420
 A person walking will see this, will see this there and will never be able to roof, 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.990
 then the roof is hidden and the most important thing to be taken into account for 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:27.429
 to make a roof of veneers well is that never, never, never, never, never, never, never, 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.429
 never, never, you have to stuff the sheet inside the wall. 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.110
 It is NEVER. 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.960
 It never means never. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.719
 The sheet must be a centimeter from the wall, an inch and never get 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:45.719
 inside the wall. 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:55.950
 The sheet when heated with the sun expands strongly, meaning that it stretches and that 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.439
 stretching produces fissures, for example here on this side. 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.270
 Here on this side it produces fissures and that fissure will cause the water to get out there 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.500
 and the deterioration of housing will slowly begin. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:20.250
 Keep in mind that the only secret to keep your home unchanged is 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.220
 Protect it from water. 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.830
 Let there be no water anywhere. 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.790
 Now, you are going to say, 'but if I do not join the sheet with the wall, how do I prevent it from entering 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.080
 the water inside my house for this endija that is going to stay here? ' 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.020
 That is very simple to solve. 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.630
 With what is called a slug. 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:51.200
 A slug of sheet metal also, the sheet reaches here and then this is what it is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.970
 put inside the wall, is embedded in the wall, this sheet that has about twenty five 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.720
 to thirty centimeters depending on the slope of the ceiling, but about twenty-five centimeters. 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.400
 This plate does get inside the wall, this sheet does not get inside the wall. 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.030
 That is a centimeter and then we will finish with this, we make the termination so that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.260
 we get the water. 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.520
 And if we want to do well, before putting the slobber, we seal all this joint with polyurethane, 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.480
 expanded polyurethane and then we put the slobber. 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.220
 In the same way, on these sides here, on the sides of here, the sheet is 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.030
 floating inside the ceiling and never enters a wall, never. 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:49.310
 Let's see with a real example how the structure of a roof is put together. 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:04:02.630
 Traditionally, the ceilings have been made of wood by means of braces, rafters, boards 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.950
 or machimbrados, but they have always been made of wood. 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.900
 In this case I have already chosen to leave the wood a little, when you can and, take 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.870
 Galvanized iron profiles, which are these, to replace the wood because the wood 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.750
 It is coming very badly. 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.250
 It comes green, they cut it, they do not let it park and they send it directly. 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.620
 Then when one places the wood, the wood is easily deformed when being with a pair 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.470
 of hours no more under the sun. 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.370
 The wood is deformed and the roofs are very difficult to assemble. 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:53.250
 I have already made the decision several years ago to use galvanized iron, it is a profile 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:01.150
 very robust, very strong and that perfectly replaces the wood and you will never have problems 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.160
 so much of bug drill, not even to paint it, this has no maintenance. 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.620
 Of course it gets covered later, right? 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.400
 It is covered with a ceiling, but the structure is extremely robust. 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.070
 Here we see how the roof can be perfectly assembled, the plates are going to be bolted 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.910
 to this structure. 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.260
 There we see the exit of the water from the gutter. 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.340
 That profile from there is set at 26 centimeters to allow a perfectly fit 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.860
 25 cm channel, which is a minimum channel to take a roof of 40 to 50 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.650
 square meter. 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.400
 There if you can see, there are some wires, those wires are going to hold the glass wool 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:58.210
 that will make thermal insulation and vapor barrier, both. 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:05.770
 Then we can see perfectly the structure where the sheet is going to be screwed. 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.710
 Here we see those wires again, at the end you see the gutter and there some plates on. 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.830
 That glass wool has to be put with the paper down, not as I have seen that the 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.880
 put with the paper up. 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:27.350
 Paper is very important because it serves as a vapor barrier and steam is one of the 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.710
 elements that produce water inside the house. 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:38.020
 There we see what we said about the separation of the sheet, that is, that never gets in 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.020
 the wall. 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.020
 There we see it. 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.330
 The sheet never enters the wall, never, never. 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.220
 Here we will see more clearly, there you can see, a centimeter, the sheet reaches there, 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.980
 one centimeter. 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.780
 There it looks perfect. 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.000
 That's perfect. That's sealed then, before putting the slobber 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.580
 with polyurethane and is perfectly sealed. 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.590
 You see? 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:14.630
 The sheet does not enter the wall. 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:21.090
 Here we see the gutter, and the drain in the end. 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:27.449
 Here we see the glass wool held by the wires that we used to see so that 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.790
 Flex the glass wool and become deformed. 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.170
 You see? 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.530
 The paper down that works as a vapor barrier to prevent steam from penetrating 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.530
 inside the house. 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:52.790
 Very good, everything looks perfect. 

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.990
 Let's continue with the next step.
