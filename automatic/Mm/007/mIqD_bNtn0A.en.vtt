problem<00:02:12.000> with<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.270> map<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
problem with this map is the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.180 
problem with this map is the
performance<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.990> wouldn't<00:02:14.680> say<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.010> too

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
performance I wouldn't say it is too

terribly unoptimized but I believe

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.290 
terribly unoptimized but I believe
before<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.860> goes<00:02:18.010> live<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.520> will<00:02:18.700> become<00:02:19.000> more

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
before it goes live it will become more

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.430 
before it goes live it will become more
