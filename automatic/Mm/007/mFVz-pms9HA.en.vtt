00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.649
 the staff this is the video that I said 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.420
 who was going to record his weak recording 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.799
 my phone is is to show you 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.940
 How does the game run? 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:26.960
 yes yes record 50 fps same setting 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:31.640
 of my video recorded by the weak is a 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:38.719
 graph the same configuration 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.719
 direct x 10m 1 gig board in full hd 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:53.789
 going down graphics here x10 in full 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.570
 hd 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.899
 all normal that is the minimum for the game 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.399
 who does not know the game yet 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.030
 But let me get a car here, no 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:11.100
 my video recorded with freights I said 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:18.960
 For you that running did not give joy 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:21.740
 nothing to see this car here direct with 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.740
 A difficult 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.560
 oh now I'm going to leave here at fps 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:39.290
 5340 only gets further away from the game wheel 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.380
 good without recording and good quiet wheel 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.570
 tone what I said that there is a 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.090
 board what I said in the video you have 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.130
 1 giga board you can rotate the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.880
 cool game for but you have to have a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.040
 cutting a run runs a process of 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.060
 four point nuclei and 3 already do not know how 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.210
 is that which rotates if you have another video but 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.000
 this I use and 7 37 70 caqueta taking the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.750
 weight on the back depending on the plaque 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.370
 is not going anywhere is it without sound 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.100
 because I'm using the set then the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.760
 my voice, but that's the game 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:25.820
 how does 40 40 fps runs smoothly 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:28.480
 calm down, I got this car 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.590
 I'll run faster here faster yet. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.920
 to see if we have a problem 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.410
 Legg how I'm holding my cell phone? 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.830
 you will get the mouse or you will play 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.830
 here o 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.450
 I do not want another car 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.660
 I lost the car, gotta get it here. 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:07.640
 Let's see now which species does not fall 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:14.480
 spade 30 these things running smoothly 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:16.760
 Quick, it's soft, I just saw you. 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.090
 musically strange here playing in that 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.090
 fight 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.400
 I think trying to run here will 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.660
 O 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:42.650
 it takes practically and 60 fps very much 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:47.990
 good played was well done other than gta 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.790
 4 is very very very well done but it is 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.360
 This you had doubts and was rolling 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.460
 with the board of 1 gigabyte or more foci 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.180
 passed so the wheel rotates more 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.950
 have to have a good processor but it's just 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:09.760
 That's right, this video only proves there 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:12.740
 yes, no tie, and that's it 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.760
 I hope I have helped those who had doubts. 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.720
 there and good luck to whoever is playing 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.720
 arm spoke
