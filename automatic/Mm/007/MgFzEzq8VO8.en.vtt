00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
and here's his forehead you have to make

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.280 
and here's his forehead you have to make
sure<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.829> he<00:03:26.430> has<00:03:26.609> a<00:03:26.639> forehead<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.870> flip

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
sure that he has a forehead if you flip

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.740 
sure that he has a forehead if you flip
it<00:03:28.380> over<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.829> way<00:03:28.889> you'll<00:03:29.790> notice<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.510> he

and the weave won't work you need to

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.599 
and the weave won't work you need to
flip<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.269> over<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.859> mouse<00:03:38.130> has<00:03:38.579> a
