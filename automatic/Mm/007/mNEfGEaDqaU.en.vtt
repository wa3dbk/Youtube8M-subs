 refill canon sx40 cartridge 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:23.610
 this is the starting tuple it has smaller 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.550
 volume than the standard differs less 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.550
 a toner hopper and a little less for us 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.489
 bunker working out the principle of parsing one and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.170
 same in order for us to take it apart 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:41.129
 we need to start 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.879
 remove pins that hold two 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.879

 small mustache tuple it splits 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.190
 in two parts 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 Let's start with the part in which we will 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 pour powder directly to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.869
 we need to disassemble it sarella 2 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:28.580
 fillings conceal don't dig your mind screwdriver 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:35.299
 snap one and the second then a little

 and clean the remnants of the old powder 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.180
 we withstand the gear when we shake out 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.180
 so that it does not fall out 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.860
 clear the dosing blade slightly 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.600

 evenly kneel and powder on 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.200
 magnetic 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:52.050
 we also feel the year itself and start 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.790
 directly pour the powder for 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:00.950
 This model can use powder 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:03.270
 lineup 1210 10 1320 falling asleep 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.780
 the resulting hole between many 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.630
 nuvola 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.610
 not dosing regimen we fall asleep to the top but

 could mix freely during 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:22.250
 work hard not just tamping

 top 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.030
 insert back could gave 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.980
 scroll gear to roller 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.790
 went deeper 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.370
 next we need to crank the rod 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.379
 align it with the semicircular hole 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.379
 so that the rod goes deeper 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.599
