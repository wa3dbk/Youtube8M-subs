um you know I've been trading with
chemistry<00:02:55.459> styles<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:56.060> lot<00:02:56.690> lately<00:02:57.019> it's<00:02:57.319> my

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
chemistry styles a lot lately it's my

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.250 
chemistry styles a lot lately it's my
go-to<00:02:57.859> method<00:02:58.420> every<00:02:59.420> single<00:02:59.780> day<00:02:59.930> that's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
go-to method every single day that's

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.289 
go-to method every single day that's
exactly<00:03:00.560> what<00:03:01.069> I'm<00:03:01.160> doing<00:03:01.220> every<00:03:01.819> single<00:03:02.000> day

so<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.620> really<00:03:03.980> what<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.250> guys<00:03:04.430> should

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.449 
so this is really what you guys should
be<00:03:04.700> doing<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.180> should<00:03:06.069> essentially<00:03:07.069> this

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
be doing it should essentially this

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.119 
be doing it should essentially this
should<00:03:07.849> be<00:03:08.150> working<00:03:08.420> on<00:03:08.859> PlayStation<00:03:09.859> because

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
should be working on PlayStation because

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.349 
should be working on PlayStation because
you're<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:10.459> taking<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.879> method<00:03:11.209> and

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
you're just taking the method and

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.110 
you're just taking the method and
applying<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.959> PlayStation<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.220> mean<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
applying it to PlayStation so I mean the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.119 
applying it to PlayStation so I mean the
only<00:03:14.180> thing<00:03:14.359> different<00:03:14.780> would<00:03:15.140> be<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.560> prices

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
only thing different would be the prices

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.530 
only thing different would be the prices
obviously<00:03:16.609> are<00:03:16.730> different<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:17.209> other<00:03:17.389> than

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
obviously are different but other than

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.099 
obviously are different but other than
that<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:18.230> actual<00:03:19.099> method<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:19.880> same<00:03:20.239> now

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
that the actual method is the same now

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.470 
that the actual method is the same now
the<00:03:21.500> reason<00:03:21.680> why<00:03:22.010> i<00:03:22.040> use<00:03:22.579> hunter<00:03:23.030> guys<00:03:23.180> is

little quick tip that I want to go ahead
and<00:04:51.380> discuss<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:51.830> this<00:04:52.010> video<00:04:52.340> though<00:04:52.610> is

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
and discuss in this video though is

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.730 
and discuss in this video though is
you'll<00:04:53.570> notice<00:04:53.840> that<00:04:53.870> in<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.199> transfer

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
you'll notice that in the transfer

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.240 
you'll notice that in the transfer
market<00:04:54.770> there<00:04:55.520> is<00:04:55.550> over<00:04:56.540> 1<00:04:56.870> million<00:04:57.320> live

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
market there is over 1 million live

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.610 
market there is over 1 million live
transfers<00:04:59.030> so<00:04:59.330> anytime<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.020> there's<00:05:00.350> over

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
transfers so anytime that there's over

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.680 
transfers so anytime that there's over
1,000,000<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.340> becomes<00:05:01.639> very<00:05:01.760> difficult<00:05:02.150> to

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
1,000,000 it becomes very difficult to

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.570 
1,000,000 it becomes very difficult to
trade<00:05:02.990> you'll<00:05:03.470> notice<00:05:03.800> that<00:05:03.830> if<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.190> go<00:05:04.340> to<00:05:04.400> my

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
trade you'll notice that if you go to my

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.210 
trade you'll notice that if you go to my
transfer<00:05:05.180> targets<00:05:05.870> I've<00:05:06.350> been<00:05:06.560> on<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:06.860> lot<00:05:07.160> of

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
transfer targets I've been on a lot of

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.440 
transfer targets I've been on a lot of
them<00:05:07.460> throughout<00:05:07.729> this<00:05:07.910> video<00:05:08.180> if<00:05:08.270> you<00:05:08.330> guys

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
them throughout this video if you guys

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.719 
them throughout this video if you guys
were<00:05:08.600> paying<00:05:08.840> attention<00:05:09.070> didn't<00:05:10.070> win<00:05:10.220> many<00:05:10.550> of

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
were paying attention didn't win many of

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.520 
were paying attention didn't win many of
them<00:05:10.940> but<00:05:11.330> that's<00:05:11.479> completely<00:05:11.870> fine<00:05:12.169> as<00:05:12.500> long

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
them but that's completely fine as long

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.740 
them but that's completely fine as long
as<00:05:12.889> I'm<00:05:12.979> only<00:05:13.220> winning<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.729> couple<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.210> them<00:05:14.360> I'm

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
as I'm only winning a couple of them I'm

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.540 
as I'm only winning a couple of them I'm
still<00:05:15.080> making<00:05:15.290> almost<00:05:15.860> six<00:05:16.100> seven<00:05:16.340> hundred

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
still making almost six seven hundred

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.060 
still making almost six seven hundred
coins<00:05:16.729> per<00:05:17.090> card<00:05:17.419> even<00:05:18.320> though<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.590> notice

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
coins per card even though you notice

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.400 
coins per card even though you notice
that<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.460> that<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.120> going<00:05:20.930> rate<00:05:21.139> was<00:05:21.289> around

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
that the that the going rate was around

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.290 
that the that the going rate was around
2,600<00:05:22.100> there<00:05:22.370> was<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.490> lot<00:05:22.669> for<00:05:22.970> them<00:05:23.120> at<00:05:23.270> that

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
2,600 there was a lot for them at that

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.390 
2,600 there was a lot for them at that
buy<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:23.750> now<00:05:24.020> price<00:05:24.410> it<00:05:24.710> doesn't<00:05:25.220> matter

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
buy it now price it doesn't matter

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.070 
buy it now price it doesn't matter
because<00:05:25.520> later<00:05:25.970> on<00:05:26.060> in<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.449> day<00:05:26.479> that<00:05:26.660> buy<00:05:27.020> it

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
because later on in the day that buy it

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.219 
because later on in the day that buy it
now<00:05:27.350> price<00:05:27.650> rises<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.400> little<00:05:28.699> bit<00:05:28.850> and<00:05:29.229> the

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
now price rises a little bit and the

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.890 
now price rises a little bit and the
reason<00:05:30.440> is<00:05:30.800> because<00:05:31.039> there<00:05:31.760> are<00:05:32.000> less<00:05:32.479> players

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
reason is because there are less players

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.650 
reason is because there are less players
on<00:05:33.260> ultimate<00:05:34.160> team<00:05:34.430> so<00:05:35.090> there<00:05:35.300> aren't<00:05:35.450> that

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
on ultimate team so there aren't that

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.320 
on ultimate team so there aren't that
many<00:05:35.740> there<00:05:36.740> aren't<00:05:37.010> as<00:05:37.100> many<00:05:37.130> cards<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.210> go

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
many there aren't as many cards to go

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.270 
many there aren't as many cards to go
ahead<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.630> purchase<00:05:38.750> so<00:05:39.020> that<00:05:39.169> 2600<00:05:39.889> might<00:05:40.100> go

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
ahead and purchase so that 2600 might go

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.909 
ahead and purchase so that 2600 might go
up<00:05:40.460> to<00:05:40.610> around<00:05:40.760> 2900<00:05:41.300> you<00:05:41.990> guys<00:05:42.169> saw<00:05:42.470> one<00:05:42.770> on
