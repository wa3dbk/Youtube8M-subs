00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
the same length and the end ins as we

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.240 
the same length and the end ins as we
could<00:05:20.610> compare<00:05:21.000> this<00:05:21.150> with<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:24.240> replica

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
could compare this with the replica

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.560 
could compare this with the replica
seems<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.400> both<00:05:26.669> of<00:05:26.849> the<00:05:26.909> ends<00:05:27.240> have<00:05:27.419> the

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
seems that both of the ends have the

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:35.870 
seems that both of the ends have the
same<00:05:27.810> length<00:05:29.389> of<00:05:30.389> ending<00:05:32.510> so<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:34.550> feel<00:05:35.550> I<00:05:35.580> went

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
same length of ending so I feel I went

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.460 
same length of ending so I feel I went
through<00:05:36.030> a<00:05:36.060> lot<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.300> things<00:05:36.599> it's<00:05:37.139> probably

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
through a lot of things it's probably

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.490 
through a lot of things it's probably
not<00:05:37.620> on<00:05:37.889> the<00:05:37.979> computer<00:05:38.190> horses<00:05:38.909> I<00:05:39.380> mean<00:05:40.380> this

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
not on the computer horses I mean this

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.379 
not on the computer horses I mean this
one's<00:05:40.770> pretty<00:05:41.039> easy<00:05:41.099> to<00:05:41.490> tell<00:05:41.729> this<00:05:41.940> rail<00:05:42.210> from

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
one's pretty easy to tell this rail from

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.050 
one's pretty easy to tell this rail from
fake<00:05:42.720> because<00:05:43.310> replicas<00:05:44.310> are<00:05:44.490> getting<00:05:44.880> really

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
fake because replicas are getting really

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.390 
fake because replicas are getting really
good<00:05:45.330> nowadays<00:05:48.560> I'll<00:05:49.560> compare<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:49.979> horse<00:05:50.220> of

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
you're comparing it to the rail one you

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.070 
you're comparing it to the rail one you
see<00:06:06.599> the<00:06:06.750> detail<00:06:07.259> in<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:07.620> horse<00:06:08.509> how<00:06:09.509> stitched

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
back looks like anyways my video kind of

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:24.290 
back looks like anyways my video kind of
got<00:06:21.659> cut<00:06:21.900> off<00:06:21.960> but<00:06:22.639> that's<00:06:23.639> what<00:06:23.789> the<00:06:23.880> back<00:06:24.090> of

the horse looks like and
I<00:06:28.640> just<00:06:29.640> figured<00:06:29.910> out<00:06:30.030> that<00:06:30.240> BAC<00:06:30.690> does<00:06:30.930> have

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
I just figured out that BAC does have

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.460 
I just figured out that BAC does have
like<00:06:31.500> uh<00:06:32.450> the<00:06:33.450> fake<00:06:33.690> one<00:06:33.900> does<00:06:34.080> have<00:06:34.260> like<00:06:34.410> a

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
like uh the fake one does have like a

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.530 
like uh the fake one does have like a
camera<00:06:34.920> structures<00:06:35.310> tag<00:06:35.580> which<00:06:36.510> is

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
camera structures tag which is

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.880 
camera structures tag which is
completely<00:06:37.380> bad<00:06:40.040> compared<00:06:41.040> to<00:06:41.160> the<00:06:41.280> real<00:06:41.490> one

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
completely bad compared to the real one

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.870 
completely bad compared to the real one
anyways<00:06:43.890> that's<00:06:44.160> what<00:06:44.220> the<00:06:44.400> back<00:06:44.610> of<00:06:44.760> the

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
anyways that's what the back of the

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.730 
anyways that's what the back of the
horse<00:06:45.180> on<00:06:45.450> the<00:06:45.600> authentic<00:06:46.230> one<00:06:46.410> looks<00:06:46.620> like

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
horse on the authentic one looks like

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:57.380 
horse on the authentic one looks like
very<00:06:49.740> detail-oriented<00:06:51.110> no<00:06:55.160> so<00:06:56.160> this<00:06:57.090> is<00:06:57.300> just

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 
very detail-oriented no so this is just

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.660 
very detail-oriented no so this is just
my<00:06:57.570> video<00:06:57.870> on<00:06:57.990> how<00:06:58.020> to<00:06:58.110> tell<00:06:58.440> ro<00:06:58.770> whole<00:06:59.430> raw

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670
