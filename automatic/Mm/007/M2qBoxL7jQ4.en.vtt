design and I'll flip it over for you and

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.170 
design and I'll flip it over for you and
let<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:42.800> see<00:04:43.070> what<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:43.310> looks<00:04:43.460> like<00:04:43.580> from<00:04:43.850> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
let you see what it looks like from the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.080 
let you see what it looks like from the
other<00:04:44.210> side<00:04:45.790> okay<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:47.090> there's<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:49.090> turn

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
other side okay so there's that turn

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.130 
other side okay so there's that turn
around<00:04:50.240> once<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.810> see<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.020> again<00:04:54.460> ok<00:04:56.140> so

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
around once you see it again ok so

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.540 
around once you see it again ok so
anyway<00:04:57.440> like<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.520> said<00:04:58.550> I'm<00:05:00.010> this<00:05:01.010> looks<00:05:01.340> like

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
anyway like I said I'm this looks like

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.500 
anyway like I said I'm this looks like
more<00:05:02.300> like<00:05:02.330> us<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:03.050> I<00:05:03.740> don't<00:05:04.280> know<00:05:04.479> much<00:05:05.479> about

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
more like us and I don't know much about

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.880 
more like us and I don't know much about
the<00:05:06.790> skydiving<00:05:08.350> terminology<00:05:09.350> here<00:05:09.500> so<00:05:09.680> bear

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
the skydiving terminology here so bear

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.340 
the skydiving terminology here so bear
with<00:05:09.950> me<00:05:10.130> but<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:11.390> looks<00:05:11.660> like<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.930> squirrel

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
with me but it looks like a squirrel

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.990 
with me but it looks like a squirrel
suit<00:05:12.710> or<00:05:13.280> at<00:05:13.370> least<00:05:13.400> that's<00:05:13.640> what<00:05:13.880> I<00:05:13.910> think

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
suit or at least that's what I think

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.680 
suit or at least that's what I think
they're<00:05:14.450> called<00:05:14.680> squirrel<00:05:15.680> suits<00:05:18.970> ok<00:05:19.970> back<00:05:20.660> to

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
they're called squirrel suits ok back to

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.880 
they're called squirrel suits ok back to

okay<00:05:47.250> so<00:05:48.250> overall<00:05:48.640> I<00:05:49.530> do<00:05:50.530> like<00:05:50.770> this<00:05:51.100> figure

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430

brought<00:06:01.690> shows<00:06:01.960> to<00:06:02.260> include<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.830> lot<00:06:02.980> of

accessories with him the only problems

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.210 
accessories with him the only problems
that<00:06:06.820> I<00:06:06.880> ran<00:06:07.090> into<00:06:07.300> with<00:06:07.540> this<00:06:07.600> figure<00:06:08.220> was

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
that I ran into with this figure was

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.300 
that I ran into with this figure was
with<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.610> glider<00:06:10.120> accessory<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.310> the

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
with the glider accessory and the

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.340 
with the glider accessory and the
short-sword<00:06:12.730> not<00:06:13.120> being<00:06:13.390> held<00:06:13.630> properly<00:06:14.110> in

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
short-sword not being held properly in

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.640 
short-sword not being held properly in
his<00:06:14.650> right<00:06:14.860> hand<00:06:15.720> but<00:06:16.720> other<00:06:16.870> than<00:06:17.080> that<00:06:17.140> I

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
his right hand but other than that I

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.320 
his right hand but other than that I
think<00:06:17.950> this<00:06:18.400> figure<00:06:18.730> deserves<00:06:19.030> a<00:06:19.180> great

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
think this figure deserves a great

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.530 
think this figure deserves a great
recommendation<00:06:20.010> I<00:06:21.010> think<00:06:21.730> that<00:06:21.850> he<00:06:21.940> makes<00:06:22.150> for

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
recommendation I think that he makes for

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.630 
recommendation I think that he makes for
a<00:06:22.570> really<00:06:23.050> nice<00:06:23.320> addition<00:06:23.740> to<00:06:23.770> anyone's<00:06:24.430> di
