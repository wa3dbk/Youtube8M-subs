 the master is not just what the books teach 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.960
 the master is an instance 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.439
 of construction 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.820
 so many wish to do something 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.950
 specifically the world of work 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.820

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.530
 matri catholic 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.730

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.560

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.230
 with set of things 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.780
 can schedules be much better than what 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.560
 a bridge to the world of work if it does that to many more possibilities 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.480
 many many 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.540

 from how it takes a teller master university characters stands 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 becoming a fourth year tradition 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.530
 this year we want to characterize it even more linked to the situation 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.160
 in the Italian and international context today he talks about training and therefore 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.570
 speak university masters 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.430
 you can be 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.770
 separated from the context of the world of work 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.350
 the moment in which a crisis is undergoing a crisis of values 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.130
 world of work chesterton rome publication on the product of the year 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.990

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.050
 popular university 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.530
 also in sight 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950
 the solution to a crisis of Fordism 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.740
 to realize oneself it cannot be 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.200
 the first goal of one who writes for the university of florence. 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:09.689
 on the other side 6 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.459
 you realize yourself 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.959
 we begin to grow the country 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.360
 it is a concern that I will not return to about the product and that contribution is that 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.250
 we feel we can give right now in a context that is not 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.319
 easy 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.059
 but on which we are with you text 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.059

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.959
 no worries post university TV in particular 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.449
 regarding the master 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:49.399
 this because in reality they mask the very particular oven 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.869
 substantially to reduce the distance between the academic world 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.869
 the time of training ones insertion 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.529
 more and more often the companies involved in the organization and management 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.959
 of master and this makes me sibylline 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.039
 those who participate much more 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.479
 forget me chance to play 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.809
 moments when companies make selections of qualified personnel is 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.819

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.360
 you're not taking me we have this presentation our party we have 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.819
 identified some areas where it leaves the bones investing very high 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.829
 defining the remuneration equal to successful professional course 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:43.569
 hehe in particular a very strong connection with the world of work. road routes 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.539
 cartoonize - companies the link will participate if it is made known 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:52.869
 nostalgic me common many years has been in many training courses while the 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:57.260
 power of weights content coming together x always dressed 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.019
 of the paths adhering to the demands of the world of work here we are a lot 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.720
 convinced that master is not a passepartout that applies to everyone and that 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.559
 opens all the doors to everyone 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:12.969
 but it is truly a challenging path that despair and aging DVDs 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.969
 professional but above all lost 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.930
 if I wanted to work in the world of music because I didn't become 

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:31.710
 rehearsed musician 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.599
 despite being passionate 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.050
 so I didn't know anything about what the movements inside can be 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.979
 the world of music and must be high with repercussions of different roles 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.490
 and the master that actually does the drawing ok different roles 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.670
 epodi which 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.850
 probably 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.430

 even if a little while ago a lot for students 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.010
 I really feel that this university is very sensible 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.080
 caring for people has an interest in surmounting that I haven't seen a tower 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.599
 high university 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.949
 you should evaluate in meaning that this mask 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.350
 for me as a person ii 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.780

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.779
 bad. 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:27.709
 because the environment is lessons. completely different format 

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:28.920

 it is a very special moment - 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:47.599
 in the definition with a person 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.539
 until you have to do a master's degree it is not just a moment when you are in charge 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.080
 such moment this is me
