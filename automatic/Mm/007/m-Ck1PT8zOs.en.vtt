00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello to all and all these open and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.370
 yes it was a long time since I had not 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.540
 does a commented video is so 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.000
 today I want to start a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.799
 new small series with you it's in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 have you share what I know 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.300
 in the coding of the patch and all that so 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.550
 I will teach you the basis of a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 patch how to make it there me doing 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.460
 so end for me is the slaughter of a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.619
 page maybe other engines you 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.349
 will say that for them not at all for 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 me is the base is the patch area 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.880
 I call it the base 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 after everyone calls him like yves 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.840
 and I will teach you how 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.160
 said and you will see that there is no 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.600
 that the patch functions in fact one 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 can do a lot of things in shingles 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 it's super cool so I'll put all 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 the software that you need in 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.739
 the description do not worry and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 and not the slope must not bend 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.260
 it's still really easy 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.280
 just have to do what I am at 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.899
 the screen then all at first not it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.059
 you need to zone handler software that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.949
 allows you to extract how much mark 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.110
 and therefore to leave the area of a patch 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.390
 so me it's bad huh because 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.430
 you saw that on youtube gmail at the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.580
 beta of a patch so it's over my wine 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.380
 there's even the v2 that's going on but as 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.150
 post life I do not know yet the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.420
 schedules to all that I can not you 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.490
 show my infinite glass with the area and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.159
 change everything so bah I show it game 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.180
 extract area was waiting because I 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.640
 think I had done before I 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 had not done Abbassi yeah here I 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.930
 stupid here it is actually it was there my match 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.100
 and I had it I had already done it I 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.470
 had it already extract so to you the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.540
 judges have shown how does it's very 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.829
 simple actually extract zon that you 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.460
 put so you are looking for your patch 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.460
 in any file of this patch 1 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.340
 that's it and the area is there so I'm going 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.409
 put next to fashion models is so 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.050
 in this video I teach you to 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.310
 change your models actually 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.010
 that's what will allow you to 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.110
 strafe with shooting on allows 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.410
 to reach super man people with 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.970
 your model and if you have a 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.280
 function in your coach so that's it 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.900
 not in the area by cons attention he 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.650
 will be the infinite ammo on your 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.910
 model 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.310
 and if you have a function in your 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.620
 patch like rapid fire or super pass 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.660
 not that's it ben then you will shoot 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.770
 infinity and it's super hot 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.610
 it's one of the best functions of the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.030
 area that we can m so here 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.940
 now that we have our zone we are going 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.630
 open it and in the zone 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.880
 we are going to search so you do ctrl 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.360
 for those who do not know it's rlf here 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:54.550
 and you mark model ben here we know 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:58.630
 already noticed but he 187 shot from the mount 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.090
 reduced as you want mp there you 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.830
 do then you can even do 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.090
 forward is simply I'm doing 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.120
 always at the party 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.250
 ok it puts you here so there you see 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.050
 well there is the lack ever sought and 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.270
 you're going to take effect screen 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.400
 and you're finally going to you so here you are 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.260
 are you the zone either you go down 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.080
 good all the way down if you already want 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.130
 copy everything or else a thing a lot 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.420
 mighty that a man's jaguar was trying 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.670
 to go back I do not know where I was so 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:40.710
 tech 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:42.900
 here we go open the models up and 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.550
 you go all everything on everything 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.740
 copy so if you see it wrong and 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.610
 because it's finally with him that 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.800
 I learned what and I wanted to do 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.930
 do what else to take with others 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.900
 passions and that's really good and so I 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.550
 the same function as him in my coach 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.900
 so I actually changed them 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.780
 so maybe you are not there 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.890
 there will not be the same stuff like that 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.400
 because I had already modified but 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.920
 it is not serious 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.350
 once you have it copy the tooth 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.300
 of the way because it is copied to here 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:24.270
 so we make her lands she knows if 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:26.670
 you do not know yet that's the effect you 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.250
 go down ba ba ba ba it's when enough 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.920
 low good do not miss 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.450
 and I have a small end mark this is the 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.370
 end what is the benchmark it's simple to 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.640
 know where I was and I believe that 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.640
 I exceeded 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:48.710
 go I can I'm here ah yes yes 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.710
 I was gone I went too fast 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.940
 it's adeline to the fact that it's going to take 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.740
 stop at the bling model 1187 bling 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:04.260
 there stop you here just before the point 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.830
 and you do ctrl b actually it's okay 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.730
 just change 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.380
 yes and here it is a dream but then 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.090
 the football heroes back the point 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.490
 always pay attention that is 0 0 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.060
 because sometimes he's two like 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.710
 that e 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.860
 sails and sailboats that it does not change 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.860
 except that no it must be 0 01 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.510
 point there then once it's done 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.530
 drool to sai models are they are well 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.970
 modeled no need to add 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.980
 puncturing the page or anything 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:39.930
 so him at montclus how do we do 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.150
 that for klose away his lands pupils 4 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.400
 so here's mom once you 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.140
 did it on ice and in red or 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.430
 makes her land she's actually it's 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.520
 as if you are leaning on the small 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.350
 cartridge here's these lands lsc 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.600
 checked in 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.210
 you leave and for m then in 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.750
 your coach you go france to zone en 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:05.100
 their super fast crazy zone injection 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.380
 simple when we are patch software 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.730
 1 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.800
 so here it is the zone chose the zone 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.860
 and then we choose where we want 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:18.660
 inject it into the patch 1 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:20.520
 and that's good it's over for this 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.960
 first episode I think I'm not going 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.300
 show you on the ps3 starts to actually 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.040
 with the models and then at worst if you 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.770
 put in the comments of me 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.890
 finally show to show you 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.470
 I'll do a little video in private that 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.630
 with the link you will see and and then 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.840
 that's how you'll see it works 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.340
 well 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.260
 without you can test by yourself 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.160
 so his walking for you you say 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.450
 in the comments you have 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.840
 maybe did something wrong what 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:51.900
 that's it for this video mom 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.970
 but I tell you see you all soon for 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.290
 the second episode that will happen very 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.090
 soon to really spend a series 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.040
 Dear to my heart 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.450
 the outputs of maps for those who 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.620
 wait do not worry that word of 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.150
 reinforcements of that happens 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.800
 hide I was doing a 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.990
 mac output compilation so that I 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.750
 think I 'll do them all of a sudden but m 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.220
 a video during a video is like that 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.230
 you will have everything where all the outputs 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.030
 map in any case that I know that 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:19.890
 I found what surely reinforcements 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:21.930
 two and you'll be happy that's so
