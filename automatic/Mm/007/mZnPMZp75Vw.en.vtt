00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.080
 hello to the full way for 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.480
 warm your ligaments and but in general 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.220
 can use squats if 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.510
 it is hard for you to warm up forging strongly 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:44.160
 sweat finally no strength 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:01:04.790
 especially if they are 10 repetitions and ligaments 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:01:04.790
 and plus to everything 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.600
 they are the police 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.600
 it's poisonous and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.790
 but I would like to warn you a couple 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.820
 the nuances of the matter is that if you go 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.130
 already on heavier forests when will 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.479
 we can squat in tight weights 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.520
 squat gather back to that thought 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.200
 get hurt for something then i also 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.820
 injured brother from being injured 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.390
 a couple of friends is more than enough 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.340
 to make sure that is true 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.259
 such a nuance and when we crouch with 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.310
 big do it yourself any piece of paper is 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.979
 It works with such straight heavy 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.600
 visa what happens to the body he 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.039
 begins to adapt and on the back 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.740
 heavy load 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.810
 healthier got no less 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.869
 mobility 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.390
 on it and plastic stuff i.e. 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.600
 understand heavy weight the body compresses 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.010
 that is, it adapts to heavy without 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.380
 Therefore, this may work nuance 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.590
 that you went to these forests and then 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.960
 start to stretch and high 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.630
 probability of injury so pay on 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.430
 this 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:34.170
 just the body or for example through verhovka 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.940
 harmful squads this occur here 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.800
 group vkontakte personal open is in 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.800
