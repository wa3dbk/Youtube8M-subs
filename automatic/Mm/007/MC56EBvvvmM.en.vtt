 last three eurovision where our 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.570

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.670
 and buranovskie grandmothers will not allow 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.490
 such errors here for example what 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.110
 the main question is cortisol from russia in 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.359
 2009 m 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.629
 who was there a year 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.389
 according to the survey 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.809
 anastasia came then was Peter 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.059
 we are not lost 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:01.769
 lost and forgotten two years later 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.579
 I understand that these words are prophetic 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.729
 and finally that year was all 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.249
 sparrows he made so many mistakes that yahoo 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.099
 more detailed disassembled let's 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.650
 First, let's see briefly what it is. 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.650
 showed 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.699
 get on the course 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.439
 first mistake he started singing in Russian 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.789
 language I and many lie flights did not understand about 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.789
 what he sings 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.999
 but then he switched to English 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.699
 but here everyone has stopped something 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.699
 understand 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.220
 his performance was extremely 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.220
 unpatriotic look 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.089
 on stage finnish flags 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.259

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.839
 next mistake 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.729
 that's what alexey would like to surprise the whole 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.729

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.349
 service cow size shoes 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.899
 after watching this video, I realized that 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:39.279
 grandmothers acrobatic etudes 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.930
 Not needed 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.430
 finally at the end of his speech 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.729
 Alexey, we obviously wanted to say something 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.729
 look 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:49.860
 hp 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.430
 spruce 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.050
 it seems he himself forgot what he is 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.050
 made at Eurovision 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.039
 you know 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.909
 at first I thought he was joking 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.429
 but then he looked like he behaves 

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:12.559
 other gears such as control 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.830

 i just do 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.229
 then I realized that all areas are very 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.229
 seriously to us 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.110
 we live we play 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.169
 We play in KVN but today for us 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.689
 victory is not the main thing for us to win by 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:00.830
 the results of three games all probably can go 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.580

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.000
