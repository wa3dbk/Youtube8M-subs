well<00:00:53.330> what<00:00:53.629> we<00:00:53.750> didn't<00:00:53.989> do<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:54.710> is<00:00:54.799> our<00:00:54.979> K<00:00:55.159> rig

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
well what we didn't do so is our K rig

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.469 
well what we didn't do so is our K rig
process<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.269> basically<00:00:56.570> lets<00:00:56.809> us<00:00:57.080> analyze<00:00:57.440> our

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
process it basically lets us analyze our

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.850 
process it basically lets us analyze our
kinematics<00:00:59.479> a<00:00:59.659> little<00:00:59.870> bit<00:00:59.989> in<00:01:00.110> motion<00:01:00.589> and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
kinematics a little bit in motion and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.310 
kinematics a little bit in motion and
just<00:01:01.280> check<00:01:01.519> our<00:01:01.729> wheel<00:01:01.909> rates<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.600> go

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
just check our wheel rates and go

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.479 
just check our wheel rates and go
through<00:01:03.530> some<00:01:03.680> different<00:01:03.890> spring<00:01:04.309> rate

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
through some different spring rate

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.910 
through some different spring rate
changes<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:05.420> basically<00:01:06.320> just<00:01:06.560> making<00:01:06.860> a

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
changes and that basically just making a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.030 
changes and that basically just making a
lot<00:01:07.010> of<00:01:07.159> technical<00:01:07.760> decisions<00:01:08.210> on<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.510> team

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040
