00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
first picture is of Captain America I

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.829 
first picture is of Captain America I
think<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.919> a<00:00:25.949> comic<00:00:26.369> version<00:00:26.630> might<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
think this is a comic version might be a

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.659 
think this is a comic version might be a
film<00:00:28.050> version

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.979 

with<00:00:32.669> another<00:00:33.000> character<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.629> right<00:00:33.660> who

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
with another character on the right who

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.040 
with another character on the right who
I<00:00:34.050> actually<00:00:34.260> don't<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.899> on<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I actually don't know it is on the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830 
I actually don't know it is on the
second<00:00:37.320> picture<00:00:37.579> it's<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:38.910> more<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> world

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
second picture it's got more of a world

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.560 
second picture it's got more of a world
war<00:00:40.110> 2<00:00:40.460> Captain<00:00:41.460> America<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
war 2 Captain America on the right and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
war 2 Captain America on the right and
the<00:00:43.290> left<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:43.980> looks<00:00:44.129> pretty<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.489> like

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the left it just looks pretty much like

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
the left it just looks pretty much like
a<00:00:44.730> classic<00:00:45.480> Captain<00:00:45.899> America<00:00:46.489> gone<00:00:47.489> down<00:00:48.320> it's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
a classic Captain America gone down it's

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.720 
a classic Captain America gone down it's
got<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.089> package<00:00:51.089> ins<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> figure<00:00:52.730> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
got the package ins for the figure it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
got the package ins for the figure it
looks<00:00:53.909> like<00:00:54.089> there's<00:00:54.480> gonna<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.720> comic<00:00:55.230> series

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
looks like there's gonna be comic series

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.220 
looks like there's gonna be comic series
and<00:00:55.890> possibly<00:00:56.220> a<00:00:56.309> movie<00:00:56.670> series<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> think

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and possibly a movie series but I think

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.619 
and possibly a movie series but I think
all<00:00:58.409> these<00:00:58.760> figures<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.909> from<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.300> comic

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
all these figures are from the comic

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.719 
all these figures are from the comic
series<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.100> haven't<00:01:02.339> actually<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.699> any

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
series so we haven't actually got any

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.560 
series so we haven't actually got any
movie<00:01:03.150> series<00:01:03.540> on<00:01:03.689> yet<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> also<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
movie series on yet and there is also a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.200 
movie series on yet and there is also a
Captain<00:01:07.229> America<00:01:07.260> stand<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.820> I'm<00:01:08.970> guessing

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
Captain America stand which I'm guessing

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.500 
Captain America stand which I'm guessing
comes<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.810> every<00:01:10.110> figure<00:01:10.970> next<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
comes with every figure next up is a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.670 
comes with every figure next up is a
kind<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.229> Captain<00:01:13.530> America<00:01:13.860> car<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
kind of Captain America car so that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.370 
kind of Captain America car so that
looks<00:01:17.009> okay<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> guess<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.840> got

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
looks okay I guess and then got

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
looks okay I guess and then got
something<00:01:19.740> looks<00:01:19.920> packs<00:01:20.330> this<00:01:21.330> one's<00:01:21.570> called
