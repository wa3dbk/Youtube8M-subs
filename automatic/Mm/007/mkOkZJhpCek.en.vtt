00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.180
 hello everyone welcome on the gold 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.460
 kraft for the hundred thousand for percent 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.009
 thousand subscribers does that makes a lot of 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.870
 zeros that's a lot of people and 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.990
 I wanted to make this first video 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.279
 to thank you because I have when 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.689
 I started my youtube channel ago 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.490
 two years is a hobby now 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.990
 it's a job and there are a hundred thousand 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.800
 people who will change my life 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.859
 now 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.320
 beyond my work as a director and 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.760
 actor that I kept doing but 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.640
 it's true that it was a little bit 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.460
 gone to the background 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.399
 now i have this youtube channel which 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.360
 gives a lot of pleasure with grace 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.670
 to which I meet a lot of 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.200
 great people and who gets you 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.270
 a lot of fun too I have 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.020
 the impression it seems to me enough 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:58.309
 fundamental nevertheless and suddenly 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.350
 a priori still years of those of 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.170
 this awesome activity that subsequently 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.580
 in addition may allow me to 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.049
 bounce if something at not what 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.240
 I would really have a base something 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.040
 that I would have built we will make you 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.710
 something I say it because you 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.780
 you realize that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.080
 I'm not alone on this channel 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.850
 is a big team the left short this 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.830
 they work on many videos 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.010
 especially on the map sizes that are 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.970
 still our most beautiful videos and we 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.970
 will create something for 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.190
 to know a spoil me it's been a long time 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 that on our server we do not have 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.100
 good and I tell myself that to be nice 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.090
 to have something really at 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.010
 massegros 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.390
 even if it had a private server that 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.659
 always happy you connect and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.430
 direct a really great thing and I'm 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.440
 am told that rather than just the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.159
 keep for us or making it the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.259
 give it so that's what we'll do 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.330
 will do a time lapse live some 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.740
 thing that we never did I 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.560
 know only one team he did 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.990
 and we're going to tear our hair out 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.350
 organize think but we'll do it 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.800
 time's up this spot live we will create 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.149
 his uncle 4 friday 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.830
 if it is not the case it will be day 5 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.370
 so it's really this week end 1 1 4 5 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.130
 6 the date will of course be confirmed 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.500
 but I ask you what is 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.410
 big becomes what you want 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.570
 in a spawn 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.090
 do you want them to have 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.020
 portals or disinterest of plantations for 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.620
 go to others 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.370
 others from other places in the same world 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.380
 do you want a door for 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.970
 go in monkey autotour is what 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.530
 you want panels of things 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.640
 like that so it's good that it's 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.250
 things we are going to put anyway 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.100
 because I feel like it and I think 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.850
 that everyone will want but if you 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.340
 have other ideas 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.810
 if you have style ideas what 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.400
 you want things like that or but 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.290
 taker so we go during the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.960
 next week pretty much we will you 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.690
 listen we're going to make plans not to 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.210
 block ready if not a live time lapse 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.890
 has no interest but we are here we go 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.050
 really think about what you want 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.640
 what we want to try to reconcile 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.060
 to really have the spawn that all the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.830
 world wants people to tear themselves away 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.660
 and is then 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.900
 then we'll start working there 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.500
 top with all that to do it in 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.240
 live under your eyes amazed we hope so 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.740
 the dregs of probably three hours at 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.430
 no doubt will want to make several 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.990
 ways are not going to finish it we're not going to the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.250
 finish in it because we're not going 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.050
 finish it in a live 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.700
 here we are I hope it will please all 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.290
 the world no contest this time 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.580
 but you everyone will have some 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.760
 suddenly in the form of sauce 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.240
 phone so if you have a server and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.560
 that you have not 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.600
 or want to change spawn 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.910
 do not hesitate to we will put in place 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.610

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.730

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.570
 before maybe christmas something like 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.390
 it's time we finish 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.550
 tormenting the group abscon tag over 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.950

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.910
