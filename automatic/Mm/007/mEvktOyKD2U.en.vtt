00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 hi then in this video i wanted 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:10.769
 tell you about a product that came out of 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.400
 little by mac are is a collection that 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.660
 includes of the creams they are 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.420
 These contouring to make this 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.480
 these are the two colors I have 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.000
 I took these two so I wanted to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.449
 also take advantage of it to make a video in 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.649
 I do contouring using the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:39.840
 creme I think I did one in 1918 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.899
 now in which I use powders yes maybe 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.370
 so a couple of years ago I said so 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.120
 because the name I love you we put them 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.180
 at work and while I try them I do vi 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.610
 I also show how I do 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 The contouring and highlighting 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.300
 using the creams with these two with 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.409
 these with these two creams or useful or 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:09.110
 cook here where I also bought 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:14.869
 the are so right that the mac is new 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:20.330
 163 is that this is a strange flat shape 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:23.700
 very dense fan that is a 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.100
 brush suitable for just for the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.729
 I leave the test now 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.400
 practice 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.340
 you will see that I start from the base 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.540
 price from the base and then passed 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.200
 directly to al con turi e lighting e 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.259
 above I apply my own because we talk 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.689
 of creams over pico to try to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.090
 remove the shiny effect from above 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.470
 an envelope I repeated three times times 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.970
 above I apply a veil and very light of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.159
 of transparent powder 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.990
 so now I leave you to the video and there 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.210
 see immediately with my first 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.160
 impressions on these products 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.510
 let 's see what I've done 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.810
 let's start trying to hide the 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.810
 eye bags 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.640
 as a foundation or used face 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.140
 enpa of fondation in the go apply 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.140
 with a wet sponge 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.640
 Start by using the lightest cream 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.580
 which serves to highlight and give 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.580
 brightness in some points of the face 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.420
 the ringer highlighting account is nothing else 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.850
 that a play of shadows and lights to put 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:10.100
 highlight some parts of the face 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:12.080
 or hide others begin to fade 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.560
 lightly with the same brush 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.560
 after which he switched to the flat stop brush 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.560
 which allows me a better nuance 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.730
 and now we pass the darker cream than 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:45.519
 allows us to change the face 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.129
 hide the imperfections that in each 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.519
 person of course we will be different 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.980
 they start have different so you need to 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.739
 study your face to understand things 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.330
 we want that we want to hide in 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.209
 this case did a bit of talking 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.120
 in the nose to make it thinner is not 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.349
 one thing I usually do though is 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.569
 something that I often know 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.299
 so I decided to lead the company 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:15.579
 with turi then one of the things just more 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:17.320
 that sell more requests than one thing 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.310
 I forgot and applied anyway 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.290
 some highlights here too no 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.320
 obviously fading it out now not 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.000
 you have to look at me with lights and this was it 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.169
 the practical video then let's talk immediately 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.389
 of the color and therefore of how of the 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.780
 shades as it goes with mine 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.330
 skin 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.880
 I like this so much I like to find that 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.520
 both very good as a shade 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.460
 I think this pretty nice for the 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.460
 my skin is a little too hot 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.580
 so coming back I would not take 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.770
 I would not take this and fade away 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.870
 pretty good if you want enough 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.400
 well speaking now of the brush 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.720
 this brush found it great for 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.380
 apply 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.320
 however, one must always take another 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.310
 brush so that it fades to fade 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.740
 well because this obviously a lot more 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.240
 for for the app to appreciate 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.639
 a slightly more precise application though 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.460
 surely to fade you will need 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:25.419
 of another brush that is one of 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.760
 this is a flat top like this 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:33.849
 it's up to you or even smaller 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:36.849
 it's up to you cream or powder cream 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.919
 I believe the cream needs a 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.199
 little more than 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.809
 work as regards the nuance 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.819
 dust a little easier to 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:50.809
 definitely blend the application in 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:53.479
 cream is a little more a little more put a little 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:56.449
 more a little less practical than 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.539
 to powder application and in any case 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:03.979
 I believe that in the end we can get a 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:07.490
 very natural effect perhaps still of 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:12.009
 more than powder if faded very well 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:16.370
 the cream because the cream melts 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:18.740
 on the skin and therefore becomes one 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.949
 as usual in the contouring in the e 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.460
 lighting in this game of light ed 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:28.849
 shadow the most important thing is yes la 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.490
 chosen color the chosen color is 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:34.159
 blend it very well because you don't have to 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.319
 note you don't have to see lines 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:39.710
 and extended as usual I think I have you 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.909
 said all if in case you wanted to 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.180
 add something else 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:46.879
 I will do it as usual on the blog is 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.789
 I hope nothing was useful and I hope 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:51.409
 to have been quick to 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:55.870
 have all the important things that 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.870
 I meant a big hello kiss
