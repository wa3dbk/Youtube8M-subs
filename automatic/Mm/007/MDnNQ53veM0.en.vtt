 I looked in the tongue when I told you 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.299
 I started recording the board of a 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.229

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.659
 When you still home falls into the water then 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.569

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.590
 that was different but you just go 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.930
 climbing up here on the balcony will do 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.870
 It's beautiful to read because there's no way you can. 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.610
 enters the top of the house is in 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.830

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.200
 goes a spoiler alert was then if 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.370
 You did not play the game it seems that you already 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.349

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.269
 today you will know that what is happening 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.930
 It will get better, it does not start, it will not. 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.690
 cheat silly or anything you go up here 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.890

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.079
 will rise here and there will stay high in the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.060
 and I did it because when I arrived 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.440
 I called the service there. 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.299
 I called it not like I had friends. 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.190

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.530

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.200
 was doing 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.329
 So, how come you can not go up? 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.660

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.060

 rockstar left in applied physics 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.500

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.590
 make yourself clear what has to be the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.370
 van that you must have a driver 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.940
 but that 's how it is 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.409
 everything that has to be explored to 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.299

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.030
