is an effect on the body you know we are
now<00:03:07.049> finding<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.680> these<00:03:07.890> chips<00:03:08.220> cause

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
now finding that these chips cause

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.070 
now finding that these chips cause
tumors<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.180> animals<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.780> have<00:03:09.900> been

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
tumors and animals that have been

tumors and animals that have been
chipped<00:03:10.380> now<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.160> frequencies<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.150> make<00:03:12.330> a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
chipped now so frequencies to make a

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.690 
chipped now so frequencies to make a
difference<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.049> we<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.410> change<00:03:13.739> those<00:03:14.040> but

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
difference and we can change those but

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.970 
difference and we can change those but
we<00:03:15.239> have<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.660> just<00:03:15.989> actually<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.769> best

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
we have to just actually one of the best

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.830 
we have to just actually one of the best
ways<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.190> do<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.519> just<00:03:17.670> become<00:03:18.000> active<00:03:18.420> that

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
ways to do is just become active that

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.990 
ways to do is just become active that
makes<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:19.260> focus<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:20.010> makes<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.430> think<00:03:20.730> and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
makes you focus that makes you think and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.990 
makes you focus that makes you think and
then<00:03:21.570> your<00:03:21.750> mindset<00:03:22.200> starts<00:03:22.530> changing<00:03:22.910> but<00:03:23.910> we

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
then your mindset starts changing but we

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.060 
then your mindset starts changing but we
still<00:03:24.209> have<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.450> be<00:03:24.660> confident<00:03:25.230> or<00:03:25.410> we<00:03:25.890> have<00:03:26.040> to

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
still have to be confident or we have to

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.650 
still have to be confident or we have to
know<00:03:26.280> where<00:03:26.459> why<00:03:26.790> we're<00:03:27.000> doing<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.390> be

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
know where why we're doing it be

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.440 
know where why we're doing it be
motivated<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.859> we<00:03:29.100> have<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.400> be<00:03:29.519> kind<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.910> smart

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
motivated so we have to be kind of smart

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.560 
motivated so we have to be kind of smart
kind<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.959> balance<00:03:31.230> all<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.560> out<00:03:32.299> yeah<00:03:33.299> and

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.080 
you live your life it at this time is
more<00:03:42.870> important<00:03:43.320> than<00:03:43.470> ever<00:03:43.799> for<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.850> greater

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
more important than ever for the greater

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.120 
more important than ever for the greater
whole<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.560> that's<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.950> really

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
whole and and that's a really

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.220 
whole and and that's a really
interesting<00:03:47.250> way<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:48.030> looking<00:03:48.180> at<00:03:48.660> things<00:03:48.720> I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
interesting way of looking at things I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.560 
interesting way of looking at things I
think<00:03:49.859> a<00:03:49.920> lot<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.130> people<00:03:50.250> think<00:03:50.670> perhaps<00:03:50.970> what

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
think a lot of people think perhaps what

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.840 
think a lot of people think perhaps what
they<00:03:51.750> do<00:03:51.810> in<00:03:52.230> their<00:03:52.380> everyday<00:03:52.680> life<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.250> rather

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
they do in their everyday life is rather

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.599 
they do in their everyday life is rather
unimportant<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.290> greater<00:03:55.530> whole<00:03:55.829> but<00:03:56.430> as

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
unimportant to the greater whole but as

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.150 
unimportant to the greater whole but as
we're<00:03:56.850> seeing<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.540> every<00:03:58.049> person<00:03:58.500> counts<00:03:58.980> and
