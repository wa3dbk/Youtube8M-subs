00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 every day is how it is so good because the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.670
 today I 'm going to show you all the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.710
 objects that can be built here in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.809
 the map view video that will stop 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.610
 side the guillotine the gallows and the reading 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.019
 of nazca since that is for the easter and 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.700
 that's going to be in the video of each 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.080
 havoc that did that part I'm going to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.520
 teach and treat the objects that are 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.439
 they can build what will they serve them 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.359
 to use them in rounds and so on 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.279
 well let's go with the first the pieces are 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.439
 they will find in this part ok where 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.490
 says general store here in this part 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.170
 will be the stones with which 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.880
 we are going to be able to build all 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 these objects the first piece of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.510
 software version either is found 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.399
 then later opening the door entering 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.930
 on the left they look against and with a 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.420
 little table that is there in the part of the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.030
 left to the wall we take it and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.770
 we are going to build it now one of the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.629
 craft tables eo the little tables 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.100
 construction on this map is located 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.870
 in the part of the room they can come to 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 this part or any other table to 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.410
 build the objects that need the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.539
 next piece let's say it's like the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.219
 base or that is like a table type and its 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.600
 location is very simple if we 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.520
 we enter through the back of the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.780
 general store we are going to enter and it's going to 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.230
 find exactly stuck to the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.510
 left there lying on the floor 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.130
 and we are going to build the third piece 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.990
 is just in front of 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.940
 where we found the pass where I was 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.830
 the last one we keep walking and you know 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.080
 find now on the right side of 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.580
 same way and lying on the floor the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.840
 fourth and last piece is of 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.420
 same way in the general store 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.220
 we grabbed up the stairs and then 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.080
 then going up in the first corner that 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.550
 see from the part on the right is going to 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.259
 find the piece there let's say this 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.610
 it's like a little metal arm you do not have 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.530
 as formed a metal arm 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.509
 we just grab it and go to 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.820
 build the last piece of this object 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.740
 now what is the soneira software for? 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.560
 well let's say it's a mini 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.479
 anderson ok is like a giant speaker and 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.729
 when we electrifies we inhabit 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.289
 like a wave that kills zombies is now 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.940
 very important to use this object 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.740
 you need the turbine ok the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.240
 Turnsit turbine can also be 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.340
 build here and now let's see 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.229
 how we build it but to be able to use 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.850
 this object we need the turbine for 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.100
 that we can give power to this one 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.390
 as a horn that we already created is very useful 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.280
 to kill zombies and have a 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.869
 pretty good durability I would 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.100
 I recommend if it is in others very high and not 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.170
 they want to be spending so much ammunition 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.090
 you build this object and get the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.740
 turbine and help them pretty much now 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.750
 we go with the next object the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.850
 the first part of the turbine is the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.560
 body of the mannequin in the same way we 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.270
 we grab and we get to the general 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.010
 store and this time we're going to grab and 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.840
 we are going to follow everything right until the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.370
 last room once we enter until 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.050
 the last room we go to the right 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.360
 and he's going to find the mannequin there in 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.010
 one of the corners we grab and we're going 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.630
 to build another one of the locations 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.640
 of these construction tables is 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.290
 just above the first responds to 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.090
 the box or here and where they see then later 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.950
 the box on the top is going to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.600
 find a little table there 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.310
 can go can they build any 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.540
 object that you wish but good 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.580
 let's go with the next piece the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.370
 next piece is like a helix ok 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.810
 it is very simple 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.460
 entering the general store we grab and 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.590
 we go to the left and it goes to 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.090
 find like on some shelves there in 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.740
 the part of the left that is very 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.990
 easy to see them since these pieces 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.060
 never change and the last piece would be the 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.650
 fan or that the top of 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.690
 the turbine to get this piece 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.820
 we just grab we went up 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.040
 the stairs and we get into the first 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.540
 fourth that we see then then entering 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.310
 in the part on the right they will see that 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.560
 there's like a shelf there's going to 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.660
 find the last piece of this object 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.550
 the good fan once it's 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.890
 ready we go to any ministers 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.750
 we put our object together and we have 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.310
 list our turbine ok 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.500
 the turbine has the same use as in 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.330
 transit tv to give power to things 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.430
 in this case it can be the soft service 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.020
 air version or to the perez if it is not 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.060
 they have turned on the power and good now 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.800
 let's go with the next object the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.200
 next object is the trampoline the 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.730
 same trampoline that will rise rise ok the 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.740
 first piece of that trampoline is the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.420
 motor that this metal motor is going to 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.340
 find very easy we enter the store 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.260
 and then then the part on the left 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.850
 they're going to look like a shelf there in the middle 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.280
 of the whole room there will be at 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.890
 left is the little motor 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.390
 we grab and we're going to build it now 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.430
 another was fiddling tables 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.380
 find in the courtroom if 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.180
 we grabbed and got off by the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.980
 top of the general store 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.170
 we are going to be the part where the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.090
 the front desk is the courthouse and there 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.350
 we can find another table 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.510
 of crafter or to build any 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.760
 vÃ¡monos object with the second piece 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.830
 it's the flag we enter in the same way 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.780
 to the store and then later we go 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.090
 on the right the flag will be found and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.519
 over some barrels and we take 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.590
 let's build it the third piece is 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.000
 the grid that is the grid with which 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.680
 we are going to throw good 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.720
 it's very simple we just grab 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.610
 we go up the stairs and you can see 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.740
 there stuck to the railing there on the floor 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.350
 stuck to the railing we took it and we 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.090
 let's build this dam finally 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.460
 the last piece of this object is the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.010
 blower we take two we put to the blind 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.020
 we go up the stairs we get into 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.270
 the first room and there everything goes right 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.370
 to find a table there in that part goes 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.650
 to be the blower we take it and we 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.750
 we are going to build this object as well as 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.250
 the turbine the trampoline and in the same 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.930
 use that have the grass and serves to 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.030
 throw them and help them get to the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.230
 place is a little complicated also les 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.270
 can help jump how are you 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.370
 barriers that are on the map where 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.720
 you can break with the giant some of 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.550
 you can also jump with them 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.900
 trampoline hunk very interesting is that 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.910
 It can also help you get out of the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.500
 house of the ghosts since if you 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.690
 you go to the house of ghosts and 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.310
 put your trampoline you can do that 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.419
 come back for example if you only 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.850
 means by the double tap 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.980
 you just buy your debuts 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.020
 put your trampoline and grab and you can 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.450
 back ok but good with this we 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.940
 we go to the next object the next 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.280
 object is the short heads ok and this one is 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.000
 is the first of four pieces 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.830
 piece is found 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.330
 entering being in the part of the 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.220
 left where is the shelf I know that 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.260
 it's in the middle of the room but it's 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.850
 time you will find until the end of 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.160
 that stadium that we say is like a 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.230
 handle or like a lever we take them 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.580
 and we are going to build the last visit 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.870
 I want to teach you 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.980
 found in the part where the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.750
 package 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.190
 or that there is where the church is 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.810
 than to get to this postman table 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.520
 They need to use the giant to give them 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.230
 I study in the door the next piece 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.210
 it's like a roll it looks a lot like a 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.040
 ok film reel equally 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.930
 we grab we enter the reader and we 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.760
 we follow everything right this time it looks 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.950
 find on the right above and as of 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.200
 a table the third piece is like a 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.390
 ok likewise saw grabbed 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.890
 we entered the stork we passed some as 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.210
 little tables that are there and it's going to 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.130
 find the part on the left 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.840
 inside some barrels 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.490
 It is very easy to see because this mountain is 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.410
 quite big then you can see 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.750
 from afar as it comes out of the barrels the 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.490
 we take and we're going to build and for 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.410
 last the last piece of this object is 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.060
 let's say that as the base this is 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.919
 find exactly at the bottom of the 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.330
 general store we grab we get 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.830
 until we touch wall and when 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.780
 we have entered the last room we 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.610
 we go to the left and we will see that 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.969
 there in the corner there is a base ok the 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.039
 grab 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.769
 we take it and we 're going to build it 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.569
 now what is the use of the short header? 

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:43.669
 which in English is called heads shopper 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.559
 Well, this heads up but it's short 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.329
 We can put heads in 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:49.699
 different places practically in 

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:51.559
 any flat surface and this saw 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.289
 it will practically cut in the 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:56.329
 head to everyone who passes by there ok to 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.889
 you will damage them but very few and 

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:59.899
 it's going to hurt them but it's not so much the 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.299
 harm but nevertheless the men 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:03.919
 it's going to be a lot of damage ok even in 

00:07:02.299 --> 00:07:05.479
 high rounds still killing one single 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.729
 hit goes face and they will cut the 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.379
 head one of the recommendations is that 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.119
 put them on the doors and they're 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.039
 simply camping somewhere 

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:15.169
 put on the doors where they can 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.610
 get out the zombies or enter the zombies and 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.559
 Well, this object will help you 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.999
 very much since it cuts off their heads and 

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:22.399
 has one and has a durability 

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:24.349
 pretty good too but good these 

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:25.699
 were all the objects I hope that they 

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:27.559
 have served and have liked the 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.179
 video I say goodbye and I'm time 

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:31.069
 They know they can give me a like or 

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:32.419
