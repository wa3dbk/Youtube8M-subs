00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
used to this kind of weather they're

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.800 
used to this kind of weather they're
native<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.310> this<00:00:52.489> environment<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.510> anything

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
native to this environment so anything

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.930 
native to this environment so anything
we<00:00:53.930> get<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.530> what<00:00:54.770> they're<00:00:55.010> built<00:00:55.790> to

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
we get is what they're built to

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.979 
we get is what they're built to
withstand<00:00:56.570> like<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.940> furry<00:00:58.940> guys<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.900> know

withstand like the furry guys you know
they<00:01:00.110> get<00:01:00.260> an<00:01:00.350> extra<00:01:00.680> layer<00:01:00.860> of<00:01:00.920> fur

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
they get an extra layer of fur

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.450 
they get an extra layer of fur
underneath<00:01:02.270> which<00:01:02.780> keeps<00:01:03.050> me<00:01:03.170> warm<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.739> they

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
underneath which keeps me warm and they

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.040 
underneath which keeps me warm and they
notice<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.180> wind<00:01:05.420> if<00:01:05.690> it's<00:01:05.840> really

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
notice that of the wind if it's really

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.370 
notice that of the wind if it's really
windy<00:01:06.430> our<00:01:07.430> dear<00:01:08.150> are<00:01:08.690> really<00:01:08.960> cool<00:01:09.140> they<00:01:09.350> have

hollow hair and it totally one of the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.380 
hollow hair and it totally one of the
greatest<00:01:11.960> insulators<00:01:12.680> there<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.210> they

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
greatest insulators there is and so they

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.359 
greatest insulators there is and so they
stay<00:01:14.630> pretty<00:01:14.869> warm<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.649> you'll<00:01:16.100> do<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.310> same

through a dormancy period just like
hibernation<00:02:14.709> for<00:02:14.890> mammals<00:02:15.280> reptiles<00:02:15.720> that

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
turtles in our turtle pond go into the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.490 
turtles in our turtle pond go into the
same<00:02:21.340> dormancy<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.570> box<00:02:22.900> turtles<00:02:23.290> which

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
same dormancy and the box turtles which

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.440 
same dormancy and the box turtles which
are<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> land<00:02:24.070> ones<00:02:24.310> go<00:02:24.610> underneath<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
are the land ones go underneath the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.600 
are the land ones go underneath the
leaves<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.959> straw<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.040> things<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.310> we<00:02:27.370> put

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
leaves and straw and things that we put

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.160 
leaves and straw and things that we put
in<00:02:27.790> their<00:02:28.120> habitat<00:02:28.300> for<00:02:28.750> them<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.989> burrow

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
in their habitat for them to burrow

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.110 
in their habitat for them to burrow
under<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.650> stay<00:02:29.860> warm<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.550> they<00:02:30.730> don't<00:02:30.880> freeze

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
under to stay warm so they don't freeze

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.330 
under to stay warm so they don't freeze
and<00:02:31.570> then<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.350> water<00:02:32.590> turtle<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.040> actually

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
and then the water turtle is actually

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.190 
and then the water turtle is actually
very<00:02:33.370> under<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.000> leaves<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.600> are<00:02:34.660> under<00:02:35.170> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
very under the leaves that are under the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.110 
very under the leaves that are under the
water<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.920> that's<00:02:36.340> where<00:02:36.549> they<00:02:36.640> stay<00:02:36.910> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
water and that's where they stay and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.729 
water and that's where they stay and
they<00:02:37.180> actually<00:02:37.750> slow<00:02:38.140> their<00:02:38.350> respiration

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
they actually slow their respiration

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.720 
they actually slow their respiration
down<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.190> point<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.459> they<00:02:39.549> don't

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
down the point that they don't

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.039 
down the point that they don't
necessarily<00:02:40.150> need<00:02:40.269> oxygen<00:02:40.480> from<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.959> air

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
necessarily need oxygen from the air

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.750 
necessarily need oxygen from the air
they<00:02:41.620> kind<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:41.890> get<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.100> from<00:02:42.220> their<00:02:42.370> own<00:02:42.489> blood

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
they kind of get it from their own blood

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.630 
they kind of get it from their own blood
and<00:02:43.000> things<00:02:43.090> like<00:02:43.269> that<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.769> they<00:02:45.370> can<00:02:45.519> stay

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
and things like that so they can stay

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.800 
and things like that so they can stay
under<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.940> water<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.330> will<00:02:46.450> see<00:02:46.630> turtles

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
under the water and you will see turtles

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.440 
under the water and you will see turtles
frozen<00:02:47.380> out<00:02:47.500> there<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.860> that's<00:02:48.670> all<00:02:48.970> natural

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
frozen out there and that's all natural

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.500 
frozen out there and that's all natural
the<00:02:50.380> reptiles<00:02:50.769> are<00:02:50.920> inside<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:51.970> keep<00:02:52.209> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
the reptiles are inside we keep the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.660 
the reptiles are inside we keep the
temperature<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.080> room<00:02:53.260> very<00:02:53.709> warm<00:02:53.980> up<00:02:54.459> in

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
temperature of the room very warm up in

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.490 
temperature of the room very warm up in
the<00:02:54.700> higher<00:02:54.970> 70s<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.870> they<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.230> stay

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
the higher 70s so that they can stay

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.320 
the higher 70s so that they can stay
warm<00:02:56.769> enough<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.070> stay<00:02:57.250> active<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.180> still

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
warm enough to stay active so we still

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:15.009 
warm enough to stay active so we still
have<00:02:58.390> reptiles<00:02:58.870> moving<00:02:59.230> all<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.500> time

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.360 

so<00:03:16.019> if<00:03:16.170> you're<00:03:16.319> looking<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.709> something<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.159> do

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
on a cold winter's day stop by the

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.599 
on a cold winter's day stop by the
