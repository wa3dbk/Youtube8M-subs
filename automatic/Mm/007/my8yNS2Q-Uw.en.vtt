 radio has been broadcasting in antwerp for almost thirty years 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.199
 the channel works with a low budget with employee contributions it is not always 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.899
 easy to make ends meet the perpetrator to see a man who finds 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:41.780

 eighty percent are at risk of losing or comes with costs 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.210

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.710

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.120
 in the media about van willem ii it is not difficult but must of the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.350
 supporters 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.020
 by social groups that get little attention, also in a different way 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.490
 profiling 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.470
 The record is there right now that a big part of that is also all 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.990
 channels 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.310
 and people try the national channels for the first time 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.340

 at the moment there are too many radio frequencies the study two of the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.230
 three non-licensed system twenty years ago permission gives itself up to 60 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.850
 and there the frequencies but those frequencies we have to put on a big mouth

 meanwhile an excellent striking policy in hand 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.970
