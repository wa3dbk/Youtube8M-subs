 that the new coaches chose 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.770
 however, the few balls should 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.290
 have the coaches who chose to 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.350

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.020
 cease in the dubbing of Spain not 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.090
 appeared more in the year 2008 one of the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.530
 screenwriters of the series granted a 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.740
 interview to a web page called 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.840
 poker the main idea was that in his 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.009
 interior will be to celebi what 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.680
 would lead to success 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.719
 He argued in support pto adventure without 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.479
 However, it was decided that he was seen 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:44.699
 legendary pokemon of the p 04 what the 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.240
 main idea was considered redundant 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.979
 so the gs ball was discarded after 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.469
 stay with Cesar the writers 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.719
 They trusted that the spectators 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:57.869
 they would end up forgetting the nonetheless not 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.449
 it was so good it was a pleasure to do this 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:03.749
