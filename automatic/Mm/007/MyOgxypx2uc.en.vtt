tweak<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.239> video<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.930> called<00:00:37.770> multi<00:00:38.309> flow

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
tweak in this video is called multi flow

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.209 
tweak in this video is called multi flow
multiflo<00:00:39.450> basically<00:00:39.989> gives<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.590> exposé

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
multiflo basically gives you an exposé

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.130 
multiflo basically gives you an exposé
like<00:00:41.430> interface<00:00:41.969> when<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.300> multitask<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
like interface when you multitask and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560 
like interface when you multitask and
it's<00:00:43.500> much<00:00:43.710> better<00:00:43.920> than<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.430> iOS<00:00:45.239> four

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
it's much better than the iOS four

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's much better than the iOS four
preset<00:00:46.730> multitasking<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.360> instead<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
preset multitasking so instead of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.439 
preset multitasking so instead of
multitasking<00:00:49.829> every<00:00:50.430> app<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.940> open<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
multitasking every app that you open it

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
multitasking every app that you open it
multiflo<00:00:54.449> basically<00:00:54.960> allows<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.670> decide

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
multiflo basically allows you to decide

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.139 
multiflo basically allows you to decide
which<00:00:56.940> app<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.930> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> multitask

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
which app that you want to multitask

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.060 
which app that you want to multitask
instead<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> multitasking<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.500> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
instead of multitasking all of them so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
instead of multitasking all of them so
for<00:01:02.370> example<00:01:02.399> we'll<00:01:02.940> open<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> calculator

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
for example we'll open up the calculator

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
for example we'll open up the calculator
application<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.460> once<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> open<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
application and then once you open that

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.289 
application and then once you open that
up<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.140> choose<00:01:08.010> an<00:01:08.159> activation<00:01:08.760> method

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
up you can choose an activation method

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.300 
up you can choose an activation method
of<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> activate<00:01:10.680> multiflow

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
of how you want to activate multiflow

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
of how you want to activate multiflow
you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> choose<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> home<00:01:12.450> button<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:12.900> for

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
this is much quicker than overboard

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.310 
this is much quicker than overboard

the app and then I'll directly launch

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.589 
the app and then I'll directly launch
that<00:04:33.870> app<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.220> next<00:04:35.400> cydia<00:04:35.819> tweak<00:04:36.389> is

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
that app so the next cydia tweak is

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.800 
that app so the next cydia tweak is
called<00:04:36.870> folder<00:04:37.259> enhancer<00:04:38.660> folder<00:04:39.660> enhancer

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
called folder enhancer folder enhancer

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.770 
called folder enhancer folder enhancer
basically<00:04:40.740> allows<00:04:41.039> you<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.460> put<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.330> folder

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
basically allows you to put a folder

basically allows you to put a folder
within<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.199> folder<00:04:43.669> within<00:04:44.669> a<00:04:44.880> folder<00:04:45.090> within<00:04:45.479> a

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
within a folder within a folder within a

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.719 
within a folder within a folder within a
folder<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.139> so<00:04:46.380> on<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.860> then<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.460> lets<00:04:47.580> you

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
folder and so on and then it lets you

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
want so hence the name folder enhancer

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.460 
want so hence the name folder enhancer
so<00:04:54.650> basically<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.949> can<00:04:56.099> go<00:04:56.280> back<00:04:56.580> into<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.300> and

useful for people that use folders

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.110 
useful for people that use folders
within<00:05:20.789> folders<00:05:21.380> now<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.830> next<00:05:23.039> cydia<00:05:23.759> tweak

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
within folders now the next cydia tweak

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.879 
within folders now the next cydia tweak
is<00:05:24.360> called<00:05:26.750> infinii<00:05:27.750> folders<00:05:28.319> and<00:05:28.500> finney

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
is called infinii folders and finney

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.620 
is called infinii folders and finney
folders<00:05:29.400> basically<00:05:29.909> allows<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.389> have<00:05:30.449> an

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
folders basically allows you to have an

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.339 
folders basically allows you to have an
infinite<00:05:31.050> number<00:05:31.259> of<00:05:32.419> apps<00:05:33.419> within<00:05:34.020> one

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
infinite number of apps within one

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.310 
infinite number of apps within one
folder<00:05:34.949> now<00:05:35.520> for<00:05:35.880> example<00:05:35.940> we'll<00:05:36.780> open<00:05:37.020> up<00:05:37.259> the

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
folder now for example we'll open up the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.350 
folder now for example we'll open up the
folder<00:05:39.020> so<00:05:40.020> once<00:05:40.349> you<00:05:40.470> open<00:05:40.620> up<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:40.949> folder

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
folder so once you open up a folder

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.510 
folder so once you open up a folder
it'll<00:05:42.360> basically<00:05:43.039> let<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:44.159> scroll

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520

it'll basically let you scroll
vertically<00:05:45.090> through<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:45.810> it's<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:46.560> very

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
vertically through it and it's a very

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.310 
vertically through it and it's a very
useful<00:05:47.070> trick<00:05:47.550> for<00:05:47.820> people<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:48.690> use<00:05:48.990> more

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
useful trick for people that use more

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.110 
useful trick for people that use more
than<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.909> the<00:05:50.909> amount<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.479> folder<00:05:51.900> icons<00:05:52.409> that
