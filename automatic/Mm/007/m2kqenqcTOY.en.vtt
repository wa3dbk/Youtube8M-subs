00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:03.749
 how to make dave animation using 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:06.120
 photoshop 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.699
 using adobe photoshop 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.659
 you can easily create dave 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.689
 animations use standard and arrange 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:14.469
 you 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.769
 in this lesson we will tell you how it is 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.109
 to make 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.570
 First, create a 10 document. 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.550
 10 pixels 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.329
 To do this, go to the file tab. 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.419
 and select create command 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.310
 in the new dialog box that appears 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.990
 set the sizes for the new document and 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.920
 video values ​​equal to ten pixels m 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.070
 in the fields width 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.820
 and height 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.720
 after entering the image sizes click those 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.940
 pore key 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.880
 make an approximation and took away 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.090
 life to size must be summed up 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910
 oak work 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.790
 then 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.540
 need to make three more copies of this 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.010
 layer 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.020
 to create duplicates 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.230
 hold down the left mouse button on the layer icon 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.080
 and dragging it on the pictogram 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.340
 create new layer 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.620
 the bottom of the palette 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.310
 layers 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.030
 third four layers 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.400
 will be four frames 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.700
 our future animation 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.500
 now the most important thing we need 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.570
 to create gif animation 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.860
 this workspace 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.840
 complex and tools 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870
 go to tab box 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.150
 their lists work environment 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 select move command 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.230
 this working environment is a 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.450
 Boron universal tools for 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.760
 create animation 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.030
 leave visible and active only 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.220
 bottom layer 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.180
 clicking on the icons and seeing 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.760
 eyes near layers 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.960
 select pencil tool 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.570
 and on the attribute panel install and for it 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 size equal to three peasants peak 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.790
 using a pencil 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.040
 draw a square in the bottom left corner 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.960
 Images 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.039
 then 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.999
 make both layer visible and active 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.749
 next higher 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.359
 and draw a square in the upper left corner 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.049
 picture 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.769
 similarly draw squares on 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.179
 each of the layers 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.589
 bypassing their corners clockwise 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:25.719
 in this way 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.359
 we get 4 frames for our future 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.369
 animation 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.299
 Now let's move on to creating an animation. 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.089
 for this filled animation 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.749
 click the day before about convert to 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.319
 frame animation 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.669
 one frame appears on the animation panel 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.019
 now click on the frame with the right button 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:47.869
 mice 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.209
 and in the context menu that appears 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.249
 select interval equal to one second 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.299
 now click 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.979
 three times on the copy creation button o 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.170
 selected frames 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.300
 located at the bottom of this 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.119
 panels 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.219
 to add three more to the animation 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.399
 frames 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.569
 select text and frame on the animation panel 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.159
 of doing and apparently and active only 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.839
 first layer image on 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.639
 Layer Palette 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.479
 as you can see first 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.329
 frame 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.799
 assigned the attributes of the first layer 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.659
 Similarly, select frames by 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:26.589
 to one 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.079
 and assign them one by one 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.379
 image make only necessary 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.379
 layer active and apparently 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.769
 now we got an animation consisting of 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.339
 four different frames 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:42.149
 to view the resulting 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:43.139
 result 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.989
 press the start button 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.899
 animation playback 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:49.049
 located humiliation of the panel 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.869
 animation 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:52.779
 now it only remains to save 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.779
 created animation in gif format 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.269
 thus using 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.809
 adobe photoshop editor tools 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:02.959
 you can easily create and die 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:03.649
 animation
