00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
energy it just is continuing on but

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.930 
energy it just is continuing on but
there's<00:02:38.450> not<00:02:38.630> enough<00:02:38.930> energy<00:02:39.820> from<00:02:40.820> the

there's not enough energy from the

expansion being dumped into the block

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.130 
expansion being dumped into the block
it's<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.489> all<00:02:43.940> being<00:02:44.330> used<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.810> push<00:02:44.989> the

it's just all being used to push the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.620 
it's just all being used to push the

bullet forward and the base of that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.890

bullet comes to rest right at 9 and 1/2
inches<00:02:52.150> now<00:02:53.150> we're<00:02:53.300> looking<00:02:53.360> at<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.630> denim

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
inches now we're looking at the denim

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.870 
inches now we're looking at the denim
test<00:02:54.110> shot<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.070> see<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.280> little<00:02:55.520> bit<00:02:55.820> of

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
test shot you can see a little bit of

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.860 
test shot you can see a little bit of
denim<00:02:56.239> right<00:02:57.110> at<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.380> very<00:02:57.709> start<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
denim right at the very start of the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.930 
denim right at the very start of the
wound<00:03:00.080> channel<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.620> couple<00:03:01.459> little<00:03:01.580> flakes

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
wound channel a couple little flakes

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.290 
wound channel a couple little flakes
right<00:03:02.150> here<00:03:02.920> what's<00:03:03.920> interesting<00:03:04.280> is<00:03:04.850> this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
right here what's interesting is this

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.449 
right here what's interesting is this
almost<00:03:05.810> looks<00:03:06.140> like<00:03:06.230> it's<00:03:06.680> potential<00:03:07.310> for

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
almost looks like it's potential for

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.820 
almost looks like it's potential for
expansion<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:10.150> then<00:03:11.150> we've<00:03:11.480> got<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.900> big

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
expansion and then we've got that big

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.500 
expansion and then we've got that big
nebulous<00:03:13.340> feature<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.970> actually<00:03:14.120> saw<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
nebulous feature I actually saw the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.170 
nebulous feature I actually saw the
high-speed<00:03:15.170> there<00:03:16.010> was<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.220> flash<00:03:16.550> fire<00:03:16.880> in<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
high-speed there was a flash fire in the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.270 
high-speed there was a flash fire in the
block<00:03:17.390> that's<00:03:17.750> why<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.290> just<00:03:18.320> absolutely

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
block that's why this is just absolutely

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.040 
block that's why this is just absolutely
huge<00:03:21.790> there<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:22.970> some<00:03:23.269> denim<00:03:23.600> being<00:03:23.780> dropped

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
huge there is some denim being dropped

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.280 
huge there is some denim being dropped
right<00:03:24.260> here<00:03:24.680> as<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:28.120> has<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.360> feature<00:03:29.600> ends

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
right here as that has that feature ends

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.910 
right here as that has that feature ends
so

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
so

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.010 
so
again<00:03:31.340> I'm<00:03:31.580> not<00:03:31.640> entirely<00:03:32.090> sure<00:03:32.270> if<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.870> was<00:03:32.990> a

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
again I'm not entirely sure if it was a

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.550 
again I'm not entirely sure if it was a

bullet progresses down more flakes of
denim<00:03:38.959> what's<00:03:39.830> interesting<00:03:40.100> is<00:03:40.780> we<00:03:41.780> actually

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
denim what's interesting is we actually

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.890 
denim what's interesting is we actually
had<00:03:42.380> some<00:03:42.740> expansion<00:03:43.400> on<00:03:43.520> this<00:03:43.700> one<00:03:43.880> I'm<00:03:44.750> not

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
had some expansion on this one I'm not

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.630 
had some expansion on this one I'm not
sure<00:03:44.959> how<00:03:45.350> much<00:03:45.530> expansion<00:03:45.980> do<00:03:46.280> we<00:03:46.340> pull<00:03:46.550> the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
sure how much expansion do we pull the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.660 
sure how much expansion do we pull the
bullet<00:03:46.910> but<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:47.630> can<00:03:47.870> see<00:03:48.020> that<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.320> nose<00:03:48.670> has

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
bullet but I can see that the nose has

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.280 
bullet but I can see that the nose has
opened<00:03:50.000> up<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.180> little<00:03:50.300> bit<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.720> can<00:03:50.959> still<00:03:51.170> see

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
opened up a little bit I can still see

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.240 
opened up a little bit I can still see
the<00:03:51.410> red<00:03:51.500> plug<00:03:51.770> in<00:03:51.920> there<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:53.630> is<00:03:54.230> facing<00:03:54.920> back

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
the red plug in there it is facing back

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.330 
the red plug in there it is facing back
towards<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:56.150> point<00:03:56.450> of<00:03:56.540> entry<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.160> the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
towards the point of entry that is the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.370 
towards the point of entry that is the
base<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.880> bullet<00:03:59.000> there<00:03:59.570> was<00:03:59.750> just<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.080> tiny

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
base of the bullet there was just a tiny

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.510 
base of the bullet there was just a tiny
bit<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.890> drawback<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:03.130> think<00:04:04.130> this<00:04:04.250> one<00:04:04.430> was

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
bit of drawback I think this one was

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.080 
bit of drawback I think this one was
going<00:04:04.820> backwards<00:04:05.350> when<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.670> finally<00:04:07.670> came<00:04:07.850> to

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
going backwards when it finally came to

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.050 
going backwards when it finally came to
rest<00:04:08.620> which<00:04:09.620> leads<00:04:10.400> me<00:04:10.550> to<00:04:10.580> believe<00:04:10.700> it

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
rest which leads me to believe it

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.310 
rest which leads me to believe it
actually<00:04:11.180> did<00:04:11.540> tumble<00:04:11.870> hundred<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.230> eighty

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
actually did tumble hundred and eighty

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.830 
actually did tumble hundred and eighty
degrees<00:04:12.769> dropping<00:04:13.700> this<00:04:13.880> denim<00:04:14.180> right<00:04:14.690> in

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
degrees dropping this denim right in

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.620 
degrees dropping this denim right in
this<00:04:15.019> section<00:04:16.090> with<00:04:17.090> ruler<00:04:17.359> up<00:04:17.480> we're

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
this section with ruler up we're

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.150 
this section with ruler up we're
tracking<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.140> wound<00:04:18.380> channel<00:04:18.769> directly

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
tracking the wound channel directly

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.659 
tracking the wound channel directly
behind<00:04:19.400> this<00:04:19.790> orange<00:04:20.239> line<00:04:20.829> flood<00:04:21.859> enters<00:04:22.160> if

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
behind this orange line flood enters if

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.300 
behind this orange line flood enters if
it<00:04:23.030> does<00:04:23.210> expand<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:23.930> doing<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:24.560> between<00:04:24.950> one

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
it does expand it's doing so between one

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:33.040 
it does expand it's doing so between one
and<00:04:29.530> five<00:04:30.530> inches<00:04:31.660> once<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.810> don't<00:04:32.960> get

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
and five inches once you don't get

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.810 
and five inches once you don't get
skinny<00:04:33.500> but<00:04:33.830> that's<00:04:33.980> really<00:04:34.250> because<00:04:34.550> this

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
skinny but that's really because this

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.300 
skinny but that's really because this
feature<00:04:35.750> is<00:04:36.080> pointing<00:04:36.650> away<00:04:36.710> from<00:04:36.890> you<00:04:37.190> at

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
feature is pointing away from you at

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.630 
feature is pointing away from you at
this<00:04:37.400> point<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:37.940> then<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.930> mess<00:04:39.140> happens

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
this point and then the mess happens

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.460 
this point and then the mess happens
again<00:04:40.640> it<00:04:40.820> was<00:04:40.970> a<00:04:41.000> flash<00:04:41.900> within<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.740> block<00:04:43.010> as

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
again it was a flash within the block as

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.610 
again it was a flash within the block as
the<00:04:45.470> expansion<00:04:45.830> cavity<00:04:46.340> collapsed<00:04:47.620> coming

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
the expansion cavity collapsed coming

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.100 
the expansion cavity collapsed coming
out<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.919> that<00:04:49.100> feature<00:04:49.540> gets<00:04:50.540> skinny<00:04:50.930> again

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
out of that feature gets skinny again

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.140 
out of that feature gets skinny again
but<00:04:51.680> that's<00:04:51.830> because<00:04:51.979> it's<00:04:52.490> pointing<00:04:53.000> away

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
but that's because it's pointing away

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.890 
but that's because it's pointing away
from<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.660> camera<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:55.180> then<00:04:56.180> we've<00:04:56.360> got<00:04:56.660> all

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
from the camera and then we've got all

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.630 
from the camera and then we've got all
this<00:04:57.050> denim<00:04:57.380> being<00:04:57.650> dropped<00:04:57.919> between<00:04:58.400> inches

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
this denim being dropped between inches

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.740 
this denim being dropped between inches
11<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.479> 12<00:04:59.750> and<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.500> good<00:05:00.680> news<00:05:01.390> well<00:05:02.390> it<00:05:02.510> did

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
come to rest right at 14 and a half

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.350 
come to rest right at 14 and a half
inches<00:05:05.540> there<00:05:06.440> is<00:05:06.650> some<00:05:07.070> tiny<00:05:07.940> bit<00:05:08.240> of

inches there is some tiny bit of

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.070 
inches there is some tiny bit of
expansion

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080

I'll<00:05:09.770> get<00:05:09.979> that<00:05:10.100> bullet<00:05:10.550> out<00:05:10.729> get<00:05:11.570> some<00:05:11.780> final

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
I'll get that bullet out get some final
