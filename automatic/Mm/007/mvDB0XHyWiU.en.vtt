00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:07.919
 ah 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.180
 if I tell you the same the nap of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.880
 break up and the longer it goes on 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.310
 near are to finish 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.810
 and we are a different group 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.280
 have some points of contact there will be 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.830
 some players who will have competed 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.960
 because I say obviously no, it's not going to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.369
 give that none have done it but be 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.869
 It is also clear that this group does not 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.610
 as a group to us has never 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.020
 touched or we want to fight 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.079
 for our possibility it is clear 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.090
 that the institution as a club that exists 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.830
 and it's there 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.630
 Besides, that is, we are not 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.180
 other groups other than the 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.680
 same shirt but we have another one 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.120
 particularity of different we are neither 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.950
 better worse than another group simply 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 we are different and we are going to fight for 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.610
 our possibility is us what 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.850
 we want to go win to continue this 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.410
 keep this good streak of desire for 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.590
 ambition that we have for the achievement 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.460
 of the title achievement but but not because of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.460
 another topic that you are not 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.900
 and there are results that give certain true 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.820
 margin with in this case with the rival 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.260
 but they do not give it to other teams and 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.510
 we only go against colo 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.940
 There are other teams that are there to 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.390
 the wait and therefore the in 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.770
 keeping just as dangerous 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.770
 I did not like you already know him well 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.870
 I say their evolutions day by day 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.900
 and then in the day to day we go 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.990
 incorporating different jobs and has 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.760
 come answering perfect in the case 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.060
 de valdo came from a specific situation 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.640
 that it was not very clear what was his the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.840
 of the determination of your injury and in 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 definitively the day came good the end of 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.140
 sorry last week with the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.310
 it is not the order the word kong 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.740
 the way of working this was from the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.940
 principle do it normal and incorporate 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.369
 directly to group work 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.170
 main and also got up well 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.790
 I work well yesterday I work 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.590
 well with what I say well I say I did the same 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.679
 that the rest and did not have any 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.759
 difficulty or that in both cases 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.910
 this although they are they have certain 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.569
 difference we are optimistic that we can 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.569
 count on them
