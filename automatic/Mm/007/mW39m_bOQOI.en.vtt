00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.070 
but also yesterday the pack opening was
going<00:02:40.790> good<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.570> went<00:02:41.810> downhill

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
going good and then it went downhill

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.040 
going good and then it went downhill
fast<00:02:42.620> as<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.010> got<00:02:43.160> no<00:02:43.370> good<00:02:43.580> pulls<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.840> logical

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
fast as I got no good pulls in a logical

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.780 
fast as I got no good pulls in a logical
later<00:02:45.470> packs<00:02:47.920> John<00:02:48.920> Tavares<00:02:49.160> up<00:02:49.400> see<00:02:49.520> if<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.670> can

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
later packs John Tavares up see if I can

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.399 

so<00:03:03.450> that's<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.719> decent<00:03:03.959> pack<00:03:04.999> Rene<00:03:05.999> and

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
so that's a decent pack Rene and

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:12.410 
so that's a decent pack Rene and
Kronwall<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:09.439> that's<00:03:10.439> it<00:03:10.730> Kronwall<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.030> rini

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.989 
Kronwall and that's it Kronwall and rini
I<00:03:12.569> believe<00:03:12.810> for<00:03:12.959> both<00:03:13.049> tears<00:03:13.560> last<00:03:13.739> week<00:03:13.999> it's

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:14.999 
I believe for both tears last week it's

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:21.190 
I believe for both tears last week it's
kind<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.359> unlucky<00:03:15.659> with<00:03:15.870> that

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.250 

and<00:03:21.770> here's<00:03:22.040> rené<00:03:22.250> 43k<00:03:23.150> he's<00:03:23.810> probably<00:03:24.020> one<00:03:24.230> of

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
and here's rené 43k he's probably one of

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.360 
and here's rené 43k he's probably one of
the<00:03:24.349> best<00:03:24.470> qualities<00:03:24.770> in<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:24.920> game<00:03:25.069> though<00:03:25.220> he

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
the best qualities in the game though he

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.449 
the best qualities in the game though he
plays<00:03:25.580> really<00:03:25.760> good<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.780> two<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.140> go<00:03:30.400> 500k<00:03:31.400> so

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
plays really good so two to go 500k so

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.869
