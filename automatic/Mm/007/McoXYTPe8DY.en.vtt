00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
was obviously early on to come out 2000

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.040 
was obviously early on to come out 2000
and<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.480> just<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:29.010> Protestant<00:03:30.570> community<00:03:31.570> the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
and it's just a Protestant community the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.220 
and it's just a Protestant community the
way<00:03:32.200> Eminem's<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:34.570> delivery<00:03:35.020> where<00:03:35.170> the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
way Eminem's like delivery where the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.110 
way Eminem's like delivery where the
verse<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.920> just<00:03:35.980> purple<00:03:36.520> rap<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.970> know

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
verse is it's just purple rap you know

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.810 
verse is it's just purple rap you know
and<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:38.110> think<00:03:38.739> I'll<00:03:39.070> say<00:03:39.310> that's<00:03:39.550> another

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
and I think I'll say that's another

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.510 
and I think I'll say that's another
reason<00:03:40.060> why<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.780> would<00:03:41.290> say<00:03:41.830> this<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.160> Emily's

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
reason why I would say this is Emily's

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.479 
reason why I would say this is Emily's
best<00:03:42.700> album<00:03:43.060> because<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:44.440> not<00:03:44.680> obviously

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
best album because it's not obviously

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.699 
best album because it's not obviously
that<00:03:45.670> they<00:03:45.850> are<00:03:45.970> listed<00:03:46.330> as<00:03:46.480> songs<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:46.989> it's

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
that they are listed as songs but it's

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.740 
that they are listed as songs but it's
all<00:03:47.860> rapping<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.580> know<00:03:48.700> there's<00:03:49.480> none<00:03:49.630> of
