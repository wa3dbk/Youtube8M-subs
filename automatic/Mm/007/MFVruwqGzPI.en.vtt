00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.530
 attention in this video are not 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.540
 have been abused little innocents but 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.549
 they are the ones who were there on the hi 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.029
 all this guys this video here 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.460
 here I do it on minecraft and I'll show you 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.830
 how to use enchanted books how to create 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.220
 an anvil as a potential type object 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.000
 swords and bows 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.000
 let's go to my base 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.540
 so much for potential weapons in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.930
 will serve unique in itself by creating you will have to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.710
 have a crafting table or counter from 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.059
 work as you want to call it macro not 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.370
 you will need a lot of bars of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.039
 iron to make the anvil and then three 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.120
 iron blocks by putting ingots in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.820
 this arrangement here after that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.820
 remove the ingots above 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.090
 so put back what I now too 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.800
 I don't take it because I already have so many 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.860
 work wait a minute 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.140
 here 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.340
 now we go to where it is encyclical with the key 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.620
 right-click and admit all 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:31.420
 bow sword or even pickaxes helmets armor 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:35.090
 six are those things from those who always first 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.770
 the sword or helmet color you have 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.840
 and then the book was made that the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.300
 otherwise nothing will come out 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.430
 then for the sword b so that is there to be 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.060
 use sharp zzÃ  recoil appearance 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.270
 of fire then scourge arthropods not 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.610
 I can never say it is so leads and is 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.250
 a theme 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.520
 proceed in colors put here and put 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 counterpoint and then the last book 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.490
 then off I fear infinite 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.300
 flame 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.300
 all 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.350
 and power 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.720
 let's go to the sea 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.490
 they will be on the surface 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:33.350
 but no it is not night 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.990
 luck my usual bad luck will be there 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.910
 a clip somewhere 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.910
 or attack the sheep 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.960
 now that you have strengthened the sword with 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.880
 refinement ops and I'm always wrong with 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.980
 accuracy with raised heel of fire 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.120
 will give you more 13.25 attack damage 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.050
 kickback will serve to make more go 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.290
 far 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.970
 the enemy has been of fire will set fire 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.720
 the animal 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:09.720
 look at the elite immediately die bow 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.180
 the bow strengthened with infinite flame e 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.300
 power is over will serve to fire the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.030
 shots there charge faster than that 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.490
 we are there from the cook and power to old 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.490
 19 we would load the maximum 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.270
 there is no one anymore sheep 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.040
 it does not matter 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.690
 however even if you hit that one arc 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:45.570
 tree the tree does not start to take 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.000
 fire and nothing for what was night 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.990
 so I could see some monsters 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.180
 hand for now I mean expects you in the 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.160
 next video and commentary sign up
