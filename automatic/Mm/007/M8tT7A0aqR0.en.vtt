00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
we're going to do is just going to start

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.230 
we're going to do is just going to start
in<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.799> middle<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> now<00:01:59.670> towards<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
in the middle of the now towards the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
in the middle of the now towards the
bottom<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:01.259> gonna<00:02:01.380> sort<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
bottom and we're gonna sort of have a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.670 
bottom and we're gonna sort of have a
bit<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.310> border<00:02:02.729> around<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.750> nail<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.439> it's

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
bit of a border around the nail so it's

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
bit of a border around the nail so it's
not<00:02:04.860> going<00:02:05.240> like<00:02:06.240> completely<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> edge<00:02:07.170> of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
not going like completely to the edge of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.080 
not going like completely to the edge of
the<00:02:07.409> nail<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.069> gonna<00:02:08.280> start<00:02:08.670> down<00:02:08.849> at<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the nail so gonna start down at the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.880 
the nail so gonna start down at the
cuticle<00:02:09.420> without<00:02:09.810> actually<00:02:10.170> touching<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
cuticle without actually touching it and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.890 
cuticle without actually touching it and
then<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.670> bring<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> up

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
then just bring it up

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.320 
then just bring it up
and<00:02:13.099> then<00:02:14.099> you're<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.489> go<00:02:14.670> around<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and then you're going to go around to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.589 
and then you're going to go around to
the<00:02:15.480> side<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.760> sort<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.819> curve<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.390> brush

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
the side and sort of curve the brush

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.170 
the side and sort of curve the brush
around<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.709> way<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.340> doesn't<00:02:20.670> touch<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
around so that way it doesn't touch the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.680 
around so that way it doesn't touch the
side<00:02:21.420> either<00:02:24.290> let's<00:02:25.290> say<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:26.390> it's<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.480> bit<00:02:27.599> of

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
side either let's say that it's a bit of

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.320 
side either let's say that it's a bit of
a<00:02:27.780> border<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:29.549> just<00:02:29.940> going<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.239> do

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
a border there and then just going to do

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.059 
a border there and then just going to do
the<00:02:30.450> other<00:02:30.629> side<00:02:30.989> as<00:02:31.290> well

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
the other side as well

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.780 
the other side as well
so<00:02:32.610> again<00:02:32.970> curve<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.540> around<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:34.580> then<00:02:35.580> just

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
so again curve it around and then just

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.339 
so again curve it around and then just
come<00:02:36.000> straight<00:02:36.269> up<00:02:36.510> without<00:02:36.660> touching<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
come straight up without touching the

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.660 
come straight up without touching the
outside<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> nail<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.250> was<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.549> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
outside of the nail so that was just the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.830 
outside of the nail so that was just the
first<00:02:41.879> crate<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.239> then<00:02:42.360> we're<00:02:42.450> going<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.660> do

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.410 
I'm going to be using two top coats and
the<00:04:41.980> first<00:04:42.190> one<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.490> I'm<00:04:42.700> going<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:42.970> use<00:04:43.030> is

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
the first one that I'm going to use is

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.770 
the first one that I'm going to use is
the<00:04:43.680> essence<00:04:44.680> gel<00:04:45.040> look<00:04:45.280> top<00:04:45.550> coat<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.030> this

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.570 
the essence gel look top coat and this
actually<00:04:47.200> does<00:04:47.440> make<00:04:47.680> your<00:04:47.890> nails<00:04:48.100> a<00:04:48.310> little

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
actually does make your nails a little

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.010 
actually does make your nails a little
bit<00:04:48.700> thicker<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.150> give<00:04:49.300> them<00:04:49.420> that<00:04:49.570> gel<00:04:49.840> look

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
bit thicker to give them that gel look

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.140 
bit thicker to give them that gel look
