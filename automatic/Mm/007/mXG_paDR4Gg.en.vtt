 you recover your investment your return of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.520
 investment since the equilibrium point

 of sale of garrafones is less than 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.190
 thirty thirty five jugs 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.260
 daily you have to sell 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.960

 purify the water costs only two 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.620
 weights with fifty cents purify 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.250
 20 liters of water 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.750
 that is, I earn 80 percent a 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 800 percent because we are talking 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.790
 that you do not sell double or 100 and the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.650
 200 and 300 almost 8 pesos per garrafon 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.660
 is what you earn in the sale of 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.220
 Purified water is if I start 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.050
 I work really really win 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.050

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.300
 Witness our more than 3500 units 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.430
 of business placed throughout Mexico me 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.650
 an insurance business seems extraordinary 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.930
 because it's about clear water is a 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.640

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.090

 transnational but at a very 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.300
 low since purifying water costs us 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.800

 transnational companies sell them between 25 and 40 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.990
 pesos wow well I think there's a big 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.820
 competition here in the sense of saying 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.530
