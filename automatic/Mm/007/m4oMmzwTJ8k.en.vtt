00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
of Capcom's earliest arcade games and in

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.560 
of Capcom's earliest arcade games and in
terms<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.770> originality<00:01:11.149> so<00:01:12.149> it<00:01:12.210> actually

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
terms of originality so it actually

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.060 
terms of originality so it actually
falls<00:01:12.780> somewhere<00:01:13.050> between<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.649> other<00:01:13.800> two

falls somewhere between the other two
but<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.610> were<00:01:14.700> plenty<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.270> games<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.690> 1942

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
but there were plenty of games like 1942

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.999 
but there were plenty of games like 1942
virtually<00:01:17.459> none<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.000> Sun<00:01:18.360> Sun<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.890> a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.570 
to them and the great thing about it is
that<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:50.380> actually<00:02:50.740> very<00:02:50.920> different<00:02:51.280> from

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
that it's actually very different from

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.280 
that it's actually very different from

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
like the gameplay

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.540
