00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700
I'm new here

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.960
there was one thing that I wanted to learn

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.840
have you heard of something called Eskista?

00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:45.372
do you know what Eskista is?

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.820
I don't understand?

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:47.444

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.260

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.160
I came from England, my Amharic isn't that great

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.020

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.820

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.600
yes, do you know how?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.840
go on then, show him

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.680

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.928

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.120

00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:12.628
YES

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.560
How do you dance to that?!

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.980

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080
I've learnt how to speak

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.520
now, I want to learn how to Eskista.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.220
Can you not do it?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.720
I can't do it.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560
That's not a problem, we can teach you.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.420
How do you work it?

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.680
How do you work it?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
Ohhhhh...It's like this...

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.060

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.260
How long have you been here?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.520
It's been 1 week

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.200
How did you learn Amharic that quickly?!

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.320
I grasp it quickly

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.820
REALLY?!

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.320

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.320
We've tried to learn English but we can't.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.760
Should we do it for you?

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.740

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.020

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.640

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.640

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.500
who will?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.680
people on the road

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.560
Anyway, it's like this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.120
That's really good. Do you know how?

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.740
yes

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.240
Go on then

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.600
What does it look like?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.720
What do you mean?

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:08.944

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.520
It's not easy

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.400
what do you want me to dance for you?!

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.960
I saw him do this

00:02:19.962 --> 00:02:21.182
No, I just wanted to show you a little bit

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.477
Do you know little bit?

00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:23.414

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:24.732

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:25.864

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.840
Show me

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.320

00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.187

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.540

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.940
I can't do it

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.100
OK

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.460
That's good.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.460
OK, so where we going?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.680

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.274
Is it called Guragigna?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.620
How about Walaytinia?

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:01.396
It will really help his confidence.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.327
Really help my confidence

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:04.057
Well, there is many kinds

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:05.670
It's not just this

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.196
this is Esksita, this is Eskista

00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.053
There is also like this, guragigna

00:03:09.053 --> 00:03:10.890
Do we need music?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.760
There must be a camera somewhere

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.295
Where is it show me?

00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:20.695
