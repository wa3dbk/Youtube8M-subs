00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 and good morning to all and to all the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.069
 fable tube today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.500
 for a new video we will say 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.630
 maybe information rather suggestions 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.099
 even even discussion of the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.139
 next update so for the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.759
 console minecraft versions so of course 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.560
 that they would be the tg 24 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.720
 because as you know so the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.930
 previous versions that were so there 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.029
 on the 22nd, the 21st, the 23rd, it was 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.670
 bug fixes from versions 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.510
 previous ones simply and so the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.300
 theory 24 could add so for 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.829
 to be in that the new update 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 to be able to add news 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.300
 things in minecraft console so here 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.980
 in this video we're just going 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.690
 a little bit spoken so what could 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.270
 so be added to this update 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.469
 which we have no date nothing we 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.350
 have a stop on this update 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.180
 even no tweet because on the side of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.820
 kadji studio so from cannes twitter 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.489
 studios there is nothing it is really 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.079
 total inactivity aside of course 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.309
 a few tweets about the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.250
 last pack of textures he's me 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.100
 appeared only released on 360 and xbox 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 one of which is the pattern pattern 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.770
 textures not that it seems to me so here 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.450
 just go a little bit talked 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.310
 so what could be added so to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.869
 the next update and we're going 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.470
 just start not a thing 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.630
 which should be added for me 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.790
 we will say more than 80% 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.500
 it is of course the colored windows 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.509
 so colorful stained glass for me 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.549
 efforts and their appearance as you the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.869
 know I released a video 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.740
 like what so there was some kind of 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.990
 small a small map a small mark 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.759
 like in mode and where there was so the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.470
 possibility of being able to use the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.360
 colored windows which was great 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.770
 do so I invite you to go see 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.740
 this video I would put you maybe 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.000
 read it in the description so who has 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.950
 allowed to add this 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.049
 feature as well as commands 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.390
 therefore blocks the texture of 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.399
 orders not block any programs 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.100
 so for the moment we have nothing on 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.409
 the block commands and so that allowed 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 so to add that of course it was on 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.430
 a map mode and so it was but 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.479
 it was still very well done here 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.079
 so I invite you to go and see when 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.599
 even the video 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.250
 so then so what could 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.510
 add sources by adding 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.099
 in the stained glass windows 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.349
 of course the colorful beacon or any 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.909
 just just by positioning the block 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.870
 colored on the beacon so he could 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:24.930
 so do the luminous flux of the beacon 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.689
 have colored here and so that could 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.670
 to be not bad so here then of course 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.349
 maybe the appearance so new 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.129
 fish so that is to say so the 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.750
 fish but who are currently so 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.079
 on psr so a new fish that we 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.970
 can find so maybe also 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.900
 so the enchanted fishing rods so 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.190
 which can be quite a lot I it is true that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.659
 I do not really see the usefulness apart 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.370
 perhaps for spring rolls size 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.340
 high school because it's true that the same 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.950
 texts a little cabbage to have so that's 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.769
 a possibility anyway to have 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.829
 so the same tags or even something else 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.870
 thereafter also also 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.659
 maybe so the famous commands 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.769
 therefore blocks the world case loc could 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.690
 to appear 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.909
 I think about the next-gen versions but 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.200
 I think back a little bit on everything 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.760
 what could be added for the 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.699
 versions of a gene in another video 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.230
 so do not hesitate to follow me 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.269
 on the social networks that are in the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.010
 description also subscribe and 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.709
 so for block commands for my 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.799
 share and should make their appearance 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.329
 I mean it should on versions 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.569
 next-gen because simply because 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.630
 that it's still stuff where 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.190
 there is programming and 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.780
 who could do maybe plant or 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.870
 even overheated the consoles so the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.160
 360 and the ps3 that would not have the capacity 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.230
 is correct to be able to do them 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.120
 work the same for versions 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.090
 next-gen and of course it's not going to come the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.320
 pc capacity this will be in my opinion a 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.250
 little bit up above anyway 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.030
 above below forgiveness underneath 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:06.140
 but it's not going to match the pc version 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.220
 that's it but about his pop over to 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.100
 tell you because it's true he 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.770
 there are no other important things 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.470
 about the version for the size 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.850
 So of course we can 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.980
 talk about other little things like 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.830
 ie the new biome 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.860
 so that's the bio but that's them 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.689
 rape 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.219
 dard though all that so we are 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:28.710
 different bio but also good good 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.969
 sure to enlarge portals that lock 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.530
 can not really be bad for 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:33.900
 maybe brought little gast in the 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.469
 normal world what can be pretty 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.659
 pretty funny and and afterwards 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.520
 of course we can talk about modes 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.659
 servers all that but that I 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.759
 will talk again in another video 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.319
 maybe coming out the next day from 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.370
 the one who is doing so at the 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.439
 case where I would put you an annotation 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.610
 it's the video came out here and I 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.830
 invite you to see this video 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.840
 see the friends so I have no more to you 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.490
 say about this video so 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.939
 do not hesitate to follow me on 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.849
 social networks 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.620
 I'm starting to become active again 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.360
 the chain so do not hesitate to you 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.889
 subscribe if it's not done yet to 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.050
 put a little blue thumbs that would make me 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.000
 super fun friends to share the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.830
 facebook video on twitter on skype 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.229

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.490
 and so I tell you go back to the 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.659
 next time Norman he should there 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.610
 have videos every two days 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.199
 maybe even every day but that 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.460
 my surprise 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.469
 but there should be really a lot 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.779
 of videos that are starting to become the 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:25.979
 friends here is me so I leave you I 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.360

 see you next time for a 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.150
 new shower on minecraft like 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.150
 usually kiss everyone and shout
