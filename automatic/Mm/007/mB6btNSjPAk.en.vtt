00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 for this to happen first we are 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.629
 an independent band is very difficult 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.550
 to get where we are coming here 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.950
 people, it was only on account of a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.259
 collective of people who have 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.839
 people who believe in the project 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.970
 give a force the guys here have a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.859
 course here of the personal saint marcelina 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.020
 careful the scenery is another galera 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.320
 taking care of the cameras, otherwise we 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.269
 He would realize then off musicians 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.490
 are giving a force when a super 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.779
 support for us so I wanted to ask 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.779
 Palmas please to this galera. 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.390
 Thanks, you 're taking advantage of this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.180
 collective think the secret of life is the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 collective is the next song here she 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.129
 call the mirror and we'll talk a little bit 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.980
 that sometimes we bring values to 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.350
 our lives that are programmed values 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.989
 values I know of a generation ago or 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 tradition and this we do not question 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.080
 It is not the time to ask yourself 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.880
 look in the mirror on the thigh will this 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.070
 my excision is being mine 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.270
 own account of my heart another scene 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.500
 my whatever I know I scheduled 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.030
 that from the moment that we are 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.340
 look in the mirror really with this 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.410
 reflect on these issues 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.180
 we can eliminate problems in the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.970
 society that today are completely 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 ridiculous as prejudice racism 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.759
 corruption, we have to give more 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
 is to stop giving a little value to the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.090
 good ways and put the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.350
 consensus 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.350
 the music is called a mirror 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.790
 I'm against the current 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.460
 and all these people are 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.360
 but there are those who 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:33.150
 they do not care anymore and you see each other 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.150
 to the mirror 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.070
 the image that sells 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.480
 is 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.189
 and take it in the comb 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.490
 is 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:18.849
 but some say that it is the happy good like this 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.849
 no one where you whistle 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.920
 it is 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.750
 Who knows, the government knows what the 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.750
 movie theater 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:45.380
 who knows if the fact of being 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.380
 today gave the Teutonic 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.489
 who knows if the course 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.920
 from who wrote it 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.510
 who knows the mirror 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.650
 someone who is not 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.129
 someone 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.050
 someone wants 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.910
 someone 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.910
 it's me who is not 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.820
 not 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.480
 someone who is not
