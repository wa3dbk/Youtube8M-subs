00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.000
 or what lucky lion I hope they are 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:07.069
 pretty good and I'm just arriving 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.769
 of what school is and I find myself 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.889
 with this tomaso tweet that I said oh for 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.079
 god that is all this and good as here 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.740
 can say say wet blogs or more 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:21.730
 blocks at 0.9 point zero and good if 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.720
 we open the image appointment or we can see 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.480
 we're practically going to go from left to 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.020
 right ok left because we have what 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.870
 what are the lianas could you say and 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.480
 also what is cocoa which is 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.899
 the jungle wood and also on the other 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.260
 side just in this part to see is 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.719
 more let's increase it in this area 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.749
 We have two new types of logs that 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.679
 If I'm not mistaken, the truth is not very 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:54.710
 ok but I think they are not in pc and if 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.690
 They are then be new to 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.879
 my voice is gone and the emotion of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.120
 emotion will be in any case the new 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.670
 biomes that came out in 1.7 I do not know 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.110
 I'm not very well updated regarding 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.990
 the new biomes 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.080
 and well, I guess it will be that and 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.200
 well over here and we can see that ok 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.480
 take off that there are many more plants 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.660
 well this is already in the 1.7 these and 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.790
 I've seen these are like grinded adis 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.400
 his name but good are those and there 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.830
 much more plants to decorate much more 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.680
 I do not know how to give it a much better view 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.180
 that is minecraft editing time and the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 it's pretty cool, they're going to 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.130
 see also red roses and blue ones 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.619
 it also changes its texture to say it 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.640
 somehow like purple roses 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.509
 and I do not know is amazing on this side 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.100
 okay we can see what clays are 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.189
 how can you say processed 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.920
 when you put them in the oven and others and 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.560
 can be made as solid and there are 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.570
 many colors that is like instead of 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.670
 put half or something like that you can 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.830
 burn easy I think good actually 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.960
 I do not know if this can be burned or not but 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.390
 it's also an option they have colors 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.120
 different and so on and it's also 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.610
 pretty cool and this side dad 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.590
 father 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.860
 we have something that as soon as I saw it, I said 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.430
 wow wow wow what is that and well these are 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.959
 the new blocks that will be in what 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.780
 is the 1.8 point point 1 point something that 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.690
 of minecraft from pc and what are the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.360
 blocks well, I do not really know 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.260
 which is which but are supposed to be 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.890
 Granites of horita and andesite in the case 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.370
 of these here the three are good 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.860
 they are in a row they are like 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.049
 in its natural state and those below 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.549
 that already look a little more squares and 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.030
 besides that they do not look like earth ground in 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.030
 yes they are like those processed and how 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.860
 do these is to put the other one has 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.629
 seen something like that more or less that calls me 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.010
 a little attention is that actually 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.310
 very good time that I do not like how it 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.280
 see the textures are not very nice to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.579
 good view but it is already a plus is 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.709
 do with with those of natural state with 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.239
 stone and also with quartz I think 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.910
 to be able to make these blocks already 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.410
 processed and so on and the two that are 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.680
 like here in the background a little 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.840
 forgotten as brown or brown yes 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.019
 I have no idea what they are but good 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.409
 I believe that most things are in themselves 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.349
 if I said yes because it's about the 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:39.379
 jungle the two different trunks all 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:44.910
 the flowers that are in 1.7 I think 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:48.390
 that all the clay cooked the new 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.310
 now it's earth rather like new 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.870
 materials rather than you can 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.960
 get that they will be in the new version 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.620
 the 1.8 point 1 point something that is granite 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.440
 and now in 7 and that would be that and 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.810
 good what you have in hand intrigued me 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.900
 a little or I do not know if they are seeds of the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.880
 of these flowers for example I do not know 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.710
 how they look alike can be that 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.300
 if it can be that not but good the truth 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.420
 they only put that on only 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.430
 they put new blocks at 0.9 point 0 and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.090
 they leave us with the intrigue and good in 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.520
 my case because I 'm not very up to date 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.740
 with what is the latest version and 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.699
 even neither of the 1.7 and level a 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.229
 the new laucho point the 1.8 sorry but 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.789
 well we already have new blocks in 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.900
 minecraft and so nothing I hope you
