 good morning everyone to all and welcome to the TV news peru 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.569
 unless you see from Mars you should know that our good old woman 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.659
 pergola I did not go well 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.909
 this does not leave us indifferent if you love her we make the point of the 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.949
 situation 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.089
 exhaustion of global warming resources and pollution 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.409
 it is urgent to become aware of the identity card of human activities 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:35.019
 in which way our husband we are interested first of all tells you 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.809
 sustainable development alice savings of minor raw materials waste logically 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.570
 the longer the tires last 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.020
 the better the raw materials used the better the number of 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.070
 replacements the user has an important role to play by choosing 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.820
 of tires with a lower cost of use a little more expensive at the moment 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.420
 of the purchase but which last longer than the best example and the michelin energy 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.450
 star 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.680
 photo said even more true for truck tires than the carcasses of 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.790
 quality enable similar wear a primary sculpting and reconstruction 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.230
 then a second sculpting in total the duration of the tire multiplies 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.230
 for two, 5 for a cost per kilometer bel morir 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.280
 on the other hand, not all tires are the same in terms of savings 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.560
 energy, in fact, depending on its use, the tire warms up to 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.300
 moment is thus giving me a fifth of the fuel needed for his own 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300
 this year 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.110
 for which I am making a wise choice the user can feed duration and 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.270
 fuel economy to effectively reduce the operating costs of the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.090
 own tires and safeguard the environment 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.680
 the future of used tires today present. in different ways excellent 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.210
 fuel can be exploited in industrial or recycled ovens 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.010
 the rubber of the tires after being shredded lends itself to multiple 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.100
 use of rubber articles road coverings athletics tracks 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.360
 xl 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.240
 last longer than marine fish 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.619
 being valued is over here is the contribution of the tires to roll 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.009
 still long on our beautiful planet 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.959
 I don't know about you but I like the idea of ​​becoming an athletics track in the end 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:14.610
 very 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.510
 but for now I haven't arrived yet, however, being able to choose to go to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.010
