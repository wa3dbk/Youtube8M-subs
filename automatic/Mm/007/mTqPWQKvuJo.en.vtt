00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
response i'm looking for so you know

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.970 
response i'm looking for so you know
he's<00:02:24.300> been<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> huge<00:02:25.110> player<00:02:25.350> for<00:02:25.590> us<00:02:25.620> over<00:02:25.890> this

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
he's been a huge player for us over this

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.650 
he's been a huge player for us over this
period<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.850> later<00:02:27.030> he<00:02:27.180> got<00:02:27.300> his<00:02:27.420> goal

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
period and the later he got his goal

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.900 
period and the later he got his goal
because<00:02:28.470> he<00:02:28.560> does<00:02:28.739> i<00:02:29.040> might<00:02:29.430> not<00:02:29.580> work<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:29.819> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
because he does i might not work for the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.940 
because he does i might not work for the
team<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.810> know<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.020> fini<00:02:31.260> as<00:02:31.440> well<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.860> know

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
team you know on fini as well you know

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.160 
team you know on fini as well you know
came<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.580> great<00:02:32.819> cross<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.900> he<00:02:34.020> got

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
came up with a great cross and he got

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.870 
came up with a great cross and he got
better<00:02:34.350> as<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.590> game<00:02:34.770> going<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.069> lasted<00:02:35.520> Clinton

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
better as a game going on lasted Clinton

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.880 
better as a game going on lasted Clinton
so<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.959> our<00:02:37.080> second<00:02:37.530> half<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.680> know

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
so in our second half you know

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.680 
so in our second half you know
particularly<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.209> can<00:02:39.330> pick<00:02:39.510> teams

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
particularly I think we can pick teams

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.180 
particularly I think we can pick teams
off<00:02:39.900> better<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.350> counter-attack<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:41.040> well

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
off better on the counter-attack as well

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.280 
off better on the counter-attack as well
because<00:02:41.459> we<00:02:41.550> do<00:02:41.700> break<00:02:41.910> very<00:02:42.150> very<00:02:42.390> well<00:02:42.600> so

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
because we do break very very well so

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.780 
because we do break very very well so
again<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.860> know<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.310> will<00:02:44.400> come<00:02:44.580> hopefully

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
again you know that will come hopefully

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.360 
again you know that will come hopefully
with<00:02:45.150> more<00:02:45.450> confidence<00:02:45.840> upper<00:02:46.260> half<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:47.220> one

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
with more confidence upper half just one
