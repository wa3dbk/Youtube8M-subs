00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.540
 find the best today 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.400
 today I bring you a very good video 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.469
 you will love them and it is 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.940
 how to have more functions in what is the 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:21.530
 instagram application if you want to know 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:23.180
 how is to stay in this video and 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.800
 we started with this video and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.990
 previously he had brought us functions 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.790
 similar in schools we add the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.050
 way to download photos and download 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.370
 videos of what is the application of 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.290
 instagram but this time 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.960
 I bring a video with which we are going to 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.390
 can add more functions to what 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.930
 is instagram seriously this week not what 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.250
 I knew second by mistake I agreed to what 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.690
 what is this tweet and it was when I gave 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.910
 account with this tweet that in addition to 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.440
 to be able to download the photos of the videos 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.690
 we will have functions very, very 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.920
 interesting and porn to do this is 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.750
 very simple the first thing that we have to 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.610
 do is have their installed continue 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.920
 devices already know that we are have 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.090
 idea for all versions then 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.680
 here on this right side I leave you 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.629
 several options in which 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.100
 simply click on that in which 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.300
 you are in the version in your 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.800
 device 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.360
 we have here squares and make 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.920
 you just their version of them 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.479
 that have the selection have gone to send 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.250
 a very simple and very easy tutorial 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.830
 make it really is highly 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.210
 recommended to have all these 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.590
 pretty good features and improvements 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.790
 then once I no longer have 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.619
 installed what we are going to do is go 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.240
 towards whom if we no longer have to 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.130
 add anything we're just going to go 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.890
 here to search and we will look for this 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.360
 tweet called instagram blogs 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.830
 So yes, the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.750
 name to be searched for and what 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.900
 download as I tell you it's called 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.090
 instagram 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.650
 we have blogs here in this 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.420
 already cost once you have searched 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.920
 just give it here in install 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.020
 then confirm and wait for it to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.670
 do all this process until you ask 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.350
 to restart what is the springboard and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.200
 once they have done this, 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.270
 all available once they have already 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.680
 your device has restarted 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.940
 just go back in and we 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.980
 let's go to what is the application of 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.530
 instagram and here the first thing they're going to 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.300
 see is this change this change that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.830
 we have here that in which you are going to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.810
 appear a very different way than the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.890
 that normally appears to you 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.170
 they will ask why they appear 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.060
 images so big because it's for a 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.040
 very simple reason with which 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 just pressing twice what 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.820
 is the image we are going to access what is 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.980
 as the image in which we will be able to 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.230
 zooming we will be able to see some type 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.910
 of something we want to see in specific 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.459
 because you use instagram will be given 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.810
 mind that we can not zoom if 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.550
 you do not like what this list is 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.100
 do not worry about just picking on 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.930
 the one that says here full 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.750
 one that you have been selected to see 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.850
 that what is your differential is normal 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.320
 as they have previously this tweet 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.660
 As it's free, it's obviously going to have 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.850
 advertising do not worry simply 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.980
 you apply to what is this 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.570
 little button that I did not what they wanted but 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.550
 this button that we have a side of 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.970
 close and once closed they will not see 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.470
 none but no advertising before 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.270
 as you can see they have some functions 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.500
 they also have the function of downloading 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.940
 the images or download the photos 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.160
 simply selecting what is 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.290
 these three little buttons we are going to see 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.030
 different options here among the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.160
 that appears to us in this part we have what 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.210
 what is to save in blogs that this 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.070
 what you are going to do is save it in our 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.600
 application of photos if it is video too 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.280
 it is saved without any problem 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.140
 just pressing what is this 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.910
 option you will also give an account 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.380
 that here we have a green bar that 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.270
 it means that it is the process and 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.430
 your image will be automatically addressed 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.200
 or your video we also have what is the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.540
 copy function to what is the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 clipboard what's up with this then 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.140
 we do press this button what 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.210
 what he's going to do is that he's going to create 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.800
 clipboard as it says there but 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.750
 they will discard what it is useful for us if 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.490
 we leave some note an email 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.820
 or something 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.930
 just by leaving it pressed and 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.550
 select the option to paste is going to 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.990
 paste what this image is and we are not going to 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.790
 have to save it we just go 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.590
 to be able to send directly without 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.360
 need to keep it in what it is 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.740
 our device as you can see 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.050
 these are some of the functions that 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.810
 we have the truth with this tweet 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.690
 it seemed very very interesting very good what 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.250
 what can we do with this then it is 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.810
 an excellent option for all this 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.550
 opinion has some adjustments that 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.230
 we can configure where simply 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.850
 we are going to that the option of where is 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.590
 our profile I remember my 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.360
 instagram is mauricio stream so that me 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.700
 keep uploading enough photos then 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.590
 follow and keep a pending 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.760
 Once those who commented that we can 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.320
 make several adjustments simply 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.120
 selecting this option that we have in 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.799
 the top part and we will be added 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.160
 this menu that we have here in which 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.080
 where it says that the links simply the 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.060
 we select and here we can configure 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.550
 some very important things like what 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.990
 which is the download button as what 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.060
 it is enabled to copy the text that 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.220
 we have in Instagram as what it is that 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.350
 it always breaks, videos are downloaded 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.060
 in high definition that occurs what 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.830
 which is the sound we can establish 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.240
 some password that whatever the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.220
 instagram application this one 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.990
 complete then several things we can 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.780
 set up several very good features 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.250
 that we can use from simply 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.139
 is to create what the photo is until you can 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.970
 add sum to the images then it's 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.650
 an application rather a very tweet 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.960
 very good that I recommend it quite 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.520
 they have their good devices 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.780
 especially for this video is because it 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.280
 It has been quite true 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.990
