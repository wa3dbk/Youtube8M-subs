hi<00:00:03.779> this<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.230> mini<00:00:04.620> demo<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.490> fry<00:00:05.970> yet

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
hi this is a mini demo of the fry yet

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.129 
hi this is a mini demo of the fry yet
SAS<00:00:07.019> distortion<00:00:07.859> pedal<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.030> power<00:00:09.540> tube

SAS distortion pedal it is a power tube

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.799 
SAS distortion pedal it is a power tube
based<00:00:10.740> distortion<00:00:11.490> which<00:00:12.120> means<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.629> bit

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
based distortion which means it's a bit

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.990 
based distortion which means it's a bit
fatter<00:00:13.139> makes<00:00:13.950> all<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.400> sounds<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
amplifier sound a bit heavier I'm using

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
pickups volumes very low on the internet

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.610 
pickups volumes very low on the internet
it<00:00:47.010> says<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.359> is<00:00:48.539> part<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> gain

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
it says that this is part of the gain

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.160 
it says that this is part of the gain
structure<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.269> basically<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.019> want

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
structure and so basically if you want

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.689 
structure and so basically if you want
to<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.499> of<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.649> clean<00:00:52.859> boost<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.399> just

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
to get more of a clean boost you just

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.069 
to get more of a clean boost you just
raise<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.089> up<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:54.359> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.929> gets

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
raise this up a little bit and it gets

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:08.800 
raise this up a little bit and it gets
obnoxiously<00:00:55.710> loud

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.450 

still<00:01:09.810> very<00:01:09.930> functional<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> useful<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.010> keep

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
still very functional and useful I keep

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:22.090 
still very functional and useful I keep
it<00:01:11.610> almost<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> way<00:01:12.780> down<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> clean

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.340 

adds<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.250> little<00:01:23.369> grit<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:23.880> point<00:01:24.350> pumping

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
adds a little grit at this point pumping

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.810 
adds a little grit at this point pumping
up<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> game<00:01:25.740> gives<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.190> of<00:01:26.340> course<00:01:26.490> more

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
up the game gives you of course more

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:49.110 
up the game gives you of course more
disorder

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.880 

the<00:01:50.120> bias<00:01:50.360> gives<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:50.960> everything<00:01:51.200> from<00:01:51.560> more

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
the bias gives you everything from more

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.130 
the bias gives you everything from more
or<00:01:52.070> less<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.460> cleaner<00:01:53.120> tube<00:01:53.570> saturation

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.320 

increases<00:02:00.140> distortion<00:02:06.670> gets<00:02:07.670> more<00:02:07.910> scooped

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
increases distortion gets more scooped

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.540 
increases distortion gets more scooped
and<00:02:08.600> thinner<00:02:08.840> as<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.080> go<00:02:09.289> up<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.340> like

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
and thinner as you go up to the like

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.820 
and thinner as you go up to the like
might<00:02:10.789> have<00:02:11.230> or<00:02:12.230> somewhere<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.620> range

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
might have or somewhere in that range

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.490 
might have or somewhere in that range
there<00:02:13.420> here's<00:02:14.420> what<00:02:14.570> again<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:15.140> even

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
there here's what again going even

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:34.790 
there here's what again going even
hotter

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.830 

there's<00:02:35.250> almost<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.640> ridiculous<00:02:36.239> amount<00:02:36.629> of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
there's almost a ridiculous amount of

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.530 
there's almost a ridiculous amount of
sustaining<00:02:37.680> gain<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.040> get<00:02:38.220> which<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
sustaining gain you get which is the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.839 
sustaining gain you get which is the
intention<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.170> pedal<00:02:40.500> will<00:02:40.590> go<00:02:40.769> from<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.370> very

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
intention this pedal will go from a very

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.119 
intention this pedal will go from a very
light<00:02:42.120> thing<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.720> an<00:02:42.870> extremely<00:02:43.530> almost

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
light thing to an extremely almost

00:02:44.129 --> 00:03:09.070 
light thing to an extremely almost
unusable<00:02:44.340> heavy<00:02:44.940> thing

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.260 

it's<00:03:10.040> kind<00:03:10.460> of<00:03:10.490> fun<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.700> play<00:03:10.820> with<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.090> much

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
it's kind of fun to play with that much

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.900 
it's kind of fun to play with that much
flab<00:03:11.710> I'm<00:03:12.710> using<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.190> in<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:13.400> setting<00:03:13.640> most

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
flab I'm using it in this setting most

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.660 
flab I'm using it in this setting most
of<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.210> time<00:03:14.420> now<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.960> it's<00:03:15.770> good<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.340> makes

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
of the time now and it's good it makes

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.930 
of the time now and it's good it makes
the<00:03:16.850> amplifier<00:03:17.360> richer<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.080> larger<00:03:18.560> sounding

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.540 

and<00:03:22.940> I'm<00:03:23.060> about<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.360> pump<00:03:24.050> this<00:03:24.440> pedal<00:03:24.920> with<00:03:25.220> my

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
and I'm about to pump this pedal with my

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:54.220 
and I'm about to pump this pedal with my
Barbour<00:03:26.000> Ltd

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.809 

so<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> great<00:03:55.860> alternative<00:03:56.069> if<00:03:56.670> you're

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
so this is a great alternative if you're

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:57.949 
so this is a great alternative if you're
looking<00:03:57.060> for<00:03:57.180> something<00:03:57.390> that's<00:03:57.660> going<00:03:57.870> to

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
looking for something that's going to

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.770 
looking for something that's going to
fatten<00:03:58.560> up<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:59.160> tone<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.490> your<00:03:59.970> amplifier<00:04:00.480> and

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
fatten up the tone of your amplifier and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.870 
fatten up the tone of your amplifier and
give<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.680> more<00:04:01.860> three-dimensional<00:04:02.190> sound

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
give you a more three-dimensional sound

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.449 
give you a more three-dimensional sound
and<00:04:03.390> yet<00:04:03.810> it's<00:04:04.050> totally<00:04:04.650> different<00:04:04.980> as<00:04:05.250> far<00:04:05.280> as

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
and yet it's totally different as far as

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.860 
and yet it's totally different as far as
I<00:04:05.640> can<00:04:05.700> tell<00:04:05.910> then<00:04:06.060> anything<00:04:06.270> else<00:04:06.450> I've<00:04:06.660> tried

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
I can tell then anything else I've tried

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.620 
I can tell then anything else I've tried
in<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.050> market<00:04:07.380> gives<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> fatter<00:04:09.090> cleaner

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
in the market gives you a fatter cleaner

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.020 
in the market gives you a fatter cleaner
