00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
there I did nine months of just intense

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.760 
there I did nine months of just intense
research<00:01:06.190> in<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:06.760> hospital<00:01:07.540> in<00:01:07.690> Sydney<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.710> you

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
research in a hospital in Sydney so you

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.160 
research in a hospital in Sydney so you
got<00:01:08.980> to<00:01:09.100> see<00:01:09.280> like<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.630> work<00:01:10.810> that<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.080> were

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
bacterial outbreak called Klebsiella

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.710 
bacterial outbreak called Klebsiella
pneumoniae<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.970> particular<00:02:33.269> bug

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
pneumoniae so this particular bug

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.460 
pneumoniae so this particular bug
carried<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:34.950> enzyme<00:02:35.700> called<00:02:36.150> kpc<00:02:36.840> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
carried this enzyme called kpc that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.470 
carried this enzyme called kpc that
basically<00:02:37.830> ate<00:02:38.100> up<00:02:38.340> all<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.580> antibiotics

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
basically ate up all the antibiotics

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.470 
basically ate up all the antibiotics
that<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.140> patients<00:02:40.530> were<00:02:40.620> being<00:02:40.769> given<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.299> no

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
that the patients were being given so no

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.970 
that the patients were being given so no
matter<00:02:42.630> what<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.319> do<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.650> treat<00:02:43.799> these

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
matter what you do to treat these

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.770 
matter what you do to treat these
patients<00:02:44.610> there<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:44.880> no<00:02:45.030> antibiotics<00:02:45.690> that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
patients there are no antibiotics that

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.229 
patients there are no antibiotics that
are<00:02:45.900> effective<00:02:46.380> we're<00:02:47.190> looking<00:02:47.519> into<00:02:47.640> rapid

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
are effective we're looking into rapid

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.449 
are effective we're looking into rapid
detection<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:49.410> these<00:02:49.590> bad<00:02:49.980> types<00:02:50.340> of

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
detection for these bad types of

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.030 
detection for these bad types of
bacteria<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.380> early<00:02:52.380> detection<00:02:52.530> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
bacteria and early detection of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.550 
bacteria and early detection of
potential<00:02:53.609> outbreaks<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.660> for<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.049> mold

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
potential outbreaks this is for the mold

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.259 
potential outbreaks this is for the mold
database<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.370> built<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.120> we're<00:02:57.239> just

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
database that I built so we're just

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.420 
database that I built so we're just
going<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.510> take<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.750> little<00:02:57.959> bit<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.470> put

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
going to take a little bit of this put

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.860 
going to take a little bit of this put
it<00:02:59.519> into<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.850> tube<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.329> contains<00:03:00.510> like

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
it into this tube that contains like

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.180 
it into this tube that contains like
beads<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.290> ethanol<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.950> then<00:03:02.040> we're<00:03:02.160> just

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
beads and ethanol and then we're just

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:13.080 
beads and ethanol and then we're just
gonna<00:03:02.370> extract<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.209> proteins<00:03:03.630> out<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.810> it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.300 

so<00:03:13.540> we're<00:03:13.660> just<00:03:13.690> gonna<00:03:13.870> pick<00:03:14.170> up<00:03:14.319> a<00:03:14.530> little<00:03:15.160> bit

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
so we're just gonna pick up a little bit

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.729 
so we're just gonna pick up a little bit
of<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.640> mold<00:03:15.989> only<00:03:16.989> when<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.170> take<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.530> from<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
of the mold only when I take it from the

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.050 
of the mold only when I take it from the
edge<00:03:17.890> because<00:03:18.250> that's<00:03:18.430> like<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.670> youngest

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
edge because that's like the youngest

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.940 
edge because that's like the youngest
part<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.750> that's<00:03:20.050> where<00:03:20.349> we're<00:03:20.620> gonna<00:03:20.709> find

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
part and that's where we're gonna find

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.250 
part and that's where we're gonna find
the<00:03:21.160> most<00:03:21.360> abundant<00:03:22.360> protein

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
the most abundant protein

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.820 
the most abundant protein
kind<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.860> pick<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.069> up

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
kind of pick it up

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.650 
kind of pick it up
and<00:03:26.950> stick<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.520> into<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.850> tube<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.270> then<00:03:28.420> just

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
and stick it into the tube and then just

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:43.570 
and stick it into the tube and then just
mush<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.990> up<00:03:32.850> alright<00:03:33.850> for<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> plate

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.310 

so<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.210> yellow<00:03:44.480> stuff<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.930> just<00:03:45.140> rubbed

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
so that yellow stuff that I just rubbed

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.410 
so that yellow stuff that I just rubbed
off<00:03:45.500> for<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.010> old<00:03:46.280> proteins<00:03:46.970> from<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.270> run

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
off for the old proteins from the run

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.100 
off for the old proteins from the run
before<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:50.690> we<00:03:50.810> have<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> clean<00:03:51.230> plate

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
before so we have a clean plate

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.760 
before so we have a clean plate
we<00:03:53.770> extracted<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:55.270> takes<00:03:55.540> about<00:03:55.960> 20

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
we extracted it it takes about 20

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.630 
we extracted it it takes about 20
minutes<00:03:57.040> or<00:03:57.160> so

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
minutes or so

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.010 
minutes or so
so<00:03:57.880> here<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.270> that's<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.630> extracted

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
so here it is that's the extracted

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.870 
so here it is that's the extracted
protein<00:03:59.440> in<00:03:59.650> there<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.130> then<00:04:00.400> there's<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
protein in there and then there's the

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.970 
protein in there and then there's the
squished<00:04:01.180> up<00:04:01.330> mold<00:04:01.570> that's<00:04:02.080> in<00:04:02.230> there<00:04:02.380> but<00:04:02.860> in

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
squished up mold that's in there but in

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
squished up mold that's in there but in
the<00:04:03.100> solution<00:04:03.550> that's<00:04:03.700> where<00:04:03.820> all<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
the solution that's where all the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.150 
the solution that's where all the
proteins<00:04:04.390> are<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:05.260> what<00:04:05.440> we're<00:04:05.590> gonna<00:04:05.680> do<00:04:05.980> is

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
proteins are so what we're gonna do is

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.250 
proteins are so what we're gonna do is
just<00:04:06.280> take<00:04:06.400> one<00:04:06.850> microliter<00:04:07.330> is<00:04:07.750> just<00:04:08.110> like

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
just take one microliter is just like

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.230 
just take one microliter is just like
that<00:04:08.560> much<00:04:08.800> in<00:04:09.070> volume<00:04:09.460> it's<00:04:09.670> hardly<00:04:09.970> anything

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
that much in volume it's hardly anything

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.170 
that much in volume it's hardly anything
and<00:04:11.080> then<00:04:11.410> I'm<00:04:11.530> gonna<00:04:11.650> spot<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.370> directly<00:04:12.910> onto

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
and then I'm gonna spot it directly onto

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.990 
and then I'm gonna spot it directly onto
this<00:04:13.390> plate<00:04:16.500> India<00:04:17.500> going<00:04:18.040> up<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:18.340> tube<00:04:18.700> is

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
this plate India going up this tube is

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.330 
this plate India going up this tube is
the<00:04:19.570> big<00:04:20.049> vacuum<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.859> it's<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.040> really<00:04:21.250> really

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
the big vacuum so it's a really really

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.280 
the big vacuum so it's a really really
powerful<00:04:21.730> vacuum<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.660> proteins<00:04:23.110> are

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
powerful vacuum that the proteins are

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.870 
powerful vacuum that the proteins are
just<00:04:23.410> gonna<00:04:23.530> fly<00:04:23.800> through<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.490> give<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:24.730> your

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
just gonna fly through to give you your

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.520 
just gonna fly through to give you your
fingerprint<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.570> on<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.020> top<00:04:26.230> there's<00:04:26.440> a

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
fingerprint and on the top there's a

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.110 
fingerprint and on the top there's a
detector<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.280> then<00:04:27.430> there's<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:27.700> massive

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
detector and then there's a massive

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.820 
detector and then there's a massive
powerful<00:04:28.540> laser<00:04:29.020> that<00:04:29.290> will<00:04:29.410> hit<00:04:29.680> the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
powerful laser that will hit the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.380 
powerful laser that will hit the
proteins<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.610> are<00:04:30.670> spotted<00:04:31.090> onto<00:04:31.300> that

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
proteins that are spotted onto that

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.300 
proteins that are spotted onto that
plate<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.080> then<00:04:32.410> make<00:04:32.590> them<00:04:32.740> fly<00:04:32.950> through<00:04:33.220> the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
plate and then make them fly through the

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.830 
plate and then make them fly through the
vacuum<00:04:33.460> we're<00:04:34.060> gonna<00:04:34.180> put<00:04:34.420> our<00:04:34.540> new<00:04:34.810> one<00:04:35.020> in

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
vacuum we're gonna put our new one in

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.740 
vacuum we're gonna put our new one in
close<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:37.870> up<00:04:38.170> and<00:04:38.470> stick<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.370> back<00:04:39.550> in<00:04:39.720> set<00:04:40.720> up

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
close it up and stick it back in set up

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:48.270 
close it up and stick it back in set up
a<00:04:40.870> program<00:04:46.230> here<00:04:47.230> is<00:04:47.350> our<00:04:47.500> target<00:04:47.950> plate<00:04:48.160> that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
a program here is our target plate that

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.880 
a program here is our target plate that
we<00:04:48.400> just<00:04:48.580> put<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.180> so<00:04:49.750> if<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:49.990> scroll<00:04:50.350> over<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.680> s

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
we just put in so if I scroll over the s

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.560 
we just put in so if I scroll over the s
you<00:04:51.040> can<00:04:51.160> see<00:04:51.250> that<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.490> camera<00:04:51.940> is<00:04:52.180> going<00:04:52.480> to

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
you can see that the camera is going to

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.200 
you can see that the camera is going to
pass<00:04:52.780> over<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.500> three<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.550> this<00:04:54.820> is<00:04:55.030> our

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
pass over to three and this is our

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.480 
pass over to three and this is our
protein<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.200> we<00:04:56.290> just<00:04:56.470> spread<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.650> on<00:04:56.830> with

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
protein that we just spread it on with

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.909 
protein that we just spread it on with
the<00:04:57.610> yellow<00:04:57.850> crystals<00:04:58.270> on<00:04:58.390> top<00:04:58.919> there

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
the yellow crystals on top there

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.310 
the yellow crystals on top there
look-alike<00:05:00.640> molds<00:05:01.180> so<00:05:01.419> they<00:05:01.540> must<00:05:01.810> carry<00:05:02.169> it

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
look-alike molds so they must carry it

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.740 
look-alike molds so they must carry it
around<00:05:02.440> like<00:05:02.830> seen<00:05:03.400> see<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:04.030> lasers<00:05:04.419> hitting

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
around like seen see the lasers hitting

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.650 
around like seen see the lasers hitting
the<00:05:04.870> protein<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:05.640> it's<00:05:06.640> giving<00:05:06.940> us<00:05:07.090> this

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
the protein and it's giving us this

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.780 
the protein and it's giving us this
spectrum<00:05:08.200> that's<00:05:08.500> been<00:05:08.740> collected<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.550> light

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
spectrum that's been collected the light

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.780 
spectrum that's been collected the light
blue<00:05:10.030> light<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:10.450> top<00:05:10.660> that's<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.530> sum<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:12.190> all

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
blue light on top that's the sum of all

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.610 
blue light on top that's the sum of all
the<00:05:13.120> fingerprints<00:05:13.630> that's<00:05:13.870> collecting<00:05:14.410> and

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
the fingerprints that's collecting and

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.200 
the fingerprints that's collecting and
then<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.070> little<00:05:15.340> one<00:05:15.490> on<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:15.700> bottom<00:05:15.910> that's

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
then the little one on the bottom that's

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.170 
then the little one on the bottom that's
moving<00:05:16.480> that's<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.260> current<00:05:17.800> tip<00:05:18.340> every<00:05:19.000> time

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
moving that's the current tip every time

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.230 
moving that's the current tip every time
it<00:05:19.300> hits<00:05:19.510> it's<00:05:19.870> gathering<00:05:20.140> 50<00:05:21.010> good<00:05:21.490> spectra

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
it hits it's gathering 50 good spectra

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.120 
it hits it's gathering 50 good spectra
and<00:05:22.600> it's<00:05:23.020> gonna<00:05:23.140> add<00:05:23.350> itself<00:05:23.770> up<00:05:23.919> to<00:05:24.100> a

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
and it's gonna add itself up to a

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.550 
and it's gonna add itself up to a
thousand<00:05:24.910> good<00:05:25.120> fingerprints<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.110> then<00:05:26.320> I'll

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
thousand good fingerprints and then I'll

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.190 
thousand good fingerprints and then I'll
move<00:05:26.770> on<00:05:26.919> to<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.070> next<00:05:27.250> spot<00:05:27.840> we<00:05:28.840> run<00:05:29.080> it

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
move on to the next spot we run it

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.290 
move on to the next spot we run it
against<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.560> entire<00:05:29.860> database<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.730> and<00:05:31.030> the

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
against the entire database so and the

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.330 
against the entire database so and the
mold<00:05:31.480> one<00:05:31.690> is<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.900> one<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.110> I<00:05:32.169> developed<00:05:32.680> and

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
mold one is the one that I developed and

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.700 
mold one is the one that I developed and
then<00:05:33.669> we're<00:05:33.970> gonna<00:05:34.270> highlight<00:05:34.930> these<00:05:35.410> guys

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
then we're gonna highlight these guys

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.370 
then we're gonna highlight these guys
and<00:05:36.100> hit<00:05:36.220> play<00:05:36.870> hopefully<00:05:37.870> you'll<00:05:38.050> give<00:05:38.229> us<00:05:38.350> a

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
and hit play hopefully you'll give us a

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.650 
and hit play hopefully you'll give us a
good<00:05:38.590> idea<00:05:38.890> so<00:05:39.430> here's<00:05:39.669> our<00:05:39.790> results<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:40.450> it's

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
good idea so here's our results and it's

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.469 
good idea so here's our results and it's
listing<00:05:41.320> you<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:41.530> top<00:05:41.740> ten<00:05:42.010> green<00:05:42.790> means<00:05:43.330> it

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
listing you the top ten green means it

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.870 
listing you the top ten green means it
scored<00:05:43.810> greater<00:05:44.140> than<00:05:44.350> 2/3<00:05:45.130> is<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.490> maximum

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
scored greater than 2/3 is the maximum

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.580 
scored greater than 2/3 is the maximum
and<00:05:46.060> then<00:05:46.419> following<00:05:46.870> that<00:05:46.990> we<00:05:47.290> have<00:05:47.440> these

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
and then following that we have these

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.380 
and then following that we have these
guys<00:05:47.950> that<00:05:47.979> are<00:05:48.370> scoring<00:05:48.790> in<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:49.060> yellow

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
guys that are scoring in the yellow

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.210 
guys that are scoring in the yellow
range<00:05:49.660> and<00:05:50.080> they're<00:05:50.380> pretty<00:05:50.830> good<00:05:50.979> but

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
range and they're pretty good but

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.650 
range and they're pretty good but
they're<00:05:51.430> not<00:05:51.550> as<00:05:51.850> good<00:05:52.030> as<00:05:52.150> greater<00:05:52.360> than<00:05:52.419> two

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
they're not as good as greater than two

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.780 
they're not as good as greater than two
and<00:05:52.840> then<00:05:52.960> anything<00:05:53.350> that's<00:05:53.500> red<00:05:53.890> means<00:05:54.640> it

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
and then anything that's red means it

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.300 
and then anything that's red means it
was<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:55.030> poor<00:05:55.450> identification<00:05:56.229> all<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:57.010> green

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
was a poor identification all the green

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.550 
was a poor identification all the green
Peaks<00:05:57.669> here<00:05:58.120> showing<00:05:58.720> you<00:05:58.750> where<00:05:59.169> there's<00:05:59.380> an

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
exact match in the database and so

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.120 
exact match in the database and so
that's<00:06:02.950> how<00:06:03.070> we<00:06:03.130> do<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.700> don't

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
that's how we do I don't

people as you can

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.660 
people as you can
the<00:06:53.060> field<00:06:53.390> is<00:06:53.800> never-ending<00:06:54.800> like<00:06:55.490> it's

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
the field is never-ending like it's

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.730 
the field is never-ending like it's
always<00:06:55.910> always<00:06:56.390> evolving<00:06:56.870> we're<00:06:57.110> developing

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
always always evolving we're developing

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.370 
always always evolving we're developing
new<00:06:58.030> technologies<00:06:59.030> to<00:06:59.060> combat<00:06:59.660> these<00:06:59.840> caesars

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
new technologies to combat these caesars

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.010 
new technologies to combat these caesars
but<00:07:00.710> I<00:07:00.920> think<00:07:01.160> there<00:07:01.280> are<00:07:01.370> always<00:07:01.990> room<00:07:02.990> to

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
but I think there are always room to

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:18.930 
but I think there are always room to
grow

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.000
