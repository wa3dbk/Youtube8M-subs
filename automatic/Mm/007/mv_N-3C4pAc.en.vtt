right how about these dice that got rock
paper<00:00:09.790> and<00:00:09.940> scissors<00:00:10.300> all<00:00:10.780> over<00:00:11.110> them<00:00:11.260> so

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
paper and scissors all over them so

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.859 
let's just do two throat so i only got
two<00:00:13.120> dice<00:00:14.730> i<00:00:15.730> think<00:00:16.269> which<00:00:16.420> one<00:00:16.449> you<00:00:16.689> want

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869

first first I got a paper and second I
got<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.480> rock<00:00:19.779> about<00:00:20.289> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.160 

our<00:00:33.250> everybody<00:00:33.820> got<00:00:34.060> a<00:00:34.090> couple<00:00:34.360> let's<00:00:34.780> versa

mud<00:00:35.650> Kwazii<00:00:35.950> here<00:00:36.280> I've<00:00:36.850> got<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.030> CB<00:00:37.300> task<00:00:37.690> and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
mud Kwazii here I've got a CB task and

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.860 
mud Kwazii here I've got a CB task and
at<00:00:38.530> first<00:00:39.070> I<00:00:39.340> thought<00:00:39.670> that<00:00:39.970> he<00:00:40.210> got<00:00:40.360> or<00:00:40.630> he

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
at first I thought that he got or he

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.080 
at first I thought that he got or he
traced<00:00:41.170> speed<00:00:41.680> boost<00:00:41.980> but<00:00:42.280> I<00:00:42.370> wasn't<00:00:42.850> really

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
traced speed boost but I wasn't really

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.360 
traced speed boost but I wasn't really
paying<00:00:43.360> attention<00:00:43.480> well<00:00:43.990> enough<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.560> it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
paying attention well enough and it

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.640 
paying attention well enough and it
totally<00:00:45.700> messed<00:00:46.090> up<00:00:46.240> my<00:00:46.300> line<00:00:46.660> of<00:00:46.810> thought<00:00:47.050> so

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
totally messed up my line of thought so

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.010 
totally messed up my line of thought so
I<00:00:48.010> you<00:00:48.460> turn<00:00:48.700> out<00:00:48.880> to<00:00:48.910> see<00:00:49.300> what<00:00:49.420> it<00:00:49.540> wants<00:00:49.840> to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
I you turn out to see what it wants to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.590 
I you turn out to see what it wants to
be<00:00:50.320> like<00:00:50.559> and<00:00:50.860> I<00:00:51.550> was<00:00:51.670> thinking<00:00:52.030> was<00:00:52.210> probably

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
be like and I was thinking was probably

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.930 
be like and I was thinking was probably
like<00:00:52.980> physically<00:00:53.980> bulky<00:00:54.370> or<00:00:54.400> something<00:00:54.790> but

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
like physically bulky or something but

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.460 
like physically bulky or something but
then<00:00:55.059> I<00:00:55.120> saw<00:00:55.270> how<00:00:55.390> much<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.570> didn't<00:00:56.050> it<00:00:56.170> was<00:00:56.440> a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
then I saw how much it didn't it was a

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.920 
then I saw how much it didn't it was a
ton<00:00:56.950> but<00:00:57.580> at<00:00:57.730> this<00:00:57.940> point<00:00:58.180> my<00:00:58.300> brain<00:00:58.660> was

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
ton but at this point my brain was

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.049 
ton but at this point my brain was
thinking<00:00:59.350> he's<00:01:00.040> going<00:01:00.160> to<00:01:00.250> have<00:01:00.400> speed<00:01:00.760> boost

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
thinking he's going to have speed boost

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.330 
thinking he's going to have speed boost
so<00:01:01.660> who<00:01:01.809> do<00:01:01.930> I<00:01:01.989> care<00:01:02.260> about<00:01:02.350> least<00:01:02.770> I<00:01:03.040> have<00:01:03.190> to

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
so who do I care about least I have to

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.369 
so who do I care about least I have to
hope<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:03.520> ninjask<00:01:04.180> can<00:01:04.750> come<00:01:04.960> back<00:01:05.140> in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
hope that ninjask can come back in

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.200 
hope that ninjask can come back in
before<00:01:05.620> he<00:01:05.860> gets<00:01:06.010> too<00:01:06.250> many<00:01:06.460> boosts<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.030> then

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
before he gets too many boosts and then

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.630 
before he gets too many boosts and then
kill<00:01:07.450> him<00:01:07.480> otherwise<00:01:08.320> with<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.100> charge<00:01:09.370> beam

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
kill him otherwise with the charge beam

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.130 
kill him otherwise with the charge beam
he's<00:01:09.880> going<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.150> completely<00:01:10.690> wrecked<00:01:10.990> my

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
he's going to completely wrecked my

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.750 
he's going to completely wrecked my
whole<00:01:11.170> team<00:01:11.530> because<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.830> did<00:01:12.010> not<00:01:12.040> like<00:01:12.520> my

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
whole team because I did not like my

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.320 
whole team because I did not like my
team<00:01:13.030> that<00:01:13.659> I<00:01:13.810> got<00:01:13.990> whatsoever<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:15.250> I'm<00:01:16.090> just

thinking man what should what am I

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.770 
thinking man what should what am I
supposed<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.130> do<00:01:18.400> he's<00:01:18.970> probably<00:01:19.180> gonna<00:01:19.420> whoa

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
supposed to do he's probably gonna whoa

wait<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.230> minute<00:01:20.440> I'm<00:01:20.590> faster<00:01:21.250> I<00:01:21.430> went<00:01:21.940> 40<00:01:22.240> wave

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
wait a minute I'm faster I went 40 wave

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.870 
wait a minute I'm faster I went 40 wave
just<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:22.840> case<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.470> survived<00:01:24.010> or<00:01:24.400> if<00:01:24.490> he<00:01:24.610> missed

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
just in case I survived or if he missed

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.990 
just in case I survived or if he missed
or<00:01:25.120> something<00:01:25.450> like<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:26.700> turns<00:01:27.700> out<00:01:27.850> i'm

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
just an idiot and it wasn't speed boost

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.420 
just an idiot and it wasn't speed boost
it<00:01:29.950> was<00:01:30.040> a<00:01:30.070> download<00:01:30.729> boost<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.180> he<00:01:31.330> got<00:01:31.510> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it was a download boost that he got and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.680 
it was a download boost that he got and
getting<00:01:33.430> a<00:01:33.490> pair<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.790> hacks<00:01:33.970> right<00:01:34.180> there<00:01:34.360> safe

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
getting a pair of hacks right there safe

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.240 
getting a pair of hacks right there safe
is<00:01:34.870> my<00:01:34.990> told<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> kiss<00:01:35.560> from<00:01:35.710> death<00:01:36.009> which

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
is my told you a kiss from death which

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.429 
is my told you a kiss from death which
was<00:01:36.399> really<00:01:36.640> sweet<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.509> he<00:01:38.020> brings<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.350> a

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
was really sweet so he brings in a

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.859 
was really sweet so he brings in a
rhyperior<00:01:38.829> he<00:01:39.340> apparently<00:01:40.149> didn't<00:01:40.509> know<00:01:40.630> or

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
rhyperior he apparently didn't know or

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.929 
rhyperior he apparently didn't know or
didn't<00:01:41.140> expect<00:01:41.740> grass<00:01:42.040> not<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.460> any<00:01:42.670> way<00:01:42.790> shape

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
didn't expect grass not in any way shape

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.749 
didn't expect grass not in any way shape
or<00:01:43.360> form<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:44.290> i<00:01:44.350> get<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> free<00:01:44.979> kill<00:01:45.310> with<00:01:45.549> that

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
or form so i get a free kill with that

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.609 
or form so i get a free kill with that
which<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:45.969> amazing<00:01:46.090> because<00:01:46.719> rhyperior<00:01:47.259> is<00:01:47.590> a

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
which is amazing because rhyperior is a

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.819 
which is amazing because rhyperior is a
beast<00:01:48.159> got<00:01:49.149> he'll<00:01:49.329> wreck<00:01:49.659> some<00:01:49.899> fools<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:50.740> in

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
beast got he'll wreck some fools so in

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.170 
beast got he'll wreck some fools so in
comes<00:01:50.950> he<00:01:51.189> trained<00:01:51.460> I'm<00:01:51.579> thinking<00:01:51.880> well<00:01:52.030> I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
comes he trained I'm thinking well I

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.999 
comes he trained I'm thinking well I
might<00:01:52.450> be<00:01:52.659> able<00:01:52.719> to<00:01:52.899> welcome<00:01:53.079> I<00:01:53.469> guess<00:01:53.860> it

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
might be able to welcome I guess it

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.560 
might be able to welcome I guess it
doesn't<00:01:54.310> matter<00:01:54.340> if<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.789> can<00:01:54.969> survive<00:01:55.119> or<00:01:55.539> not

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
doesn't matter if I can survive or not

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.389 
doesn't matter if I can survive or not
so<00:01:55.869> told<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.229> kids<00:01:56.439> just<00:01:56.500> effectively<00:01:57.189> took

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
so told you kids just effectively took

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.330 
so told you kids just effectively took
out<00:01:57.780> three<00:01:58.780> different<00:01:59.170> pokes<00:01:59.409> all<00:01:59.950> of<00:02:00.250> them

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
out three different pokes all of them

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.740 
out three different pokes all of them
very<00:02:00.579> threatening<00:02:01.060> or<00:02:01.270> at<00:02:01.329> least<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:01.600> thought

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
very threatening or at least I thought

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.480 
very threatening or at least I thought
they<00:02:01.930> were<00:02:02.049> threatening<00:02:02.439> at<00:02:02.560> first<00:02:02.799> because<00:02:03.310> I

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
they were threatening at first because I

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.660 
they were threatening at first because I
made<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.670> mental<00:02:03.880> mistake<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:06.310> we're<00:02:06.460> kind

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
made a mental mistake and now we're kind

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.940 
made a mental mistake and now we're kind
of<00:02:06.729> back<00:02:06.820> at<00:02:07.030> square<00:02:07.180> one<00:02:07.299> um<00:02:07.719> I<00:02:08.380> do<00:02:08.619> have<00:02:08.740> a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
of back at square one um I do have a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.830 
of back at square one um I do have a
smear<00:02:09.220> go<00:02:09.399> with<00:02:09.580> belly<00:02:09.820> drum<00:02:10.090> pass<00:02:10.390> but<00:02:10.780> i

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
smear go with belly drum pass but i

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.390 
smear go with belly drum pass but i
don't<00:02:11.170> know<00:02:11.350> i<00:02:11.530> don't<00:02:11.680> want<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:11.980> bring<00:02:12.130> him<00:02:12.250> out

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
don't know i don't want to bring him out

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.250 
don't know i don't want to bring him out
just<00:02:12.910> yet<00:02:13.210> because<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.540> wanted<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:13.990> against

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
just yet because I wanted to be against

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.590 
just yet because I wanted to be against
something<00:02:14.440> slower<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.490> go<00:02:15.940> back<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.120> my<00:02:16.270> lead

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
something slower so I go back to my lead

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.910 
something slower so I go back to my lead
because<00:02:16.870> that's<00:02:17.050> pretty<00:02:17.170> much<00:02:17.320> what<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.620> do

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
because that's pretty much what you do

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.650 
because that's pretty much what you do
even<00:02:18.550> though<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:18.850> nothing<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.420> turn

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
even though I have nothing to you turn

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.650 
even though I have nothing to you turn
off<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.200> UM<00:02:20.640> however<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:21.940> an<00:02:22.060> advantage<00:02:22.360> for

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
off to UM however it is an advantage for

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.630 
off to UM however it is an advantage for
me<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> do<00:02:23.050> in<00:02:23.260> fact<00:02:23.320> put<00:02:23.740> out<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> u-turn<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
me so I do in fact put out a u-turn and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.210 
me so I do in fact put out a u-turn and
it<00:02:25.450> works<00:02:25.660> out<00:02:25.780> great<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.350> my<00:02:26.500> advantage<00:02:26.740> so

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
it works out great to my advantage so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.850 
it works out great to my advantage so
now<00:02:27.910> it's<00:02:28.300> just<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.510> question<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.170> know<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.560> lot

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
now it's just a question of I know a lot

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.470 
now it's just a question of I know a lot
of<00:02:29.890> people<00:02:30.010> put<00:02:30.460> this<00:02:30.610> guy<00:02:30.820> with<00:02:31.000> tons<00:02:31.330> of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
of people put this guy with tons of

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.510 
of people put this guy with tons of
speeds<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:32.050> don't<00:02:32.380> know<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:32.770> smeargle<00:02:33.190> is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
speeds so I don't know if smeargle is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.180 
speeds so I don't know if smeargle is
going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.030> be<00:02:34.120> faster<00:02:34.600> or<00:02:34.630> not<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.590> end<00:02:36.040> up

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
going to be faster or not so I end up

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.310 
going to be faster or not so I end up
not<00:02:36.460> wanting<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.880> risk<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.960> decide<00:02:38.290> to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
not wanting to risk it and I decide to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.309 
not wanting to risk it and I decide to
go<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.590> yanmega<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.060> can<00:02:40.269> judge<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.230> know

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
go to yanmega so I can judge you know

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.600 
go to yanmega so I can judge you know
see<00:02:41.530> how<00:02:41.560> fast<00:02:41.950> he<00:02:42.159> is

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
see how fast he is

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.580 
see how fast he is
see<00:02:43.540> how<00:02:43.600> much<00:02:43.750> he<00:02:43.840> wants<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.110> take<00:02:44.260> from<00:02:44.440> an

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
see how much he wants to take from an

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.770 
see how much he wants to take from an
air<00:02:44.710> /<00:02:45.070> maybe<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.490> can<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.700> 28<00:02:46.090> KO<00:02:46.330> if<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.600> get<00:02:46.750> a

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
air / maybe I can just 28 KO if I get a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.650 
air / maybe I can just 28 KO if I get a
flinch<00:02:47.170> um<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:49.120> I'm<00:02:49.210> just<00:02:49.300> thinking

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
flinch um and then I'm just thinking

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.660 
flinch um and then I'm just thinking
what<00:02:50.500> else<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.770> can<00:02:50.920> do<00:02:51.010> after<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.400> if<00:02:51.490> things

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
what else I can do after that if things

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.530 
what else I can do after that if things
go<00:02:51.940> wrong<00:02:52.210> so<00:02:52.990> anchors<00:02:53.740> my<00:02:53.860> yanmega<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:55.030> thought

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
go wrong so anchors my yanmega I thought

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.390 
go wrong so anchors my yanmega I thought
about<00:02:55.690> hypnosis<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.290> again<00:02:56.800> smeargle<00:02:57.190> is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
about hypnosis but again smeargle is

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.550 
about hypnosis but again smeargle is
going<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.640> have<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.210> unfortunately

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
going to have that and unfortunately

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.660 
going to have that and unfortunately
Nintendo<00:02:59.560> doesn't<00:02:59.890> want<00:03:00.070> us<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.310> find<00:03:00.340> out

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
Nintendo doesn't want us to find out

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.970 
Nintendo doesn't want us to find out
what<00:03:00.820> happens<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:01.510> he<00:03:02.170> said<00:03:02.380> his<00:03:02.530> last<00:03:02.710> guy<00:03:02.950> was

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
what happens so he said his last guy was

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.760 
what happens so he said his last guy was
also<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> chatot<00:03:04.300> or<00:03:04.570> she<00:03:04.780> taught<00:03:04.990> that<00:03:05.470> little

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
also a chatot or she taught that little

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.620 
also a chatot or she taught that little
nu<00:03:06.070> bird<00:03:06.340> thing<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:06.940> he<00:03:07.120> pretty<00:03:07.270> much<00:03:07.390> admitted

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
nu bird thing so he pretty much admitted

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.840 
nu bird thing so he pretty much admitted
that<00:03:07.990> I<00:03:08.050> had<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.440> one<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.860> bag<00:03:09.040> my

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
that I had that one in the bag my

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.550 
that I had that one in the bag my
smeargle<00:03:10.120> was<00:03:10.390> faster<00:03:10.750> than<00:03:10.780> his<00:03:10.959> gliscor<00:03:11.380> so

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
smeargle was faster than his gliscor so

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.530 
smeargle was faster than his gliscor so
eventually<00:03:11.830> I'd<00:03:12.130> set<00:03:12.370> up<00:03:12.490> belly<00:03:13.120> drum<00:03:13.330> if<00:03:13.480> I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
eventually I'd set up belly drum if I

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.120 
eventually I'd set up belly drum if I
didn't<00:03:13.780> kill<00:03:13.959> him<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:14.260> we<00:03:14.740> decide<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:14.980> have

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
didn't kill him so we decide to have

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.270 
didn't kill him so we decide to have
another<00:03:15.160> rule<00:03:15.520> at<00:03:15.700> new<00:03:16.090> pokes<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.680> I've<00:03:17.680> got<00:03:18.250> a

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
another rule at new pokes and I've got a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.910 
another rule at new pokes and I've got a
little<00:03:18.670> bit<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:18.940> an<00:03:19.420> advantage<00:03:19.660> here<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.140> think

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
little bit of an advantage here I think

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.190 
little bit of an advantage here I think
um<00:03:21.310> if<00:03:22.000> we<00:03:22.150> both<00:03:22.300> earthquake<00:03:22.840> each<00:03:22.989> other

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
um if we both earthquake each other

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.620 
um if we both earthquake each other
we'll<00:03:23.440> both<00:03:23.620> he'll<00:03:24.280> probably<00:03:24.610> survive<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.540> I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
we'll both he'll probably survive and I

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.540 
we'll both he'll probably survive and I
won't<00:03:26.020> at<00:03:26.500> least<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.739> don't<00:03:26.830> think<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.160> would<00:03:27.370> so

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
won't at least I don't think I would so

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.820 
won't at least I don't think I would so
I<00:03:27.640> switch<00:03:27.910> out<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.360> go<00:03:29.020> figure<00:03:29.320> he<00:03:29.620> got

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
I switch out and go figure he got

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.729 
I switch out and go figure he got
psychic<00:03:30.310> metagross<00:03:30.790> which<00:03:31.709> something<00:03:32.709> I

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
psychic metagross which something I

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.820 
psychic metagross which something I
should<00:03:33.190> be<00:03:33.220> familiar<00:03:33.430> with<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.620> don't<00:03:35.620> see

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
should be familiar with so I don't see

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.590 
should be familiar with so I don't see
an<00:03:35.920> item<00:03:36.160> though<00:03:36.520> so<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.030> don't<00:03:37.090> know<00:03:37.330> if<00:03:37.360> it's

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
an item though so I don't know if it's

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.840 
an item though so I don't know if it's
carved<00:03:37.989> or<00:03:38.530> lefties<00:03:39.070> or<00:03:39.100> what<00:03:39.550> because<00:03:39.700> I

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
carved or lefties or what because I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.449 
carved or lefties or what because I
haven't<00:03:40.060> heard<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.570> yet<00:03:40.600> so<00:03:41.470> at<00:03:41.950> this<00:03:42.130> point

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
haven't heard it yet so at this point

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.979 
haven't heard it yet so at this point
I'm<00:03:42.640> predicting<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:43.330> probably<00:03:43.750> going<00:03:43.900> to

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
I'm predicting it's probably going to

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.960 
I'm predicting it's probably going to
have<00:03:44.110> hidden<00:03:44.350> power<00:03:44.590> fire<00:03:44.950> unless<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.610> scarf

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
have hidden power fire unless it's scarf

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.310 
have hidden power fire unless it's scarf
I<00:03:46.270> mean<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.510> still<00:03:46.750> might<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:46.989> hidden<00:03:47.140> power

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
I mean it still might have hidden power

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.460 
I mean it still might have hidden power
fire<00:03:47.620> but<00:03:48.310> uh<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.840> was<00:03:49.840> thinking<00:03:49.900> he's<00:03:50.260> going<00:03:50.380> to

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
fire but uh I was thinking he's going to

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.900 
fire but uh I was thinking he's going to
switch<00:03:50.650> move<00:03:50.830> as<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:50.950> hidden<00:03:51.160> power<00:03:51.310> fire<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:51.820> I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
switch move as a hidden power fire so I

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.330 
switch move as a hidden power fire so I
just<00:03:52.120> switched<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:53.010> unfortunately<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.220> did

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
just switched and unfortunately so did

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.520 
just switched and unfortunately so did
he<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:55.330> fact<00:03:55.600> that<00:03:55.690> he<00:03:55.780> brings<00:03:56.080> in<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.290> luxe

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
he the fact that he brings in a luxe

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.199 
he the fact that he brings in a luxe
right<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:56.980> fortress<00:03:57.580> makes<00:03:57.820> me<00:03:57.970> think<00:03:58.150> that

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
right to a fortress makes me think that

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.810 
right to a fortress makes me think that
it's<00:03:58.360> going<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.510> be<00:03:58.630> specially<00:03:59.200> based<00:03:59.440> on<00:03:59.820> but

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
it's going to be specially based on but

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.400 
it's going to be specially based on but
I<00:04:00.880> don't<00:04:00.910> have<00:04:01.209> anything<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.600> hurt<00:04:01.959> this<00:04:02.170> with

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
I don't have anything to hurt this with

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.560 
I don't have anything to hurt this with
right<00:04:02.680> here<00:04:03.070> so<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.730> go<00:04:04.090> with<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.239> willow<00:04:04.480> wisp

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489

I've seen iron head so now I know that a
willow<00:04:40.180> wisp<00:04:40.270> is<00:04:40.600> going<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.810> be<00:04:40.900> good<00:04:41.080> against

willow wisp is going to be good against
it<00:04:41.650> which<00:04:42.070> at<00:04:42.220> first<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.580> didn't<00:04:42.790> think<00:04:42.820> it

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
it which at first I didn't think it

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.520 
it which at first I didn't think it
would<00:04:43.210> because<00:04:43.450> he<00:04:43.570> switched<00:04:43.900> when<00:04:44.140> I<00:04:44.200> tried

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
would because he switched when I tried

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.320 
would because he switched when I tried
to<00:04:44.560> willow<00:04:44.860> wisp<00:04:45.100> into<00:04:45.460> a<00:04:45.490> physical<00:04:45.760> attacker

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
to willow wisp into a physical attacker

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.990 
to willow wisp into a physical attacker
so<00:04:47.020> that's<00:04:47.140> why<00:04:47.290> i<00:04:47.320> subbed<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:48.040> get<00:04:48.850> some

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
so that's why i subbed to get some

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.490 
so that's why i subbed to get some
little<00:04:49.180> scouting<00:04:49.450> see<00:04:49.750> what<00:04:49.870> he<00:04:49.930> wanted<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.229> do

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
little scouting see what he wanted to do

little scouting see what he wanted to do
and<00:04:50.800> now<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.700> get<00:04:51.820> this<00:04:52.030> thing<00:04:52.240> burned<00:04:52.479> and<00:04:52.979> it

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
and now I get this thing burned and it

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.500 
and now I get this thing burned and it
looks<00:04:54.190> like<00:04:54.280> body<00:04:54.640> slam<00:04:55.000> is<00:04:55.270> due

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
looks like body slam is due

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.480

about<00:04:55.780> four<00:04:56.110> or<00:04:56.140> five<00:04:56.290> points<00:04:56.950> more<00:04:57.160> than<00:04:57.220> what

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
about four or five points more than what

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.610 
about four or five points more than what
my<00:04:57.610> substitute<00:04:58.210> can<00:04:58.420> make<00:04:58.600> so<00:04:59.200> I<00:04:59.230> don't<00:04:59.470> want

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
my substitute can make so I don't want

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.440 
my substitute can make so I don't want
to<00:04:59.710> risk<00:04:59.830> it<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.310> switch<00:05:00.850> out<00:05:01.060> because<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.390> know

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
to risk it I switch out because I know

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.850 
to risk it I switch out because I know
this<00:05:01.630> guy's<00:05:01.840> got<00:05:01.990> more<00:05:02.050> defense<00:05:02.560> and

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
this guy's got more defense and

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.160 
this guy's got more defense and
substitute<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:03.670> he'll<00:05:03.820> be<00:05:03.850> safe<00:05:04.240> but<00:05:05.020> of

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
substitute so he'll be safe but of

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.600 
substitute so he'll be safe but of
course<00:05:05.410> he<00:05:05.710> doesn't<00:05:05.890> do<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.190> same<00:05:06.400> thing

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
course he doesn't do the same thing

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.130 
course he doesn't do the same thing
again<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:07.120> he<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.480> turns<00:05:07.750> out<00:05:07.960> it's<00:05:08.110> just

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
again and he you turns out it's just

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.890 
again and he you turns out it's just
like<00:05:08.350> come<00:05:08.560> on<00:05:08.590> man<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:09.340> can't<00:05:09.910> get<00:05:10.090> any<00:05:10.300> ground

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900

like come on man I can't get any ground
covered<00:05:11.320> whatsoever<00:05:11.860> so<00:05:12.840> here<00:05:13.840> I'm<00:05:14.740> hoping

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
covered whatsoever so here I'm hoping

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.490 
covered whatsoever so here I'm hoping
that<00:05:15.160> he's<00:05:15.370> not<00:05:15.400> scarfed<00:05:16.000> I'm<00:05:16.360> hope<00:05:17.020> I'm

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
that he's not scarfed I'm hope I'm

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.380 
that he's not scarfed I'm hope I'm
thinking<00:05:17.950> in<00:05:18.250> my<00:05:18.280> head<00:05:18.370> he'll<00:05:18.730> probably<00:05:19.090> do

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
thinking in my head he'll probably do

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.380 
thinking in my head he'll probably do
explosion<00:05:19.990> because<00:05:20.890> uh<00:05:20.920> I<00:05:21.550> don't<00:05:22.000> know<00:05:22.120> that's

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
explosion because uh I don't know that's

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.490 
explosion because uh I don't know that's
just<00:05:22.510> what<00:05:22.630> I'm<00:05:22.720> thinking<00:05:23.020> because<00:05:23.200> rake<00:05:23.350> who

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
just what I'm thinking because rake who

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.010 
just what I'm thinking because rake who
is<00:05:23.560> kind<00:05:23.740> of<00:05:23.830> annoying<00:05:24.070> um<00:05:24.490> I<00:05:25.210> know<00:05:25.480> teeple

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
isn't going to one hit KO unless I get a

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.610 
isn't going to one hit KO unless I get a
crit<00:05:28.030> so<00:05:28.600> I'm<00:05:28.660> just<00:05:28.810> thinking<00:05:29.110> of<00:05:29.230> what<00:05:29.410> can<00:05:29.560> I

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
crit so I'm just thinking of what can I

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.620 
crit so I'm just thinking of what can I
go<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.860> do<00:05:30.160> I<00:05:30.190> want<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.490> go<00:05:30.550> back<00:05:30.790> to<00:05:30.820> mismagius

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.490 
go to do I want to go back to mismagius
and<00:05:32.400> just<00:05:33.400> sacrifice<00:05:33.970> it<00:05:34.210> pretty<00:05:34.450> much<00:05:34.660> I

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
and just sacrifice it pretty much I

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500 
and just sacrifice it pretty much I
still<00:05:36.010> desperately<00:05:36.520> want<00:05:36.730> fortress<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.390> get

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
still desperately want fortress to get

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.210 
still desperately want fortress to get
in<00:05:37.630> there<00:05:37.780> get<00:05:37.960> up<00:05:38.020> some<00:05:38.260> toxic<00:05:38.650> spikes<00:05:38.920> get<00:05:39.130> up

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
in there get up some toxic spikes get up

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.850 
in there get up some toxic spikes get up
a<00:05:39.310> stealth<00:05:39.580> rock<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.180> it's<00:05:41.170> half<00:05:41.380> dead<00:05:41.680> now<00:05:41.830> so

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
a stealth rock and it's half dead now so

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.410 
a stealth rock and it's half dead now so
I'm<00:05:42.190> probably<00:05:42.370> not<00:05:42.640> gonna<00:05:42.790> be<00:05:42.850> able<00:05:42.940> to<00:05:43.060> do<00:05:43.210> all

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
I'm probably not gonna be able to do all

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.240 
I'm probably not gonna be able to do all
of<00:05:43.450> that<00:05:43.600> so<00:05:43.990> I<00:05:44.020> set<00:05:44.380> up<00:05:44.410> a<00:05:44.530> sub<00:05:44.710> just<00:05:44.890> in<00:05:45.070> case

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
of that so I set up a sub just in case

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.550 
of that so I set up a sub just in case
the<00:05:46.210> ends<00:05:46.420> up<00:05:46.480> not<00:05:46.600> being<00:05:46.660> scarf<00:05:47.200> he<00:05:47.350> ends<00:05:47.470> up

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
the ends up not being scarf he ends up

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.700 
the ends up not being scarf he ends up
being<00:05:47.740> specs<00:05:48.160> so<00:05:49.140> well<00:05:50.140> that<00:05:50.320> changes<00:05:50.470> my

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
being specs so well that changes my

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.440 
being specs so well that changes my
thought<00:05:50.920> process<00:05:51.310> a<00:05:51.400> little<00:05:51.550> bit<00:05:51.700> at<00:05:52.270> this

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
thought process a little bit at this

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.780 
thought process a little bit at this
point<00:05:52.630> i<00:05:52.780> switch<00:05:53.050> bout<00:05:53.350> to<00:05:53.650> an<00:05:53.980> Espeon<00:05:54.520> because

point i switch bout to an Espeon because

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.250 
point i switch bout to an Espeon because
