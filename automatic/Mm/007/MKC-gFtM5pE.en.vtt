00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you can see changes to the face etc that

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.569 
you can see changes to the face etc that
reflect<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.110> now<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:35.309> being

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
reflect that this is here now that being

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.840 
reflect that this is here now that being
true<00:00:35.880> that's<00:00:36.270> great<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.930> don't<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.200> any

true that's great but we don't have any
levels<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> detail<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> rest<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.680> I'm

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
levels of detail for the rest so I'm

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
levels of detail for the rest so I'm
gonna<00:00:40.890> grab<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.100> decimator<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.450> don't

come over here select Road
focus<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.700> them<00:01:12.530> now<00:01:13.530> remember<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.070> we're

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
focus on them now remember what we're

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
focus on them now remember what we're
trying<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.940> get<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.240> minimum<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.720> can

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
trying to do is get the minimum we can

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.130 
trying to do is get the minimum we can
get<00:01:16.140> without<00:01:16.530> losing<00:01:17.570> necessary<00:01:18.570> detail<00:01:18.870> so

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
get without losing necessary detail so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.400 
get without losing necessary detail so
I'm<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.680> start<00:01:19.890> cranking<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.370> down

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
I'm just going to start cranking it down

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.170 
I'm just going to start cranking it down
cranking<00:01:22.410> it<00:01:22.530> down<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.729> fifteen

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
cranking it down there we go fifteen

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.870 
cranking it down there we go fifteen
hundred<00:01:24.330> Polly's<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.310> could<00:01:26.310> probably<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
hundred Polly's I could probably go a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.250 
hundred Polly's I could probably go a
little<00:01:27.060> bit<00:01:27.240> lower<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:28.020> serve

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
little bit lower but this will serve

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.120 
little bit lower but this will serve
then<00:01:29.009> I'm<00:01:29.220> gonna<00:01:29.369> go<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> top<00:01:30.350> slide<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
then I'm gonna go to the top slide up so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.270 
then I'm gonna go to the top slide up so
I<00:01:32.160> can<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.580> it<00:01:33.140> top

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I can see it top

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
I can see it top
and<00:01:35.910> again<00:01:36.210> pull<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.200> down<00:01:37.440> now<00:01:37.620> this<00:01:37.770> one

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and again pull it down now this one

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.780 
and again pull it down now this one
could<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.190> tricky<00:01:38.550> because<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.940> those<00:01:39.090> strings

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
could be tricky because of those strings

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.610 
could be tricky because of those strings
not<00:01:41.790> necessarily<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.690> best<00:01:42.900> choice<00:01:43.230> but

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
not necessarily the best choice but

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.320 
not necessarily the best choice but
it'll<00:01:43.800> work<00:01:45.200> there<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.030> 3,000<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.180> I

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
it'll work there we go but 3,000 and I

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.990 
it'll work there we go but 3,000 and I
can<00:01:48.660> live<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
can live with that

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.390 
can live with that
then<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.300> go<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.660> legging<00:01:52.130> down<00:01:53.130> real

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
then we go to the legging down real

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.660 
then we go to the legging down real
quick<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:54.860> they're<00:01:55.860> very<00:01:55.890> simple<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.490> should

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
quick here they're very simple I should

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.899 
quick here they're very simple I should
get<00:01:56.820> way<00:01:57.810> down<00:01:58.110> here

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.200 

so<00:02:01.540> you<00:02:01.600> notice<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:01.990> get<00:02:02.049> those<00:02:02.320> peek<00:02:02.530> throughs

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so you notice I get those peek throughs

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.109 
so you notice I get those peek throughs
slide<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.360> up<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.659> all<00:02:04.840> those<00:02:05.020> go<00:02:05.320> away<00:02:06.119> there

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
slide it up to all those go away there

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:21.780 
slide it up to all those go away there
we<00:02:07.240> go<00:02:16.800> thumbs<00:02:17.800> down<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:20.349> like<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.430> turn<00:02:21.580> what

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
we go thumbs down I like to turn what

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.100 
we go thumbs down I like to turn what
boots<00:02:22.120> turn<00:02:22.300> them<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.510> side<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.870> gives<00:02:23.019> you

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
boots turn them to the side it gives you

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.559 
boots turn them to the side it gives you
better<00:02:23.319> for<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:24.340> let's<00:02:25.060> crank<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.420> way

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
better for you so let's crank it way

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.380 
better for you so let's crank it way
down<00:02:25.810> here<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> range

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.600 

they're<00:02:30.260> holding<00:02:30.380> up<00:02:30.590> pretty<00:02:30.710> nice<00:02:31.720> too

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.580 

yeah<00:02:37.610> there's<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.150> nice<00:02:38.330> compromise<00:02:38.750> as<00:02:39.200> far<00:02:39.440> as

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
yeah there's a nice compromise as far as

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.830 
yeah there's a nice compromise as far as
quality<00:02:40.010> goes<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.760> still<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.150> decent

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.570 

you'll<00:02:44.840> notice<00:02:45.020> we're<00:02:45.260> down<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.590> 7800<00:02:46.370> I'm

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
you'll notice we're down to 7800 I'm

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.309 
you'll notice we're down to 7800 I'm
gonna<00:02:46.790> create<00:02:47.060> an<00:02:47.180> LOD<00:02:47.599> for<00:02:47.840> my<00:02:47.930> outfit

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
gonna create an LOD for my outfit

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.620 
gonna create an LOD for my outfit

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
you take a second to do is look at your

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.140 
you take a second to do is look at your
textures<00:04:12.569> here<00:04:13.459> if<00:04:14.459> there's<00:04:14.640> anything<00:04:14.879> you

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
textures here if there's anything you

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.420 
textures here if there's anything you
can<00:04:15.390> reduce<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.019> texture<00:04:16.380> size<00:04:16.590> on<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:17.250> might

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
can reduce the texture size on you might

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.590 
can reduce the texture size on you might
want<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.609> do<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:17.940> right<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.289> like<00:04:20.280> eyelashes<00:04:20.970> do

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
want to do so right so like eyelashes do

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.850 
want to do so right so like eyelashes do
I<00:04:21.660> really<00:04:21.870> need<00:04:21.959> something<00:04:22.289> that<00:04:22.530> big
