actually bring it into los santos
customs<00:02:39.709> what<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:40.670> need<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.849> do<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.239> basically

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
customs what you need to do is basically

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.360 
customs what you need to do is basically
find<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.470> right<00:02:42.620> police<00:02:42.890> car

so those four police cars there this is

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.089 
so those four police cars there this is
the<00:02:45.079> Interceptor<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:45.739> happen<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:45.980> be

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
the Interceptor that I happen to be

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.949 
the Interceptor that I happen to be
driving<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.909> can't<00:02:47.209> be<00:02:47.359> right<00:02:47.540> after<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
driving you can't be right after the

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.470 
driving you can't be right after the
zero<00:02:48.200> times<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:49.099> address<00:02:49.519> value<00:02:49.760> copy<00:02:50.239> it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
zero times that address value copy it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.059 
zero times that address value copy it
then<00:02:50.659> you're<00:02:51.109> going<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.290> bring<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.620> into<00:02:51.739> cheat

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
then you're going to bring it into cheat

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.580 
then you're going to bring it into cheat
engine<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.639> in<00:02:53.209> cheat<00:02:53.450> engine<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:54.109> paste<00:02:54.379> it

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
engine and in cheat engine you paste it

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.099 
engine and in cheat engine you paste it
into<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.920> hex<00:02:55.159> value<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.599> hex<00:02:56.810> value

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
into the hex value so that hex value

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.199 
into the hex value so that hex value
right<00:02:57.260> there<00:02:57.500> you're<00:02:58.010> going<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.189> copy<00:02:58.400> from

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
right there you're going to copy from

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.390 
right there you're going to copy from
that<00:02:59.870> list<00:03:00.139> that<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.349> give<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.920> paste<00:03:01.220> it

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
into the hex value you're going to hit

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.319 
into the hex value you're going to hit
new<00:03:03.200> scan<00:03:03.470> first<00:03:03.769> skin<00:03:04.069> it'll<00:03:04.609> scan<00:03:04.879> all<00:03:05.060> the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
to do this a little bit cleaner what you

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.159

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
can do is you can find the actual

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.140 
can do is you can find the actual
license<00:03:54.560> plate<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.889> the<00:03:54.949> car<00:03:55.129> and<00:03:55.549> that's<00:03:56.060> a

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
license plate of the car and that's a

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.149 
license plate of the car and that's a
little<00:03:56.329> bit<00:03:56.449> faster<00:03:56.870> sometimes<00:03:57.260> as<00:03:57.440> well<00:03:57.620> so

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
little bit faster sometimes as well so

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.390 
little bit faster sometimes as well so
you<00:03:58.220> don't<00:03:58.489> mess<00:03:58.669> up<00:03:58.900> but<00:03:59.900> this<00:04:00.109> way<00:04:00.349> you<00:04:01.250> can

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
you don't mess up but this way you can

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.280 
you don't mess up but this way you can
change<00:04:01.639> every<00:04:01.970> vehicle<00:04:02.180> or<00:04:02.569> every<00:04:02.810> cop<00:04:03.049> car

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
however since this is a blacklisted

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.309 
however since this is a blacklisted
vehicle<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.449> cannot<00:04:11.840> keep<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.199> in<00:04:12.290> your

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
a bunch of options on there that you

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.920 
a bunch of options on there that you

really don't need sell it for $300

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.390 
really don't need sell it for $300
because<00:04:18.109> this<00:04:18.440> is<00:04:18.560> technically<00:04:18.919> thinking

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400
