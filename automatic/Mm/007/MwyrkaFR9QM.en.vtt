00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
the closest oil that can replicate and

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.229 
the closest oil that can replicate and
be<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.200> most<00:04:19.440> similar<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.580> human<00:04:20.820> oil

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
be the most similar to the human oil

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.940 
be the most similar to the human oil
that<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.630> naturally<00:04:21.900> produce<00:04:22.590> which<00:04:22.830> is

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
that you naturally produce which is

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.640 
that you naturally produce which is
called<00:04:23.190> sebum<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:24.000> this<00:04:24.330> works<00:04:24.630> by<00:04:24.870> balancing

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
called sebum so this works by balancing

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.040 
called sebum so this works by balancing
out<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.040> pH<00:04:26.520> levels<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.180> your<00:04:27.360> skin<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:27.810> it's

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
out the pH levels of your skin so it's

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.780 
out the pH levels of your skin so it's
gonna<00:04:28.200> give<00:04:28.410> you<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.710> extra<00:04:28.890> moisture<00:04:29.340> where
