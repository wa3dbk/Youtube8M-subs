00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
today we're going to adjust the chains

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.970 
today we're going to adjust the chains
there's<00:00:11.219> two<00:00:11.429> chains<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.179> MGK<00:00:12.599> ten<00:00:13.019> also

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
there's two chains in this MGK ten also

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.490 
there's two chains in this MGK ten also
NGK<00:00:14.490> eleven<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.360> will<00:00:15.480> be<00:00:15.599> discussing<00:00:15.960> both<00:00:16.320> of

NGK eleven it will be discussing both of

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.990 
NGK eleven it will be discussing both of
them<00:00:16.619> today

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.500

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
reach up in here this is how your MGK 10

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.780 
reach up in here this is how your MGK 10
looks<00:00:34.079> after<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.739> shroud<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.010> off<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
looks after the shroud is off and the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.940 
looks after the shroud is off and the
wheel<00:00:35.910> assembly<00:00:36.440> what<00:00:37.440> we're<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
wheel assembly what we're going to do is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.500 
wheel assembly what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> check<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.760> tighten<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
we're going to check and tighten the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
we're going to check and tighten the
outer<00:00:39.750> chain<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:41.100> final<00:00:41.579> drive

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
outer chain which is your final drive

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.840 
outer chain which is your final drive
chain<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.530> ours<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.489> actually

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
chain as you can see ours is actually

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.529 
chain as you can see ours is actually
very<00:00:45.690> good<00:00:46.100> but<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.340> needed<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> tighten

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
very good but if you needed to tighten

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.260 
very good but if you needed to tighten
it<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.590> loose<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
it because it was loose this is what you

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.900 
it because it was loose this is what you
do<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:52.079> first<00:00:52.379> locate<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.920> four<00:00:53.280> engine<00:00:53.730> mount

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
do we first locate all four engine mount

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:06.649 
do we first locate all four engine mount
bolts<00:00:54.410> one<00:00:55.670> to<00:01:05.090> where<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> bolts<00:01:06.479> were

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
bolts one to where the bolts were

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.000 
bolts one to where the bolts were
basically<00:01:07.760> loose<00:01:08.760> by<00:01:08.939> feel<00:01:09.650> take<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> motor

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
basically loose by feel take the motor

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.120 
basically loose by feel take the motor
and<00:01:11.880> slide<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> back<00:01:12.799> if<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> notice

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and slide it to the back if you notice

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.039 
and slide it to the back if you notice
the<00:01:14.220> angle<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.509> chain<00:01:15.689> was<00:01:15.840> loose

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the angle here if your chain was loose

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.170 
the angle here if your chain was loose
i've<00:01:16.590> moving<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.130> back<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.850> tighten<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
i've moving this back with tighten the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.660 
i've moving this back with tighten the
chain<00:01:18.409> now<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> do<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.310> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.580> do

is<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.909> sure<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> chain<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> nice<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.930> tight

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
is be sure the chain is nice and tight

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140 
is be sure the chain is nice and tight
and<00:01:22.170> hold<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> motor<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.759> tighten<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and hold the motor as you tighten the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.149 
and hold the motor as you tighten the
first<00:01:24.360> two<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.770> tighten<00:01:26.100> them

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159

first two because as you tighten them
with<00:01:26.400> our<00:01:26.939> rubber<00:01:27.150> mount<00:01:27.390> system<00:01:27.780> right<00:01:27.869> here

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
with our rubber mount system right here

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.370 
with our rubber mount system right here
it<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.890> loosen<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:30.000> tad<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.320> to

slide<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> back<00:01:36.229> next<00:01:37.229> we're<00:01:37.470> gonna<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:37.740> at

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
slide it back next we're gonna look at

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.969 
slide it back next we're gonna look at
the<00:01:38.040> inner<00:01:38.280> chain<00:01:38.750> right<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.799> one

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the inner chain right here this one

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.330 
the inner chain right here this one
seems<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.850> little<00:01:42.150> loose<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:44.250> what
