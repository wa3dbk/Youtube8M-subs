00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
that's because i have 100 anointed

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.630 
that's because i have 100 anointed
crisper<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.840> not<00:02:37.020> 200<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.280> at<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.490> moment

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
crisper and not 200 so at the moment

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
most pets don't attack all the time if

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.750 
most pets don't attack all the time if
you<00:02:43.440> have<00:02:43.560> no<00:02:43.770> charisma<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.550> future

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
next Bell I've just it to happen where

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.850 
next Bell I've just it to happen where
the<00:02:58.790> monsters<00:02:59.180> dead<00:02:59.530> anyway<00:03:00.530> there<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.709> go

the monsters dead anyway there you go

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.140 
the monsters dead anyway there you go
you<00:03:00.950> can<00:03:01.129> see<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.459> put<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.700> state<00:03:01.910> at<00:03:02.030> this

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
you can see it's put the state at this

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.300 
you can see it's put the state at this
effect<00:03:02.510> on<00:03:02.660> me<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.709> you've<00:03:03.830> just<00:03:03.890> got<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.190> go<00:03:04.250> to

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
effect on me so you've just got to go to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.119 
effect on me so you've just got to go to
the<00:03:04.489> next<00:03:04.610> battle<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:06.319> hope<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.920> happens

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
the next battle and hope it happens

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.740 
the next battle and hope it happens
again<00:03:09.129> there<00:03:10.129> is<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:10.489> me<00:03:10.640> or<00:03:11.209> are<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.569> two

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
again there is it just me or are the two

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.240

mini<00:03:11.959> dragons<00:03:12.349> to<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.500> bench<00:03:12.739> quest<00:03:13.040> right

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
mini dragons to the bench quest right

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.120

now<00:03:13.430> it's<00:03:14.269> not<00:03:14.420> dragon<00:03:14.780> fable<00:03:14.959> is<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.530> think

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
now it's not dragon fable is it I think

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.520 
now it's not dragon fable is it I think
this<00:03:16.190> should<00:03:16.310> make<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.519> few<00:03:16.910> more<00:03:17.530> stronger

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
this should make a few more stronger

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.460 
this should make a few more stronger
monsters<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.280> love<00:03:19.430> dragons<00:03:19.670> like<00:03:20.090> the

I've got my 45 step to seven percent
together

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.990 

you

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.020 

the<00:03:44.660> weapon<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.410> lot<00:03:45.740> better<00:03:45.980> than<00:03:46.940> the

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
the weapon is a lot better than the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.750 
the weapon is a lot better than the
Harvey<00:03:47.330> dighi<00:03:47.630> it<00:03:48.260> loses<00:03:48.710> about<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:49.280> damage

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
Harvey dighi it loses about to damage

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.300 
Harvey dighi it loses about to damage
per<00:03:50.000> turn<00:03:50.270> but<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.470> really<00:03:51.890> isn't

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
per turn but that really isn't

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.760 
per turn but that really isn't
comparable<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.480> status<00:03:54.050> effects<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.620> it

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
comparable to the status effects that it

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.790 
comparable to the status effects that it
does<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.820> if<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.600> stuck<00:03:56.870> between<00:03:57.080> picking

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
does so if you stuck between picking

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.699 
does so if you stuck between picking
Harvey<00:03:57.980> GG<00:03:58.490> and<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.300> weapon<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.470> should

that doesn't have a look key cost as you

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.600 
that doesn't have a look key cost as you
can<00:05:03.040> see<00:05:03.220> here<00:05:04.470> no<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.650> weapon<00:05:05.980> special<00:05:06.430> can

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
stack so the more times the weapon

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.710 
stack so the more times the weapon
special<00:05:09.400> happens<00:05:09.700> there<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.210> ball<00:05:10.360> damage
