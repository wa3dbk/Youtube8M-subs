 his transparent pregón presents martín 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.370
 Muñoz and his transparent proclamation ideas 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.370
 stick 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:31.829
 well here we are very well 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.809
 very good very happy to be here 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.610
 are all the nice things stores 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.040
 for for the chocolates that we have to 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.769
 that are increasingly blue 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.800
 people started doing things to 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:49.800
 work we give you the ideas and 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:56.289
 the craftsman for the sake of art 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.030
 of art to which as such and in fact 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.680
 when you have a problem or something 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.440
 Most doctors tell you 'it will not be 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.780
 something to distract or parliament you have to have 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.810
 yes yes yes totally totally distract 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.240
 the mind if the hands also do not put 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.759
 do is a good way that this 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 it's okay we made some dragonflies 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.630
 dragonflies with that with their own hotmail 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.880
 what are these educated bars 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.979
 transparent that are spectacular and 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.690
 grace beacons of supreme also that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.670
 I had a comment 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.409
 you have to have this kind of guns not 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.450
 any type of guns 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.030
 because there are other guns that out there 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.950
 are the guns or those that should be used 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.170
 because they are not under the rules of 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 security and it was plugged in since it's 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.969
 very much careful with that kind of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.259
 tools in addition carefully for those 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.179
 issues when you go out 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:49.509
 here there is electricity and because we buy 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:51.069
 some means but security behind 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.929
 which are heard thanks I slept is 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.650
 well how are you doing then we are going to 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.840
 start working 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.850
 I'm going to tell you how the subject is 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.320
 we explained conomita that we are going to 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.780
 work with ultra hot milk 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.910
 transparent a very good gun and 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.170
 I'm going to make the drawing on the plane of 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.509
 the dragonfly so that you can 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.090
 do very fast at home and they can do 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.620
 some fantastic souvenir looks we're going to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.550
 do first as a kind of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.730
 circle and another little circle rather and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.420
 here we are going to throw what is going to be the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.690
 little body of the dragonfly after we go to 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.110
 do as one eye let's make another eye 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.380
 more exactly the same and two more eyes 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.750
 little ones these are going to be the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.540
 four wings obviously afterwards 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.030
 we're going to do all the blasting 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.320
 from the hotmail bar so that for 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.300
 give it that way that we went 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.130
 doing and then once we did 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.600
 this we are going to do as a little dot and what 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.490
 we stretch another little dot and stretch it 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.680
 that are going to make the antennas good 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.900
 saying this I'm explained I'm going 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.910
 to leave here so you read is that it is in 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.530
 our producer that is a chocolate for 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.960
 that you can have the 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.030
 design if they need it well 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.310
 next step they will work on the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.380
 home allowance a glass or insert 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.780
 as in this case metal table 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.030
 house is perfect let's take the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.370
 gun and let's do then those 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.140
 designs that I told you detail if you 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.420
 they do not dare to do it like that by free hand 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.790
 or something place a glass with the design 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.240
 below and they help with the design 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.980
 then look, let's start with the 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.550
 little body we do the head as well 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.240
 I told them and 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.040
 it's shot 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.969
 and here I come again 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.120
 to do the little body well this is going to 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.650
 be the body of the dragonfly we are going to 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.210
 then make those little eyes that 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.870
 I had just done so 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.410
 we do it this way 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.260
 we do it this way 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.000
 and so the other two little eyes that 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.610
 they are the smallest ones that are going to be 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.380
 for the other smaller rooms 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.630
 all right 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.000
 then once we have armadito 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.810
 this you have to hope to dry nothing this way 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.670
 how is it 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.610
 let's take distance with the gun 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.010
 they see support and take distance and I start 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.750
 Fill 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.730
 all that all that is going to be the 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.650
 inner part of the wings so that 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.690
 have a body so they have a good shape 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.359
 so that they hold up well we're going to 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.910
 repeat the 4 wings and now the famous ones 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.260
 antenitas that I was telling you is a little dot and 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.870
 style a little dot and style well this what 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.970
 they are going to leave nothing as they are 23 minutitos 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.680
 nothing else to dry a secret a 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.150
 tip if you want to do it faster than 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.800
 they are making souvenir we take them 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.590
 under the tap since we're in 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.300
 the table of cut of house and we wet it that 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.340
 nothing happens absolutely super 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.590
 crystal clear and what they are going to do 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.889
 is that they cool much faster look 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.860
 I have here so you can see them 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.289
 let's do this side see the wings 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.949
 how they have to be 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:00.199
 here we have the little bodies well then 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.680
 what we do that is after placing a 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.980
 little bit of glue and let's do it 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.220
 to here and place 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.870
 lalita and hold a little bit so that 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.090
 so that he stays 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.760
 seized in the way that I need 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.340
 well the same thing we're going to do with the 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.790
 others the other three wings and 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.140
 the smallest see as I have here 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.500
 let's take out the little tricks 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.650
 important and we're going to paste the other 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.050
 wings below come for us to stay 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.940
 tightly grasped the dragonfly and then 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.390
 obviously a little bit of glue and 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.740
 the two antennas will be like this 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.720
 as I have here and I tell you a 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.340
 little secret more to make it easy and come 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.920
 that we fix everything with the bars 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.630
 transparent I grabbed a bit of 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.210
 wire and screw it with the same 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.850
 glue I put a little bit of glue and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.310
 I pressed and there I was the wire 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.560
 then with that very useful the trunk 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.500
 so that in order to dispose 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.630
 all dragonflies and that you can 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.340
 without any problems and remove them 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.740
 deliver them on some birthday a 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.850
 baptism or whatever you want and good normitamita 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.530
 the very good idea we are seeing exact of 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.910
 the chunks I like that 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.190
 rustic question but 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.440
 we can paint them in gold plated 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.920
 white as well we said white but in 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.560
 the free here we do it as a 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.840
 ornament to decorate or otherwise as a 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.540
 souvenir four afternoons super fast 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.400
 put together the truth that is very easy 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.290
 glue these are so harmful what 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.410
 important is that they have each visit already 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.240
 in fact, always on a plate of 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.150
 Aluminum mentions her from home where 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.670
 and lists you want me mine 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.740
 I love I love precious very easy 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.120
 thank you better brought it two recesses the 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.100
 next week 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.530
 good and now we continue with silvina 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.570
 gap that teaches us to be eleventh 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.570
 story of a bowl in cartapesta
