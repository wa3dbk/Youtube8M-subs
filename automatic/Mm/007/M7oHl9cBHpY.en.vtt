00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
these it's incredible these things

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.860 
these it's incredible these things
vibrate<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:49.180> what<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.209> like<00:03:50.330> about<00:03:50.390> these<00:03:50.810> is

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
vibrate and what I like about these is

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.540 
vibrate and what I like about these is
that<00:03:51.080> they<00:03:51.890> have<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> lower<00:03:52.250> frequency

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
that they have a lower frequency

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.370 
that they have a lower frequency
response<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:55.040> can<00:03:55.250> get<00:03:55.370> lower<00:03:56.050> beats<00:03:57.050> and

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
response so it can get lower beats and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.280 
response so it can get lower beats and
face<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.950> then<00:03:58.040> studios<00:03:58.490> can<00:03:59.140> because<00:04:00.140> when

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
face and then studios can because when

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.920 
face and then studios can because when
the<00:04:00.350> studio<00:04:00.650> is<00:04:00.860> hitting<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.430> hit<00:04:01.940> some<00:04:02.209> beats

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930
