00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.200
 with the rebell has köckerling as 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.379
 next manufacturer a short corner 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 wilkerling with the market 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.619
 challenging naming one 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.050
 rebellion on the course disc 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.750
 trigger a teasing market 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.320
 we have the cultivated 41 meters wide 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.660
 versions of the short haul tested the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.989
 discs have a diameter of 51 centimeters 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.270
 and are 5 mm strong the inclination 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.980
 the jagged working tools is 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.230
 16 degrees to the direction of travel 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.060
 in addition to the effect has köckerling 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.970
 the discs an attack of seven 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.820
 grad spends the slices header 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.310
 The rebellion is fixed 26 inches apart 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.900
 within the series result in a total 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.900
 strich distance of 13 cm 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.310
 the bar distance from the claim to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.900
 back row is 70 cm 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.090
 that is not the case in comparison 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.020
 but the greatest value was also enough 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.970
 intense earth movements always from the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 discs are sealed in triple 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.460
 and so was the entry roll store 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.220
 All tools are stored individually 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.760
 a 90 x 13 mm thick leaf spring on 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.350
 frame rise through this suspension 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.490
 Can the slab stones in all 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.770
 dodge directions 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.430
 in principle it is an integrated 3d 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.380
 the backup for our operations was the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.300
 lever regardless of speed and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 working depth always like a board in 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.660
 Berlin has a working area of ​​2 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.150
 to 12 cm deep 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.400
 4 cm are in our experience the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.050
 shallowest settings for sitting at 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.500
 thies possible stop but also 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.790
 quite 14 cm in it 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.590
 the deep imagination takes place 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.040
 standard on a descent system 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.020
 with bolt our test machine was for 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.350
 1800 euros surcharge with a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.860
 hydraulic imagination 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.860
 Did 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.370
 for deep guidance and reconsolidation 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.819
 comes with the rebellor of köckerling 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.280
 known double sts 19 53 centimeters 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.810
 diameter for use 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.700
 The roller works mainly up 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.980
 medium to heavy soils flawless 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.870
 The demand behind wanted something 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.959
 she also sits down in one another 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.209
 under extreme conditions not for 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.340
 850 euros surcharge there is one 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.170
 spredged submit supplements for the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.940
 Rebels are intervening 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.810
 Adjust the tines for care 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.850
 additional one with cooling 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.190
 just under 26 tons is the rule 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.780
 Comparatively easy classmates 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.540
 in the same work width are due 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.769
 up to three tons 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.780
 However, when used at the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.940
 woods are on the slices up to 400 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.519
 kilogram earth systems the weight must 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.470
 then on the tug and amount 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.480
 our conclusion köckerling has with the rule 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.640
 a very solid short on the market 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.190
 The slices aim safely in 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.280
 the floor and but interest evenly 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.280
