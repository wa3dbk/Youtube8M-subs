00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.340
 we 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.960
 finally 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.310
 I 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello everyone that needs sludge 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.160
 and they find themselves today for 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.860
 a new video then it's going to be 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.460
 an informative ad video because 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.960
 that because the zero for 9.0 comes up and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.369
 a lot of people I think about 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.040
 time she's specious this new 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.020
 version that will come out 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.700
 so in fact I'm going to clarify this 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 point there since I had already said 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.849
 in some videos but that's it 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.649
 really a video ad for that everything 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.270
 the world is watching because there is little 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.890
 almost a year I had started a series 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.399
 which was called the adventures of ipod hugo 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.929
 so the oldest know and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.030
 certainly appreciated since this is the 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.320
 series which is the most views on my 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.019
 chain is the series that has the most 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.789
 success is so it's a series where it's 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.070
 an aspect on minecraft pocket edition 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.269
 is in fact it was a respect at the base 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 0.7 then 10.8 and lala 0.9 point 0 arrives 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.210
 at the bottom we will have a lot of 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.010
 new possibilities but I have not 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.350
 want to start all over again because 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.850
 than what I did in this series and 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 it's still going to require a lot of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.170
 time when I think about it is not even 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.700
 hours of play it's days of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.680
 weeks of play on this map 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 so I really do not really want to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.369
 start all over again so that's why I 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.649
 want to go out an episode goes at the same time 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.790
 that this video is actually this 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.439
 episode I would like everyone 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.119
 go see him even those who do not have 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.290
 followed the beginning of the series in fact the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.540
 video ad is here to tell you 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.670
 go watch this video there the episode 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.530
 40 adventures of ipod hugo which is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.549
 released at the same time as this video even 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.100
 if you have not seen the beginning of the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.869
 series but will see it frankly not 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 what am I really going to everything everything 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.149
 explained on the let's play that I'm going 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.469
 to do in 0.9 zero point here is so it's 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.130
 this video advertises because if I 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.409
 did not do it 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.520
 there are many people who would not have 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.420
 not been seeing the video because they 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.070
 would not have followed the beginning of the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.780
 series and for all who want to see 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.270
 excluding 0.9 zero point I'm going 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.859
 everything explained in so she is 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.630

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.490
