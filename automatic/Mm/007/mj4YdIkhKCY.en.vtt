on one of our earlier videos and this is

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.710 
on one of our earlier videos and this is
the<00:00:30.100> top<00:00:30.310> of<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:30.490> Coon<00:00:30.670> cuff<00:00:30.940> this<00:00:31.330> little<00:00:31.540> pad

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
the top of the Coon cuff this little pad

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.750 
the top of the Coon cuff this little pad
is<00:00:31.900> what's<00:00:32.080> going<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.230> get<00:00:32.320> depressed<00:00:32.680> as<00:00:33.430> part

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
is what's going to get depressed as part

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.690 
is what's going to get depressed as part
of<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.880> setting<00:00:34.180> mechanism<00:00:35.129> underneath<00:00:36.129> I'm

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
of the setting mechanism underneath I'm

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.820 
of the setting mechanism underneath I'm
gonna<00:00:36.879> try<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.059> get<00:00:37.239> close<00:00:37.420> in<00:00:37.629> here<00:00:37.809> this<00:00:38.650> is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
gonna try to get close in here this is

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.520 
gonna try to get close in here this is
the<00:00:39.010> trigger<00:00:39.460> itself<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:41.020> when<00:00:41.170> it's<00:00:41.290> pulled

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
the trigger itself and when it's pulled

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.720 
the trigger itself and when it's pulled
back<00:00:42.629> should<00:00:43.629> be<00:00:43.750> able<00:00:43.809> to<00:00:43.960> see<00:00:44.190> right<00:00:45.190> down<00:00:45.520> in

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
back should be able to see right down in

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.110 
back should be able to see right down in
here<00:00:46.120> there's<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:46.930> little<00:00:47.320> notch<00:00:47.559> right<00:00:48.120> there

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
here there's a little notch right there

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.600 
here there's a little notch right there
that<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.629> pad<00:00:49.809> is<00:00:49.930> going<00:00:50.080> to<00:00:50.140> get<00:00:50.340> hooked<00:00:51.340> into

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
that the pad is going to get hooked into

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.080 
that the pad is going to get hooked into
so<00:00:52.470> from<00:00:53.470> this<00:00:53.710> side<00:00:54.630> this<00:00:55.630> gets<00:00:55.840> pushed<00:00:56.079> down

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so from this side this gets pushed down

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.660 
so from this side this gets pushed down
little<00:00:58.090> triggers<00:00:58.390> go<00:00:58.570> set<00:00:58.840> up<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.460> now<00:01:00.610> you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
little triggers go set up and now you

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.700 
little triggers go set up and now you
can<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:04.440> like<00:01:05.440> that<00:01:06.149> straight<00:01:07.149> through<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
can see like that straight through and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.540 
can see like that straight through and
from<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.220> top<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.190> set<00:01:12.430> position

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
from the top that's in the set position

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.160 
from the top that's in the set position
and<00:01:15.550> then<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:16.330> can<00:01:16.450> see<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.720> way<00:01:16.810> down<00:01:17.020> in

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and then you can see the way down in

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.830 
and then you can see the way down in
there<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.440> hairs<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.880> I'm<00:01:19.030> just<00:01:19.149> gonna<00:01:19.300> pull

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
there the hairs and I'm just gonna pull

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.270 
there the hairs and I'm just gonna pull
it<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.509> you<00:01:23.170> see<00:01:23.350> it<00:01:23.440> shuts<00:01:23.830> pretty<00:01:24.040> quickly

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
it and you see it shuts pretty quickly

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.590 
it and you see it shuts pretty quickly
but<00:01:24.549> basically<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.450> idea<00:01:25.479> is<00:01:25.869> that<00:01:25.900> when<00:01:26.170> your

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
but basically the idea is that when your

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.940 
but basically the idea is that when your
animals<00:01:28.600> down<00:01:28.750> in<00:01:28.930> there<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.290> just<00:01:29.320> kind<00:01:29.920> of

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
animals down in there it just kind of

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.330 
animals down in there it just kind of
holds<00:01:30.220> on<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.580> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
holds on to it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.480 
holds on to it
pretty<00:01:33.340> easy<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.610> set<00:01:33.850> just<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.180> couple<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.510> tips

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
pretty easy to set just a couple of tips

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.570 
pretty easy to set just a couple of tips
try<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.549> set<00:01:36.820> it<00:01:37.000> in<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.360> soil<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.010> 45<00:01:39.549> degree

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
try to set it in the soil at a 45 degree

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:47.820 
try to set it in the soil at a 45 degree
angle<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:44.070> if<00:01:45.070> this<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.490> flat<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.930> want<00:01:47.170> the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
angle so if this is flat you want the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.390 
angle so if this is flat you want the
trip<00:01:48.100> pan<00:01:48.600> facing<00:01:49.600> upward<00:01:50.220> at<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.880> 45<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.400> that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
trip pan facing upward at a 45 so that

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.910 
trip pan facing upward at a 45 so that
kind<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.729> set<00:01:54.939> would<00:01:55.060> be<00:01:55.180> good<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.740> you're

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
kind of set would be good if you're

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.270 
kind of set would be good if you're
doing<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.689> ground<00:01:58.689> set<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.680> want<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.890> pack<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
doing a ground set you want to pack the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.480 
doing a ground set you want to pack the
dirt<00:02:00.430> in<00:02:00.610> around<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.810> trap<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:03.220> that<00:02:03.250> the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
dirt in around the trap so that the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.350 
dirt in around the trap so that the
opening<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:03.970> open<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.680> they<00:02:06.610> don't<00:02:06.790> see<00:02:07.060> the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
opening is open but they don't see the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.419 
opening is open but they don't see the
edges<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:08.019> so<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.709> they<00:02:08.950> would<00:02:09.130> want<00:02:09.340> to

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
edges of this so that they would want to

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.720 
edges of this so that they would want to
have<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:09.880> need<00:02:10.269> to<00:02:10.299> dig<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:10.720> out<00:02:11.130> again<00:02:12.130> always

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
have a need to dig it out again always

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.509 
have a need to dig it out again always
make<00:02:12.940> sure<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.540> anchored<00:02:13.930> with<00:02:14.519> some

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
make sure that it's anchored with some

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.199

you're doing a bluff ground set you can

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.699 
you're doing a bluff ground set you can
actually<00:02:24.250> drill<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.209> hole<00:02:25.420> through<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.470> face
