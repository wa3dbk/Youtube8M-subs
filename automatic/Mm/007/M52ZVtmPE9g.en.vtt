00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240 

so<00:00:00.210> the<00:00:00.299> standard<00:00:00.690> problem<00:00:01.100> there's<00:00:02.100> been

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so the standard problem there's been

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.590 
so the standard problem there's been
given<00:00:02.520> town<00:00:02.669> wants<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.030> test<00:00:03.270> whether<00:00:03.419> they

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
given town wants to test whether they

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300 
given town wants to test whether they
understand<00:00:04.140> something<00:00:04.440> about<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:05.069> the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
understand something about the the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.639 
understand something about the the
causality<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:05.940> their<00:00:06.150> tools<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:07.020> basis<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
causality of their tools is basis the

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.060 
causality of their tools is basis the
trap<00:00:08.580> tube<00:00:09.380> so<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.740> have<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.040> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
trap tube so what you have is a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.950 
trap tube so what you have is a
horizontal<00:00:11.370> tube<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.650> an<00:00:13.650> animal<00:00:14.130> has<00:00:14.340> to

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
horizontal tube and an animal has to

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.429 
horizontal tube and an animal has to
avoid<00:00:16.220> pushing<00:00:17.220> food<00:00:17.699> towards<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> trap<00:00:19.670> and

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
avoid pushing food towards the trap and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.050 
avoid pushing food towards the trap and
stared<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> has<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.830> pull<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.160> away<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
stared it has to pull it away from the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.910 
stared it has to pull it away from the
trap<00:00:26.449> to<00:00:27.449> get<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> food<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.769> do

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
trap to get the food out and what we do

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800 
trap to get the food out and what we do
is<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.460> give<00:00:29.609> them<00:00:29.760> lots<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.210> experience<00:00:30.689> with

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
is we give them lots of experience with

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.279 
is we give them lots of experience with
this

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
this

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.500 
this
this<00:00:31.529> trap<00:00:31.740> tube<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.640> lots<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> ten<00:00:33.180> trials

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
this trap tube and lots of ten trials

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.870 
this trap tube and lots of ten trials
and<00:00:33.660> we've<00:00:34.380> randomly<00:00:34.559> reversed<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.489> position

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and we've randomly reversed the position

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.160 
and we've randomly reversed the position
of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> Trappist<00:00:36.510> which<00:00:36.719> means<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.079> they

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
of the Trappist which means that they

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
of the Trappist which means that they
can't<00:00:37.469> learn<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.190> always<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.670> come<00:00:38.850> from<00:00:38.969> one

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
can't learn to always just come from one

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
can't learn to always just come from one
side<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.780> pull<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.739> sometimes<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
side and pull because sometimes the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.950 
side and pull because sometimes the
charts<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.940> side<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
charts going to be on this side of it so

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.860 
charts going to be on this side of it so
what<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.200> did<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:44.340> present<00:00:45.180> micros<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
what we did was present micros with this

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
what we did was present micros with this
initial<00:00:46.320> tube<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.030> found<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:49.940> out<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
initial tube and we found that out of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
initial tube and we found that out of
six<00:00:51.360> close<00:00:51.660> threes<00:00:52.170> were<00:00:52.469> able<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.949> learn<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
six close threes were able to learn to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.150 
six close threes were able to learn to
solve<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> problem<00:00:54.149> within<00:00:54.329> 150<00:00:54.930> twelve<00:00:55.350> so

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
solve the problem within 150 twelve so

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310 
solve the problem within 150 twelve so
we<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:56.910> how<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.960> saw<00:00:58.140> him<00:00:58.230> in

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
we want to know now how they saw him in

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.119 
we want to know now how they saw him in
the<00:00:58.379> problem<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.430> we<00:01:00.210> change<00:01:01.129> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the problem so we change the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.470 
the problem so we change the
characteristics<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> trap<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
characteristics of the trap to you to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.179 
characteristics of the trap to you to
begin<00:01:03.600> with

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
begin with

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.370 
begin with
first<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.549> our<00:01:05.670> first<00:01:05.939> transfer<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.990> took<00:01:07.229> away

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
first in our first transfer we took away

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.250 
first in our first transfer we took away
the<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> disks<00:01:08.479> just<00:01:09.479> leaving<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> blue<00:01:10.020> rim

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the the disks just leaving the blue rim

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.660 
the the disks just leaving the blue rim
so<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.619> crows<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.100> pull<00:01:14.460> away<00:01:14.580> from

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
so now the crows have to pull away from

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
so now the crows have to pull away from
the<00:01:14.880> blue<00:01:15.090> rim<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.840> these<00:01:15.990> two<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> tree

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the blue rim but these two are the tree

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
the blue rim but these two are the tree
cues<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:18.150> mean<00:01:18.360> anything

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
cues here that don't mean anything

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
cues here that don't mean anything
I'm<00:01:19.710> having<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> loop<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:20.850> just

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
I'm having the loop so if they just

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.210 
I'm having the loop so if they just
learnt<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:22.500> something<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.130> an

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
learnt to do something because of an

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
learnt to do something because of an
learn<00:01:23.520> associatively<00:01:24.090> about<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.540> particular

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
learn associatively about one particular

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.770 
learn associatively about one particular
Harbhajan<00:01:25.439> cue<00:01:25.710> then<00:01:26.369> they<00:01:26.820> should<00:01:26.970> found<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
Harbhajan cue then they should found and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
Harbhajan cue then they should found and
we<00:01:27.840> find<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.170> these<00:01:28.530> three<00:01:28.740> glows<00:01:28.950> continue

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
we find that these three glows continue

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.200 
we find that these three glows continue
to<00:01:29.850> avoid<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> trap<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.380> okay<00:01:31.880> they<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.030> still

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
to avoid the trap so okay they can still

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
to avoid the trap so okay they can still
obviously<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.689> been<00:01:33.720> using<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.320> blue<00:01:34.979> rim

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
obviously have been using the blue rim

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.340 
obviously have been using the blue rim
that's<00:01:35.970> still<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> very

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's still there and it's a very

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.319 
that's still there and it's a very
obvious<00:01:37.560> cue<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.310> use<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.640> solve<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> problem

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
obvious cue to use to solve the problem

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.350 
obvious cue to use to solve the problem
so<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.290> our<00:01:40.380> next<00:01:40.560> transfer<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.610> remove<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
so in our next transfer we remove the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.960 
so in our next transfer we remove the
blue<00:01:42.540> rim<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.890> put<00:01:44.100> by<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> disk<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.820> this

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
blue rim and we put by the disk but this

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.929 
blue rim and we put by the disk but this
time<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> disc<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.630> lack<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.610> find<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
time the disc of lack and we find that

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
time the disc of lack and we find that
again<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> crows<00:01:48.659> continue<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.590> solve<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
again the crows continue to solve the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.520 
again the crows continue to solve the
problem

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.630 

so<00:01:54.530> at<00:01:54.859> this<00:01:54.979> point<00:01:55.159> we<00:01:55.369> thought<00:01:55.490> either

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
so at this point we thought either

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.370 
so at this point we thought either
something<00:01:56.030> maybe<00:01:56.359> interesting<00:01:57.049> going<00:01:57.200> on

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
something maybe interesting going on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.800 
something maybe interesting going on
here<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:57.649> know<00:01:58.329> because<00:01:59.329> they're<00:01:59.479> not<00:01:59.509> using

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
here you know because they're not using

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.319 
here you know because they're not using
any<00:02:00.079> single<00:02:00.619> cube<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.549> single<00:02:01.819> feature<00:02:02.030> of

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
any single cube and a single feature of

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.149 
any single cube and a single feature of
their<00:02:02.509> problem<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.229> order<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.740> solve<00:02:03.920> it

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
their problem in order to solve it

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.130 
their problem in order to solve it
however<00:02:05.000> they<00:02:05.119> still<00:02:05.179> could<00:02:05.600> have<00:02:05.630> been<00:02:05.750> using

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
however they still could have been using

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.669 
however they still could have been using
kind<00:02:06.859> of<00:02:06.950> two<00:02:07.189> Q's<00:02:07.670> independently<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:08.750> if

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
kind of two Q's independently so if

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.869 
kind of two Q's independently so if
they'd<00:02:09.890> learn<00:02:10.129> both<00:02:10.340> abouts

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
they'd learn both abouts

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.509 
they'd learn both abouts
to<00:02:11.150> like<00:02:11.299> pull<00:02:11.660> towards<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.349> disk<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.010> pull

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
to like pull towards this disk and pull

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.250 
to like pull towards this disk and pull
away<00:02:13.640> from<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.150> rim<00:02:14.450> if<00:02:14.750> these<00:02:15.110> were

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
away from the rim if these were

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.009 
away from the rim if these were
independent<00:02:15.620> Q's<00:02:16.599> then<00:02:17.599> when<00:02:17.720> we<00:02:17.810> take<00:02:17.989> away

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
independent Q's then when we take away

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.809 
independent Q's then when we take away
one<00:02:18.230> they<00:02:18.920> still<00:02:19.160> got<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.370> other<00:02:19.400> one<00:02:19.700> which

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
one they still got the other one which

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.580 
one they still got the other one which
they<00:02:19.970> use<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.660> vice<00:02:20.840> versa<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.440> two

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
they use and vice versa this two

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.370 
they use and vice versa this two
transfers<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.970> then<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.180> put<00:02:23.390> two<00:02:23.750> holes<00:02:24.079> into

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
transfers so then we put two holes into

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.430 
transfers so then we put two holes into
the<00:02:24.470> tube<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.640> we<00:02:26.120> put<00:02:26.329> a<00:02:26.569> trap<00:02:26.930> base<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.290> only

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the tube and we put a trap base to only

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.309 
the tube and we put a trap base to only
one<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.769> them<00:02:27.890> because<00:02:28.069> we<00:02:28.160> wanted<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.549> see

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
one of them because we wanted to see

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.400 
one of them because we wanted to see
whether<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.709> crows<00:02:30.920> would<00:02:31.130> prefer<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.459> use

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
whether the crows would prefer to use

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.229 
whether the crows would prefer to use
the<00:02:33.410> obvious<00:02:33.769> cube<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.459> trap<00:02:34.670> base<00:02:34.880> which

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
the obvious cube the trap base which

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.990 
the obvious cube the trap base which
remains<00:02:36.049> or<00:02:36.440> if<00:02:36.950> they<00:02:37.099> were<00:02:37.160> confused<00:02:37.700> by<00:02:37.940> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
remains or if they were confused by the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.089 
remains or if they were confused by the
two<00:02:38.239> holes<00:02:38.480> because<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.410> holes<00:02:39.650> are<00:02:39.890> kind<00:02:40.069> of

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
two holes because the holes are kind of

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.819 
two holes because the holes are kind of
causal<00:02:40.519> features<00:02:40.879> they're<00:02:41.150> an<00:02:42.019> important

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
causal features they're an important

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.780 
causal features they're an important
part<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.220> problem<00:02:43.549> because<00:02:43.610> they

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
part of the problem because they

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.140 
part of the problem because they
actually<00:02:43.940> do<00:02:44.329> something<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:46.280> what<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:46.879> found

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
actually do something so what we found

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.520 
actually do something so what we found
was<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.480> when<00:02:47.660> there's<00:02:47.810> two<00:02:48.079> holes<00:02:48.290> there

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
was that when there's two holes there

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.839 
was that when there's two holes there
the<00:02:48.620> crows<00:02:48.829> got<00:02:49.040> really<00:02:51.040> reluctant<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.459> pull

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
the crows got really reluctant to pull

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.590 
the crows got really reluctant to pull
the<00:02:53.810> food<00:02:54.079> into<00:02:54.829> either<00:02:55.010> of<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.549> tube<00:02:56.239> so<00:02:56.269> they

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
the food into either of the tube so they

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.990 
the food into either of the tube so they
were<00:02:56.660> out<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.620> hole<00:02:57.859> so<00:02:58.100> they<00:02:58.700> were<00:02:58.760> really

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
were out of the hole so they were really

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000 
were out of the hole so they were really
reluctant<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.569> pull<00:02:59.810> inside<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> hole<00:03:00.829> so

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
reluctant to pull inside of the hole so

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.949 
reluctant to pull inside of the hole so
they<00:03:01.100> spend<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.430> lot<00:03:01.579> of<00:03:01.609> time<00:03:01.910> pushing<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.720> here

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
they spend a lot of time pushing to here

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.800 
they spend a lot of time pushing to here
and<00:03:03.230> then<00:03:04.150> come<00:03:05.150> back<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.569> moving<00:03:05.690> the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
and then come back and moving the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.330 
and then come back and moving the
freezer<00:03:06.019> here<00:03:06.319> without<00:03:06.769> putting<00:03:07.040> him<00:03:07.250> to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
freezer here without putting him to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.370 
freezer here without putting him to
either<00:03:07.489> hole<00:03:07.849> so<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.569> suggested<00:03:09.109> to<00:03:09.230> us<00:03:09.260> that

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
either hole so this suggested to us that

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.979 
either hole so this suggested to us that
they<00:03:10.160> really<00:03:10.459> can't<00:03:10.700> learn<00:03:10.940> something<00:03:11.870> about

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
they really can't learn something about

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.500 
they really can't learn something about
holes<00:03:12.459> either<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.849> they<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.150> learned<00:03:14.329> to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
holes either that they just learned to

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.750 
holes either that they just learned to
avoid<00:03:14.660> them<00:03:15.109> or<00:03:15.709> maybe<00:03:15.980> more<00:03:16.280> they've<00:03:16.549> learned

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
avoid them or maybe more they've learned

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.670 
avoid them or maybe more they've learned
something<00:03:17.000> more<00:03:17.180> more<00:03:18.049> interesting<00:03:18.500> maybe

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
something more more interesting maybe

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.409 
something more more interesting maybe
they've<00:03:18.859> actually<00:03:19.099> learnt<00:03:19.849> like<00:03:20.389> a

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
they've actually learnt like a

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.180 
they've actually learnt like a
regularity<00:03:21.049> in<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.410> world<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.799> maybe

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
regularity in the world that maybe

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.819 
regularity in the world that maybe
objects<00:03:22.700> only<00:03:22.940> move<00:03:23.120> horizontally<00:03:23.870> along<00:03:24.769> a

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
objects only move horizontally along a

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.729 
objects only move horizontally along a
continuous<00:03:25.400> surface<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.840> then<00:03:26.989> we<00:03:27.349> gave<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
continuous surface so then we gave the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.710 
continuous surface so then we gave the
close<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.250> trap<00:03:28.609> table<00:03:29.000> now<00:03:29.209> this<00:03:29.419> problem

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
close the trap table now this problem

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.870 
close the trap table now this problem
looks<00:03:30.019> completely<00:03:30.530> different<00:03:31.010> from<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.639> trap

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
looks completely different from the trap

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.390 
looks completely different from the trap
cheap<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.269> was<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.419> wooden<00:03:32.870> box<00:03:33.190> with<00:03:34.190> two

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
cheap it was a wooden box with two

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.819 
cheap it was a wooden box with two
pieces<00:03:35.359> of<00:03:35.419> feeling<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.930> there<00:03:36.739> was<00:03:36.889> a<00:03:38.590> trap<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
pieces of feeling and there was a trap a

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.710 
pieces of feeling and there was a trap a
hole<00:03:40.190> in<00:03:40.459> front<00:03:40.579> of<00:03:40.760> one<00:03:40.970> piece<00:03:41.180> one<00:03:41.569> of<00:03:41.660> the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
hole in front of one piece one of the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.089 
hole in front of one piece one of the
pieces<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:42.019> meats<00:03:42.319> then<00:03:42.859> there<00:03:42.980> was<00:03:43.069> a

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
pieces of meats then there was a

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.830 
pieces of meats then there was a
continuous<00:03:43.639> surface<00:03:43.849> in<00:03:44.120> front<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.510> other

continuous surface in front of the other

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.379 
continuous surface in front of the other
now<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.859> trap<00:03:46.069> too<00:03:46.250> different<00:03:46.730> in<00:03:46.849> the

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
now the trap too different in the

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.000

the important thing is a hole and when

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.810 
the important thing is a hole and when
we<00:04:28.210> gave<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.080> trap<00:04:29.320> table<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:30.370> our<00:04:30.400> crows

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
we gave the the trap table to our crows

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.060 
we gave the the trap table to our crows
really<00:04:31.660> surprisingly<00:04:32.169> from<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.560> very<00:04:32.800> first

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
really surprisingly from the very first

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.860 
really surprisingly from the very first
trial<00:04:33.370> they<00:04:33.789> were<00:04:33.849> avoiding<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:34.509> all<00:04:34.660> three

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
trial they were avoiding it all three

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.499 
trial they were avoiding it all three
quotes<00:04:35.080> on<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.650> first<00:04:35.860> trial<00:04:36.099> avoid<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.699> the

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
quotes on the first trial avoid the the

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:52.000 
quotes on the first trial avoid the the
hole<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:39.340> they<00:04:39.430> continue<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:39.940> do<00:04:40.150> so

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.700 

and<00:04:53.010> this<00:04:53.130> was<00:04:53.450> as<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.510> say<00:04:54.810> surprising<00:04:55.440> because

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
and this was as I say surprising because

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.460 
and this was as I say surprising because
that<00:04:56.460> kind<00:04:56.790> of<00:04:56.960> suggests<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.200> what<00:04:58.350> the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
that kind of suggests that what the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.710 
that kind of suggests that what the
crows<00:04:58.650> had<00:04:58.830> actually<00:04:59.220> done<00:04:59.370> was<00:04:59.610> extract<00:05:00.510> some

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
crows had actually done was extract some

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.420 
crows had actually done was extract some
kind<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:00.990> course<00:05:01.320> or<00:05:01.500> regularity<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.190> they'd

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
kind of course or regularity that they'd

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.950 
kind of course or regularity that they'd
understand<00:05:02.940> some<00:05:03.150> kind<00:05:03.360> of<00:05:03.450> rule<00:05:03.690> in<00:05:03.870> the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
understand some kind of rule in the

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.690 
understand some kind of rule in the
world<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:04.710> know<00:05:04.740> objects<00:05:05.280> will<00:05:05.520> only

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
world that you know objects will only

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.530 
world that you know objects will only
move<00:05:06.530> along<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.590> continuous<00:05:08.130> surface<00:05:08.550> not<00:05:09.090> they

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
move along a continuous surface not they

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.870 
move along a continuous surface not they
won't<00:05:09.630> move<00:05:09.810> along<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.140> a<00:05:10.680> whole<00:05:11.340> in<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.640> same

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
won't move along a a whole in the same

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.190 
won't move along a a whole in the same
way<00:05:12.320> so<00:05:13.850> what<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:15.180> leads<00:05:15.450> us<00:05:15.630> to<00:05:15.660> suggest<00:05:15.930> is

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
way so what that leads us to suggest is

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.890 
way so what that leads us to suggest is
that<00:05:16.230> right<00:05:16.590> from<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.920> very<00:05:17.000> first<00:05:18.000> tube<00:05:18.390> they

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
that right from the very first tube they

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.600 
that right from the very first tube they
were<00:05:18.990> using<00:05:19.200> this<00:05:19.440> kind<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.770> causal<00:05:20.160> relation

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
were using this kind of causal relation

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.340 
were using this kind of causal relation
and<00:05:20.850> they<00:05:21.270> used<00:05:21.660> this<00:05:21.750> causal<00:05:22.110> relation

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
and they used this causal relation

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.080 
and they used this causal relation
across<00:05:22.590> all<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.950> permutations<00:05:23.220> that<00:05:23.670> we<00:05:23.850> gave

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
across all the permutations that we gave

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.060 
across all the permutations that we gave
them<00:05:24.270> of<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.900> basic<00:05:25.290> understanding

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
them of the basic understanding

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.610 
them of the basic understanding
something<00:05:26.280> about<00:05:26.430> a<00:05:26.610> hole<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.260> then<00:05:28.260> in<00:05:28.500> order

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
something about a hole and then in order

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.650 
something about a hole and then in order
to<00:05:28.830> have<00:05:28.920> transferred<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.000> trap<00:05:30.240> table

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
to have transferred to the trap table

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.510 
to have transferred to the trap table
they<00:05:31.170> must<00:05:31.380> have<00:05:31.470> been<00:05:31.590> using<00:05:31.770> analogical

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
they must have been using analogical

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.690 
they must have been using analogical
reasoning<00:05:33.290> what<00:05:34.290> I<00:05:34.320> was<00:05:34.530> really<00:05:34.980> don't<00:05:35.370> aren't

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
reasoning what I was really don't aren't

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.310 
reasoning what I was really don't aren't
saying<00:05:36.090> is<00:05:36.540> that<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:37.080> crows<00:05:38.040> think<00:05:39.020> it's<00:05:40.020> in

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
saying is that the crows think it's in

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.640 
saying is that the crows think it's in
exactly<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.830> same<00:05:40.860> way<00:05:41.220> as<00:05:41.280> humans<00:05:42.620> what<00:05:43.620> we

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
exactly the same way as humans what we

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.640 
exactly the same way as humans what we
found<00:05:44.100> was<00:05:44.760> that<00:05:44.790> they<00:05:45.690> had<00:05:45.930> they<00:05:46.350> seemed<00:05:46.530> to

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
found was that they had they seemed to

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.980 
found was that they had they seemed to
understand<00:05:47.100> something<00:05:47.340> about<00:05:47.550> how<00:05:47.990> holes

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
understand something about how holes

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.370 
understand something about how holes
work<00:05:49.350> but<00:05:50.250> we<00:05:50.520> on<00:05:50.850> our<00:05:51.120> third<00:05:51.540> transfer<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.110> and

work but we on our third transfer I and

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.630 
work but we on our third transfer I and
mentioned<00:05:52.770> that<00:05:52.830> when<00:05:52.980> there<00:05:53.100> were<00:05:53.160> two<00:05:53.370> holes

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640

mentioned that when there were two holes
the<00:05:54.090> coast<00:05:54.330> got<00:05:54.510> really<00:05:54.780> confused<00:05:55.260> and<00:05:55.470> they

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
the coast got really confused and they

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.040 
the coast got really confused and they
didn't<00:05:55.800> understand<00:05:56.400> that<00:05:56.700> one<00:05:57.330> hole<00:05:57.600> had<00:05:58.020> a

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
didn't understand that one hole had a

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.610 
didn't understand that one hole had a
base<00:05:58.320> on<00:05:58.620> one<00:05:59.130> call<00:05:59.340> of<00:05:59.460> biddin<00:05:59.760> so<00:06:00.420> a<00:06:00.780> human<00:06:01.410> if

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
base on one call of biddin so a human if

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.290 
base on one call of biddin so a human if
you<00:06:01.650> give<00:06:01.890> that<00:06:02.040> problem<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.520> you<00:06:02.580> they're

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
you give that problem to you they're

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.180 
you give that problem to you they're
gonna<00:06:03.510> say<00:06:03.780> oh<00:06:03.990> I<00:06:04.260> should<00:06:04.410> pull<00:06:04.620> out<00:06:04.650> this<00:06:04.980> way

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
gonna say oh I should pull out this way

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
gonna say oh I should pull out this way
because<00:06:05.310> it's<00:06:05.490> gonna<00:06:05.640> fall<00:06:05.850> through<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:06.060> hole

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
because it's gonna fall through the hole

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:13.030 
because it's gonna fall through the hole
and<00:06:06.330> I<00:06:06.420> get<00:06:06.600> it<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:07.440> clothes<00:06:07.680> didn't<00:06:08.040> do<00:06:08.160> that

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.860 

I<00:06:13.130> studied<00:06:13.730> this<00:06:13.910> year<00:06:14.770> gave<00:06:16.870> twenty

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
I studied this year gave twenty

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.260 
I studied this year gave twenty
individuals<00:06:18.230> from<00:06:18.890> the<00:06:19.610> great<00:06:19.820> ape<00:06:19.970> species

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
individuals from the great ape species

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.010 
individuals from the great ape species
so<00:06:20.660> bonobos<00:06:21.640> chimpanzees<00:06:22.690> gorillas<00:06:23.690> and

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
so bonobos chimpanzees gorillas and

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.050 
so bonobos chimpanzees gorillas and
orangutans<00:06:24.140> and<00:06:24.860> they<00:06:25.190> gave<00:06:25.370> them<00:06:25.580> the<00:06:25.820> trap

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
orangutans and they gave them the trap

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.750 
orangutans and they gave them the trap
tube<00:06:26.350> and<00:06:27.350> then<00:06:27.530> saw<00:06:27.770> it<00:06:27.950> that<00:06:28.340> then<00:06:28.490> looked<00:06:28.730> to

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
tube and then saw it that then looked to

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.000 
tube and then saw it that then looked to
see<00:06:28.940> if<00:06:28.970> they<00:06:29.120> could<00:06:29.180> transfer<00:06:29.780> to<00:06:29.810> the<00:06:30.170> trap

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
see if they could transfer to the trap

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.740 
see if they could transfer to the trap
table<00:06:31.400> or<00:06:31.520> vice<00:06:31.730> versa<00:06:31.760> they<00:06:32.240> first<00:06:32.540> learned

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
table or vice versa they first learned

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.360 
table or vice versa they first learned
about<00:06:32.810> the<00:06:33.050> trap<00:06:33.260> table<00:06:33.680> and<00:06:33.860> then<00:06:34.280> they

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
about the trap table and then they

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.670 
about the trap table and then they
transferred<00:06:34.850> to<00:06:35.450> the<00:06:35.570> trap<00:06:35.780> tube<00:06:36.020> and<00:06:36.470> they

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
transferred to the trap tube and they

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.190 
transferred to the trap tube and they
found<00:06:36.890> no<00:06:37.220> evidence<00:06:37.250> of<00:06:37.820> transfer<00:06:38.330> that<00:06:38.360> even

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
found no evidence of transfer that even

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.530 
found no evidence of transfer that even
if<00:06:39.380> even<00:06:39.680> though<00:06:40.040> the<00:06:40.220> Apes<00:06:40.640> could<00:06:40.940> get<00:06:41.120> really

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
if even though the Apes could get really

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.120 
if even though the Apes could get really
good<00:06:41.660> at<00:06:41.810> this<00:06:41.960> when<00:06:42.440> you<00:06:42.560> give<00:06:42.710> them<00:06:42.800> a<00:06:42.920> trap

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
good at this when you give them a trap

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.400 
good at this when you give them a trap
table<00:06:43.490> problem<00:06:43.850> they<00:06:44.300> go<00:06:44.450> back<00:06:44.660> to<00:06:44.840> putting<00:06:45.290> it

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
table problem they go back to putting it

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.650 
table problem they go back to putting it
in<00:06:45.500> the<00:06:45.590> trap<00:06:45.800> all<00:06:45.980> the<00:06:46.010> time<00:06:46.310> so<00:06:46.910> our<00:06:47.360> crows

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
in the trap all the time so our crows

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.550 
in the trap all the time so our crows
have<00:06:47.870> really<00:06:49.390> shown<00:06:50.390> some<00:06:51.080> a<00:06:51.170> level<00:06:51.470> of

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
have really shown some a level of

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.110 
have really shown some a level of
sophistication<00:06:51.710> here<00:06:52.460> that<00:06:52.580> hasn't<00:06:53.000> been

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
sophistication here that hasn't been

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.570 
sophistication here that hasn't been
shown<00:06:53.360> before
