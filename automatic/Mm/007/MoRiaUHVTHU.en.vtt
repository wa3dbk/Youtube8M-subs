 You are then this app starts 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.970

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.840
 It was on the screen that's what his name was. 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.570
 I'm not mistaken, he's normal. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.240

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.699

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.510
 side dish 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.840
 turn the sun and earphone to take pictures or 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.329

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.420
 just touch the goal he starts from 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.420
 degree that is to rotate 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.590
 You can also use this application 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.440
 with your hand but the bad is that he does not 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:23.229

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:27.399

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.979
 table of their function and it was 4 4s 15 at 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.780

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.110
