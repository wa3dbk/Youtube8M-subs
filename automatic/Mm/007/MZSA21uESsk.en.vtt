00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:04.010
 is that dear brothers 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.010
 I remember that stepped on remarkable historical god 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.379
 when a nephew of the queen victory 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.309
 was ordered by sanz expulsion the prince the English lenders as 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.009
 minister of the gospel 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.480
 expulsion in the presence of his distinguished turn 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 who was running the British Empire told him prince so-and-so 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.649
 if God has called you to his service 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.649
 never stoop to do the king of england 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.470
 and because also 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.470
 when the 70s broke the public morals of the United States 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.730
 I will say something that some will not accept willingly 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.010
 today he died 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
 the ennador ted kennedy 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.720
 often fascinated with the kennedy 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.260
 I hope it is in the presence of God 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.110
 I hope to meet him and his soria brothers 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.350
 but the day they chose 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 to president kennedy the united states made a historical mistake 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.950
 with the only non-protestant president of its history 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.020
 because then a moral permissiveness was installed in the white house 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.220
 that leads to the extreme of what we already know 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.700
 from clinton 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.790
 and Monica Lewinsky 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.370
 this will be scandalized gtc and there was a very strong movement the united states 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.799
 he asked big bilic to lend his name to be a candidate 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.400
 and what is written by the great vangelist 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
 the greatest apostle of the gospel in the 20th century 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.359
 ended in the simplest way read in the document asking lecce 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.439
 lend your name to save the nation 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.600
 st kings said 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.300
 I thank you very much it is an honor that I do not deserve but I want to remind you 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.780
 that I have been called 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.780
 to higher destinations than the white house 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 and sometimes we are very excited about elementary things 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.090
 because there is an episode that can not be overlooked that is that lucas 4 5 8 and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.090
 I'll see it 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.989
 then the devil took him to the high place and they showed him distant all the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.059
 rich of the world 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.709
 on the ground if all his splendor told him 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.829
 I will give you the authority because it has been given to me and you could give it to me 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:25.659
 want 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.069
 so if you love me 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.959
 everything will be yours 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.870
 Jesus answered him written is he worships the Lord your God and serves only 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.959
 some seem to understand here that I say out loud sea do not recognize yours 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.259
 what to do then in political matters will be the big question 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.299
 Well, there are two obvious positions 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.299
 or to be sustained by participating 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.139
 as I would say truism 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.029
 because the Latin American situation dear brother 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.399
 is repeating the famous canteen movie the little father 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.569
 in which the sermon he pronounced 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.119
 it's extraordinary 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.889
 says things like this 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.059
 how it changes every hand 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.819
 I used to see a woman come and think how she will look naked 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.819
 Now watch her come and think how she will look dressed 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.649
 but the end of the sermon of the father of cantinflas 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.789
 It is formidable because it describes everything that humanity is at this time 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.339
 today what you say 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.200
 nothing is good or bad 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200
 If not the opposite 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.919
 in germany nazi 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.930
 the church of Rome was an ally of Hitler 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.199
 one of the masterpieces of romania literature is that the vicar 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.889
 that they dedicated it to papa pio 12 precisely 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.959
 for his openly favorable attitude towards the Jews' holocaust 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.199
 but the Lutheran church of germany 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.819
 as openly support is known for the racist regime for a long time 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.709
 there was an exception 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.709
 a clandestine Christian militant 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:17.059
 di filippo pozzato 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:21.119
 who ended up on the gallows as a modern martyr for opposing tyranny 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.110
 and his voice 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.400
 is still listening 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.110
 because tigers opportunity 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.460
 therefore this 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.659
 for the lack of protest against the Protestants 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.229
 Latin America has themes to meditate deeply on the liberators 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.259
 he was more friends with the Protestants 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.450
 you know why because the Protestants were fighting 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.460
 to Spain 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.460
 that was the Catholic power par excellence 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.990
 and there stories like the one that counts for example here in argentina jose 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.949
 engineers 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.110
 of how liberator san martín invited to come to live in Argentina the 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.800
 doctor lucas pablo torres diego ponson 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.930
 who veered from the liver pure vote the first churches the hunt was not 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.029
 renewed mode 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.180
 and we also know the case of lucas martí bush 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.830
 another famous missionary who was in Chile supported by ogilvy ins 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.099
 and then in Bolivia supported by his creel persona 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:30.240
 I do not know if he suffers and mateos 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.069
 ariana some dialogue and about what happened to the president's possession 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.639
 evo morals forgive 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.499
 because before going to the public authorities to lend their lament 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.949
 He appeared at the door of the sun 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.509
 in which he returns as 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.800
 and was fulfilled by a shaman 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 consecrating it to dad iii 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.949
 and pachamama the earth 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.499
 already at the end 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:58.039
 the Scream 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.039
 live coca 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.550
 a similar case in Ecuador with all due respect to President Rafael Belt 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.689
 also before going to the congress he will lend his oath 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:14.339
 was anointed by a samán indicate 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:16.559
 said savior inti papa 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:18.569
 and pachamama 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.569
 a lady from Friday in Bogota last Sunday happened to me 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.110
 tell me one thing that those countries to which God was consecrated 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:27.839
 The only thing that occurred to me to answer them 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.839
 you have the answer in your heart 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.560
 all that is the fault of Spain that did not know how to give the image and sara our indigenous 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.270
 and locals wanted to impose by force and strength the blood fed 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.580
 it is famous the anecdote for example of a Dominican of the inquisition 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.289
 in his dialogue with atahualpa the emperor 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.439
 Of the Incas 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.129
 and tells 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.330
 you are a savage 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.289
 because he loves to be 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.660
 and Atahualpa responds more wild you are that convinces you studies 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.729
 an irony about transubstantiation 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:11.559
 if he had allowed them a god of love 

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:14.499
 things would be very different 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.379
 by hand 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.899
 how are things in this society pus Christian 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:25.759
 and again pagan, all that is missing is that in Greece the head of state goes to 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.039
 partenón and credited an afternoon bull according to positions saints 

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:35.110
 or that in Spain 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.449
 the first Minister 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.809
 returns a goat in front of the 

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:44.080
 parana xiv of summer sa of mythology 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.259
 before going to take possession of two cuts 

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:50.409
 now that we should seek the indigenous claim yes sir 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:51.860
 we agree 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.800
 but the claim of the indigenous people is not made through the 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.650
 idolatry because the idolatry anna villar regenerate and nobody claims the 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.850
 idolatry the only time again 

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.170
 poverty and violence
