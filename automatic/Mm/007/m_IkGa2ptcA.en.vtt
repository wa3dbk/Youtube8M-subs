thing<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.870> look<00:02:24.440> at<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.769> reflection<00:02:25.550> off<00:02:25.730> the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
thing is look at the reflection off the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.850 
thing is look at the reflection off the
gun<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:27.620> seems<00:02:28.130> very<00:02:28.430> nice<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.860> obviously

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
gun that seems very nice and obviously

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.729 
gun that seems very nice and obviously
it<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> higher<00:02:31.700> polygon<00:02:32.330> polygon<00:02:33.290> count<00:02:33.590> as

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
it is a higher polygon polygon count as

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.900 
it is a higher polygon polygon count as
well<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.190> gun<00:02:34.430> looks<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:35.090> lot<00:02:35.660> more<00:02:35.900> sharper

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
well the gun looks a a lot more sharper

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.090 
well the gun looks a a lot more sharper
much<00:02:37.910> more<00:02:38.180> detail<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.959> it<00:02:39.320> looks<00:02:39.560> rounder

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
much more detail and it looks rounder

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.710 
much more detail and it looks rounder
too<00:02:43.090> ok<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.269> as<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:45.050> terms<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.530> FPS<00:02:46.310> wise<00:02:46.820> as<00:02:47.269> in

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
too ok and as in terms of FPS wise as in

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.940 
too ok and as in terms of FPS wise as in
frames<00:02:48.260> per<00:02:48.470> second<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.870> really<00:02:50.870> liked<00:02:51.170> modern

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
frames per second I really liked modern

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.780 
frames per second I really liked modern
combat<00:02:52.250> 3<00:02:52.459> because<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:54.260> was<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:55.010> really<00:02:55.519> seemed

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
combat 3 because it was it really seemed

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.350 
combat 3 because it was it really seemed
like<00:02:55.989> 60fps<00:02:56.989> most<00:02:57.680> at<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:58.040> time<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:58.610> you're<00:02:59.150> not

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
like 60fps most at a time but you're not

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.790 
like 60fps most at a time but you're not
gonna<00:02:59.540> get<00:02:59.780> this<00:02:59.959> here<00:03:00.230> at<00:03:00.350> least<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.680> the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
gonna get this here at least on the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.280 
gonna get this here at least on the
galaxy<00:03:01.190> note<00:03:01.220> 2<00:03:01.580> I'm<00:03:02.390> seeing<00:03:02.720> somewhere

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
galaxy note 2 I'm seeing somewhere

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.280 
galaxy note 2 I'm seeing somewhere
between<00:03:03.910> 20<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.940> 30<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.630> I'm<00:03:05.810> just<00:03:06.050> eyeballing

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
between 20 to 30 if I'm just eyeballing

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.080 
between 20 to 30 if I'm just eyeballing
it<00:03:06.800> here<00:03:07.300> also<00:03:08.530> see<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.739> there's<00:03:10.160> like<00:03:10.370> they

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
it here also see that there's like they

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.479 
it here also see that there's like they
want<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.360> show<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.130> reflections<00:03:13.130> off<00:03:13.310> the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
want to show you the reflections off the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.970 
want to show you the reflections off the
water<00:03:13.700> that's<00:03:14.000> pretty<00:03:14.239> nice<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.650> sky

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
water that's pretty nice and the sky

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.340 
water that's pretty nice and the sky
looks<00:03:16.280> amazing<00:03:16.820> that<00:03:17.000> really<00:03:17.030> like<00:03:17.540> looks

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350

like the real deal ok so yeah with all
these<00:03:23.900> uh<00:03:23.959> graphic<00:03:24.709> improvements<00:03:25.390> there's

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
these uh graphic improvements there's

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.000 
these uh graphic improvements there's
definitely<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.260> performance<00:03:27.980> hit<00:03:29.440> ok<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.470> one

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
definitely a performance hit ok and one

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.580 
definitely a performance hit ok and one
thing<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.370> do<00:03:31.880> want<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.420> point<00:03:33.020> out<00:03:33.200> is

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
thing I do want to point out is

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.650 
thing I do want to point out is
and<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:34.790> modern<00:03:35.060> combat<00:03:35.420> 3<00:03:35.629> if<00:03:36.349> you<00:03:36.410> hit<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
and in modern combat 3 if you hit the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.759 
and in modern combat 3 if you hit the
hit<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.870> zoom<00:03:39.200> button

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
hit that zoom button

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.190 
hit that zoom button
right<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:42.590> were<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:44.090> automatically<00:03:44.900> locked

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
right you were it automatically locked

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.470 
right you were it automatically locked
you<00:03:45.349> onto<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> target<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:46.190> easy<00:03:46.489> I'm<00:03:47.060> not<00:03:47.120> sure

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
you onto a target and easy I'm not sure

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.839 
you onto a target and easy I'm not sure
about<00:03:47.750> other<00:03:48.080> modes<00:03:48.440> but<00:03:48.819> definitely<00:03:49.819> that

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
about other modes but definitely that

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.360 
about other modes but definitely that
isn't<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.510> case<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.500> do<00:03:51.709> need<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.099> get<00:03:52.250> up

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
isn't the case you do need to get up

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.759 
isn't the case you do need to get up
pretty<00:03:52.580> close<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:53.330> you<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.870> need<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.379> do<00:03:54.739> a

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
pretty close and you do need to do a

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.509 
pretty close and you do need to do a
little<00:03:55.190> bit<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:56.739> finding<00:03:57.739> your<00:03:57.890> enemy<00:03:58.340> and

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
little bit of finding your enemy and

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.270 
little bit of finding your enemy and
then<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.060> then<00:03:59.840> that<00:03:59.870> auto<00:04:00.290> lock<00:04:00.650> on<00:04:00.860> works

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
then and then that auto lock on works

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.509 
then and then that auto lock on works
but<00:04:01.580> it's<00:04:01.760> not<00:04:02.030> as<00:04:02.239> easy<00:04:02.660> as<00:04:02.810> before<00:04:03.519> maybe

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
but it's not as easy as before maybe

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.640 
but it's not as easy as before maybe
modern<00:04:04.910> combat<00:04:05.269> 3<00:04:05.450> was<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:05.959> little<00:04:06.319> bit<00:04:06.470> too

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
modern combat 3 was a little bit too

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.699 
modern combat 3 was a little bit too
easy<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:08.090> is<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.329> at<00:04:08.900> least<00:04:09.170> two<00:04:09.440> steps

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
easy and this is a at least two steps

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.550 
easy and this is a at least two steps
more<00:04:10.269> difficult<00:04:11.269> if<00:04:11.569> you're<00:04:11.870> looking<00:04:12.260> for

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
more difficult if you're looking for

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.920 
more difficult if you're looking for
that<00:04:12.739> same<00:04:13.280> kind<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.819> experience<00:04:15.940> ok<00:04:16.940> but<00:04:17.419> ya

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
that same kind of experience ok but ya

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.229 
that same kind of experience ok but ya
know<00:04:18.769> obviously<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.280> can't<00:04:19.549> do<00:04:19.639> a<00:04:19.669> whole<00:04:19.940> game

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
know obviously I can't do a whole game

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.030 
know obviously I can't do a whole game

that<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:36.949> try<00:04:37.310> playing<00:04:37.610> this<00:04:37.850> game<00:04:38.060> with<00:04:38.300> the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
that I try playing this game with the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.440 
that I try playing this game with the
USB<00:04:39.770> OTG<00:04:40.220> controller<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.520> ps3

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
USB OTG controller and the ps3

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.810 
USB OTG controller and the ps3
controller<00:04:44.479> I<00:04:45.229> thought<00:04:45.919> maybe<00:04:46.340> they<00:04:46.669> would

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
controller I thought maybe they would

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.000 
controller I thought maybe they would
make<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.450> ps3<00:04:47.900> controller<00:04:48.289> work<00:04:48.530> this<00:04:48.770> time

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
make the ps3 controller work this time

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.339 
make the ps3 controller work this time
because<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.760> ps2<00:04:50.180> controller<00:04:50.450> did<00:04:50.930> not<00:04:51.110> work

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
because the ps2 controller did not work

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.290 
because the ps2 controller did not work
on<00:04:51.500> modern<00:04:51.889> combat<00:04:52.099> 3<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.550> only<00:04:52.820> map<00:04:53.030> that

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
on modern combat 3 the only map that

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.740 
on modern combat 3 the only map that
buttons<00:04:53.960> on<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.260> half<00:04:55.190> on<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:56.030> right<00:04:56.210> side<00:04:56.539> of

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
buttons on the half on the right side of

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.810 
buttons on the half on the right side of
it<00:04:56.990> but<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.620> was<00:04:57.889> surprised<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.400> find<00:04:58.430> out<00:04:58.760> that

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
it but I was surprised to find out that

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.409 
it but I was surprised to find out that
you<00:04:59.060> could<00:04:59.210> actually<00:04:59.330> move<00:05:00.820> not<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:02.060> way<00:05:02.210> but

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
you could actually move not that way but

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.770 
you could actually move not that way but
move<00:05:02.660> forward<00:05:03.650> backward<00:05:04.130> left<00:05:04.160> and<00:05:04.669> right<00:05:04.880> but

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
move forward backward left and right but

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.350 
move forward backward left and right but
you<00:05:05.900> were<00:05:06.020> not<00:05:06.229> able<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.639> write<00:05:07.639> this<00:05:08.000> part

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
you were not able to write this part

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.659 
you were not able to write this part
worked<00:05:08.810> read<00:05:09.349> with<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:09.800> d-pad<00:05:09.979> as<00:05:10.310> well<00:05:10.490> but

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
worked read with the d-pad as well but

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.089 
worked read with the d-pad as well but
data<00:05:11.300> map<00:05:11.630> just<00:05:12.050> like<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.530> only<00:05:12.680> thing<00:05:12.830> they

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
data map just like the only thing they

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.640 
data map just like the only thing they
didn't<00:05:13.520> map<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.940> seems<00:05:14.210> so<00:05:14.870> it's<00:05:14.990> once<00:05:15.530> again

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
didn't map it seems so it's once again

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.790 
didn't map it seems so it's once again
useless<00:05:16.310> if<00:05:16.520> you're<00:05:16.669> not<00:05:16.910> rooted<00:05:17.229> so<00:05:18.229> you

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
useless if you're not rooted so you

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.930 
useless if you're not rooted so you
would<00:05:18.950> have<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.460> route<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.690> device<00:05:21.639> and<00:05:22.639> then

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
would have to route the device and then

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.750 
would have to route the device and then
use<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:24.500> know<00:05:24.620> connect<00:05:25.010> over<00:05:25.250> Bluetooth

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
use the you know connect over Bluetooth

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.610 
use the you know connect over Bluetooth
and<00:05:26.180> use<00:05:26.510> sixaxis<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:28.520> play<00:05:29.050> water<00:05:30.050> in<00:05:30.229> combat

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
and use sixaxis to play water in combat

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.159 
and use sixaxis to play water in combat
with<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.979> ps3<00:05:31.400> controller<00:05:31.970> so<00:05:32.690> anyway<00:05:32.960> that's

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
with the ps3 controller so anyway that's

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.080 
with the ps3 controller so anyway that's
