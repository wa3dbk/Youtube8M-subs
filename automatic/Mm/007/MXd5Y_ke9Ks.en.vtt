the<00:00:47.430> Colts<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> two<00:00:48.210> deep<00:00:48.390> coverage<00:00:48.840> which

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the Colts have a two deep coverage which

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.630 
the Colts have a two deep coverage which
means<00:00:49.649> they're<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> little<00:00:50.039> bit<00:00:50.219> late<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
means they're a little bit late in the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.920 
means they're a little bit late in the
box<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.360> an<00:00:51.449> extra<00:00:51.750> run

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
box they don't have an extra run

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.810 
box they don't have an extra run
defender<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> good<00:00:53.190> opportunity<00:00:53.430> for

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
defender so it's a good opportunity for

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
defender so it's a good opportunity for
us<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> run<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> ball<00:00:55.230> we're<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.530> shotgun
