 Hello friends

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:13.220
 let's prepare a chop suey loin of 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.590
 pig we are going to need 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:20.150
 pork loin diced 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.300
 carrot cut into strips or julienne strips 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.320
 paprika or cut green paprika cut 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.160
 in strips celery cut into pieces onion 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.370
 finely chopped cabbage cut into 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.500
 strips of sprout of germinated rice 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.430
 they get in any supermarket and 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.600
 scallion cut in en accomplis 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.030
 soy sauce and olive oil if you have 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.150
 the possibility of getting oil from 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.790
 sesame seeds for the end 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.030
 a very hot one we add oil of 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.030
 olive 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.480
 and we sauté 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.670
 can not be 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.680
 all right 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.470
 the leg 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.620
 until golden 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.650
 we add the pinch of salt so that 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.880
 giving 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.880
 about the preparation 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.880
 already at this point the wind with the boat 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 or the dog farm 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.150
 there at that point we incorporate the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.150
 onion 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.030
 we sauté 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.619
 all right 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.510
 to incorporate the flavors of the 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.510
 onion with pork 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.910
 with 12 seconds 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.910
 the onion 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.020
 at this point when the onion is 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.660
 clarified and somewhat soft in the 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.660
 moment to incorporate the carrot 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.190
 we mix 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.080
 in the carrot take this little color more 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.160
 more alive and we incorporate 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.160
 the cabbage 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.440
 It's cabbage time because 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.540
 he is going to throw away all his liquid and goes to 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.860
 make the preparation a bit 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.860
 more consistency 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.879
 and join all the flavors 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.879
 We say carrot onion 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.330
 if you see that in the preparation 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.070
 he is staying a little dry I'm going to 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.070
 add a little more oil 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.930
 and at this point we incorporate the paprika 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.440
 we want 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.709
 this preparation is very easy very fast 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.840
 the advantage of having a good house 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.250
 will be much tastier to the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.660
 preparation 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.660
 we incorporate the celery 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.950
 in the skin will provide an aroma and a 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.330
 very particular flavor of the community 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.940
 Asian already at this point 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.340
 to finish we incorporate the outbreaks 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.340
 of sprouted rice and chives 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:25.580
 a trickle of sesame oil 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.580
 not very much because it is very invasive 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.590
 we just want to reinforce the two a little 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.590
 flavors 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.780
 can be 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.940
 I am 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.810
 of pork and ready an easy recipe and 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.160
 fast that only in 10 minutes or less 10 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.260
 minutes we did it together with you 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.930
 hoping you enjoy it very nutritious 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.290
 tasty to enjoy with the family and
