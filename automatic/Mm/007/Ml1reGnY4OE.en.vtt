00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
how it works with multiple eggs I saw

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.460 
how it works with multiple eggs I saw
later<00:02:12.190> on<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.610> trailer<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.350> can

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
later on in the trailer that you you can

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.930 
later on in the trailer that you you can
actually<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.890> boat<00:02:15.190> outside<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.880> ship

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
actually have a boat outside of the ship

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.810

so<00:02:16.630> stop<00:02:16.960> which<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.410> game<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.460> game<00:02:18.640> map

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
so stop which the game that the game map

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.280 
so stop which the game that the game map
is<00:02:18.940> not<00:02:18.970> restricted<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.750> ship<00:02:19.930> itself

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290
