00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
get this theme out of here and I went

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.540 
get this theme out of here and I went
upstairs<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.630> told<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.960> floor<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.550> we're

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
upstairs and told the floor up we're

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.130 
upstairs and told the floor up we're
cutting<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.000> real<00:00:21.359> hard<00:00:21.570> thing<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:22.020> because

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
cutting a real hard thing to do because

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.500 
cutting a real hard thing to do because
this<00:00:22.320> poor<00:00:22.560> thing<00:00:22.590> pulls<00:00:23.039> out<00:00:23.189> before<00:00:23.580> when

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
this poor thing pulls out before when

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.230 
this poor thing pulls out before when
they<00:00:24.689> ran<00:00:24.930> their<00:00:25.140> original<00:00:25.529> old<00:00:25.680> wiring<00:00:26.240> and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
they ran their original old wiring and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.009 
they ran their original old wiring and
this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> beam<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.769> runs<00:00:29.010> across<00:00:29.189> there

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
this is the beam they runs across there

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.090 
this is the beam they runs across there
that<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> six<00:00:32.160> plus<00:00:32.399> six<00:00:32.989> beam<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.440> believe

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that is a six plus six beam I believe

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940 
that is a six plus six beam I believe
that<00:00:35.219> runs<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.940> length<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> house<00:00:36.950> it's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that runs the length of the house it's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.830 
that runs the length of the house it's
pretty<00:00:38.219> huge<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.180> beyond<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.570> have

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
pretty huge and two beyond it we have

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
pretty huge and two beyond it we have
that<00:00:40.079> board<00:00:40.469> downstairs<00:00:41.070> ain't<00:00:41.340> holding<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that board downstairs ain't holding it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.139 
that board downstairs ain't holding it
up<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.460> thinking<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> don't<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.059> any

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
up so I'm thinking I don't have any

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
up so I'm thinking I don't have any
trouble<00:00:45.329> taking<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> settled

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
trouble taking that out what I settled

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.200 
trouble taking that out what I settled
in<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.640> was<00:00:47.910> fixing<00:00:48.809> these<00:00:48.930> steps<00:00:49.910> these<00:00:50.910> steps

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
in on was fixing these steps these steps

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.100 
in on was fixing these steps these steps
were<00:00:51.420> broken<00:00:52.640> the<00:00:53.640> edges<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
were broken the edges of the of the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.250 
were broken the edges of the of the
things<00:00:55.559> were<00:00:55.739> broken<00:00:56.010> off<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.239> saw<00:00:58.109> my

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
things were broken off and I saw my

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.470 
things were broken off and I saw my
brother-in-law<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.070> few<00:00:59.280> years<00:00:59.550> ago<00:00:59.699> use<00:01:00.210> wood

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
brother-in-law a few years ago use wood

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
brother-in-law a few years ago use wood
putty<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.899> fix<00:01:01.109> them<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.530> didn't<00:01:01.739> think

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
putty to fix them with I didn't think

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.759 
putty to fix them with I didn't think
him<00:01:01.980> strong<00:01:02.340> enough<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.619> here's<00:01:04.619> one
