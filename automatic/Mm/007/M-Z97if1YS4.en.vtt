00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.400
 Did you know that 43% of Spaniards 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.180
 Do not use photoresists correctly? 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.689
 I'm Aurora Garre, 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.640
 expert from the Medical Department of Cinfa, 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.760
 and I will explain how to protect ourselves from the sun properly. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.460
 Although the sun has beneficial effects for our health, 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.840
 It can also cause irreversible damage to our skin 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.800
 if we do not take adequate protective measures. 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.280
 The most frequent and visible sun injuries 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.560
 are the burns 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.760
 caused by ultraviolet radiation. 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.480
 But also, 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.100
 infrared radiation A 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.520
 penetrates the deeper layers of the skin 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 and it attacks our cells. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.820
 Thus, it causes the premature aging of the skin 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.700
 and it damages the DNA, 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.660
 increasing the risk of suffering melanoma 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.560
 or skin cancer. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 To protect your skin from the sun properly, 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.540
 Remember these ten tips: 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.400
 Strengthen your skin's natural defenses 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.580
 with a diet rich in antioxidants. 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.200
 Use sunscreens 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.680
 with a minimum protection factor of 30, 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.880
 that protect against ultraviolet radiation A and B 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.200
 and the infrared A. 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.740
 Apply them half an hour before before sunbathing 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.680
 and re-apply them every two hours 

00:01:22.838 --> 00:01:23.970
 and after the bath. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420
 Use higher sunscreens 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.260
 in environments with snow, sand and water, 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.080
 that reflect the radiations. 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.760
 It goes in the shade, 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.960
 He uses hats and sunglasses. 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.200
 Avoid exposing yourself to the sun in the days 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.720
 with higher radiation index. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.360
 You can check them through 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.280
 of channels like the AEMET. 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.260
 Do not take the sun between 12 and 4 in the afternoon. 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.060
 Protect yourself all year long; not only in summer. 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.960
 Children under 3 years old 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.500
 they should not be exposed to the sun. 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.220
 If you have any doubts, consult your pharmacist. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.520
 Remember that the skin has memory 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.880
 and taking good care of it today is health for tomorrow. 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.331
 See you soon 

00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:05.311
