00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.109
 happy good day people is the kevin 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.580
 with me i have the baxter he is 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.099
 operates as a grave analyst or 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.250
 just as a guest at riot or on the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.109
 Event and yes I wanted you first 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.260
 First of all, what do you actually have? 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.119
 after you made love so well 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 when I came home I have got myself 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.060
 ok I have to take a break first 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.220
 to have 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.359
 I have been for many weeks now 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.949
 again the stop-pages are new weeks 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.260
 I'll be back at home and that's okay 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.489
 I was again in briefly for a while 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.920
 angeles has a bit of rheydt there 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.690
 worked on what game balancing is concerned 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.090
 I was a week since he has 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.399
 helped for the 75 and so on 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.059
 give a little feedback and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.870
 that's what I have to play at home again 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.239
 I do not really want to because I 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.680
 hate it between in the meantime 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.510
 Both aim to play okay therefore 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 makes a little break and I'm building 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.629
 think about what could I do and then 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.480
 I have just as I said 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.829
 ibm I thought then okay me 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.750
 ask if they are the ones we need 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 especially and I'm just with the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.619
 whole people with the next stop well 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.470
 so and then I asked yes here 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.540
 How could it possibly be 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.500
 so be helpful and ask 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.210
 then at some point has the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.869
 possible just that I'm a clown here 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.430
 can make 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.470
 and they were keen hold 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.200
 to engage myself so long as 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 analyst and then with that I have 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.860
 not much done so too 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.689
 I play home and stream 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.310
 and things like that, of course, as anyone but 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.600
 really work out 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.710
 I can not do that , I stop 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.780
 just take a break until the end of the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.680
 Year one with new year I will 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 Of course, then watch how it goes on 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 do you like the job as analyst 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.820
 would you you can imagine on 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.840
 perhaps in accordance to your career 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.329
 player to continue or as 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.189
 to make a full-time job 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.170
 So I know what I imagine 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.420
 could be done as a full-time job 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.700
 option definitely i want to go though 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.820
 gain experience in each case first 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.939
 In all areas so be analyst 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 caster know players coach and something 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.540
 I just have to look what's mine 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.099
 I like what I want to do and me 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.030
 my experience you collect here 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.560
 for example with this whole 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.180
 Broadcasting is definitely 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.910
 I would say bring you on 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.560
 alive 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.170
 and I know you can do it yourself 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.820
 my yes so I can imagine it 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.780
 I do not know where I am going yet 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.350
 definitely wants to play 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.150
 but probably in the future I mean 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.220
 Do I work black because I still work 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.870
 not because I mean you can stop 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.900
 back to the university 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.240
 go or find training wise 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.320
 I gossip but as I said so me 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.910
 could imagine me anyway 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.920
 Something in the direction of this 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.420
 work 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.600
 It was very good impression ever 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.710
 from her actually no question what 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.210
 actually many people are interested 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.090
 maybe you would like it too 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.310
 live in america investigator is if there are many 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.030
 Heavy phases were easier phases 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.210
 probably the hardest part was 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.440
 in the beginning because it's the beginning 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.970
 actually pretty easy because you 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.750
 do you know people i know mine 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:08.290
 europeans are imported here very big 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.730
 but after that it will be okay 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.910
 Do not you have a car in Los Angeles 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.020
 Everything is an hour's drive away 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.510
 Can someone ask manager if they are 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.310
 is driving around for an hour and then 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.630
 somehow you have to go out white 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.190
 So the problem that if you in so 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.140
 a closed neighborhood where i am 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.790
 you want to live there someday 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.650
 out of the house because you can not 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.780
 always dry throughout the house 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.280
 and only play is so as I said there 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.830
 then I did not mind and 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.880
 then you have the time where you even ok 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.330
 I'm not bothered about the whole thing 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.830
 shit but you have then keep it 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.790
 then reads relatively well actually had 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.989
 spring split we have this rank 3 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.690
 then have completed in the playoffs 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.800
 but also andrei would have done but think 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.660
 I can achieve more and then have 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.380
 we can with the line up on each one 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.020
 case to see 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.989
 we have to be extremely strong play 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.489
 we were split with cera 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.110
 Extremely much problems started and were 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.970
 still ranked first for five weeks 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.890
 and then the point really came where 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.810
 I'm ok, actually, I want you 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.250
 love because the atmosphere has me too 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.500
 not liked and that was despite us 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.720
 Wrote one and was ok I have to 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.250
 really even if we drive fast 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.440
 and so I will not be here next 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.760
 play year because somehow I like it 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.620
 it does not have anything to do with life now 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.140
 to do in los angeles 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.270
 or something but somehow with the 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.600
 I did not come across people playfully 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.530
 is okay but if you are outside then 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.780
 not really 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.040
 has to do with it then it's me somehow 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.410
 my I would not say I am 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.030
 the social to human but I am already 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.240
 not really as introverted as that 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.889
 whole cd player and then someday 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.250
 turning stop by almost as if I 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.960
 say 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.810
 and so I tell myself just so good 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.880
 I have to get out and go anyway 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.720
 angeles enjoyed life pretty much 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.889
 and then in the end I had stopped there 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.540
 one holds extremely many kindly 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.710
 and then make the decision 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.960
 well you now simply goes back to 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.280
 europe there is of course the contact to 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.419
 I need many people in Europe 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.560
 my if you are a player now 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.000
 comes back then you have of course 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.770
 Extremely many benefits from here was 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.140
 i think my north america is probable 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.700
 the stronger region was infrastructure 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:16.210
 infrastructure is called coaches nls 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.370
 better gaming houses more money so what 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.300
 Salary and stuff is everything 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.360
 That's right 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.979
 and when I came back I first got that 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.110
 difference noticed to the European 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.690
 scene that the whole infrastructure in 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.120
 europe actually pretty bad so until 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.010
 on a two teams here in europe here 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.290
 really active in trying it better 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.140
 it's pretty pretty to do 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.780
 You have to say pretty weak and yes 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.190
 I mean, I like to live where the me 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.510
 So work leads if I did bock 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.669
 on a team became with people too 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.840
 play 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.280
 north america or europe is me 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.990
 It does not really matter then, after all 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.690
 yes it has such a hard time or too 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.750
 a simple experience you have experienced 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.030
 When I first have a nice Christmas 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.760
 and a happy new year 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.620
 Just repeat it and do it strongly 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.669
 you will come next year 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.289
 Any graduation will be at one 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.169
 German fans give or generally 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.750
 his fans i do not know how many 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:17.740
 German fans are so there are a few 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.510
 In any case, my thanks for I know 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.050
 that a few people always stream 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.370
 there are also german fans and 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.690
 yes finds support in any case many 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.640
 thanks and I would probably 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.289
 soon again sometime early 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.270
 So to stream even really early 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.860
 Stream every day for eight hours 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.700
 to get in there too 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.919
 I'm probably a bit German 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.640
 stream and I mean if the bock have 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.310
 could just switch on 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.820
