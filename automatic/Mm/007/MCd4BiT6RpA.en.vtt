00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
show you how to pitch it so when we tick

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.640 
show you how to pitch it so when we tick
it<00:00:26.400> out<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.880> see<00:00:27.690> that<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.170> elastic

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it out I see that we have this elastic

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.590 
it out I see that we have this elastic
strap<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.160> goes<00:00:29.220> around<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.640> tent<00:00:29.850> here<00:00:30.060> all

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
strap that goes around the tent here all

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.250 
strap that goes around the tent here all
we<00:00:30.750> need<00:00:30.870> to<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.110> is<00:00:31.350> just<00:00:31.620> tick<00:00:31.860> that<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
we need to do is just tick that off and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.540 
we need to do is just tick that off and
then<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.500> best<00:00:34.649> way<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> pitch<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.249> tent<00:00:35.280> is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
then the best way to pitch the tent is

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.829 
then the best way to pitch the tent is
actually<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> throw<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.600> let<00:00:36.809> it

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
actually just to throw it up and let it

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:39.319 
actually just to throw it up and let it
sort<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.079> tick<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:38.039> sort<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.370> rough<00:00:38.730> shape<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
sort of tick it's sort of rough shape to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.910 
sort of tick it's sort of rough shape to
start<00:00:39.539> with<00:00:41.569> just<00:00:42.569> like<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.620> really

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
start with just like so it's really

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.200 
start with just like so it's really
really<00:00:44.129> easy<00:00:44.159> because<00:00:44.699> then<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.059> need<00:00:45.089> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
really easy because then all you need to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.970 
really easy because then all you need to
do<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.929> around<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.350> pitch<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> from

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
hydrostatic head of 4000 mil as you can

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.330 
hydrostatic head of 4000 mil as you can
see<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.900> use<00:01:07.080> these<00:01:07.380> luminous<00:01:07.890> guidelines

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
see we use these luminous guidelines

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.450 
see we use these luminous guidelines
which<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:08.700> pre<00:01:08.940> attached<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> tent

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
which are pre attached to the tent

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
which are pre attached to the tent
advantage<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> being<00:01:12.270> luminous<00:01:12.570> obviously

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
advantage of being luminous obviously

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.360 
advantage of being luminous obviously
it's<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.590> much<00:01:13.710> more<00:01:13.890> visible<00:01:14.040> when

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
it's going to be much more visible when

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.860 
it's going to be much more visible when
it's<00:01:14.490> dark<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.880> hopefully<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.510> won't<00:01:15.600> trip

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
it's dark and hopefully you won't trip

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.760 
it's dark and hopefully you won't trip
over<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.110> quite<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.440> easily

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
over it quite as easily

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.100 
over it quite as easily
each<00:01:17.460> Guylaine<00:01:17.910> also<00:01:18.300> has<00:01:18.450> its<00:01:18.660> own<00:01:18.750> retainer

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
each Guylaine also has its own retainer

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.540 
each Guylaine also has its own retainer
so<00:01:19.440> that<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.800> comes<00:01:19.980> to<00:01:20.130> ticking<00:01:20.430> down

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
so that when it comes to ticking down

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
a toggle on the inside here so that

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.900 
a toggle on the inside here so that

could just be rolled up and popped into

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.500 
could just be rolled up and popped into
that<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:09.560> one<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.580> main<00:02:10.700> features<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:11.060> the

leave the front door open and that will

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.520 
leave the front door open and that will
also<00:03:19.910> help<00:03:20.180> get<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.570> air<00:03:20.720> out<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.320> tent

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
also help get the air out of the tent

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.740 
also help get the air out of the tent
when<00:03:21.709> we<00:03:21.890> fold<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.220> down<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:23.330> there's<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.600> bit<00:03:23.720> of

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
when we fold it down so there's a bit of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.300 
when we fold it down so there's a bit of
a<00:03:23.840> technique<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.560> putting<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.010> tent<00:03:25.160> away

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
a technique to putting the tent away

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.280 
a technique to putting the tent away
what<00:03:25.670> we<00:03:25.790> do<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.120> we<00:03:26.239> gather<00:03:26.420> up<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.690> poles<00:03:26.930> all

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
what we do is we gather up the poles all

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.229 
what we do is we gather up the poles all
in<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.739> middle<00:03:27.980> like<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:28.850> just<00:03:29.000> grab

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
in the middle like this so we just grab

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.680 
in the middle like this so we just grab
two<00:03:29.510> end<00:03:30.440> ones<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.920> meet<00:03:31.160> them<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.459> middle

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
two end ones and meet them in the middle

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.390 
two end ones and meet them in the middle
like<00:03:32.690> this

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
like this

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.530 
like this
once<00:03:34.400> it's<00:03:34.549> in<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.790> position<00:03:34.970> here<00:03:35.390> we're

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
once it's in this position here we're

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.220 
once it's in this position here we're
just<00:03:35.690> turn<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> tent<00:03:36.170> on<00:03:36.320> its<00:03:36.470> side<00:03:36.680> like<00:03:36.950> so

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
just turn the tent on its side like so

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.750 
just turn the tent on its side like so
and<00:03:39.230> then<00:03:39.350> we<00:03:39.440> take<00:03:39.590> this<00:03:39.739> pool<00:03:39.950> here<00:03:40.220> we're

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
and then we take this pool here we're

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.130 
and then we take this pool here we're
just<00:03:40.790> going<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> tuck<00:03:41.239> that<00:03:41.269> in<00:03:41.600> underneath

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
just going to tuck that in underneath

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.710 
just going to tuck that in underneath
into<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.799> middle<00:03:43.010> like<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:44.330> that's<00:03:44.480> we

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
into the middle like that and that's we

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.210 
into the middle like that and that's we
it's<00:03:44.870> two<00:03:45.019> circles<00:03:46.570> like<00:03:47.570> so<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.950> once<00:03:49.100> you're

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
it's two circles like so so once you're

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.440 
it's two circles like so so once you're
in<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.370> position<00:03:49.459> here<00:03:49.940> I'm<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.180> going<00:03:50.360> to

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
in this position here I'm just going to

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.810 
in this position here I'm just going to
push<00:03:50.630> all<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.900> air<00:03:50.930> over<00:03:51.799> the<00:03:51.830> tent<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.400> then

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
push all the air over the tent and then

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.240 
push all the air over the tent and then
grab<00:03:53.299> hold<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.260> whole<00:03:54.440> thing<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
grab hold of the the whole thing and

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.340 
grab hold of the the whole thing and
lift<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.519> up<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:56.090> all<00:03:56.540> we<00:03:56.660> need<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.840> do<00:03:57.019> then<00:03:57.200> is

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
lift it up and all we need to do then is

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.699 
lift it up and all we need to do then is
just<00:03:57.620> look<00:03:57.860> at<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.610> elastic<00:03:59.030> strap<00:03:59.530> pop<00:04:00.530> that

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
just look at the elastic strap pop that

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.670
