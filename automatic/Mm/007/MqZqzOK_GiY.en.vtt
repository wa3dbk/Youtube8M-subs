00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.839
 good in this tutorial let's see how 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.809
 a mask is made in flash we go to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.419
 create a new document and I'm going to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:21.350
 import a photo file import me what 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.350
 I will import to the photo 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.000
 the photo has stayed 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.940
 in the library the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.560
 to do is to create a fund a fund to which 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.440
 it will not affect the mask 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.770
 what he's going to do is see a cemetery 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.930
 through a route 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.350
 Well, I'm going to do just what I do not 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.820
 know the first sing 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.989
 but I'm going to do for example a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.989
 rectangle in color 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.519
 and I'm going to call this layer for him 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.370
 this is not going to affect the mask 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.640
 I'm going to create film frames 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.270
 f5 to create me 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.150
 now above this layer I'm going to 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.760
 put the photo of the cemetery where I'm going 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.970
 to call the lid 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.820
 and me 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.310
 drag 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.800
 the photo to this layer as it is a little 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 larger than the lame scenario 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.660
 free transformation tool and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.620
 get pressed so you do not miss me 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.620
 the proportions 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.630
 and in the parts I like them because I do not know 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 stay out 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.310
 above this I'm going to do 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.390
 go back to making a layer and I'm going to draw 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.550
 a ghost 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.880
 This is the ghost I'm going to turn 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.590
 in symbol to remove the channel to 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.990
 to sing 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.100
 white I'm going to take the oval tool 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.909
 what is the fastest 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.909
 and an oval 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.170
 iquitos sonar can get it out of some 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170
 type over here 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.340
 I'm going to draw but we know 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.069
 I'm never commando to go a 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.010
 and other little faster 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.230
 this so they do not want me the same no 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.800
 it's a little bit bigger eye and this 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.060
 here in the middle by he took it off 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.060
 I'm going to draw two dots 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.550
 I already have the ghost selected him and 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.350
 I say modify convert into symbol 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.030
 sea graphic 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.770
 being a graphic symbol has 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.770
 properties that I can remove 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.810
 and what I'm going to do is 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.100
 interpolation to go through a 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.440
 scenario, the first thing I do is make 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:08.810
 one click above and here on properties 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.020
 symbols say that all of alpha color 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.710
 and I'm going to go down I put a 10 and 2 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.560
 percent a music like that 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.810
 I'm going to create a classic interpolation 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.580
 so that the ghost goes through the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.930
 scenario and I'm going to do it a little more 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.450
 big 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.220
 here in the 60 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.200
 I'm going to take one up here and also 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.780
 I'm going to notice it a bit so I'll go 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.040
 rotating 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.790
 and here in heaven 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.790
 asaja 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.879
 a little easier 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.709
 and now I'm going to draw the mask the 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.920
 mask are the objects through the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.720
 which I will see certain parts of the 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.110
 stage 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.030
 I drew again, you ask me 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.200
 I'm going to do with the rectangle it will be more 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.040
 easy 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.040
 color that is paid 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.940
 approaching I 'm going 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.190
 this like very salty love double click and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.190
 I'm going to apply it taking 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.280
 taking 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.780
 when I turn this into the mask 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.520
 objects that put with mask are the 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.460
 that are going to see through these 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.460
 drawings is worth then I'm going to put here more 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:55.860
 windows and the only thing I have to do 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.630
 is to turn this into a mask the ghost 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.569
 I want you to affect the mask again 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.039
 put the cemetery with a mask 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.710
 that he accepts the mask because I'm going to 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.479
 put with mask and the black wall does not 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.599
 I want the wall of the 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.650
 wrong and I give him enter command for me as 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:15.180
 legacy 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.180
 and there's the mask
