00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
law so I'm gonna have to move slow and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.990 
law so I'm gonna have to move slow and
try<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:24.830> get<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> quick<00:02:25.160> peek<00:02:25.460> because<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.820> want

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
to a snapping turtle head but I've been

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.000 
to a snapping turtle head but I've been
dealing<00:03:39.810> with<00:03:39.930> these<00:03:40.110> Turtles<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.620> several

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
dealing with these Turtles for several

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.950 
dealing with these Turtles for several
years<00:03:41.280> now<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.760> kind<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.090> have<00:03:42.270> a<00:03:42.300> feel<00:03:42.630> for

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
years now and I kind of have a feel for

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.900 
years now and I kind of have a feel for
when<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.590> turtles<00:03:43.890> about<00:03:44.130> their<00:03:44.340> strike<00:03:44.640> and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
when it turtles about their strike and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.190 
when it turtles about their strike and
this<00:03:45.720> one<00:03:45.930> here<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.460> very<00:03:47.460> common<00:03:48.030> it's<00:03:48.200> now

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
this one here is very common it's now

00:03:49.200 --> 00:04:16.420 
this one here is very common it's now
peeing<00:03:49.590> all<00:03:49.860> over<00:03:49.890> me<00:04:08.870> this<00:04:09.870> deep<00:04:10.140> right<00:04:10.350> here

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.460 

now<00:04:17.430> what<00:04:17.580> these<00:04:17.760> turtles<00:04:18.150> do<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.480> they<00:04:19.170> burrow

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
now what these turtles do is they burrow

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.250 
now what these turtles do is they burrow
in<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> leaves<00:04:20.100> which<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.790> at<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.030> bottom

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
in the leaves which is at the bottom

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.300 
in the leaves which is at the bottom
anytime<00:04:22.260> they're<00:04:22.440> spooked<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:22.830> off<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.100> lock

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
anytime they're spooked in off the lock

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.430 
anytime they're spooked in off the lock
and<00:04:23.610> more<00:04:23.910> than<00:04:24.030> likely<00:04:24.090> most<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.230> time

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
and more than likely most of the time

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.600 
and more than likely most of the time
they'll<00:04:25.620> just<00:04:25.770> hide<00:04:25.950> in<00:04:26.130> right<00:04:26.310> underneath

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
they'll just hide in right underneath

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.670 
they'll just hide in right underneath
the<00:04:26.820> log<00:04:26.970> or<00:04:27.540> within<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.810> couple<00:04:28.020> feet<00:04:28.169> from<00:04:28.560> the

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
the log or within a couple feet from the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.050 
the log or within a couple feet from the
log<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.100> reason<00:04:29.370> they<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:29.669> is

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
log and the reason they do this is

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.740 
log and the reason they do this is
because<00:04:30.600> they<00:04:30.930> know<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.650> more<00:04:32.340> than<00:04:32.370> likely

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
because they know that more than likely

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.180 
because they know that more than likely
what<00:04:33.750> scare<00:04:34.050> them<00:04:34.230> in<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.410> water<00:04:34.590> was<00:04:34.830> nothing

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
what scare them in the water was nothing

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.520 
what scare them in the water was nothing
too<00:04:35.370> serious<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.000> they<00:04:36.510> just<00:04:36.690> kind<00:04:36.870> of<00:04:37.020> hide

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
too serious and they just kind of hide

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.470 
too serious and they just kind of hide
under<00:04:37.830> there<00:04:38.010> to<00:04:38.610> wait<00:04:38.790> until<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.150> coast<00:04:39.330> is

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
under there to wait until the coast is

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.360 
under there to wait until the coast is
clear<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:39.960> then<00:04:40.380> they<00:04:40.470> hop<00:04:40.650> right<00:04:40.860> back<00:04:40.890> up<00:04:41.220> on

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
clear and then they hop right back up on

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.159 
clear and then they hop right back up on
the<00:04:41.490> log<00:04:41.640> again<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.030> get<00:04:42.150> some<00:04:42.300> more<00:04:42.419> Sun<00:04:42.660> it's

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.750 
the log again to get some more Sun it's
not<00:04:43.380> every<00:04:43.680> day<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.919> find<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.400> beauty<00:04:44.730> like
