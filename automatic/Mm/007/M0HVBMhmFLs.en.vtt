00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.000
 hello hello and welcome to coco tv 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.279
 with a new presentation 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 today the bitfenix phenom case 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.840
 in micro-atx version so if we buy 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.460
 micro or mini format does not change 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 not exactly the same case 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.140
 same design it's just chassis that 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.379
 will change in the front we have a 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.780
 facade united here in white on the top 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.879
 a small black beak that can be removed 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.589
 like those that will allow to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.050
 leave access to a radiator in 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.579
 watercooling 240 mm but point of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.239
 fans unfortunately since if 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.920
 we put a 120 we can rest 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:04.470
 correctly the little guy we put the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.840
 top in the back we have a rivers to 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.700
 tea xx or rather rivers micro-atx with 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.820
 five teams and if a very good thing 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.740
 a 120 or 140 mm occupied slot 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.520
 by a 120mm fan is here 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.909
 ayew shield access below then we 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.450
 turned 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.759
 the case we have here enough to draw 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.130
 the front faÃ§ade which will decline via 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.990
 four little pins inside there 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.069
 we have a filter so it's not 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.600
 quite a filter since it's 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.210
 plain plastic but it's still 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.319
 protected here if we want to put some 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.789
 hard drives since we have some 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.009
 locations for purpose of pushing him 3 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.840
 inch and a half with what to put 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.270
 fan we recognize the diameter on 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.880
 can put a maximum of 200 mm or 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 120 140 there we have our four feet 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.780
 with a non-slip system 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.670
 very efficient rubber and a small 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 aluminum casket and if we have 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.310
 the lamp the sorry place for 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.369
 supply 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.709
 the cable is placed at the back 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.159
 we saw inside there is a small 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:04.859
 extension that the food will breathe 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.679
 from the front since we have here a 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.149
 wide opening for fan like 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.990
 on the mythical model it's exactly 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.180
 the same chassis 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.730
 some pieces are repeated here 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.140
 a bay 5 25 but without access to 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.360
 the outside we can remove it if 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.150
 need no problem feeding is going 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.620
 measure 260 mm maximum of long hours 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.180
 so two authors here pay attention to 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.680
 connectors if we are on modular 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.390
 it could possibly type or 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.790
 blocked we then have wide access 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.349
 right here 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.909
 for the bad kite of the radiator 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.829
 in the back a small fan of 120 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.120
 mm that is already installed as well as a 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.189
 on the bottom and we can always 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.719
 place and a second if we place a 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.819
 second 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.590
 it will do like this so there it is not 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.970
 set of course but know that if we 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.069
 wants to be a watercooling radiator 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.450
 and quite simply in 240 mm it does not 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.909
 do not go in that way over the location 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.079
 of food in France we can 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.879
 always put two 120 mm with a 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.750
 little bridge aesthetically it can be 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.659
 nice in the water for watercooling 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.030
 on the other hand no problem that there is 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.049
 the place to the dishes as much for me that 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.900
 arrives for a radiator of 240 mm 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:19.000
 eventually we leave where we remove there 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.209
 I will not go there the good little 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.010
 turntables for 5.25 bay depending 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.560
 of his preferences knowing that if one 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.359
 share on the prodigy in micro-atx the 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.489
 platinum will have more interest since we 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.989
 have an opening at the front the case 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.370
 is exactly the same except say it 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.030
 we get the handles of the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.269
 mini-itx version another little more in 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.959
 the bundle we have this is a bay 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.870
 5 25 where one can fix a fan of 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.659
 80 mm and of course the 3 inches and 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.629
 half or even why not push 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.090
 nor finally for storage so as one 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.549
 could see it we have the 5.25 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.150
 possibly in the bottom of the case 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.500
 but we also have this patina 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.629
 vertical that will allow to store 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.419
 hard drives on each side and 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.530
 then platinum simply 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.349
 so here I am not in the right direction 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.120
 she comes to take place inside 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.349
 on the graphics cards and the 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.939
 real and gold processor so all the 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.169
 radiator 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.789
 we are reassured there is a lot of 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.060
 normally place the case can 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.099
 accommodate blood 65 70 mm widely on 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.919
 will see if it's with or without platinum and 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:30.090
 with or without a disk on the inside 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.409
 the test we deal with it very quickly 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.419
 it was the little plastic from underneath 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.099
 then the case the finish is good 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.680
 except touch as usual with 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.150
 bitfenix of quality leblanc marks a 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.129
 little fingerprints if you have them 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.419
 fingers a little fat 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.779
 or a little dirty to be careful 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.069
 maybe preferred another color if 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:49.110
 we are in a little environment 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.769
 dirtying the dust we'll see what 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.169
 it gives particular for the fan 

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:57.179
 underneath see if the plastic tip does 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.860
 not too much trouble if it filters if it 

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:59.939
 increases noise or if 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.449
 it simply smothers the 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.529
 fan 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.529
 we'll see you soon
