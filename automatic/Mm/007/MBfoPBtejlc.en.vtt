00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello to all guys and welcome back on 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.620
 my channel 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.630
 this will be a short video where I will go to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.379
 explain a little what will happen on the channel 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.210
 in the coming days as you know if 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.730
 any of you saw on facebook i 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.039
 finally bought an xbox one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.920
 white with destinies there is sunset overdrive 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.560
 child of light custer storm and others 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.239
 you play slowly recording something 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.030
 there too and I'm going to get the 19th of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.680
 may the witcher 3 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 obviously besides this there will also be 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.980
 the new house of wolves so I will go to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 do it all together 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 so be connected that there will be 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.570
 lots of news about jurassic instead 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 park builder will obviously continue the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 series while for the non-application 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.129
 always of the ludia that is those who do 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.050
 precisely this app you see now is not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.989
 therefore compatible with my device 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.820
 I'll have to update myself by buying another one 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.460
 what updating the device or 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.939
 wait for him to face himself 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.890
 the version for my device does not 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.689
 I know when it will be released then to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.330
 moment I can't tell you when it will start 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.360
 the new series obviously in the meantime 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.100
 I will continue this connection there is 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.860
 they will also be new ones like vi 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.140
 I said before it is nothing we go to see 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.400
 on the fly as the park a little updated 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.450
 lately 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.049
 let's go immediately to open this 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.150
 perfect evolution leads us to 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.980
 very nice second star 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:45.240
 ok above of course the glacier park 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.080
 let's go here to donate the dodo guys 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.660
 ok 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.540
 very nice also take this 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.830
 reward the flight here they are shipments 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.600
 nothing interesting at the moment 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:05.320
 ok let's do the free one is this one 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.690
 should be ready a lot between 51 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.790
 now guys obviously then we'll go to 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.929
 see who it is 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.010
 let's see if we can lead to 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.709
 maximum this takes so many resources 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.810
 but we should do it 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.700
 ok even this max guys a lot 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.850
 nice of this coloring 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.160
 with these two horns in front of you beautiful 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.380
 I like it 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.870
 what else here are all of them already 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.970
 at most a few missions bent to 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.130
 flight I oppose bare trees 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.640
 near a bridge then we leave 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.120
 for later we activate the ports 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.730
 fundamental as always 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.540
 and let's go guys to the other park that one 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.780
 Jurassic 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.540
 see you directly there ok guys 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:04.400
 here we go immediately to open the other one 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:07.409
 evolution that there is here 70 excellent typing 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.090
 they should perhaps have a dinner yet 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.920
 there should still be one from some 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:19.260
 part I do n't remember where a water ever 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:23.040
 open opens in 15 hours and then here it is 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.140
 then this one and so we begin this 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.959
 let's start this no at the time I didn't want to 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.890
 do this susato pick up what 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:41.129
 I collect nothing 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:45.480
 home home we want water too 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:48.239
 this excellent should be in a 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.530
 other this that we also bring to the 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:59.930
 maximum say beautiful this level 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:02.959
 64 perfect we collect ok later 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.870
 let's see what 10 thousand ask me sometimes 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.120
 I will never take it to the maximum 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.859
 we still have a little there so much we can 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.549
 activate the port that definitely not 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:15.489
 I did it 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.489
