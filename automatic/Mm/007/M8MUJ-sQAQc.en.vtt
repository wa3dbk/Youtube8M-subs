00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.510 
lot of limbs in the first two or three
years<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.260> we<00:00:51.350> come<00:00:51.590> into<00:00:51.710> production<00:00:52.280> very

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
years and we come into production very

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.639 
years and we come into production very
quickly<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.540> other<00:00:53.690> thing<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.320> does<00:00:54.350> is

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
quickly the other thing that it does is

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.709 
quickly the other thing that it does is
that<00:00:54.950> it<00:00:55.130> makes<00:00:55.399> things<00:00:55.670> much<00:00:55.969> more<00:00:56.239> efficient

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
that it makes things much more efficient

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
trees are close together trees are much

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.330 
trees are close together trees are much
shorter<00:00:59.360> they're<00:01:00.079> safer<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.620> work<00:01:00.800> with<00:01:01.040> we

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
shorter they're safer to work with we

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.420 
shorter they're safer to work with we
need<00:01:01.550> much<00:01:02.360> less<00:01:02.390> ladder<00:01:02.930> work<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.500> for<00:01:04.339> our

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
need much less ladder work and for our

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.219 
need much less ladder work and for our
workers<00:01:04.640> too<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.420> better<00:01:05.750> place<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.200> work

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229

first<00:01:55.369> things<00:01:55.609> we<00:01:55.789> try<00:01:55.999> to<00:01:56.060> do<00:01:56.299> is<00:01:56.419> to<00:01:56.630> get

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
first things we try to do is to get

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.169 
first things we try to do is to get
irrigation<00:01:57.499> in<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:58.039> ground<00:01:58.310> we<00:01:58.819> live<00:01:58.999> in<00:01:59.090> a

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
irrigation in the ground we live in a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.849 
irrigation in the ground we live in a
desert<00:01:59.359> if<00:01:59.689> we<00:01:59.929> don't<00:02:00.109> want<00:02:00.319> these<00:02:00.529> trees

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
desert if we don't want these trees

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.050 
desert if we don't want these trees
they're<00:02:01.099> going<00:02:01.279> to<00:02:01.340> die<00:02:01.520> they're<00:02:01.880> going<00:02:01.999> to

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
they're going to die they're going to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.769 
they're going to die they're going to
die<00:02:02.209> fast<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:03.079> our<00:02:03.649> goal<00:02:04.369> is<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.789> be<00:02:05.179> watering

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:05.779 
die fast so our goal is to be watering

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:08.020 
die fast so our goal is to be watering
the<00:02:05.899> trees<00:02:06.139> within<00:02:06.409> four<00:02:06.889> days<00:02:07.099> after<00:02:07.340> they're

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the trees within four days after they're

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.120 
the trees within four days after they're
planted<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.630> ground<00:02:08.750> after<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.830> is

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
planted in the ground after that is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.420 
planted in the ground after that is
putting<00:02:10.880> trellis<00:02:11.390> in<00:02:11.630> we<00:02:12.380> put<00:02:12.740> in<00:02:12.860> posts<00:02:13.310> and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
putting trellis in we put in posts and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.850 
putting trellis in we put in posts and
wires<00:02:13.900> one<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.050> things<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.470> happens

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
wires one of the things that happens

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.500 
wires one of the things that happens
when<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.160> put<00:02:16.340> trees<00:02:16.580> close<00:02:16.850> together<00:02:17.270> as

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
when you put trees close together as

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.860 
when you put trees close together as
you're

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
you're

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.720 
you're
you<00:02:17.930> seen<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.200> lot<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.409> weight<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.860> small

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
you seen a lot of weight on small

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.369 
you seen a lot of weight on small
structures<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:20.540> those<00:02:20.629> structures<00:02:21.170> aren't

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
structures and those structures aren't

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.559 
structures and those structures aren't
large<00:02:22.159> enough<00:02:22.250> or<00:02:22.610> strong<00:02:22.819> enough<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.330> carry

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
large enough or strong enough to carry

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.630 
large enough or strong enough to carry
the<00:02:23.780> crop<00:02:24.019> load<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.470> they'll<00:02:24.650> carry<00:02:25.010> that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the crop load that they'll carry that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.089 
the crop load that they'll carry that
they'll<00:02:25.879> bear<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:27.019> put<00:02:27.200> posts<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.650> wire<00:02:27.830> in

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
they'll bear so we put posts and wire in

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.250 
they'll bear so we put posts and wire in
to<00:02:28.489> train<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> trees<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:29.659> to<00:02:29.900> give<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
to train the trees to but to give the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.380 
to train the trees to but to give the
tree<00:02:30.769> support<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.640> won't<00:02:31.760> break<00:02:32.030> when

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
tree support so that it won't break when

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.240 
tree support so that it won't break when
it's<00:02:32.510> carrying<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.900> full<00:02:33.080> load<00:02:33.110> after<00:02:33.950> we<00:02:34.040> plant

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
it's carrying a full load after we plant

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.399 
it's carrying a full load after we plant
the<00:02:34.430> trees<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.819> course<00:02:34.849> we<00:02:35.329> want<00:02:35.629> to<00:02:35.720> get<00:02:36.230> them

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
the trees of course we want to get them

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.190 
the trees of course we want to get them
into<00:02:36.620> production<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.430> takes<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.849> little<00:02:38.000> time

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
into production it takes a little time

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.220 
into production it takes a little time
by<00:02:39.200> fifth<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.980> sixth<00:02:40.370> year<00:02:40.730> will<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.540> hopefully

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
by fifth to sixth year will be hopefully

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.680 
by fifth to sixth year will be hopefully
at<00:02:42.319> full<00:02:42.530> production<00:02:43.090> this<00:02:44.090> has<00:02:44.269> been<00:02:44.420> Dave

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690
