engine holds about 1.6 gallons
because<00:02:50.930> even<00:02:51.500> though<00:02:51.590> it's<00:02:51.920> less<00:02:52.400> even

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
because even though it's less even

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.880 
because even though it's less even
though<00:02:52.879> it's<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.120> bigger<00:02:53.330> file<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.440> probably

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
though it's a bigger file it's probably

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.280 
though it's a bigger file it's probably
due<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.280> size<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.569> engine<00:02:56.720> space

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
due to the size of the engine space

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.500 
due to the size of the engine space
underneath<00:02:57.590> put<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> gas<00:02:58.519> tank<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:59.360> other

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
underneath put the gas tank the other

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.280 
underneath put the gas tank the other
stores<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.970> gives<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:02.690> magic<00:03:03.140> box

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
stores and it gives you this magic box

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.860 
stores and it gives you this magic box
which<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.799> would<00:03:03.980> guess<00:03:04.159> is<00:03:04.370> somewhere<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
which I would guess is somewhere in the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.619 
which I would guess is somewhere in the
32<00:03:06.379> liter<00:03:06.620> range<00:03:06.830> 29<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.790> 32<00:03:08.120> liter<00:03:08.420> range

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
32 liter range 29 to 32 liter range

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.800 
32 liter range 29 to 32 liter range
somewhere<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:09.110> range<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.540> gives<00:03:11.750> that

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
somewhere in that range so it gives that

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.780 
somewhere in that range so it gives that
a<00:03:11.900> nice<00:03:12.110> extra<00:03:12.470> feature<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.430> know<00:03:13.519> if

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
a nice extra feature that you know if

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.550 
a nice extra feature that you know if
your<00:03:14.000> bike<00:03:14.150> doesn't<00:03:14.360> already<00:03:14.540> have<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:14.989> you
