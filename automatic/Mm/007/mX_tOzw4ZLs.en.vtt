and<00:02:21.459> then<00:02:22.459> here<00:02:23.060> we<00:02:23.209> have<00:02:23.349> could<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.440> be<00:02:24.620> I

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
and then here we have could it be I

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.820 
and then here we have could it be I
think<00:02:26.269> looks<00:02:26.959> like<00:02:27.140> we<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.470> pair<00:02:27.799> of

think looks like we have a pair of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.789 
think looks like we have a pair of
premium<00:02:28.459> headphones<00:02:28.970> they're<00:02:29.269> calling<00:02:29.799> quad

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
beat 2 and that's exactly what these

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.180 
beat 2 and that's exactly what these
look<00:02:35.569> like<00:02:35.629> is<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> premium<00:02:36.799> feeling

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
look like is a premium feeling

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.680 
look like is a premium feeling
headphones<00:02:37.819> as<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.239> see<00:02:38.360> they<00:02:38.450> got<00:02:38.569> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
headphones as you can see they got the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.190 
headphones as you can see they got the
LG<00:02:39.110> logo<00:02:39.379> on<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.489> back<00:02:40.879> ends<00:02:41.299> of<00:02:41.390> them<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.870> it

LG logo on the back ends of them and it

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.050 
LG logo on the back ends of them and it
feels<00:02:42.440> almost<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:43.010> metal<00:02:43.549> but<00:02:43.849> it<00:02:43.940> can

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
feels almost like a metal but it can

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.650 
feels almost like a metal but it can
also<00:02:44.209> be<00:02:44.360> maybe<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.019> polished<00:02:45.620> plastic

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
also be maybe a polished plastic

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.789 
also be maybe a polished plastic
regardless<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:47.870> still<00:02:47.900> nice<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.230> see<00:02:48.590> them

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
regardless it's still nice to see them

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.670 
regardless it's still nice to see them
included<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.940> rubber<00:02:50.480> also<00:02:50.780> feels<00:02:51.140> very<00:02:51.440> nice

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
included the rubber also feels very nice

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.509 
included the rubber also feels very nice
on<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.459> feels<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.849> premium<00:02:53.120> rubber<00:02:53.569> and

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
on it it feels like a premium rubber and

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.680 
on it it feels like a premium rubber and
here<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:55.609> looks<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.819> we<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> switch<00:02:56.480> to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
here it looks like we have a switch to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.240 
here it looks like we have a switch to
control<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.140> volume<00:02:57.319> as<00:02:57.709> well<00:02:57.890> as<00:02:58.040> maybe

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
control the volume as well as maybe

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.770 
control the volume as well as maybe
