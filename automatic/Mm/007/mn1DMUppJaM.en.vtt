00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.770 
intent was to come off of this area
right<00:02:05.049> here<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:06.340> another<00:02:06.549> switch<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.390> just

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
right here with another switch and just

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.710 
right here with another switch and just
come<00:02:07.990> come<00:02:08.769> straight<00:02:09.099> out<00:02:09.129> here<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.849> circle

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
come come straight out here and circle

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.319 
come come straight out here and circle
around<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.230> then<00:02:11.379> connect<00:02:11.849> at<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.969> far<00:02:13.180> end

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
around and then connect at the far end

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:14.519 
around and then connect at the far end
of<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.510> layout<00:02:13.840> down<00:02:14.079> there<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.409> another

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:14.529 
of the layout down there with another

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:15.780 
of the layout down there with another
switch

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
switch

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.500 
switch
and<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.010> could<00:02:18.219> pull<00:02:18.430> trains<00:02:18.879> on<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.390> off

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
and so I could pull trains on and off

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.429 
and so I could pull trains on and off
but<00:02:20.500> when<00:02:21.189> I<00:02:21.219> started<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:21.939> lay<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.120> out<00:02:22.439> by

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
but when I started to lay that out by

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.289 
but when I started to lay that out by
the<00:02:23.530> time<00:02:23.769> i<00:02:23.799> got<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.840> switch<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.349> all<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.769> the

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
the time i got the switch and all of the

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.179 
the time i got the switch and all of the
curves<00:02:28.299> in<00:02:28.540> there<00:02:28.719> too<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.079> a<00:02:29.349> nice<00:02:29.590> gradual

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
curves in there too to a nice gradual

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.670 
curves in there too to a nice gradual
radius<00:02:30.730> i<00:02:31.000> was<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.109> have<00:02:32.319> very<00:02:32.349> much

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
radius i was going to have very much

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.789 
radius i was going to have very much
area<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.099> park<00:02:33.340> train<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:33.970> i've<00:02:34.060> decided<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
area to park train so i've decided to

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.089 
area to park train so i've decided to
come<00:02:35.799> down<00:02:35.980> here<00:02:36.010> at<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.700> side<00:02:37.109> anyway<00:02:38.109> come

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
come down here at this side anyway come

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.069 
come down here at this side anyway come
down<00:02:39.280> here<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:40.530> put<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> turnout<00:02:41.829> in<00:02:42.129> here<00:02:43.079> come

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
down here and put a turnout in here come

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.589 
down here and put a turnout in here come
back<00:02:44.260> probably<00:02:44.920> without<00:02:45.159> about<00:02:45.879> a<00:02:45.909> 22<00:02:46.420> inch

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.690 
back probably without about a 22 inch
radius<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:47.379> come<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.889> a<00:02:47.920> wide<00:02:48.430> turn

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
radius and then come into a wide turn

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.399 
radius and then come into a wide turn
out<00:02:48.909> in<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.870> center<00:02:50.230> here<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:52.239> then<00:02:53.109> take<00:02:53.379> a

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
out in the center here and then take a

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.179 
out in the center here and then take a
couple<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:54.599> other<00:02:55.599> turnouts<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.560> and

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
couple of other turnouts and and

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.490 
couple of other turnouts and and
probably<00:02:57.669> try<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.030> get<00:02:58.209> for<00:02:58.799> at<00:02:59.799> least<00:03:00.010> four

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
probably try and get for at least four

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.330 
probably try and get for at least four
sidings<00:03:02.500> down<00:03:03.069> here<00:03:03.370> clear<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.419> end<00:03:04.659> and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
sidings down here clear to the end and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.399 
sidings down here clear to the end and
that<00:03:06.340> will<00:03:06.730> helpfully<00:03:07.239> give<00:03:07.810> me<00:03:07.959> enough<00:03:08.139> room

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
that will helpfully give me enough room

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.280 
that will helpfully give me enough room
for<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.680> mite<00:03:08.889> for<00:03:09.189> my<00:03:09.310> intermodal<00:03:10.090> stuff<00:03:10.419> which

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
for a mite for my intermodal stuff which

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.710 
for a mite for my intermodal stuff which
I've<00:03:11.709> acquired<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.519> lot<00:03:12.700> over<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:13.209> past<00:03:13.239> year

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
I've acquired a lot over the past year

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.490 
I've acquired a lot over the past year
I've<00:03:13.840> kind<00:03:14.409> of<00:03:14.439> become<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.769> fan<00:03:15.099> of<00:03:15.129> intermodal

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
I've kind of become a fan of intermodal

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.580 
I've kind of become a fan of intermodal
operations<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:17.829> I've<00:03:18.189> got<00:03:19.049> several<00:03:20.049> kits<00:03:20.409> to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
operations so I've got several kits to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.430 
operations so I've got several kits to
build<00:03:21.000> some<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.120> finish<00:03:22.479> as<00:03:22.720> far<00:03:23.019> as<00:03:23.139> painting

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
build some to finish as far as painting

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.899 
build some to finish as far as painting
and<00:03:24.540> hope<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.569> have<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:26.739> place<00:03:26.879> when<00:03:27.879> I

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
and hope to have that in place when I

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.839 
and hope to have that in place when I
start<00:03:28.269> you'll<00:03:28.569> remember<00:03:29.310> if<00:03:30.310> you've<00:03:30.519> seen<00:03:30.549> the

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
start you'll remember if you've seen the

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.089 
start you'll remember if you've seen the
other<00:03:31.000> videos<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.720> right<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.620> here<00:03:32.889> where

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
other videos that right in here where

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.159 
other videos that right in here where
you<00:03:33.489> can<00:03:33.639> see<00:03:33.699> the<00:03:33.940> blue<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.479> the<00:03:34.540> foam<00:03:35.139> is

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
you can see the blue of the foam is

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.599 
you can see the blue of the foam is
showing<00:03:35.680> through<00:03:35.979> I<00:03:36.909> had<00:03:37.419> originally<00:03:38.609> for

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
showing through I had originally for

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.420 
showing through I had originally for
tracks<00:03:39.940> in<00:03:40.299> here<00:03:40.359> for<00:03:41.049> sidings<00:03:41.500> with<00:03:42.280> some

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
tracks in here for sidings with some

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.849 
tracks in here for sidings with some
very<00:03:42.579> switches<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:44.470> was<00:03:44.590> going<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.769> be

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
very switches and it was going to be

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.530 
very switches and it was going to be
kind<00:03:44.979> of<00:03:45.099> cool<00:03:45.159> there<00:03:45.790> was<00:03:45.909> going<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.269> be<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.359> lot

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
kind of cool there was going to be a lot

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.270 
kind of cool there was going to be a lot
of<00:03:46.569> switching<00:03:46.959> operations<00:03:47.530> available<00:03:48.010> but

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
of switching operations available but

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.849 
of switching operations available but
I've<00:03:48.400> decided<00:03:48.699> to<00:03:48.819> take<00:03:48.940> that<00:03:49.209> out<00:03:49.419> and<00:03:49.859> I've

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
I've decided to take that out and I've

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.759 
I've decided to take that out and I've
left<00:03:51.099> this<00:03:51.250> one<00:03:51.519> turn<00:03:51.819> out<00:03:52.000> still<00:03:52.299> in<00:03:52.449> here

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
left this one turn out still in here

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.809 
left this one turn out still in here
haven't<00:03:53.769> decided<00:03:53.829> what<00:03:54.250> I'm<00:03:54.310> going<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.519> do<00:03:54.669> yet

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
haven't decided what I'm going to do yet

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.860 
haven't decided what I'm going to do yet
I've<00:03:55.120> got<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:56.069> team<00:03:57.069> track<00:03:57.689> concept<00:03:58.689> that<00:03:58.780> I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
I've got a team track concept that I

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.000 
I've got a team track concept that I
want<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.139> maybe<00:03:59.349> put<00:03:59.650> in<00:03:59.799> here<00:04:00.120> I've<00:04:01.120> also<00:04:01.329> got

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
want to maybe put in here I've also got

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.890 
want to maybe put in here I've also got
a<00:04:04.439> some<00:04:05.439> grain<00:04:05.709> bins<00:04:05.979> that<00:04:06.699> I<00:04:07.120> have<00:04:07.599> to<00:04:07.720> put

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
a some grain bins that I have to put

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.809 
a some grain bins that I have to put
together<00:04:08.169> and<00:04:08.769> maybe<00:04:08.949> we'll<00:04:09.220> put<00:04:09.400> those<00:04:09.549> in

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
together and maybe we'll put those in

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.319 
together and maybe we'll put those in
there<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:11.349> haven't<00:04:12.220> decided<00:04:12.310> yet<00:04:12.849> what<00:04:13.180> I'm

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
there I haven't decided yet what I'm

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.490 
there I haven't decided yet what I'm
going<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.569> do<00:04:13.750> whether<00:04:13.989> I'm<00:04:14.139> going<00:04:14.229> to<00:04:14.290> leave

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
going to do whether I'm going to leave

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.479

sidewalks I'm going to put some

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.450 
sidewalks I'm going to put some
expansion<00:05:18.380> joints<00:05:18.890> in<00:05:19.010> there<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.310> whether

those<00:05:19.669> of<00:05:19.940> course<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.510> also<00:05:20.570> maybe<00:05:20.930> whether

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
those of course and also maybe whether

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.070 
those of course and also maybe whether
the<00:05:21.440> street<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.740> little<00:05:21.800> bit<00:05:22.450> my<00:05:23.450> concept<00:05:23.990> is

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
the street a little bit my concept is

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.880 
the street a little bit my concept is
still<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:24.500> have<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.919> park<00:05:25.250> in<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.760> center<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:27.500> i

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
still to have a park in the center so i

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.310 
still to have a park in the center so i
will<00:05:28.400> try<00:05:28.970> and<00:05:29.030> get<00:05:29.180> that<00:05:29.330> done<00:05:29.540> shortly

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
will try and get that done shortly

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.110 
will try and get that done shortly
that's<00:05:30.710> i<00:05:30.919> guess<00:05:31.070> my<00:05:31.250> next<00:05:31.310> step<00:05:31.700> and<00:05:31.970> then

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
that's i guess my next step and then

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.270 
that's i guess my next step and then
after<00:05:32.870> that<00:05:32.990> start<00:05:33.500> putting<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.919> buildings

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
after that start putting the buildings

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.330 
after that start putting the buildings
together<00:05:34.430> that<00:05:35.060> I've<00:05:35.180> that<00:05:35.630> I've<00:05:36.340> acquired

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
together that I've that I've acquired

it<00:06:08.150> left<00:06:08.330> over<00:06:08.630> in<00:06:08.780> my<00:06:09.500> mix<00:06:09.770> and<00:06:10.070> I've<00:06:10.880> put<00:06:11.690> a

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
it left over in my mix and I've put a

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.159 
it left over in my mix and I've put a
concrete<00:06:12.500> retaining<00:06:12.950> wall<00:06:13.460> in<00:06:13.669> there<00:06:14.030> so<00:06:14.390> all

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
concrete retaining wall in there so all

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:16.420 
concrete retaining wall in there so all
right<00:06:15.350> so<00:06:15.500> I<00:06:15.530> just<00:06:15.710> ran<00:06:15.800> out<00:06:16.010> of<00:06:16.040> battery<00:06:16.340> power

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
right so I just ran out of battery power

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.219 
right so I just ran out of battery power
again<00:06:16.880> so<00:06:17.180> I'm<00:06:17.240> going<00:06:17.390> to<00:06:17.419> try<00:06:17.540> and<00:06:17.600> talk<00:06:17.900> fast

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
again so I'm going to try and talk fast

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:19.300 
again so I'm going to try and talk fast
this<00:06:18.470> doesn't<00:06:18.770> look<00:06:18.830> like<00:06:18.919> it's<00:06:19.160> going<00:06:19.190> to

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
this doesn't look like it's going to

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.040 
this doesn't look like it's going to
last<00:06:19.520> long<00:06:19.790> either<00:06:19.820> had<00:06:20.690> some<00:06:20.900> questions

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
last long either had some questions

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.440 
last long either had some questions
about<00:06:21.410> the<00:06:21.650> tunnel<00:06:21.950> construction<00:06:22.180> as<00:06:23.180> you<00:06:23.300> can

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
about the tunnel construction as you can

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.350 
about the tunnel construction as you can
see<00:06:23.630> it's<00:06:23.810> just<00:06:24.020> cardboard<00:06:24.320> on<00:06:24.620> the<00:06:24.710> back<00:06:24.890> side

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
see it's just cardboard on the back side

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.130 
see it's just cardboard on the back side
cut<00:06:26.360> in<00:06:26.510> a<00:06:26.600> profile<00:06:27.370> I've<00:06:28.370> stacked<00:06:28.820> some<00:06:29.479> paper

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
cut in a profile I've stacked some paper

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.050 
cut in a profile I've stacked some paper
wads<00:06:30.440> which<00:06:30.770> I've<00:06:30.950> covered<00:06:31.280> with

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
wads which I've covered with

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.330 
wads which I've covered with
on<00:06:32.150> plaster<00:06:33.080> cloth<00:06:33.169> and<00:06:33.590> just<00:06:33.680> spray<00:06:33.950> painted

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
on plaster cloth and just spray painted

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.670 
on plaster cloth and just spray painted
and<00:06:35.030> I've<00:06:35.180> got<00:06:35.330> some<00:06:35.510> woodland<00:06:35.900> scenics<00:06:36.139> Rock

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
and I've got some woodland scenics Rock

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.150 
and I've got some woodland scenics Rock
molds<00:06:37.100> where<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:37.669> see<00:06:37.820> the<00:06:37.850> brown<00:06:38.150> areas<00:06:39.160> for

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
molds where you see the brown areas for

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.800 
molds where you see the brown areas for
rock<00:06:40.430> so<00:06:40.820> that's<00:06:41.000> basically<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.480> tunnel

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
rock so that's basically the tunnel

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.150 
rock so that's basically the tunnel
construction<00:06:41.990> I<00:06:42.470> don't<00:06:42.650> know<00:06:42.740> if<00:06:42.830> it<00:06:42.919> shows<00:06:43.130> up

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
construction I don't know if it shows up

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.610 
construction I don't know if it shows up
at<00:06:43.520> all<00:06:43.669> but<00:06:44.600> it<00:06:44.750> is<00:06:44.900> pretty<00:06:45.110> much<00:06:45.350> just

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
at all but it is pretty much just

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.240 
at all but it is pretty much just
styrofoam<00:06:47.620> performs<00:06:48.620> in<00:06:48.800> there<00:06:48.950> pretty

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
styrofoam performs in there pretty

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.940 
styrofoam performs in there pretty
simple<00:06:50.169> anyhow<00:06:51.169> I'm<00:06:51.260> going<00:06:51.380> to<00:06:51.440> sign<00:06:51.590> off<00:06:51.770> for

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
simple anyhow I'm going to sign off for

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.800 
simple anyhow I'm going to sign off for
now<00:06:52.010> wait<00:06:52.490> till<00:06:52.639> my<00:06:52.730> batteries<00:06:53.150> recharged<00:06:53.600> and

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
now wait till my batteries recharged and

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.379 
now wait till my batteries recharged and
hopefully<00:06:54.139> finish<00:06:54.440> this<00:06:54.560> up<00:06:54.770> later<00:06:55.150> go<00:06:56.150> into<00:06:56.360> a

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
hopefully finish this up later go into a

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.260 
hopefully finish this up later go into a
few<00:06:56.810> more<00:06:56.930> details<00:06:57.110> so<00:06:57.800> thanks<00:06:58.790> for<00:06:58.880> watching
