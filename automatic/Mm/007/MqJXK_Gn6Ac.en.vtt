00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
these colors kind of just below each

these colors kind of just below each
other<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.290> striping<00:02:52.980> motion<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.819> then<00:02:54.209> we

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
other in a striping motion and then we

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.699 
other in a striping motion and then we
blend<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.900> colors<00:02:55.170> i'll<00:02:55.349> show<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.590> the

decor<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.670> first<00:03:02.910> two

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
decor so this is what the first two

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.640 
decor so this is what the first two
colors<00:03:03.420> look<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.139> can<00:03:04.290> tell<00:03:04.500> that

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
colors look like you can tell that

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.860 
colors look like you can tell that
there's<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.859> very<00:03:05.130> distinct<00:03:05.670> line<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.690> order

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
there's a very distinct line so in order

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.620 
there's a very distinct line so in order
to<00:03:07.139> get<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.410> line<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:08.040> look<00:03:08.220> more<00:03:08.489> gradient<00:03:09.450> i

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
to get the line to look more gradient i

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.509 
to get the line to look more gradient i
am<00:03:09.989> taking<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.410> side<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.980> sponge<00:03:11.280> brush

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
am taking the side of the sponge brush

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.110 
am taking the side of the sponge brush
and<00:03:11.790> tapping<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.750> along<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.290> two<00:03:13.500> colors<00:03:14.120> just

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
and tapping it along the two colors just

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.759 
and tapping it along the two colors just
so<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.329> looks<00:03:15.510> more<00:03:15.569> seamless<00:03:16.049> as<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.590> see

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
so it looks more seamless as you can see

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.849 
so it looks more seamless as you can see
here<00:03:17.329> then<00:03:18.329> finally<00:03:19.049> we<00:03:19.230> are<00:03:19.349> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.709> add

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
here then finally we are going to add

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.509 
here then finally we are going to add
the<00:03:20.280> deepest<00:03:20.760> blue<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.560> end<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.160> and

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
the deepest blue to the end of this and

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.220 
the deepest blue to the end of this and
with<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> darker<00:03:24.419> colors<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:24.930> more

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
with the darker colors it is more

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.990 
with the darker colors it is more
noticeable<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.889> see<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> strokes<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.910> you

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
noticeable to see the strokes so you

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.120 
noticeable to see the strokes so you
might<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.419> to<00:03:27.569> add<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.750> couple<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.470> coats<00:03:28.739> to

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
might have to add a couple of coats to

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.159 
might have to add a couple of coats to
get<00:03:29.310> like<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:30.239> type<00:03:30.419> of<00:03:30.450> color<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.900> want<00:03:31.079> if

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
get like the type of color you want if

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.539 
get like the type of color you want if
you<00:03:31.230> want<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.709> opaque<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.280> know<00:03:32.370> that's

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
you want it more opaque you know that's

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.940 
you want it more opaque you know that's
up<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.359> whatever<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.840> prefer<00:03:34.019> so

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
up to you just whatever you prefer so

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.379 
up to you just whatever you prefer so
like<00:03:35.130> we<00:03:35.280> did<00:03:35.459> with<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.639> first<00:03:35.910> two<00:03:36.150> lighter

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
like we did with the first two lighter

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.640 
like we did with the first two lighter
colors<00:03:36.810> you're<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.139> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.349> take<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
colors you're just going to take the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.710 
colors you're just going to take the
side<00:03:37.859> of<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.040> sponge<00:03:38.370> brush<00:03:38.639> and<00:03:38.910> blend<00:03:39.510> out

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
side of the sponge brush and blend out

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.339 
side of the sponge brush and blend out
the<00:03:39.780> two<00:03:40.079> colors<00:03:40.730> just<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:41.970> looks<00:03:42.349> like

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
the two colors just so it looks like

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.409 
the two colors just so it looks like
it's<00:03:43.500> gradually<00:03:44.250> changing<00:03:44.700> from<00:03:44.910> light<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
it's gradually changing from light to

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.629 
it's gradually changing from light to
dark<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:46.560> will<00:03:46.709> also<00:03:46.889> look<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.310> lot<00:03:47.459> better

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
dark this will also look a lot better

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.520 
dark this will also look a lot better
from<00:03:48.000> far<00:03:48.540> away<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.109> doesn't<00:03:49.380> look<00:03:49.470> like

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
from far away and it doesn't look like

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.080 
from far away and it doesn't look like
just<00:03:49.889> stripes<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.519> gives<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.730> more<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.940> an

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
just stripes it gives it more of an

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.460 
just stripes it gives it more of an
ombre<00:03:51.419> effect<00:03:51.750> which<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.049> what<00:03:52.169> we're<00:03:52.319> trying

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
ombre effect which is what we're trying

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.520 
ombre effect which is what we're trying
to<00:03:52.620> achieve<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.329> can<00:03:54.720> choose<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.049> leave

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
to achieve so you can choose to leave

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.050 
to achieve so you can choose to leave
these<00:03:55.709> letters<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:56.849> lean

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
these letters like this and just lean

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.240 
these letters like this and just lean
them<00:03:57.180> up<00:03:57.359> against<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:58.049> wall<00:03:58.349> or<00:03:58.410> your<00:03:58.829> dresser

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
them up against a wall or your dresser

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.369 
them up against a wall or your dresser
but<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.849> wanted<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.329> connect<00:04:00.689> them<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.110> in<00:04:01.230> order

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
but I wanted to connect them so in order

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.790 
but I wanted to connect them so in order
