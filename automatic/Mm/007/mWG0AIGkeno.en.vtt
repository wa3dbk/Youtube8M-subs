00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 pl I told him we women also know 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.799
 tie tie and another amount of 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.530
 things that you do not imagine good 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.370
 the doctor is with us again today 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.010
 Marlon Becerra and because for him and for 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.920
 all of us smile is a party 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.660
 marlon welcome again but there 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 more he gives me a mirror than for the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.810
 eagerness to go from one side to the other 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.529
 criticize someone who takes it from me 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 wallet with a good divine mirror 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.430
 marlon I would like us to talk today about 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.430
 the gums 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 because there is different coloring of the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 gums of one suddenly people who 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.910
 they have very dark gums there are other 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.969
 they have very clear gums that's 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.059
 something racial that's because the color of the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.750
 on top of the girl's girl when the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.190
 person generates a lot of melanin 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 especially in the black race the gum 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.930
 it looks more black it's basically melanin 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.510
 but there are white people whose essence are 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.100
 Blacks today is very easy to do 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.740
 a peeling a peeling with a laser 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.090
 and the entity remains pink but not 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.210
 means that the gum that is more 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.270
 dark but not as healthy as a 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.680
 brown paper is nothing to do but to 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.560
 many people do not like to have the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.390
 dark black anxiety yes and it is valid is 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.430
 valid because in some way like that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.590
 black pigmentation takes away beauty 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.600
 the teeth I am a friend to make 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.119
 peeling and remove your hands and you can 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.250
 reform in the shape of the gum let's say 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.320
 if one wants to make teeth a 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.390
 little in day with the cosmetic I imagine 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.509
 that everything can be trimmed the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.850
 gum you can change the shape of the 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.429
 gum there is a biological space that never 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.380
 you can rape because when you violate 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.860
 the gum will be inflamed 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.899
 always enter almost always are two or 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.270
 three millimeters which can be 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.159
 modify without any problem 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.700
 modify is with scalpel surgery with 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:06.209
 gases with links and recovery is 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.209
 one day almost two hours 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.349
 when a good person and consult a 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.530
 doctor because he has gum problems 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.530
 when it bleeds when or because it is 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.110
 everything gums that blood like this you use a 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.920
 extra hard brush if the gum bleeds 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.250
 there is no pathology there is a soft brush 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.290
 hard or soft if the gum bleeds there 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.810
 alteration never going to throw the gum 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.790
 should never bleed should never bleed 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.470
 good in pregnant women for example 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.780
 It is normal for the gums to enlarge and 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.880
 they get inflamed and blood in a little bit but without 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.130
 But you have to review, you should never 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.260
 bleed should never be red the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.450
 anxiety should be a pink or beautiful tissue 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.790
 it was always done and let's not say 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.470
 dawn with inflamed gum should go 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.049
 to the doctor if they know about the socidad 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.330
 inflammation something is happening can be 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.920
 infection may be infection 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.140
 it may be that you are starting a 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.880
 bone loss may be that you are 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.489
 starting a periodontal disease 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.349
 something is happening that's like a warning 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.790
 that is a warning 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.680
 okay 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.180
 marlon today I want you to give us another tip 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.340

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.290

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.939
 I do in all my clinics absolutely 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:22.000

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:24.819

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.730
 dangerous not so much why but something 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.769
 someone who has thought more than a 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.859
 more than not if for example yesterday I wrote 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:49.379
 one if you know what you have to do and 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.379

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.230

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.320
 light and all that is the children's 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.950

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.090
 they are still smiling to life 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.380

 more but they do not send us the photo 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.740
 very important to send us the photo and 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.259
 the story because I believe who is 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.300
 you are applying and because this person 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.240
 he deserves to have his teeth again 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.699
