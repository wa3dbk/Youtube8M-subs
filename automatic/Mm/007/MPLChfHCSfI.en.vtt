 prepare no breakfast enough 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.489
 rebel doctor colombia digital for 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:40.059
 alternative health for all very well 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:42.710
 let's start talking about flaxseed 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.789
 of this breakfast plain and simple 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.110
 consists of taking a well of deutsche 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.390
 grapes 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.290
 as a Syrian group plug that he bought 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.540
 in the important supermarket was bands 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.840
 very well I'm going to use two possible 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:05.790
 why 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.790
 it note on the tripod it touches me said 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.560
 without also giving tradition 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 d 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.130
 and then 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.470
 the lettuce that is a fruit 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.900
 very rich 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.070
 in my walk 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.070
 of seeds 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.560
 Makes it a s 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.060
 nutritional supplement that has a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.970
 medicinal property 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.080
 for 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.080
 and from fear 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.250
 ah 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.440
 we have to prepare with a whole 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.520
 week 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.520
 then always 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.580
 and we are going to add 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.920
 linseed flaxseed is a 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.770
 oily seed would be oily it means 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.110
 the seeds 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.300
 of fatty origin with a high content of 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.170
 thanks but the medicinal properties 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.360
 of the nasa are quite broad you'll be 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.030
 by many of its components 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.360
 We are going to use flaxseed powder here 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.030
 will you use one you can use 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.709
 two spoons 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.920
 but as I have invited the tripod 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.740
 human is holding the camera that 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.470
 I will use from every tablespoon of 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.080
 flaxseed to 800 milligrams of fatty acids 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.720
 They serve the essential Canada 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.080
 following components 1 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.180
 has soluble and insoluble fiber that 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.530
 favor intestinal transit for 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.950
 all the people who suffer from 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:16.050
 chronic constipation is an excellent 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.110
 carrier of stones that favoring 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.580
 evacuation if I am consuming 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.980
 routinely amounts of vinasse in 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.410
 this simple juice I'm going to improve 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.569
 much my intestinal transit and I'm going to 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.730
 get results 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.519
 made quite enough central 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.200
 digestive protest is very rich in a 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.299
 substance called hallucinate which is the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.159
 first soluble that is found is a 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.439
 substance how are we going to find 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.180
 below the weapon blade caste 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.250
 that is in dust but the thought the 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.010
 practice using the role not for the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.500
 reasons that will not be leaving in water the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.569
 last night but those we worked on 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.669
 this lake advertisement has a property 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.769
 very important and is a protector of the 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.609
 gastric mucosa is a blocker of 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.980
 acids which means that protects the 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:05.939
 gastric mucosa of gastritis processes 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.829
 we can say the portico anchovy indicate 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.959
 that for its acid content can 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.510
 propose to bother those patients 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.010
 that after vienna this test but with 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.440
 the component of cooking 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.440
 contained in flaxseed are going to have a 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.260
 an authorized agent that in the long run 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.750
 mud of the gastric mucosa 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.730
 of the inflammation processes in 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.250
 oils was another important component 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.840
 of flaxseed of course are the acids 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.200
 essential fatty acids and I want to tell you 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.330
 that have the best proportion of 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.640
 essential fatty acids omega 3 6 and 9 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.350
 that are not produced by the body and 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.800
 that they learn to be ingested in the diet 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.640
 of plant origin have no effects 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.220
 secondary but those of omega 3 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.870
 from animal origin of flavor 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.150
 in long texture to availability 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.730
 because through flaxseed we have a 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.600
 excellent control for the population 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.600
 moderation 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.740
 many therapeutic properties 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.449
 they provide the vinasse between them is 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.480
 help to modulate the contents of 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:20.410
 let's apply the type of water 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.410
 Y 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.449
 helps to release the levels of 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.669
 cholesterol and triglycerides our 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.330
 organism has some properties or 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.680
 signs and has taken out some properties 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.169
 regarding the mutation of the tension 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.990
 protective arterial against certain types 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.150
 of cancers at the colon level at the level of 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.030
 stomach and pests or fire extinguishers 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.210
 exposed and of course for me it's a 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.360
 excellent food that has a 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.919
 true medicinal action for all 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.690
 people who have a tendency to 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.630
 suffer landslides that in general 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.970
 all the people who want 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.040
 have a bowel movement and open 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.440
 those floodgates that great environment more 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.220
 money or toxic output as is the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.800
 colon 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.750
 incorporate the threat into the diet with 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.450
 this simple cube is pretty enough 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.210
 accept those people who suddenly 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.580
 you have a little intolerance and do not 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.820
 like the 8th because of the risks of the 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.890
 acidity that it has in effect adds spend and 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.140
 how to combine it with another type of sought 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.890
 the papaya friends regularly I love 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.830
 this combination 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.910
 we are going to use that a politician link the 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.910
 of the sun and the blender 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.990
 of the blender 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.940
 but the preparation is quite simple 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.470
 be a little thick to me 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.470
 particularly does not bother me 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:03.470
 and so a little water 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.470
 or it is very simple 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.520
 and good 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:27.040
 and there our game of lives 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.040
 It is not unpleasant 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:34.220
 for the fat content because it gives a 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.500
 feeling a feeling of fullness and 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.680
 It also helps us lose weight health 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.750
 well this is a health space 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.090
 alternative for all so small 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.260
 tips for us to have a 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.410
 excellent health 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:51.280
 remember we are what we eat 

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.280
 we also eat
