all<00:00:05.130> right<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.490> now<00:00:05.640> we<00:00:05.700> switched<00:00:06.060> over<00:00:06.300> to<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:07.230> a

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
all right so now we switched over to a a

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.549 
all right so now we switched over to a a
V<00:00:07.890> right<00:00:07.920> dome<00:00:08.250> light<00:00:08.520> or<00:00:08.730> as<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.570> might<00:00:09.750> know

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
V right dome light or as you might know

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.379 
V right dome light or as you might know
it<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.830> V<00:00:11.219> ray<00:00:11.400> or<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.850> I<00:00:12.000> BL<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.900> mental<00:00:13.260> ray

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
it a V ray or of I BL for mental ray

image<00:00:15.389> based<00:00:15.600> lighting<00:00:15.900> can<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.289> done<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
image based lighting can be done in a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.970 
image based lighting can be done in a
few<00:00:17.279> different<00:00:17.580> ways<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:18.119> v-ray<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.740> first

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
few different ways in v-ray the first

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.180 
few different ways in v-ray the first
and<00:00:20.400> commonly<00:00:21.390> used<00:00:21.510> easiest<00:00:22.320> way<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.770> to<00:00:22.800> go

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
and commonly used easiest way is to go

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.490 
and commonly used easiest way is to go
to<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.580> Global's<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.330> under<00:00:25.140> v-ray

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
to the Global's and under v-ray

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.970 
to the Global's and under v-ray
environment<00:00:26.780> we<00:00:27.780> have<00:00:27.930> an<00:00:28.110> override

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
environment we have an override

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.340 
environment we have an override
environment<00:00:29.610> control<00:00:30.030> and<00:00:30.270> you<00:00:30.360> can<00:00:30.539> map<00:00:30.750> any

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
environment control and you can map any

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.430 
environment control and you can map any
one<00:00:31.860> of<00:00:31.890> these<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:33.059> people<00:00:33.539> often<00:00:33.719> map<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> GI

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
one of these so people often map the GI

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.280 
one of these so people often map the GI
texture<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.220> reflection<00:00:35.700> texture<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.390> even

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
texture and reflection texture and even

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430 
texture and reflection texture and even
the<00:00:37.560> background<00:00:37.739> texture<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.850> dome<00:00:39.440> based

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the background texture with a dome based

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.810 
the background texture with a dome based
HDRI<00:00:41.130> image<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:42.750> fine<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.920> offers

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
HDRI image and that's fine but offers

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.030 
HDRI image and that's fine but offers
fewer<00:00:45.120> controls<00:00:45.660> than<00:00:45.989> using<00:00:46.380> a<00:00:46.470> v-ray<00:00:46.829> dome

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
fewer controls than using a v-ray dome

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.040 
fewer controls than using a v-ray dome
light<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.510> gonna<00:00:48.720> go<00:00:48.960> over<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.290> method

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
light so I'm gonna go over that method

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.620 
light so I'm gonna go over that method
so<00:00:52.050> let's<00:00:52.230> check<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:53.300> again<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.480> under

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
so let's check out again it's under

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.319 
so let's check out again it's under
create<00:00:55.020> lights<00:00:55.640> v-ray<00:00:56.640> dome<00:00:56.850> light<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
create lights v-ray dome light and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.590 
create lights v-ray dome light and
that's<00:00:57.540> what<00:00:57.719> we've<00:00:57.840> created<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that's what we've created here so this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
that's what we've created here so this
dome<00:01:00.840> light<00:01:01.079> has<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:03.290> texture<00:01:04.290> applied<00:01:04.649> to<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
dome light has a texture applied to it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.069 
dome light has a texture applied to it
it's<00:01:05.309> an<00:01:05.460> HDR<00:01:05.939> eye<00:01:07.399> that<00:01:08.509> we<00:01:09.509> can<00:01:09.659> check<00:01:09.869> out

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
it's an HDR eye that we can check out

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.489 
it's an HDR eye that we can check out
here<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.280> simple<00:01:12.139> chrome<00:01:13.139> sphere

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:13.499 
here it's just a simple chrome sphere

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:15.859 
here it's just a simple chrome sphere

spectacular<00:01:17.719> but<00:01:18.719> let's<00:01:19.200> spawn<00:01:19.499> off<00:01:19.709> a<00:01:23.029> new

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:24.029 
spectacular but let's spawn off a new

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:26.359 
spectacular but let's spawn off a new
render<00:01:24.389> now<00:01:25.350> there's<00:01:25.529> a<00:01:25.590> few<00:01:25.770> options<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
render now there's a few options with a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.050 
render now there's a few options with a
dome<00:01:26.579> light<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.719> we<00:01:27.869> should<00:01:28.109> cover<00:01:29.029> one<00:01:30.029> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
dome light that we should cover one of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.660 
dome light that we should cover one of
course<00:01:30.389> is<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.749> enable<00:01:31.139> it<00:01:31.469> I<00:01:31.679> see<00:01:32.639> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
course is that we enable it I see a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.480 
course is that we enable it I see a
default<00:01:33.209> left<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.569> off<00:01:33.719> so<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.229> turn<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.649> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
default left it off so we turn it on and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.139 
default left it off so we turn it on and
we've<00:01:36.209> got<00:01:36.240> our<00:01:36.740> default<00:01:37.740> scene<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
we've got our default scene the

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.149 
we've got our default scene the
intensity<00:01:39.569> multiplier<00:01:40.139> is<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.679> a<00:01:40.829> nice

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
intensity multiplier is just a nice

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
intensity multiplier is just a nice
handy<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.209> control<00:01:42.959> the<00:01:43.109> brightness<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
handy way to control the brightness of

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.120 
handy way to control the brightness of
your<00:01:43.679> HDR<00:01:44.310> they're<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.700> all<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.060> same<00:01:46.130> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
your HDR they're not all the same so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.559 
your HDR they're not all the same so
that's<00:01:47.669> something<00:01:47.849> your<00:01:48.090> environment

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
that's something your environment

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.440 
that's something your environment
wouldn't<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.319> if<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.709> plugged<00:01:50.039> your<00:01:50.969> HDR

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
wouldn't have if you plugged your HDR

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
wouldn't have if you plugged your HDR
into<00:01:51.749> the<00:01:51.869> environment<00:01:52.109> area<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> showed

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.489 
into the environment area that I showed
you<00:01:53.039> earlier<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:54.479> only<00:01:54.630> way<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.109> control

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
you earlier the only way you can control

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.190 
you earlier the only way you can control
its<00:01:55.649> brightness<00:01:55.919> is<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> go<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
its brightness is to go to the the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.999 
its brightness is to go to the the
texture<00:01:58.200> itself<00:01:58.649> or<00:01:59.489> the<00:01:59.700> file<00:01:59.939> node<00:02:00.209> and

adjust<00:02:02.009> its<00:02:02.219> gain<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.349> just<00:02:04.529> a<00:02:04.619> little

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
adjust its gain this is just a little

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.099 
adjust its gain this is just a little
more<00:02:05.130> straightforward<00:02:05.459> and<00:02:05.999> easier<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> deal

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
I'll switch that over the dome spherical

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.460 
I'll switch that over the dome spherical
obviously<00:02:28.340> use<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.790> dome<00:02:28.970> texture<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
obviously use the dome texture and the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.610 
obviously use the dome texture and the
dome<00:02:30.830> texture<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.460> piped<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:32.050> from<00:02:33.050> our<00:02:33.170> HDR

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
dome texture is piped in from our HDR

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.040 
dome texture is piped in from our HDR
eye<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.090> we<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.270> adjust<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.720> texture

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
eye and we can adjust the texture

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.170 
eye and we can adjust the texture
resolution<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.010> fly<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:38.030> is

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
resolution on the fly so this is

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.210 
resolution on the fly so this is
currently<00:02:38.690> using<00:02:39.190> 1024<00:02:40.190> pixels<00:02:40.700> wide<00:02:42.220> that's

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
currently using 1024 pixels wide that's

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.760 
currently using 1024 pixels wide that's
also<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:44.090> our<00:02:44.240> viewport<00:02:44.630> display<00:02:45.110> which<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.740> a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
also in our viewport display which is a

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.430 
also in our viewport display which is a
new<00:02:45.980> feature<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.850> disable<00:02:47.840> viewport

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
new feature you can disable viewport

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.170 
new feature you can disable viewport
display<00:02:48.800> or<00:02:49.040> enable<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.760> can<00:02:49.940> see

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
display or enable it and you can see

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.860 
display or enable it and you can see
that<00:02:51.160> environment<00:02:52.160> in<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.000> maya<00:02:53.180> scene<00:02:53.510> which

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
that environment in the maya scene which

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.280 
that environment in the maya scene which
is<00:02:54.050> very<00:02:54.260> handy<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.940> that's<00:02:56.540> also<00:02:56.930> set<00:02:57.170> to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
is very handy the that's also set to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.140 
is very handy the that's also set to
1024<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:59.230> so<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.590> also<00:03:00.770> converts<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.460> to<00:03:01.490> srgb

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
1024 and so it also converts it to srgb

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.980 
1024 and so it also converts it to srgb
space<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:03.110> gives<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> very<00:03:05.120> proper

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
space so it gives you a very proper

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.720 
space so it gives you a very proper
representation<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.010> viewport<00:03:07.400> instead

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
representation in the viewport instead

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.610 
representation in the viewport instead
of<00:03:07.850> some<00:03:08.060> flat<00:03:08.330> linear<00:03:08.680> image<00:03:11.290> now<00:03:12.290> one<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
of some flat linear image now one of the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.760 
of some flat linear image now one of the
first<00:03:12.860> things<00:03:13.130> most<00:03:13.430> people<00:03:13.580> asked<00:03:14.030> about

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
first things most people asked about

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.850 
first things most people asked about
image<00:03:15.770> based<00:03:16.010> lighting<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.520> how<00:03:16.670> do<00:03:16.730> we<00:03:17.060> rotate

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
image based lighting is how do we rotate

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.430 
image based lighting is how do we rotate
the<00:03:19.360> position<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.660> because<00:03:20.989> if<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.200> just

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
the position of this because if you just

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.900 
the position of this because if you just
grab<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.860> light<00:03:22.070> which<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.489> what<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.670> have

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
grab the light which is what I have

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.790 
grab the light which is what I have
currently<00:03:23.120> selected<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:24.140> dome<00:03:24.350> light<00:03:24.380> and

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
currently selected the dome light and

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.930 
currently selected the dome light and
rotate<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.930> you'll<00:03:26.930> see<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.730> does<00:03:28.730> absolutely

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
rotate it you'll see it does absolutely

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.750 
rotate it you'll see it does absolutely
nothing<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:30.470> doesn't<00:03:30.860> change<00:03:31.070> how<00:03:31.700> the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
nothing it doesn't change how the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.820 
nothing it doesn't change how the
environment<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:32.780> mapped<00:03:33.050> onto<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.560> light<00:03:35.830> so

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
environment is mapped onto that light so

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.010 
environment is mapped onto that light so
yeah<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.160> looks<00:03:37.310> like<00:03:37.459> not<00:03:37.730> not<00:03:38.180> any<00:03:38.420> single

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
yeah it looks like not not any single

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.670 
yeah it looks like not not any single
angle<00:03:40.690> adjustment<00:03:41.690> actually<00:03:42.050> does<00:03:42.230> anything

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
angle adjustment actually does anything

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.320 
angle adjustment actually does anything
to<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.100> dome<00:03:43.790> light<00:03:44.530> IBL<00:03:45.530> position<00:03:45.950> itself<00:03:46.330> to

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
to the dome light IBL position itself to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.920 
to the dome light IBL position itself to
adjust<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:48.580> will<00:03:49.580> go<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.360> texture<00:03:50.750> node

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
adjust that will go to the texture node

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.199 
adjust that will go to the texture node
it's<00:03:51.830> actually<00:03:52.130> handiest<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.700> go<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:52.940> the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
it's actually handiest to go to the

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.229 
it's actually handiest to go to the
hypershade<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:54.580> graph<00:03:55.580> out<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.030> dome<00:03:56.209> light

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
hypershade and graph out the dome light

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.020 
hypershade and graph out the dome light
so<00:03:57.070> that's<00:03:58.070> what<00:03:58.190> I've<00:03:58.280> already<00:03:58.430> done<00:03:58.610> so

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
so that's what I've already done so

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.120 
so that's what I've already done so
there's<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.330> dome<00:03:59.540> light<00:03:59.570> here's<00:04:00.410> our<00:04:00.620> HDR<00:04:01.040> I

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
there's the dome light here's our HDR I

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.030 
there's the dome light here's our HDR I
texture<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.880> this<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.650> node<00:04:03.890> that

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
texture and this is the the node that

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.530 
texture and this is the the node that
we're<00:04:04.220> looking<00:04:04.340> for<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.940> v-ray<00:04:05.239> place

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
we're looking for the v-ray place

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.770 
we're looking for the v-ray place
environment<00:04:06.260> texture<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.880> allows<00:04:08.420> us<00:04:08.660> to

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
environment texture that allows us to

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.160 
environment texture that allows us to
control<00:04:09.110> a<00:04:09.470> few<00:04:10.220> things<00:04:10.459> it's<00:04:11.300> horizontal<00:04:11.630> and

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
control a few things it's horizontal and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.290 
control a few things it's horizontal and
vertical<00:04:12.680> rotation<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.430> they've<00:04:13.700> also<00:04:13.880> got

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
vertical rotation and they've also got

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.370 
vertical rotation and they've also got
horizontal<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.410> vertical<00:04:15.739> flips<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:17.380> also

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
horizontal and vertical flips and also

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.789 
horizontal and vertical flips and also
handy<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.919> if<00:04:19.100> you're<00:04:19.250> not<00:04:19.280> using<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.940> latitude

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
handy is if you're not using a latitude

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.740 
handy is if you're not using a latitude
unwrapped<00:04:22.180> image<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.419> can

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
unwrapped image you can

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.800 
unwrapped image you can
angular's<00:04:24.260> cubics<00:04:24.830> Mirrorball<00:04:25.370> any<00:04:25.760> sort<00:04:26.750> of

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
image you want the one we're using is

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.400 
image you want the one we're using is
spherical<00:04:29.900> or<00:04:30.080> latitude<00:04:30.820> distorted<00:04:32.230> you<00:04:33.230> want

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
spherical or latitude distorted you want

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.170 
spherical or latitude distorted you want
to<00:04:33.500> adjust<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.920> rotation<00:04:34.090> horizontally<00:04:35.090> of

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
to adjust the rotation horizontally of

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.000 
to adjust the rotation horizontally of
your<00:04:35.330> image<00:04:35.570> it's<00:04:36.020> all<00:04:36.230> in<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.470> horizontal

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
your image it's all in the horizontal

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:46.660 
your image it's all in the horizontal
rotation<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:45.440> likewise<00:04:46.100> there<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:46.550> a

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
rotation and likewise there is a

vertical rotation controls which are

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.400 
vertical rotation controls which are
used<00:04:49.280> less<00:04:49.580> frequently<00:04:49.610> not<00:04:50.330> you'd<00:04:51.140> really

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
used less frequently not you'd really

want<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.680> flip<00:04:51.920> your<00:04:51.950> HDRI<00:04:52.550> entirely<00:04:53.120> but<00:04:53.510> I'm

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
want to flip your HDRI entirely but I'm

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.540 
want to flip your HDRI entirely but I'm
sure<00:04:54.350> there's<00:04:54.560> certain<00:04:54.800> cases<00:04:55.040> where<00:04:55.400> you'd

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
sure there's certain cases where you'd

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.680 
sure there's certain cases where you'd
want<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:56.950> now<00:04:57.950> you<00:04:58.070> might<00:04:58.220> notice<00:04:58.370> let's<00:04:58.940> check

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
want to now you might notice let's check

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.850 
want to now you might notice let's check
out<00:04:59.840> our<00:04:59.870> image<00:05:00.320> again<00:05:02.080> let's<00:05:03.080> view<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:05.860> we

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
out our image again let's view that we

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.250 
out our image again let's view that we
do<00:05:07.040> have<00:05:07.310> more<00:05:07.340> or<00:05:07.760> less<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:08.180> Sun<00:05:08.510> coming<00:05:08.990> from<00:05:09.140> a

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
do have more or less a Sun coming from a

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.220 
do have more or less a Sun coming from a
particular<00:05:09.740> direction<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:11.180> we<00:05:11.810> should<00:05:12.020> get

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
particular direction so we should get

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.740 
particular direction so we should get
some<00:05:12.590> definition<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.340> shadows<00:05:16.450> let's<00:05:17.450> turn

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
some definition of shadows let's turn

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.050 
some definition of shadows let's turn
this<00:05:17.870> material<00:05:18.440> down<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.160> little<00:05:19.580> bit<00:05:19.790> so<00:05:20.030> that

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
this material down a little bit so that

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.180 
this material down a little bit so that
we<00:05:20.300> can<00:05:20.480> get<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.660> better<00:05:20.840> sense<00:05:20.960> of<00:05:21.410> where

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
we can get a better sense of where

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.370 
we can get a better sense of where
shadows<00:05:22.490> are<00:05:22.850> falling<00:05:25.750> now<00:05:26.750> you<00:05:26.810> can<00:05:27.020> see<00:05:27.260> as

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
shadows are falling now you can see as

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.120 
shadows are falling now you can see as
I've<00:05:27.560> let<00:05:27.979> it<00:05:28.100> refine<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.990> our<00:05:29.990> HDRI<00:05:30.590> does

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
I've let it refine that our HDRI does

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:37.240 
I've let it refine that our HDRI does
have<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:32.650> soft<00:05:33.650> low<00:05:34.220> Sun<00:05:34.669> that<00:05:35.470> it's<00:05:36.470> slightly

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
have a soft low Sun that it's slightly

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.460 
have a soft low Sun that it's slightly
overcast<00:05:37.729> in<00:05:38.060> that<00:05:38.210> day<00:05:38.450> and<00:05:38.990> you<00:05:39.020> can<00:05:39.290> see

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
overcast in that day and you can see

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.190 
overcast in that day and you can see
that<00:05:39.650> v-ray<00:05:40.550> is<00:05:40.729> picking<00:05:41.150> up<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.930> shadow

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
that v-ray is picking up the shadow

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.650 
that v-ray is picking up the shadow
definition<00:05:42.890> there<00:05:43.070> is<00:05:43.210> directionality<00:05:44.210> to

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
definition there is directionality to

definition there is directionality to
the<00:05:44.780> shadow<00:05:45.020> which<00:05:45.919> is<00:05:46.190> a<00:05:46.490> great<00:05:46.940> advantage<00:05:47.210> to

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
the shadow which is a great advantage to

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.420 
the shadow which is a great advantage to

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
using v-ray v-ray dome lights because

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.690 
using v-ray v-ray dome lights because
they<00:05:52.610> are<00:05:52.820> fully<00:05:53.150> adaptive<00:05:53.720> and<00:05:53.960> we'll

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
they are fully adaptive and we'll

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.280 
they are fully adaptive and we'll
important<00:05:55.700> sample<00:05:56.180> your<00:05:56.360> dome<00:05:56.600> light<00:05:56.870> so<00:05:57.140> the

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
important sample your dome light so the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.170 
important sample your dome light so the
brightest<00:05:57.650> areas<00:05:57.979> get<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.310> most<00:05:58.520> samples<00:05:58.970> and

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
brightest areas get the most samples and

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.240 
brightest areas get the most samples and
we'll<00:05:59.870> get<00:06:00.050> nice<00:06:00.260> clean<00:06:00.590> shadow

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
we'll get nice clean shadow

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.880 
we'll get nice clean shadow
directionality<00:06:02.320> now<00:06:03.320> I<00:06:03.350> can<00:06:03.590> be<00:06:03.680> better

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890

but they did put it up there for people
to<00:06:39.560> use<00:06:39.680> and<00:06:40.130> I'm<00:06:40.880> just<00:06:41.060> showing<00:06:41.260> how<00:06:42.260> it's

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
to use and I'm just showing how it's

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.700 
to use and I'm just showing how it's
working<00:06:42.680> but<00:06:43.370> it's<00:06:43.520> an<00:06:43.669> HDR<00:06:44.030> of<00:06:44.330> a<00:06:44.389> flashlight

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
working but it's an HDR of a flashlight

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.290 
working but it's an HDR of a flashlight
illuminating<00:06:45.710> a<00:06:45.800> scene<00:06:46.040> and<00:06:47.889> it<00:06:49.120> shows<00:06:50.120> very

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
clearly that the v-ray light is or dome

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.140 
clearly that the v-ray light is or dome
light<00:06:53.660> is<00:06:54.310> image<00:06:55.310> based<00:06:55.580> and<00:06:55.850> as<00:06:55.940> being

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
light is image based and as being

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.390 
light is image based and as being
important<00:06:56.720> sampled<00:06:57.169> so<00:06:57.440> that<00:06:57.650> we're<00:06:58.250> getting

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
important sampled so that we're getting

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.379 
important sampled so that we're getting
very<00:06:58.820> defined<00:06:59.300> shadows<00:06:59.810> from<00:07:00.110> our<00:07:00.590> HDR<00:07:01.130> i

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
very defined shadows from our HDR i

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.590 
very defined shadows from our HDR i
again<00:07:02.389> a<00:07:02.419> huge<00:07:02.690> advantage<00:07:03.199> over<00:07:03.380> mental<00:07:04.280> rays

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
again a huge advantage over mental rays

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.480 
again a huge advantage over mental rays
methods<00:07:05.600> of<00:07:05.840> of<00:07:06.350> handling<00:07:07.010> image<00:07:07.250> based

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
methods of of handling image based

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.420 
methods of of handling image based
lighting<00:07:08.199> so<00:07:09.199> there<00:07:09.620> you<00:07:09.740> go<00:07:09.889> for<00:07:10.160> the<00:07:10.250> dome

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
lighting so there you go for the dome

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.050 
lighting so there you go for the dome
light<00:07:10.960> i'll<00:07:11.960> just<00:07:12.320> quickly<00:07:12.500> show<00:07:13.070> let's<00:07:13.790> hide

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
light i'll just quickly show let's hide

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.110 
light i'll just quickly show let's hide
the<00:07:14.240> dome<00:07:14.419> light<00:07:15.190> all<00:07:16.190> right<00:07:16.340> so<00:07:16.580> let's<00:07:16.760> create

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
the dome light all right so let's create

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.490 
the dome light all right so let's create
a<00:07:17.450> sphere<00:07:17.540> light<00:07:19.210> and<00:07:20.210> you'll<00:07:20.690> see<00:07:20.900> that<00:07:21.080> is

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
a sphere light and you'll see that is

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.730 
a sphere light and you'll see that is
pretty<00:07:22.190> much<00:07:22.340> what<00:07:22.580> it<00:07:22.610> says<00:07:22.940> is<00:07:23.330> a<00:07:23.740> spherical

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 
pretty much what it says is a spherical

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.219 
pretty much what it says is a spherical
light<00:07:25.130> suitable<00:07:25.790> for<00:07:26.030> imitating<00:07:26.930> the

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:27.229 
light suitable for imitating the

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.590 
light suitable for imitating the
fall-off<00:07:27.500> of<00:07:27.860> say<00:07:28.100> a<00:07:28.130> bulb<00:07:28.490> light<00:07:29.030> bulb<00:07:29.240> or

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:29.600 
fall-off of say a bulb light bulb or

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.629 
fall-off of say a bulb light bulb or
chinese<00:07:30.139> lantern<00:07:30.650> something<00:07:31.100> larger<00:07:31.520> and

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 
chinese lantern something larger and

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.100 
chinese lantern something larger and
pretty<00:07:34.639> much<00:07:34.789> has<00:07:34.970> all<00:07:35.150> the<00:07:35.270> same<00:07:35.479> settings<00:07:35.900> as

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
pretty much has all the same settings as

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.659 
pretty much has all the same settings as
the<00:07:36.229> rectangle<00:07:36.770> light<00:07:36.919> so<00:07:37.130> there's<00:07:37.310> not<00:07:37.460> much

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:37.669 
the rectangle light so there's not much

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:41.620 
the rectangle light so there's not much
more<00:07:37.940> to<00:07:38.240> go<00:07:38.600> over<00:07:38.979> with<00:07:39.979> that<00:07:40.250> very<00:07:41.180> similar

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:41.630 
more to go over with that very similar

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.400 
more to go over with that very similar
setup<00:07:42.020> and<00:07:43.450> there<00:07:44.450> you<00:07:44.630> go<00:07:44.780> so<00:07:45.080> that's<00:07:45.200> the

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:45.410 
setup and there you go so that's the

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.760 
setup and there you go so that's the
basics<00:07:45.889> of<00:07:46.039> v-ray<00:07:46.760> lights<00:07:47.440> we'll<00:07:48.440> get<00:07:48.620> into

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:48.770 
basics of v-ray lights we'll get into

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.029 
basics of v-ray lights we'll get into
some<00:07:48.979> more<00:07:49.550> lighting<00:07:49.850> technique<00:07:50.479> and

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 
some more lighting technique and

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.830 
some more lighting technique and
concepts<00:07:52.039> for<00:07:52.880> how<00:07:53.180> to<00:07:53.240> light<00:07:53.479> certain

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 
concepts for how to light certain

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.100 
concepts for how to light certain
subjects<00:07:54.349> in<00:07:54.560> later<00:07:54.800> videos<00:07:55.190> so<00:07:55.870> thanks<00:07:56.870> a<00:07:56.960> lot

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.110 
subjects in later videos so thanks a lot

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.130 
subjects in later videos so thanks a lot
for<00:07:57.289> watching<00:07:57.349> and<00:07:57.919> take<00:07:58.099> care
