00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
complexes and stuff like that so those

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.790 
complexes and stuff like that so those
are<00:01:38.670> more<00:01:38.910> what<00:01:39.090> these<00:01:39.300> are<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.959> really

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.669 
are more what these are for and really
nice<00:01:40.920> designs<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:42.380> mean<00:01:43.380> there's<00:01:43.590> really

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
nice designs I mean there's really

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.440 
nice designs I mean there's really
simple<00:01:44.250> there's<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.670> too<00:01:44.970> much<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.179> them

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
simple there's not too much to them

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
simple there's not too much to them
basically<00:01:46.349> over<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.830> there's<00:01:47.039> not<00:01:47.190> too<00:01:47.369> much

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
basically over here there's not too much

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999 
basically over here there's not too much
room<00:01:47.580> left<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.090> work<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.709> basically

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
room left to work with and so basically

buildings<00:02:21.239> over<00:02:21.480> here

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
buildings over here

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.559 
buildings over here
originally<00:02:23.069> this<00:02:23.610> these<00:02:24.000> three<00:02:24.239> buildings

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
originally this these three buildings

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.360 
originally this these three buildings
right<00:02:24.660> here<00:02:24.870> was<00:02:25.260> originally<00:02:25.530> only<00:02:26.160> supposed

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
right here was originally only supposed

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.210 
right here was originally only supposed
to<00:02:26.459> be<00:02:26.550> one<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.120> one<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.569> left<00:02:28.040> but<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
to be one the one on the left but then I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.070 
to be one the one on the left but then I
realized<00:02:29.550> how<00:02:29.610> skinny<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.030> made<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.050> I

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
realized how skinny I made it and so I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.390 
realized how skinny I made it and so I
ended<00:02:31.349> up<00:02:31.440> making<00:02:31.560> three<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.160> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
ended up making three of them and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.890 
ended up making three of them and
actually<00:02:32.580> worked<00:02:32.880> out<00:02:33.000> perfectly<00:02:33.360> because

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
actually worked out perfectly because

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.510 
actually worked out perfectly because
now<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.349> have<00:02:34.470> sidewalks<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.010> both<00:02:35.040> sides

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
now I can have sidewalks on both sides

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.770 
now I can have sidewalks on both sides
and<00:02:35.760> there's<00:02:36.090> plenty<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> room<00:02:36.720> for

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and there's plenty of room for

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.949 
and there's plenty of room for
everything<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.730> same<00:02:38.880> stone<00:02:39.150> building<00:02:39.510> I'm

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
everything the same stone building I'm

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.630 
everything the same stone building I'm
not<00:02:40.140> sure<00:02:40.290> if<00:02:40.380> I've<00:02:40.470> actually<00:02:40.620> said<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.160> but

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
not sure if I've actually said this but

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.490 
not sure if I've actually said this but
this<00:02:41.849> is<00:02:41.970> actually<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.450> first<00:02:42.750> building<00:02:43.410> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
this is actually the first building I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.960 
this is actually the first building I
actually<00:02:43.680> started<00:02:44.010> working<00:02:44.069> on<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.790> city

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
actually started working on on the city

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.750 
actually started working on on the city
and<00:02:45.319> it's<00:02:46.319> really<00:02:46.620> funny<00:02:46.890> how<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.519> first

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
and it's really funny how the first

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.670 
and it's really funny how the first
building<00:02:48.209> on<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.510> city<00:02:48.690> has<00:02:48.959> never<00:02:49.140> even<00:02:49.530> been

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
building on the city has never even been

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.949 
building on the city has never even been
finished<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.849> I<00:02:50.880> had<00:02:51.360> been<00:02:51.390> working<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.750> that

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
finished so I had been working on that

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.449 
finished so I had been working on that
I'm<00:02:52.200> gonna<00:02:52.349> finish<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.709> up<00:02:52.800> by<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:52.980> next<00:02:53.220> part

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
I'm gonna finish it up by the next part

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.430

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
promise because it's a pain in the ass

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.979 
promise because it's a pain in the ass
this<00:02:57.540> because<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.140> tall<00:02:59.120> we<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.299> the

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
this because it's so tall we have the

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.140 
this because it's so tall we have the
park<00:03:01.230> area<00:03:01.410> which<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.830> right<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:03.060> you

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
park area which is right here so you

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.630 
park area which is right here so you
might<00:03:03.360> be<00:03:03.420> wondering<00:03:03.510> why<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:05.250> Minecraft

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
might be wondering why is the Minecraft

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.140 
might be wondering why is the Minecraft
character<00:03:06.019> using<00:03:07.019> grey<00:03:07.799> black<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.549> light

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
character using grey black and light

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.809 
character using grey black and light
grey<00:03:09.420> wool<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.260> reason<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.950> statues

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
grey wool the reason for that is statues

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.430 
grey wool the reason for that is statues
really<00:03:12.060> don't<00:03:12.209> have<00:03:12.420> too<00:03:12.750> much<00:03:12.840> color<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.319> them

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
really don't have too much color to them

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.990 
really don't have too much color to them
because<00:03:13.860> they're<00:03:14.010> always<00:03:14.160> out<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.790> Sun

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
because they're always out in the Sun

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.270 
because they're always out in the Sun
and<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.049> figured<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.739> make<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> little<00:03:17.130> bit

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
and so I figured to make it a little bit

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.890 
and so I figured to make it a little bit
more<00:03:17.400> realistic<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.030> would<00:03:18.150> use<00:03:18.330> those<00:03:18.480> colors

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
more realistic I would use those colors

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.370 
more realistic I would use those colors
and<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.890> yeah<00:03:20.130> here's<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.519> new<00:03:20.610> park<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
and so yeah here's the new park it's a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.229 
and so yeah here's the new park it's a
different<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.400> different<00:03:23.700> design<00:03:23.790> not

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
different it's a different design not

different<00:04:02.670> facts<00:04:02.819> about<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.150> city<00:04:04.100> let's<00:04:05.100> see

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
different facts about the city let's see

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.670 
different facts about the city let's see
it's<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.030> I<00:04:06.120> said<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.299> lot<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.720> stuff<00:04:07.560> that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
it's like I said a lot of the stuff that

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.900 
it's like I said a lot of the stuff that
I've<00:04:07.739> been<00:04:07.769> working<00:04:08.069> on<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.400> working<00:04:08.670> on<00:04:08.819> the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
I've been working on is working on the

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.490 
I've been working on is working on the
floors<00:04:09.209> so<00:04:09.600> if<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.780> look<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.049> map<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.440> can

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
floors so if you look on the map you can

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.710 
floors so if you look on the map you can
see<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> lot<00:04:10.829> more<00:04:10.859> gray<00:04:11.370> than<00:04:11.400> grass<00:04:11.880> now<00:04:12.120> which

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
see a lot more gray than grass now which

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.150 
see a lot more gray than grass now which
is<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> good<00:04:13.079> thing<00:04:13.139> and<00:04:13.530> eventually<00:04:14.069> this

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
is a good thing and eventually this

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.190 
is a good thing and eventually this
whole<00:04:14.220> left<00:04:14.700> side<00:04:14.940> for<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.540> most<00:04:15.750> part<00:04:15.959> will

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
whole left side for the most part will

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.029 
whole left side for the most part will
be<00:04:16.489> gray<00:04:17.489> on<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.820> map<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.239> not<00:04:18.329> grass<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:19.229> this

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
be gray on the map and not grass so this

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.279 
be gray on the map and not grass so this
building<00:04:20.250> right<00:04:20.400> here<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:21.600> actually<00:04:21.750> another

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
building right here is actually another

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.409 
building right here is actually another
one<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.470> my<00:04:22.530> favorites<00:04:22.979> just<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.700> design

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
one of my favorites just that the design

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.600 
one of my favorites just that the design
of<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.750> it's<00:04:24.930> unique<00:04:25.370> when<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.430> showed<00:04:26.580> my

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
of it it's unique when I showed my

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.279 
of it it's unique when I showed my
friend<00:04:27.000> that<00:04:27.120> she's<00:04:27.270> actually<00:04:27.389> like<00:04:27.600> Stein's

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
friend that she's actually like Stein's

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.690 
friend that she's actually like Stein's
why<00:04:28.560> do<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.740> always<00:04:28.860> do<00:04:29.070> weird<00:04:29.280> designs<00:04:29.550> for

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
why do you always do weird designs for

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.399 
why do you always do weird designs for
your<00:04:29.789> windows<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.450> it's<00:04:30.539> like<00:04:30.659> I<00:04:30.840> have<00:04:31.260> no

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
your windows and it's like I have no

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.320 
your windows and it's like I have no
idea<00:04:31.650> dude<00:04:31.860> it's<00:04:32.580> just<00:04:32.849> one<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:33.030> those<00:04:33.120> things

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
idea dude it's just one of those things

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.720 
idea dude it's just one of those things
and<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:34.530> up<00:04:34.680> here<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:34.950> grass<00:04:35.190> area

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
and so up here is grass area

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.060 
and so up here is grass area
not<00:04:36.270> too<00:04:36.450> much<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.900> figured<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.290> grass<00:04:37.470> area<00:04:37.830> up

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
not too much I figured the grass area up

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.710 
not too much I figured the grass area up
here<00:04:38.100> will<00:04:38.430> just<00:04:38.490> make<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.760> look<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.450> little<00:04:39.540> bit

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
here will just make it look a little bit

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.530 
here will just make it look a little bit
better<00:04:39.840> from<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.350> sky<00:04:40.830> point<00:04:41.160> of<00:04:41.280> view<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:42.180> over

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
better from a sky point of view and over

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.570 
better from a sky point of view and over
here<00:04:42.840> we<00:04:43.260> have<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.560> new<00:04:43.710> tallest<00:04:44.160> building<00:04:44.460> on

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
here we have the new tallest building on

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.060 
here we have the new tallest building on
the<00:04:44.730> map<00:04:45.200> so<00:04:46.200> if<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.410> fly<00:04:46.590> all<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.800> way<00:04:46.890> up

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
the map so if you fly all the way up

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.520 
the map so if you fly all the way up
this<00:04:48.000> basically<00:04:48.480> goes<00:04:48.660> all<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.840> way<00:04:48.990> up<00:04:49.260> to

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
this basically goes all the way up to

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.740 
this basically goes all the way up to
the<00:04:49.740> height<00:04:49.920> limit<00:04:50.600> originally<00:04:51.600> this

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
the height limit originally this

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.000 
the height limit originally this
building<00:04:52.020> was<00:04:52.140> not<00:04:52.320> supposed<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.650> be<00:04:52.770> this

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
building was not supposed to be this

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.220 
building was not supposed to be this
tall<00:04:53.190> it<00:04:53.730> just<00:04:53.970> turned<00:04:54.630> out<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.840> be<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.080> tall

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
tall it just turned out to be this tall

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.410 
tall it just turned out to be this tall
and<00:04:55.640> basically<00:04:56.640> the<00:04:56.790> plane<00:04:56.940> with<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.270> is

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
and basically the plane with it is

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.120 
and basically the plane with it is
because<00:04:58.320> it<00:04:58.440> looks<00:04:58.590> really<00:04:58.770> nice<00:04:58.920> in<00:04:59.100> my

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
because it looks really nice in my

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.960 
because it looks really nice in my
opinion<00:04:59.240> if<00:05:00.240> you<00:05:00.300> look<00:05:00.450> all<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.600> way<00:05:00.690> up<00:05:01.970> I'm

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
opinion if you look all the way up I'm

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.060 
opinion if you look all the way up I'm
gonna<00:05:03.150> add<00:05:03.330> two<00:05:03.690> smaller<00:05:04.020> ones<00:05:04.260> on<00:05:04.440> both<00:05:04.740> sides

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
gonna add two smaller ones on both sides

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.180 
gonna add two smaller ones on both sides
since<00:05:05.640> I<00:05:05.940> have<00:05:06.120> enough<00:05:06.300> room<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:07.470> then<00:05:07.650> back

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
since I have enough room and then back

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.440 
since I have enough room and then back
here<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.460> gonna<00:05:08.610> be<00:05:08.670> like<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.820> little<00:05:08.970> entrance

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
here is gonna be like a little entrance

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.290 
here is gonna be like a little entrance
area<00:05:09.840> for<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.170> and<00:05:10.320> stuff<00:05:10.530> like<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:11.120> I'm<00:05:12.120> not

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
area for it and stuff like that I'm not

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.520 
area for it and stuff like that I'm not
exactly<00:05:12.570> sure<00:05:12.720> what<00:05:13.050> I'm<00:05:13.140> gonna<00:05:13.230> do<00:05:13.380> with<00:05:13.470> that

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
exactly sure what I'm gonna do with that

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.240 
exactly sure what I'm gonna do with that
yet<00:05:13.800> but<00:05:14.040> I'll<00:05:14.280> think<00:05:14.430> of<00:05:14.550> something<00:05:14.880> later<00:05:15.240> on

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
yet but I'll think of something later on

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
yet but I'll think of something later on
and<00:05:17.250> then<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.430> think<00:05:17.820> one<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.150> last

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
and then I think one of the last

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.640 
and then I think one of the last
buildings<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:18.990> guys<00:05:19.140> haven't<00:05:19.470> seen

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
buildings have windows but that will
