machine<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.590> date<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.100> time

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
machine the date and the time

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.870 
machine the date and the time
so<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.780> actual<00:04:58.770> file<00:04:59.070> name<00:04:59.280> will<00:04:59.430> be<00:04:59.550> pretty

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
so the actual file name will be pretty

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.250 
so the actual file name will be pretty
long<00:05:00.090> if<00:05:00.420> you<00:05:00.570> look<00:05:00.720> at<00:05:00.870> here<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:03.180> can<00:05:03.360> by

tray one tray two is also a universal
paper<00:06:05.590> tray<00:06:05.890> but<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.790> second<00:06:07.180> tray<00:06:07.360> will

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
paper tray but the second tray will

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.570 
paper tray but the second tray will
allow<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.080> to<00:06:08.970> use<00:06:09.970> up<00:06:10.270> to<00:06:10.750> 12<00:06:11.260> by<00:06:11.590> 18<00:06:11.920> paper

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
allow you to use up to 12 by 18 paper

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.140 
allow you to use up to 12 by 18 paper
size<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:14.110> machine<00:06:14.410> will<00:06:14.560> not<00:06:14.640> full<00:06:15.640> bleed<00:06:15.940> on

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
size the machine will not full bleed on

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.720 
size the machine will not full bleed on
12<00:06:16.420> by<00:06:16.540> 18<00:06:16.720> but<00:06:17.080> it<00:06:17.230> will<00:06:17.320> full<00:06:17.620> bleed<00:06:17.860> 11<00:06:18.250> by<00:06:18.370> 17

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
12 by 18 but it will full bleed 11 by 17

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.470 
12 by 18 but it will full bleed 11 by 17
so<00:06:19.150> that's<00:06:19.330> a<00:06:19.480> good<00:06:19.630> feature<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:22.150> machine

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
so that's a good feature the machine

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.950 
so that's a good feature the machine
itself<00:06:22.750> has<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.520> automatic<00:06:24.720> duplexing<00:06:25.720> so<00:06:25.870> you

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
itself has a automatic duplexing so you

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.380 
itself has a automatic duplexing so you
can<00:06:26.170> print<00:06:27.010> or<00:06:27.280> copy<00:06:28.380> front<00:06:29.380> and<00:06:29.500> back<00:06:30.240> if<00:06:31.240> you

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
can print or copy front and back if you

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.050 
can print or copy front and back if you
look<00:06:31.570> on<00:06:31.780> the<00:06:31.960> right<00:06:32.140> side<00:06:32.170> here<00:06:32.860> this<00:06:33.730> is<00:06:33.910> your

look on the right side here this is your

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.130 
look on the right side here this is your
main<00:06:34.330> jammed<00:06:34.750> or<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:37.300> machine<00:06:37.600> itself<00:06:37.900> it's

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
main jammed or the machine itself it's

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.740 
main jammed or the machine itself it's
pretty<00:06:38.410> easy<00:06:38.590> to<00:06:38.740> find<00:06:39.430> and<00:06:39.910> release<00:06:40.390> gem

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
pretty easy to find and release gem

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.280 
pretty easy to find and release gem
papers<00:06:41.440> it's<00:06:41.740> just<00:06:42.070> a<00:06:42.160> basic<00:06:42.370> u-turn<00:06:42.880> path<00:06:43.290> so

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
papers it's just a basic u-turn path so

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.499 
papers it's just a basic u-turn path so
