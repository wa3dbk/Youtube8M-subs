00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.080 

when<00:00:00.659> I<00:00:00.719> got<00:00:00.870> these<00:00:01.020> tires<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.620> was<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:02.250> was<00:00:02.850> doing

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
when I got these tires I was I was doing

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.470 
when I got these tires I was I was doing
some<00:00:03.270> research<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.589> came<00:00:05.370> across<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:06.120> pile

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
some research and I came across the pile

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.560 
some research and I came across the pile
of<00:00:06.509> old<00:00:06.690> tubes<00:00:07.700> and<00:00:08.700> then<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.000> heard<00:00:09.179> about<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
of old tubes and then I heard about the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.180 
of old tubes and then I heard about the
3s<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.790> then<00:00:11.790> came<00:00:12.090> along<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.450> fours<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:13.500> did

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
3s and then came along the fours I did

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.720 
3s and then came along the fours I did
my<00:00:14.309> research<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.470> said<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.130> pilot<00:00:17.609> role

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
my research and said that the pilot role

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.460 
my research and said that the pilot role
for<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.270> put<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> last<00:00:18.840> longer<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:21.439> be<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
for just put the last longer and be a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.310 
for just put the last longer and be a
little<00:00:22.830> bit<00:00:22.949> more<00:00:23.130> stickier<00:00:23.810> so<00:00:24.810> that's<00:00:25.109> why<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
little bit more stickier so that's why I

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.070 
little bit more stickier so that's why I
chose<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> pyro<00:00:26.189> force<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> far<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.810> them<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
chose a pyro force so far I like them a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
chose a pyro force so far I like them a
lot<00:00:32.360> I'm<00:00:33.360> hoping<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.260> least<00:00:34.320> 10,000

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
lot I'm hoping to get at least 10,000

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.610 
lot I'm hoping to get at least 10,000
miles<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:37.290> some<00:00:37.500> people

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
miles out of it it's a what some people

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.650 
miles out of it it's a what some people
are<00:00:37.860> getting<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:39.360> pocket<00:00:39.750> roads<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
are getting out of the pocket roads so

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.799 
are getting out of the pocket roads so
at<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.809> track<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:44.059> they<00:00:45.059> seem<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.480> pretty

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
at the track up they seem to do pretty

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.400 
at the track up they seem to do pretty
well<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.010> novice<00:00:47.430> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
well I was in novice so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.410 
well I was in novice so
the<00:00:49.770> breaking<00:00:50.130> was<00:00:50.250> good<00:00:50.430> acceleration<00:00:50.910> was

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the breaking was good acceleration was

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
the breaking was good acceleration was
good<00:00:51.600> coming<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:52.950> of<00:00:53.100> corner<00:00:53.430> was

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
good coming in and out of corner was

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.240 
good coming in and out of corner was
okay

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
okay

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.420 
okay
I<00:00:55.280> do<00:00:55.670> recommend<00:00:56.090> them<00:00:56.269> for<00:00:56.769> for<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.890> track<00:00:58.160> if

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
I do recommend them for for the track if

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.460 
I do recommend them for for the track if
you're<00:00:58.660> honest<00:00:59.660> it's<00:01:00.050> okay<00:01:00.410> but<00:01:01.340> uh

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.960 

into<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.620> advanced<00:01:05.129> level<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.610> want<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> get

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
into the advanced level you want to get

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.610 
into the advanced level you want to get
something<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.420> that's<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> more

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
something that that's going to be more

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.160 
something that that's going to be more
stickier

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.179 

I<00:01:10.259> think<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.920> paid<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:12.020> around<00:01:13.020> 350<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.070> these

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
I think I paid like around 350 for these

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.210 
I think I paid like around 350 for these
front<00:01:14.640> front<00:01:15.090> back<00:01:15.180> tires<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.799> mounted<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
front front back tires and I mounted it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.539 
front front back tires and I mounted it
myself<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.850> balanced<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> myself<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> rain

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
myself I balanced it myself and the rain

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.149 
myself I balanced it myself and the rain
they<00:01:20.759> did<00:01:20.939> pretty<00:01:21.240> well<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:21.689> stuck<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.560> wasn't

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
they did pretty well they stuck I wasn't

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
they did pretty well they stuck I wasn't
really<00:01:23.460> pushing<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
really pushing it but just right on the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
really pushing it but just right on the
street<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:25.740> rain

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
street in the rain

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.910 
street in the rain
to<00:01:27.600> filter<00:01:27.990> out<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> water<00:01:28.590> pretty<00:01:28.829> good

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
to filter out the water pretty good

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.140 
to filter out the water pretty good
I<00:01:30.009> think<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.430> only<00:01:30.580> thing<00:01:30.670> flipping

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
I think the only thing flipping

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.990 
I think the only thing flipping
although<00:01:32.780> at<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.050> track<00:01:33.290> coming<00:01:34.160> out<00:01:34.280> of<00:01:34.460> one

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
although at the track coming out of one

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.830 
although at the track coming out of one
turn<00:01:35.620> was<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:36.650> going<00:01:36.980> into<00:01:37.370> turn<00:01:37.940> I<00:01:38.270> kind<00:01:38.810> of

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
turn was it going into turn I kind of

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.480 
turn was it going into turn I kind of
felt<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.140> front<00:01:39.440> chatter<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.860> little<00:01:40.130> bit<00:01:40.250> but

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
felt the front chatter a little bit but

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.390 
felt the front chatter a little bit but
I<00:01:41.090> think<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.170> was<00:01:42.290> my<00:01:42.440> fault<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.950> tire<00:01:43.160> was

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
I think it was my fault the tire was

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.290 
I think it was my fault the tire was
cold

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.520 

people<00:01:51.990> swimming<00:01:52.200> down<00:01:52.440> there

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.530 

okay<00:01:59.070> I'll<00:01:59.370> enroll<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.820> what<00:02:00.150> can<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.330> say

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
okay I'll enroll for what can I say
