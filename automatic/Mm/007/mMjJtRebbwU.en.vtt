is<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.590> fun<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.130> played<00:01:47.520> advanced<00:01:47.939> warfare

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
is this fun I played advanced warfare

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.450 
is this fun I played advanced warfare
one<00:01:48.540> time<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.079> didn't<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
one time and I didn't like it I was a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.280 
one time and I didn't like it I was a
little<00:01:50.850> hesitant<00:01:51.030> about<00:01:51.479> knowing<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
little hesitant about knowing the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
little hesitant about knowing the
mobility<00:01:52.829> changes<00:01:53.280> inside<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.820> game<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
mobility changes inside this game the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.940 
mobility changes inside this game the
wall<00:01:54.450> running<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.049> all<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.290> these<00:01:55.439> things<00:01:55.680> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
wall running and all of these things and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.149 
wall running and all of these things and
I<00:01:56.340> was<00:01:56.490> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:57.049> no<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.409> kind<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.829> scared

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
I was kind of like no I'm kind of scared

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.800 
I was kind of like no I'm kind of scared
I<00:01:59.399> did<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.729> like<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> mobility<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
I did not like the mobility and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.539 
I did not like the mobility and
maneuverability<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> advanced<00:02:02.159> warfare

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
maneuverability of advanced warfare

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.280 
maneuverability of advanced warfare
therefore<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> didn't<00:02:03.600> play<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.899> game<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> was

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
therefore I didn't play the game it was

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.289 
therefore I didn't play the game it was
actually<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> game<00:02:04.799> breaker<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.280> me<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:06.090> you

actually a game breaker for me if you
have<00:02:06.420> enjoyed<00:02:06.719> advanced<00:02:07.079> warfare<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.619> all<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
have enjoyed advanced warfare in all the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.290 
have enjoyed advanced warfare in all the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
actually enjoy the mobility I love the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.670 
actually enjoy the mobility I love the
sliding<00:02:15.880> i<00:02:16.090> love<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.450> boost<00:02:16.660> jumping<00:02:17.200> i<00:02:17.350> love

sliding i love the boost jumping i love
the<00:02:17.830> wall<00:02:18.010> running<00:02:18.340> i<00:02:18.580> think<00:02:19.120> they<00:02:19.270> did<00:02:19.450> it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
the wall running i think they did it

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.240 
the wall running i think they did it
just<00:02:19.870> right<00:02:19.960> it's<00:02:20.260> not<00:02:20.380> too<00:02:20.590> much<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:21.070> not

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
in the middle and I really had a lot of

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.380 
in the middle and I really had a lot of
fun<00:02:26.590> playing<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.490> run<00:02:27.670> around<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
fun playing this you can run around the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.000 
fun playing this you can run around the
only<00:02:28.660> few<00:02:28.870> flaws<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.170> I've<00:02:29.500> noticed<00:02:29.710> so<00:02:29.980> far

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
only few flaws that I've noticed so far

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.800 
only few flaws that I've noticed so far
and<00:02:30.460> keep<00:02:30.820> in<00:02:30.940> mind<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.240> is<00:02:31.300> an<00:02:31.510> earlier

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
and keep in mind this is an earlier

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.240 
and keep in mind this is an earlier
version<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.290> what<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.590> actually<00:02:32.770> being

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
version of what is actually being

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.160 
version of what is actually being
operated<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.030> right<00:02:34.330> now<00:02:34.360> half<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:35.110> these

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
operated on right now half of these

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.470 
operated on right now half of these
problems<00:02:35.440> are<00:02:35.710> already<00:02:35.980> fixed<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:37.000> they

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
problems are already fixed but they

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.790 
problems are already fixed but they
could<00:02:37.630> use<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> little<00:02:38.080> bit<00:02:38.260> more<00:02:38.380> weapon

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
could use a little bit more weapon

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.220 
could use a little bit more weapon
squeaking<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.850> time<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.240> kill<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.600> extremely

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
squeaking the time to kill is extremely

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.460 
squeaking the time to kill is extremely
fast<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.950> lot<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.150> categories<00:02:43.720> shotguns

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
fast in a lot of the categories shotguns

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.500 
fast in a lot of the categories shotguns
can<00:02:44.740> be<00:02:44.830> really<00:02:45.340> really<00:02:45.430> dangerous<00:02:45.730> at<00:02:46.210> long

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
can be really really dangerous at long

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.270 
can be really really dangerous at long
range<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.350> sometimes<00:02:47.800> they<00:02:47.950> can<00:02:48.010> be<00:02:48.100> quite

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
range but sometimes they can be quite

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.010 
range but sometimes they can be quite
inconsistent<00:02:49.060> which<00:02:49.390> makes<00:02:49.630> them<00:02:49.810> not<00:02:49.960> the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
inconsistent which makes them not the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.890 
inconsistent which makes them not the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
little bit of tweaking it could be very

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.990 
little bit of tweaking it could be very
very<00:03:20.380> perfect<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.950> few<00:03:21.100> guns<00:03:21.340> still<00:03:21.640> need<00:03:21.820> some

Department<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.120> tried<00:03:49.420> using<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.930> gravity

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
Department I tried using the gravity

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.310 
Department I tried using the gravity
spikes<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:51.070> this<00:03:51.610> guy<00:03:51.910> tries<00:03:52.420> so<00:03:52.780> hard<00:03:52.810> to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
spikes and this guy tries so hard to

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.949 
spikes and this guy tries so hard to
slam<00:03:53.709> dunk<00:03:54.040> people<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.580> probably<00:03:55.300> tried<00:03:55.570> 20

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
slam dunk people I probably tried 20

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.440 
slam dunk people I probably tried 20
times<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.500> land<00:03:56.740> that<00:03:57.430> actual<00:03:57.940> specialist

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
times to land that actual specialist

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.720 
times to land that actual specialist
ability<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.650> got<00:04:00.010> killed<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.459> time<00:04:00.640> to

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
ability and I got killed the time to

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.340 
ability and I got killed the time to
kill<00:04:00.880> us<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.120> fast<00:04:01.360> in<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:01.600> game<00:04:01.810> with<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.110> lot

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
kill us so fast in this game with a lot

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.990 
kill us so fast in this game with a lot
of<00:04:02.380> these<00:04:02.590> weapons<00:04:03.070> that<00:04:03.580> I<00:04:03.640> could<00:04:03.910> even

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
of these weapons that I could even

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.790 
of these weapons that I could even
complete<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.720> ability<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.410> would<00:04:05.560> waste

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
complete the ability and I would waste

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.500 
complete the ability and I would waste
it<00:04:05.980> have<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.310> build<00:04:06.490> it<00:04:06.610> all<00:04:06.730> up<00:04:06.940> again<00:04:07.120> and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
it have to build it all up again and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.110 
it have to build it all up again and
just<00:04:07.990> never<00:04:08.230> get<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.560> use<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.580> was<00:04:09.820> really

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
just never get to use it that was really

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.300 
just never get to use it that was really
lacking<00:04:10.450> was<00:04:11.170> not<00:04:11.410> very<00:04:11.590> functional<00:04:11.920> at<00:04:12.190> all

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
lacking was not very functional at all

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.740 
lacking was not very functional at all
and<00:04:12.550> then<00:04:12.910> you<00:04:13.000> have<00:04:13.090> some<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.390> other<00:04:13.540> ones

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
and then you have some of the other ones

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.420 
and then you have some of the other ones
like<00:04:13.930> this<00:04:14.110> Pharaoh<00:04:14.380> which<00:04:14.650> are<00:04:14.800> great<00:04:15.040> they

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
like this Pharaoh which are great they

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.220 
like this Pharaoh which are great they
are<00:04:15.520> very<00:04:15.580> strong<00:04:16.120> can<00:04:16.540> be<00:04:16.630> potent<00:04:17.109> and

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
are very strong can be potent and

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.080 
are very strong can be potent and
dangerous<00:04:17.590> at<00:04:17.739> range<00:04:18.010> but<00:04:18.489> they're<00:04:18.640> not<00:04:18.850> the

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
dangerous at range but they're not the

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.820 
dangerous at range but they're not the
easiest<00:04:19.450> things<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.020> world<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.380> use<00:04:20.590> they

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
easiest things in the world to use they

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.860 
easiest things in the world to use they
are<00:04:20.980> kind<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.489> challenging<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.600> I<00:04:22.630> think

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
are kind of challenging so I think

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.540 
are kind of challenging so I think
they've<00:04:22.990> done<00:04:23.140> a<00:04:23.200> great<00:04:23.560> job<00:04:23.590> overall<00:04:24.250> with

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
they've done a great job overall with

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.310 
they've done a great job overall with
some<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:24.910> them<00:04:25.060> but<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.570> few<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.870> them<00:04:26.080> needs

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
some of them but a few of them needs

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.450 
some of them but a few of them needs
some<00:04:26.500> tweaking<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.100> I'm<00:04:27.220> sure

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
some tweaking and I'm sure

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.830 
some tweaking and I'm sure
we're<00:04:27.580> gonna<00:04:27.669> see<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.150> when<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.479> full<00:04:28.660> game

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
we're gonna see that when the full game

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.990 
we're gonna see that when the full game
is<00:04:29.050> released<00:04:29.199> in<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:30.039> end<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:30.789> one

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
is released in the end this one

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.210 
is released in the end this one
definitely<00:04:31.240> does<00:04:31.810> leave<00:04:32.410> me<00:04:32.590> wanting<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:33.009> play

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
definitely does leave me wanting to play

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.830 
definitely does leave me wanting to play
the<00:04:33.370> game<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.550> little<00:04:33.669> more<00:04:33.880> I'm<00:04:34.300> still<00:04:34.660> on<00:04:34.810> the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
the game a little more I'm still on the

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.200 
the game a little more I'm still on the
fence<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.410> am<00:04:35.979> more<00:04:36.160> about<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.610> old<00:04:36.819> call<00:04:37.090> of
