definitely more than enough reason to
play<00:03:32.340> through<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.700> game<00:03:32.730> multiple<00:03:33.269> times<00:03:33.510> one

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
play through the game multiple times one

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.660 
play through the game multiple times one
thing<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.470> did<00:03:34.620> kind<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:35.010> bug<00:03:35.160> me<00:03:35.340> though<00:03:35.519> is

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
thing that did kind of bug me though is

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.400 
thing that did kind of bug me though is
that<00:03:35.700> there<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.150> some<00:03:36.480> backtracking<00:03:36.959> in<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
that there is some backtracking in the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.289 
that there is some backtracking in the
game<00:03:37.560> now<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.190> actually<00:03:38.430> makes<00:03:38.760> sense<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
game now it actually makes sense in the

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.360 
game now it actually makes sense in the
context<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> plot<00:03:40.140> but<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.830> does<00:03:41.010> make<00:03:41.220> it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
context of the plot but it does make it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.490 
context of the plot but it does make it
feel<00:03:41.400> like<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:41.970> issue<00:03:42.269> mora<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.780> smaller<00:03:43.230> than

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
feel like the issue mora is smaller than

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.410 
feel like the issue mora is smaller than
it<00:03:43.620> actually<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:44.040> you're<00:03:44.880> always<00:03:45.180> going

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
it actually is you're always going

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.870 
it actually is you're always going
through<00:03:45.630> some<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.200> same<00:03:46.410> areas<00:03:46.880> luckily

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
through some of the same areas luckily

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.640 
through some of the same areas luckily
the<00:03:48.150> environments<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:48.750> varied<00:03:49.080> visually

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
the environments are varied visually

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.770 
the environments are varied visually
enough<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.160> large<00:03:50.700> enough<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.420> make<00:03:51.570> up<00:03:51.750> for

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
enough and large enough to make up for

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.509 
enough and large enough to make up for
that<00:03:52.049> but<00:03:52.500> it's<00:03:52.620> still<00:03:52.799> something<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.220> keep<00:03:53.400> in

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
that but it's still something to keep in

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.759 
that but it's still something to keep in
