worked<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.430> get<00:02:37.180> some<00:02:37.330> water<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:40.989> a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
worked I get some water this is a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.380 
worked I get some water this is a
marbling<00:02:41.590> technique<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.310> something<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
marbling technique this is something a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.229 
marbling technique this is something a
technique<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:43.989> use<00:02:44.200> when<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:45.239> creating

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
technique that you use when you creating

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.910 
technique that you use when you creating
marble<00:02:46.599> but<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.780> let<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.019> water<00:02:47.230> or<00:02:47.769> that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
marble but to let that water or that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.870 
marble but to let that water or that
paint<00:02:48.250> dry<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.879> little<00:02:49.090> bit<00:02:50.459> when<00:02:51.459> it's<00:02:51.580> dry<00:02:51.819> to

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
paint dry a little bit when it's dry to

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.180 
paint dry a little bit when it's dry to
a<00:02:52.030> certain<00:02:52.390> extent<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:53.050> flick<00:02:53.620> some<00:02:53.739> water<00:02:53.980> over

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
a certain extent I flick some water over

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.710 
a certain extent I flick some water over
it<00:02:55.590> hopefully<00:02:56.590> that'll<00:02:56.980> all<00:02:57.160> pull<00:02:57.430> up

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.270 

strategically<00:03:01.720> not<00:03:01.930> there<00:03:02.140> obviously<00:03:05.250> not<00:03:06.250> a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
strategically not there obviously not a

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.130 
strategically not there obviously not a
bad<00:03:06.459> idea<00:03:06.610> when<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.030> do<00:03:07.180> this<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.780> look<00:03:07.930> at<00:03:08.049> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
bad idea when you do this to look at it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.460 
bad idea when you do this to look at it
from<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.410> side<00:03:09.720> because<00:03:10.720> you'll<00:03:11.019> see<00:03:11.230> where

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
from the side because you'll see where

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.500 
from the side because you'll see where
you've<00:03:11.620> put<00:03:11.920> your<00:03:12.910> paint<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.299> where<00:03:13.420> you

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
you've put your paint and where you

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.559 
you've put your paint and where you
