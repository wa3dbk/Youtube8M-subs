00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 as you can see here I bring you another 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.309
 unboxing to this video is the last or 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.139
 better tell me more things but make one 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.849
 of the last so go kings and they're going to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 come tutorials videos and videos about 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.289
 the system and videos that makes you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.930
 they want to see if they want it to go up but 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.670
 as I said I am accumulating things and little 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.900
 little to know arming the system was going to 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.340
 be like start making videos not 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.529
 I want to start doing things and doing them 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.480
 half want to wait for me to gather things 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 and then we do it all again 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.590
 completely but good as 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.410
 can see this package was sent to 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.660
 us for our friends of envite 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.190
 is how you can see there and then a little 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.500
 of the history of the complicity of mbi ex 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 is a relatively new company not 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.040
 It has a lot of time but the truth is 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 products of very good quality that the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.250
 I really recommend it, they are not 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.289
 the products but what I read what 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.820
 what you heard is a good company with 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.230
 good products as I said good quality 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.670
 and for good you have to open it you have to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.989
 check ourselves 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.699
 now they will see what they see here 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 inside is something that the truth wanted 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.760
 a lot for my system and it makes me a lot 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.040
 missing and well then you have to open the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.290
 package 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.760
 and since we remove the tape over there 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.460
 that see the box to see what good that 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.700
 inside and as you can see here are the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.080
 famous that say acting pinets that the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.970
 mint always becomes a cochinero with 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 this is when he will pay for his products but 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.210
 good 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.460
 Y 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.200
 as if it were a wedding like earth in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.960
 rice then do not open the package 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.940
 that you have to pull the first thing that most 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.710
 guys who have to give around and 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.280
 well there is that the first thing we see 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.960
 here and this as you can see is a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.000
 school where are the possible ones so that 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.009
 it's possible that something explodes inside 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 possible and do not burn the most products 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.869
 that you have or electronic devices that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.670
 you have connected in this cable and so 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.140
 it's not going to be a lot of stress is everything else 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.399
 well all this is here I know that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 comes is inside because I just asked 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 reprimand that I wanted to tell them 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.860
 exactly what I wanted and when 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.140
 they saw these things to stop fuses 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.970
 who love each other in English fuck you shoulders 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.970
 who rather here next 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.540
 here to the side as you can see well in 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.010
 Some rs as are prescribed high quality 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.009
 I do not know with what they get to see there 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.060
 high quality train 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.400
 you can really open to see it as 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.110
 can see today is if this good cable what 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.549
 more in details on this but it's cable is 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.409
 the one that comes as cooked is not like 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.360
 I would say that you have like around for 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.950
 protect it and as I said the tips on of 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.530
 good quality but that afterwards what 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.019
 we see how I said good he turned it on 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.909
 via exterior or in fx as you want 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.980
 say and finally what comes that 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.810
 inside that what I most wanted what 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.800
 I wanted more is 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.290
 and what it is is wired for the car of 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.470
 caliber 0 as you can see there either 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.970
 passes the house and is 100% copper 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.980
 so that it is of high quality as 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.370
 I said to see if we can open the box 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.980
 Quick 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.830
 since you know how it opens to 30 with tape 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.349
 inward 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:06.330
 these three things we turn and open 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:08.470
 and as you can see is a complete set of 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.959
 wiring for your car as I said is from 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.370
 caliber 0 to what would take it would prove it 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.780
 but if he is not going to do it more with the omb 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.329
 review because I want to compare this 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.610
 wiring against a wiring or rather 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.829
 a cable that is not so good brand and 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.299
 how can you see good and cumanÃ¡ in this 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.370
 good video that I leave later because 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.140
 they see it and see that the truth is 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.959
 It's worth spending a little money 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.000
 more and invest in something that the truth you 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.099
 you know what is good and what good 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.200
 results and not doing you're not going to 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.720
 disappoint with this product and good 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.450
 Well here are the three things that baker 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.200
 the wiring the thirds and the thing to 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.900
 have your fuses and as I said is from me 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.879
 ex area I leave on your facebook I leave you 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.590
 my facebook follow my facebook because 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.849
 there I'll be updating 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.379
 things that I have you following with 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.299
 you receive packages as I am going to do certain 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.790
 thing when doing video eyecheck in the 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.950
 facebook so they are up to date 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.360
 and well we're leaving without video as 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.859
 I said this is a maxim and the week that 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.450
 comes is going to have more videos of the 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.090
 that you are going to want to see that they are 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.219
 videos where you can learn 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.900
 and that I will be able to install 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:14.819
 things in my car and why do not we put 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.819
 for your video page
