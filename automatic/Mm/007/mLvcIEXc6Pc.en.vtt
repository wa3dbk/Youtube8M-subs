00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello everyone, Andrei Andreevich 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660
 Andreev my site all-all point ru 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.429
 last video we talked about 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.570
 sum of positive and negative 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.150
 numbers 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.949
 let's talk about the difference today 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.740
 if we need a positive number 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.720
 subtract a negative number and i wrote 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.769
 specifically two examples because we have 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.380
 modulo more first 2 6 and 7 7 by 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.179
 module has more than 6 of its two options 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.619
 if we are of the smaller absolute value read 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.730
 more modulo and vice versa 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.739
 several options and so if you need from 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.800
 positive number subtract 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.629
 negative number in this case 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 I act first there is a rule here you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:54.780
 there is a number 6 minus minus 7 to the rule 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.550
 says that if you need to subtract some 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 the number you actually need to add 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.830
 opposite number 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.470
 that is, subtract some number is the same 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.350
 the very thing to add the opposite for 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 minus seven opposite seven 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.310
 if we replaced the number with 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.979
 we replace the opposite difference by 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.890
 the amount is obtained can be to six 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.470
 add plus seven is the same 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 that six plus seven 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.009
 that is, before the number plus we can not 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.540
 write if it is positive and then 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.939
 brackets can not write because it was 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.960
 two signs in a row now one left 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:39.500
 just 6 plus 7 and see it visually 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.829
 very similar to the plus if we have written 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.690
 minus then schools and then minus visually 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.990
 this is very 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.970
 reminds plus so if your worth 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.750
 minus in a row then we will assume that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:58.520
 this plus 6 plus 7 will be 13 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.200
 if the value is the opposite nothing 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.620
 changing minus to minus gives plus 6 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.950
 this 13 agree that this topic 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.070
 one of the easiest if you need to subtract 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.420
 negative number two minuses changing on 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.890
 1 plus and then the student is considered 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.350
 I will write you a few examples and you 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.860
 try it yourself so we 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:30.010
 you were convinced that everything is clear 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.990
 so a few examples means 5 minus 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:41.240
 minus 9 that is, you need to subtract from the five 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:42.890
 minus 9 out of 18 you need to subtract -8 from hundreds 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.100
 need to deduct 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:54.440
 minus 57 and 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:56.350
 from 19 we will subtract -11 I am equal to you 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.520
 I recommend to pause and 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.680
 try to count yourself 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.970
 how much will it be let's hope 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.350
 what did you find yourself 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.350
 paused let's get together means 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.930
 minus to minus gives plus it turns out 9 5 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:26.019
 plus 9 is 14 18 minus gives minus 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:27.950
 plus 18 + 8 how much will it be 26 100 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:35.290
 minus minus plus 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:41.030
 and 57 100 + 57 will be 157 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:44.569
 19 minus minus 11 is 19 + 11 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.720
 This 30 seems to me that this topic is very 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.550
 simple here is generally easy to read if 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.290
 need to learn a negative number this then 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.670
 the same as adding a positive 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.810
 then everything becomes easy and simple 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.150
 write in the comments whether it was all 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.950
 everything is clear and you have four tasks 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.010
 it turned out to do by yourself 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.650
 advise my videos to your friends write 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.910
 what topics you do not understand this 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.100
 bye everyone 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.520
 come tomorrow there will be a new video on 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.520
 new topic
