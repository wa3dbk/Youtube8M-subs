something<00:01:21.869> different<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.520> be

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
something different and I think it's be

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.510 
something different and I think it's be
fair<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.540> does<00:01:25.320> reflect<00:01:25.590> Donald<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
fair it really does reflect Donald you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.899 
fair it really does reflect Donald you
know<00:01:26.549> Donald<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> grump<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.369> he<00:01:29.369> has<00:01:29.579> some

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
know Donald is a grump and he has some

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.230 
know Donald is a grump and he has some
attitude<00:01:30.570> about<00:01:30.720> him<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.790> he's<00:01:32.790> gonna<00:01:32.970> look

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
attitude about him and he's gonna look

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.870
