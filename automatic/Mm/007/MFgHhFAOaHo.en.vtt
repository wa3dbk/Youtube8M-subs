00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
an ordinary printer here is obviously an

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.990 
an ordinary printer here is obviously an
image<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.030> printed<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> minute<00:00:43.620> and

image that we printed in a minute and
that's<00:00:45.000> how<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> works<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.610> we<00:00:47.610> start<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that's how it works so we start with a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.850 
that's how it works so we start with a
blank<00:00:49.430> template<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.700> comes<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> kit<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
blank template this comes with a kit it

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.890 
stage the second stage we've got these
corners<00:02:20.530> here<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.310> we<00:02:21.460> don't<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:22.750> don't

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
corners here that we don't we don't

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.100 
corners here that we don't we don't
require<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.800> we<00:02:24.330> need<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.450> cut<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.780> most<00:02:25.930> to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
require and we need to cut the most to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.080 
require and we need to cut the most to
just<00:02:26.320> take<00:02:26.500> either<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:27.100> Stanley<00:02:27.580> knife<00:02:27.610> or<00:02:28.060> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
just take either a Stanley knife or a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.290 
just take either a Stanley knife or a
pair<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.390> scissors<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.680> trim<00:02:30.640> them<00:02:30.940> again

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
pair of scissors and trim them again

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.120 
pair of scissors and trim them again
roughly<00:02:31.570> away<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.380> don't<00:02:32.650> need<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.860> be<00:02:32.980> that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
roughly away you don't need to be that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.390 
roughly away you don't need to be that
accurate<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.470> here's<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:35.830> second<00:02:36.190> stage

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
accurate so here's the second stage

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.770 
accurate so here's the second stage
we've<00:02:36.640> trimmed<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.540> corners<00:02:38.110> away<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.370> now

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
we've trimmed the corners away and now

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.290 
we've trimmed the corners away and now
we're<00:02:40.780> turning<00:02:40.930> back<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.190> side<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:43.000> start

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
we're turning back to this side we start

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.770 
we're turning back to this side we start
folding<00:02:43.710> holding<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.800> canvas<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:46.660> are

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
folding holding the canvas so there are

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.810 
folding holding the canvas so there are
fold<00:02:47.020> marks<00:02:47.500> already<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.340> just<00:02:48.490> need<00:02:48.700> to

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
fold marks already you just need to

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.270 
fold marks already you just need to
follow<00:02:49.030> them<00:02:49.410> again<00:02:50.410> all<00:02:50.560> these<00:02:50.740> are<00:02:51.010> very

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
follow them again all these are very

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.510 
follow them again all these are very
they're<00:02:51.580> very<00:02:51.610> detailed<00:02:52.300> instructions<00:02:52.480> and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
they're very detailed instructions and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.770 
they're very detailed instructions and
you<00:02:54.520> can<00:02:54.670> either<00:02:54.790> watch<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.240> video<00:02:55.570> again

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
you can either watch this video again

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.630 
you can either watch this video again
obviously<00:02:56.040> keep<00:02:57.040> calling<00:02:57.460> them<00:02:57.580> away<00:02:58.410> into

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
obviously keep calling them away into

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.910 
obviously keep calling them away into
the<00:03:00.640> center<00:03:01.060> following<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.170> fold<00:03:02.470> marks

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
the center following the fold marks

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.479 
the center following the fold marks
which<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.490> think<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.790> can<00:03:03.970> see<00:03:04.180> on<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.390> video

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
which I think you can see on the video

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.590 
which I think you can see on the video
when<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.610> get<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.330> stage<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:09.000> expose<00:03:10.000> a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
when you get to this stage you expose a

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.570 
when you get to this stage you expose a
little<00:03:11.380> tab<00:03:11.590> here<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:16.050> just<00:03:17.050> create<00:03:17.380> this<00:03:17.580> box

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
little tab here and just create this box

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.800 
little tab here and just create this box
here<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.209> press<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.200> tab<00:03:20.440> down<00:03:21.630> okay<00:03:22.630> and

here and press the tab down okay and

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:35.150 
here and press the tab down okay and
we'll<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.170> same<00:03:24.060> all<00:03:25.060> around

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.250 

expose<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.370> tab<00:03:36.640> when<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.660> create<00:03:37.960> a<00:03:37.990> little

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
expose the tab when you create a little

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.970 
expose the tab when you create a little
box<00:03:39.160> here<00:03:39.460> that<00:03:42.030> little<00:03:43.030> tab<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:44.590> sticks<00:03:44.890> to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
box here that little tab just sticks to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.720 
box here that little tab just sticks to
the<00:03:45.220> base<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:46.540> hold<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.870> doll<00:03:47.020> in<00:03:47.730> position

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
the base to hold the doll in position

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:59.040 
the base to hold the doll in position
two<00:03:49.720> tabs<00:03:49.990> in<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.290> longer<00:03:50.620> edge<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.780> we<00:03:58.900> need

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
two tabs in the longer edge and we need

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.060

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
it ready you can see the effect now we

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.920 
it ready you can see the effect now we
need<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.370> take<00:04:03.520> care<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.760> these<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.720> these

need to take care of these of these
corners<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:07.090> final<00:04:07.450> stage<00:04:07.690> now<00:04:07.960> you<00:04:08.020> got

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
corners and the final stage now you got

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.380 
corners and the final stage now you got
to<00:04:08.470> this<00:04:08.620> situation<00:04:09.400> where<00:04:09.790> everything<00:04:10.270> is

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
to this situation where everything is

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.050 
to this situation where everything is
folded<00:04:10.810> away<00:04:10.900> you've<00:04:11.740> got<00:04:11.920> these<00:04:12.100> corners

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
folded away you've got these corners

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.910 
folded away you've got these corners
that<00:04:13.209> we'll<00:04:13.330> need<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.480> take<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> look<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.770> what

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
that we'll need to take a look and what

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.680 
that we'll need to take a look and what
happens<00:04:15.280> here<00:04:15.490> is<00:04:15.610> we<00:04:15.640> we<00:04:16.120> open<00:04:16.420> it<00:04:16.540> up<00:04:16.630> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
happens here is we we open it up a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.460 
happens here is we we open it up a
little<00:04:17.049> bit

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
little bit

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.010 
little bit

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
just to push the corner in and make it

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.040 
just to push the corner in and make it
nice<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.130> neat<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.490> tidy<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:31.390> we<00:04:31.540> do<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.810> all

around if your fingers are a little bit

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.680 
around if your fingers are a little bit
dinky<00:04:34.150> than<00:04:34.360> mine<00:04:34.570> it's<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.590> little<00:04:36.040> bit<00:04:36.160> easier

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
dinky than mine it's a little bit easier

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.750 
dinky than mine it's a little bit easier
or<00:04:37.690> as<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.990> said<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.380> can<00:04:38.650> you<00:04:39.160> can<00:04:39.340> fold<00:04:39.580> them

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
or as I said you can you can fold them

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.400 
or as I said you can you can fold them
in<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.480> then<00:04:41.080> just<00:04:41.110> with<00:04:41.620> a<00:04:41.650> pair<00:04:41.950> of<00:04:42.010> scissors

in and then just with a pair of scissors
just<00:04:44.410> push<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:52.450> you<00:04:52.540> get<00:04:52.690> these

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
just push it in and you get these

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.720 
just push it in and you get these
corners<00:04:54.040> that<00:04:54.190> way<00:04:54.630> nicely<00:04:55.630> folder<00:04:55.960> then<00:04:56.730> you

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
way and if you fit it this way you can

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.070 
way and if you fit it this way you can
then<00:05:51.080> fold<00:05:51.350> out<00:05:53.530> one<00:05:54.530> side<00:05:54.770> of<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:55.870> of<00:05:56.870> this

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
then fold out one side of the of this

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:07.240 
then fold out one side of the of this
frame<00:05:57.490> like<00:05:58.490> so<00:06:01.390> and<00:06:02.390> it<00:06:02.540> becomes<00:06:06.100> frame<00:06:07.100> that

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
frame like so and it becomes frame that

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.650 
frame like so and it becomes frame that
you<00:06:07.370> can<00:06:07.520> stand<00:06:07.760> to<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.000> side<00:06:08.030> of<00:06:08.390> the<00:06:08.480> table

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
you can stand to the side of the table

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.340 
you can stand to the side of the table
obviously<00:06:09.350> if<00:06:09.770> you<00:06:09.920> have<00:06:10.100> a<00:06:10.130> portrait<00:06:10.700> image

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
obviously if you have a portrait image

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.280 
obviously if you have a portrait image
you<00:06:12.350> can<00:06:12.530> stand<00:06:12.800> it<00:06:12.920> that<00:06:13.070> way
