to do my guess is that you had to do the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.920 
to do my guess is that you had to do the
same<00:02:37.010> thing<00:02:37.459> it's<00:02:37.910> been<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.090> while<00:02:38.269> if<00:02:38.720> memory

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
same thing it's been a while if memory

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.289 
same thing it's been a while if memory
serves<00:02:39.080> part<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.769> do<00:02:40.030> yep

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
serves part to do yep

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.840

or Stan and that then that then this

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.730 
or Stan and that then that then this
time<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.180> easier
