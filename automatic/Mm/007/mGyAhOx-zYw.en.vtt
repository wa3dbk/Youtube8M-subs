hello everyone my name is John Joe and

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.730 
hello everyone my name is John Joe and
today<00:00:10.559> I'll<00:00:10.860> be<00:00:10.980> reviewing<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.759> trigger<00:00:12.030> trap

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
today I'll be reviewing the trigger trap

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
today I'll be reviewing the trigger trap
dongle<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.950> app<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> iOS<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.080> believe<00:00:17.750> you

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
dongle and app for the iOS I believe you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.150 
dongle and app for the iOS I believe you
can<00:00:18.930> hear<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:20.220> got<00:00:20.400> some<00:00:20.640> Thunder<00:00:21.000> rolling<00:00:22.160> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
can hear we got some Thunder rolling so

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.529 
can hear we got some Thunder rolling so
I'm<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.400> do<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> quick<00:00:23.850> time-lapse<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I'm going to do a quick time-lapse and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
I'm going to do a quick time-lapse and
starts<00:00:25.109> raining<00:00:25.380> basically<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.250> these<00:00:26.880> clouds

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
starts raining basically of these clouds

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.670 
starts raining basically of these clouds
that<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.539> rolling<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.349> got<00:00:28.470> some

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that are rolling in and we got some

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.230 
that are rolling in and we got some
planes<00:00:28.980> coming<00:00:29.279> by<00:00:29.519> because<00:00:29.730> there's<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
planes coming by because there's the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.530 
planes coming by because there's the
Fort<00:00:30.449> Lauderdale<00:00:30.539> Airport<00:00:31.019> Airport<00:00:32.000> close<00:00:33.000> by

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
Fort Lauderdale Airport Airport close by

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.260 
Fort Lauderdale Airport Airport close by
I'm<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:34.200> Dania<00:00:34.559> Beach<00:00:34.590> Florida<00:00:35.010> by<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> way<00:00:35.550> so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
I'm in Dania Beach Florida by the way so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.520 
I'm in Dania Beach Florida by the way so
yeah<00:00:36.390> let<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.690> run<00:00:37.020> through<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.290> really

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
yeah let me just run through this really

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.069 
yeah let me just run through this really
quick<00:00:37.860> basically<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.210> an<00:00:39.360> app<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.930> will

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
quick basically this is an app that will

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
quick basically this is an app that will
control<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.829> camera<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.180> all

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
control your camera and you can do all

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
control your camera and you can do all
different<00:00:42.420> sorts<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.350> time<00:00:44.070> lapses<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
different sorts of time lapses you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.119 
different sorts of time lapses you can
do<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.750> cable<00:00:46.260> release<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
do they have cable release they have a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.639 
do they have cable release they have a
bang<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.789> if<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> clap<00:00:48.239> whistle<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.079> tap

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
bang so if you clap whistle or tap

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.100 
bang so if you clap whistle or tap
anything<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.280> we'll<00:00:50.370> take<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> picture<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
anything and we'll take a picture you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
anything and we'll take a picture you
can<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> regular<00:00:52.559> time-lapse<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.610> do

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
can do a regular time-lapse you can do

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.220 
can do a regular time-lapse you can do
what<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.030> call<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.629> warp<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
what they call as a time warp and I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.689 
what they call as a time warp and I
actually<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> trademark<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.550> don't

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
actually have a trademark so I don't

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.000 
actually have a trademark so I don't
know<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.570> any<00:00:57.719> other

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
know if you can do that with any other

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.090 
know if you can do that with any other
cable<00:00:59.010> release<00:00:59.309> system<00:00:59.789> or<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.809> trigger<00:01:01.440> system

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
cable release system or a trigger system

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.479 
cable release system or a trigger system
for<00:01:02.340> cameras<00:01:02.969> has<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> distance<00:01:04.439> lapse<00:01:04.710> for

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
for cameras has a distance lapse for

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.850 
for cameras has a distance lapse for
road<00:01:05.729> trips<00:01:06.000> things<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:07.080> seismic

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
road trips things like that has seismic

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
road trips things like that has seismic
mode<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.390> detect<00:01:09.689> earthquakes<00:01:09.990> or

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
mode so it will detect earthquakes or

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.670 
mode so it will detect earthquakes or
vibration<00:01:10.979> using<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:11.490> iPhones<00:01:12.200> vilasa<00:01:13.200> or

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
vibration using your iPhones vilasa or

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.679 
vibration using your iPhones vilasa or
whatever<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.159> call<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.580> thing<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.210> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
whatever you call that thing that you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.170 
whatever you call that thing that you
know<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:16.170> detect<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.040> sort<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.369> thing

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
know can detect that sort of thing

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.380 
know can detect that sort of thing
peekaboo<00:01:19.110> where<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.439> has<00:01:19.650> facial<00:01:19.920> recognition

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
peekaboo where it has facial recognition

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
peekaboo where it has facial recognition
it<00:01:21.390> has<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> star<00:01:22.170> trail<00:01:22.470> time-lapse<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it has a star trail time-lapse so you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600 
it has a star trail time-lapse so you
can<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.640> star<00:01:23.939> trail<00:01:24.210> stuff<00:01:24.830> has<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> long

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
can do star trail stuff has a long

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.810 
can do star trail stuff has a long
exposure<00:01:27.090> HDR<00:01:27.869> mode<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.670> long

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
exposure HDR mode so you can do long

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.660 
exposure HDR mode so you can do long
exposure<00:01:30.659> HDR<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.070> long

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
exposure HDR and you can do long

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
exposure HDR and you can do long
exposure<00:01:33.439> HDR<00:01:34.439> time<00:01:34.770> lapses<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.400> well<00:01:36.020> Tesla

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
exposure HDR time lapses as well Tesla

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.630 
exposure HDR time lapses as well Tesla
so<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.610> detect<00:01:38.909> magnetic<00:01:39.630> things<00:01:40.640> bulb

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
so it can detect magnetic things bulb

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.810 
so it can detect magnetic things bulb
ramping<00:01:41.880> mode<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.750> then<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> wide<00:01:43.770> Wi-Fi<00:01:44.460> slave

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
ramping mode and then a wide Wi-Fi slave

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.330 
ramping mode and then a wide Wi-Fi slave
mode<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.229> trigger<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> remotely

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
mode so you can trigger it remotely

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
mode so you can trigger it remotely
through<00:01:47.549> Wi-Fi<00:01:47.790> devices<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.810> other

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
through Wi-Fi devices and other

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
through Wi-Fi devices and other
locations<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.310> connected<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
locations so you have this connected to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
locations so you have this connected to
here<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.689> connect<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> Wi-Fi<00:01:52.409> network

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
here and you connect to a Wi-Fi network

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.590 
here and you connect to a Wi-Fi network
and<00:01:53.070> trigger<00:01:53.310> remotely<00:01:53.700> from<00:01:54.149> somewhere<00:01:54.570> else

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and trigger remotely from somewhere else

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.440 
and trigger remotely from somewhere else
not<00:01:55.049> having<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.860> close<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.430> camera<00:01:56.790> so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
not having to be close to the camera so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.670 
not having to be close to the camera so
basically<00:01:57.780> I'm<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> set<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
basically I'm just going to set up a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.770 
basically I'm just going to set up a
simple<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.280> lapse<00:01:59.549> right<00:01:59.820> now<00:02:00.000> I'm<00:02:00.540> actually

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
simple time lapse right now I'm actually

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.859 
simple time lapse right now I'm actually
going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.159> attempt<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> time-warp

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
going to attempt to do the time-warp

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.959 
going to attempt to do the time-warp
this<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.920> would<00:02:05.130> only<00:02:05.310> work<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.790> your

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
this really would only work if your

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.399 
this really would only work if your
camera<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.420> do<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.930> quick<00:02:07.140> shutter

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
camera can do really quick shutter

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.839 
camera can do really quick shutter
speeds<00:02:07.740> because<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> start<00:02:08.640> doing

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
speeds because it's going to start doing

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.309 
speeds because it's going to start doing
some<00:02:09.200> quick<00:02:10.200> like

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
some quick like

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.289 
some quick like
maybe<00:02:11.560> like<00:02:11.709> five<00:02:12.040> six<00:02:12.370> frames<00:02:12.640> per<00:02:12.879> second

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
maybe like five six frames per second

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.449 
maybe like five six frames per second
and<00:02:13.450> then<00:02:13.599> I'll<00:02:13.689> start<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.049> slow<00:02:14.290> down<00:02:14.319> so<00:02:15.159> give

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and then I'll start to slow down so give

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.970 
and then I'll start to slow down so give
you<00:02:15.549> that<00:02:15.700> time<00:02:15.999> warp<00:02:16.299> effect<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.349> then<00:02:17.829> at

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
you that time warp effect and then at

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.190 
you that time warp effect and then at
the<00:02:18.099> end<00:02:18.129> you<00:02:18.639> can<00:02:18.819> program<00:02:19.450> however<00:02:19.719> you<00:02:19.959> want

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the end you can program however you want

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.989 
the end you can program however you want
there's<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.650> quadratic<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.700> all<00:02:21.819> different

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
there's a quadratic and all different

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.599 
there's a quadratic and all different
types<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.689> curves<00:02:23.499> you<00:02:23.739> can<00:02:23.920> use<00:02:24.129> I'm<00:02:24.400> actually

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
types of curves you can use I'm actually

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:30.440 
types of curves you can use I'm actually
gonna<00:02:24.969> use<00:02:25.349> B<00:02:26.700> I'll<00:02:27.700> use<00:02:27.939> the<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:29.219> quartic

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
gonna use B I'll use the the quartic

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.569 
gonna use B I'll use the the quartic
curve<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.530> let's<00:02:32.739> start<00:02:32.980> taking<00:02:33.340> some

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
curve and so let's start taking some

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.149 
curve and so let's start taking some
pictures<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.540> some<00:02:34.900> quick<00:02:35.439> pictures<00:02:35.829> and<00:02:36.069> I'll

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
pictures of some quick pictures and I'll

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.250 
pictures of some quick pictures and I'll
start<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.519> level<00:02:36.790> up<00:02:36.939> and<00:02:37.239> then<00:02:37.629> it<00:02:37.750> will<00:02:37.900> take

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
start to level up and then it will take

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.140 
start to level up and then it will take
some<00:02:38.469> more<00:02:38.620> quick<00:02:38.829> pictures<00:02:39.219> so<00:02:39.370> kind<00:02:39.819> of<00:02:39.879> warp

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
some more quick pictures so kind of warp

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.569 
some more quick pictures so kind of warp
you<00:02:40.269> through<00:02:40.480> time<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.469> hopefully<00:02:42.249> we<00:02:42.430> can

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
you through time and hopefully we can

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.629 
you through time and hopefully we can
get<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.030> these<00:02:43.299> clouds<00:02:43.810> rolling<00:02:44.139> in<00:02:44.469> and<00:02:44.769> just

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
get so these clouds rolling in and just

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.129 
get so these clouds rolling in and just
before<00:02:45.969> it<00:02:46.060> starts<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.389> rain<00:02:46.540> I'm<00:02:46.750> gonna<00:02:46.900> cut

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
before it starts to rain I'm gonna cut

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.509 
before it starts to rain I'm gonna cut
it<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.469> shut<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.709> all<00:02:47.919> down<00:02:47.950> because<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.370> don't

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
it and shut it all down because I don't

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.759 
it and shut it all down because I don't
want<00:02:48.639> to<00:02:48.730> damage<00:02:48.909> any<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.269> my<00:02:49.389> equipment

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
want to damage any of my equipment

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.709 
want to damage any of my equipment
obviously<00:02:50.769> all<00:02:51.340> right<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.849> actually<00:02:52.150> I'm

anything I'll do some voiceover later if
not<00:03:07.810> we're<00:03:08.469> all<00:03:08.590> good<00:03:08.889> and<00:03:09.099> I'll<00:03:09.219> just<00:03:09.400> edit

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
not we're all good and I'll just edit

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.309 
not we're all good and I'll just edit
this<00:03:09.790> part<00:03:10.060> up<00:03:10.180> or<00:03:10.389> maybe<00:03:10.870> I'll<00:03:11.019> leave<00:03:11.109> it<00:03:11.260> in

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
this part up or maybe I'll leave it in

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.800 
this part up or maybe I'll leave it in
who<00:03:11.680> knows<00:03:11.889> anyway<00:03:12.639> so<00:03:12.699> let's<00:03:13.269> start<00:03:13.599> this

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
who knows anyway so let's start this

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.520 
who knows anyway so let's start this
time<00:03:14.079> to<00:03:14.980> go<00:03:15.159> so<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.810> gonna<00:03:16.930> take<00:03:17.139> that<00:03:17.290> first

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
time to go so it's gonna take that first

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.619 
time to go so it's gonna take that first
picture<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.099> it<00:03:18.189> should<00:03:18.430> as<00:03:18.639> you<00:03:19.209> can<00:03:19.359> see

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
picture and it should as you can see

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.199 
picture and it should as you can see
start<00:03:20.169> taking<00:03:20.379> more<00:03:21.009> pictures<00:03:21.459> consecutively

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
start taking more pictures consecutively

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.170 
start taking more pictures consecutively
quicker<00:03:22.629> quicker<00:03:22.989> quicker<00:03:23.229> well<00:03:24.159> quick<00:03:24.790> and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
quicker quicker quicker well quick and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.899 
quicker quicker quicker well quick and
then<00:03:25.509> it<00:03:25.689> will<00:03:25.810> slow<00:03:26.049> down<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:27.310> yeah<00:03:27.669> that's

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
then it will slow down so yeah that's

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.179 
then it will slow down so yeah that's
pretty<00:03:28.000> much<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.569> and<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.620> was<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:30.040> review

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
pretty much it and this was the review

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.259 
pretty much it and this was the review
of<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:31.239> trigger<00:03:32.049> trap<00:03:32.409> dongle<00:03:33.129> and<00:03:33.220> app<00:03:33.519> for

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
of the trigger trap dongle and app for

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.140 
of the trigger trap dongle and app for
the<00:03:34.449> Fujifilm<00:03:34.989> xee<00:03:35.620> one<00:03:36.009> and<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.909> one<00:03:37.120> I

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
the Fujifilm xee one and the one I

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.599 
the Fujifilm xee one and the one I
actually<00:03:37.479> got<00:03:37.959> was<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.319> Canon<00:03:38.769> version<00:03:39.310> so

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
actually got was the Canon version so

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.159 
actually got was the Canon version so
I'll<00:03:39.729> provide<00:03:39.970> links<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.629> descriptions

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
I'll provide links in the descriptions

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.869 
I'll provide links in the descriptions
to<00:03:41.439> the<00:03:41.560> Canon<00:03:41.949> version<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.519> all<00:03:42.609> other

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
to the Canon version and all other

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.990 
to the Canon version and all other
versions<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.599> this<00:03:44.189> dongle<00:03:45.189> which<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.729> pretty

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
versions of this dongle which is pretty

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.089 
versions of this dongle which is pretty
much<00:03:46.150> compatible<00:03:46.750> with<00:03:46.870> any<00:03:47.079> camera<00:03:47.409> all<00:03:47.889> you

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
much compatible with any camera all you

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.490 
much compatible with any camera all you
have<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.340> do<00:03:48.519> is<00:03:48.669> get<00:03:48.939> a<00:03:48.970> different<00:03:49.629> cable<00:03:50.290> that

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
have to do is get a different cable that

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.110 
have to do is get a different cable that
connects<00:03:50.919> to<00:03:51.250> your<00:03:51.459> camera

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
connects to your camera

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.849 
connects to your camera
so<00:03:52.449> essentially<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.989> could<00:03:53.109> buy<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.349> dongle

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
so essentially you could buy the dongle

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.619 
so essentially you could buy the dongle
which<00:03:54.009> is<00:03:54.159> this<00:03:54.340> red<00:03:54.609> cable<00:03:54.969> here<00:03:55.150> in<00:03:55.239> this<00:03:55.329> box

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
which is this red cable here in this box

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.559 
which is this red cable here in this box
and<00:03:55.959> by<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.759> different<00:03:57.759> cables<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.389> just

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
and by this different cables and just

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.509 
and by this different cables and just
switch<00:03:58.810> em<00:03:58.959> out<00:03:59.169> depending<00:03:59.949> on<00:04:00.040> which<00:04:00.159> camera

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
switch em out depending on which camera

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.009 
switch em out depending on which camera
you're<00:04:00.639> gonna<00:04:00.729> use<00:04:00.969> it<00:04:01.150> on<00:04:01.209> it's<00:04:01.719> an<00:04:01.810> awesome

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
you're gonna use it on it's an awesome

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.990 
you're gonna use it on it's an awesome
system<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.799> would<00:04:02.919> recommend<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.489> over<00:04:03.819> any

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
system I would recommend this over any

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.229 
system I would recommend this over any
other<00:04:04.259> triggering<00:04:05.259> system<00:04:05.799> or<00:04:06.239> remote

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
other triggering system or remote

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.279 
other triggering system or remote
triggers<00:04:08.199> or<00:04:08.549> intervalometer<00:04:09.689> it's<00:04:10.689> just<00:04:10.989> so

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:11.289 
triggers or intervalometer it's just so

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.520 
triggers or intervalometer it's just so
diverse<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:11.889> has<00:04:12.609> a<00:04:12.669> future<00:04:13.629> capabilities<00:04:14.379> to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
diverse and has a future capabilities to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.610 
diverse and has a future capabilities to
expand<00:04:14.919> in<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.189> future<00:04:15.599> through<00:04:16.599> the<00:04:16.719> app<00:04:16.959> so

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
expand in the future through the app so

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.099 
expand in the future through the app so
it's<00:04:17.949> a<00:04:18.039> really<00:04:18.310> cool<00:04:18.489> system<00:04:19.299> works<00:04:19.750> on<00:04:19.900> any

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
it's a really cool system works on any

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.019 
it's a really cool system works on any
camera<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.799> right<00:04:21.250> now<00:04:21.370> I'm<00:04:21.489> just<00:04:21.549> doing<00:04:21.880> this

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.029 
camera and right now I'm just doing this

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.040 
camera and right now I'm just doing this
time-lapse<00:04:22.539> with

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
time-lapse with

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.860 
time-lapse with
fujifilm<00:04:23.590> XE<00:04:24.280> 1<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.789> a<00:04:25.270> 28<00:04:25.720> millimeter

voigtländer<00:04:26.800> pancake<00:04:27.310> lines<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:28.389> I'll<00:04:28.750> just

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
voigtländer pancake lines and I'll just

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.570 
voigtländer pancake lines and I'll just
run<00:04:29.229> through<00:04:29.349> the<00:04:29.500> settings<00:04:29.889> real<00:04:30.099> quick<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.550> am

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
run through the settings real quick I am

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.629 
run through the settings real quick I am
at<00:04:30.970> aperture<00:04:31.690> f11<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:33.250> believe<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
at aperture f11 and I believe the

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.480 
at aperture f11 and I believe the
shutter<00:04:33.909> speed<00:04:34.210> is<00:04:34.780> at<00:04:35.440> about<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.889> thousand

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
shutter speed is at about a thousand

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.170 
shutter speed is at about a thousand
shutter<00:04:36.759> speed<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.419> ISO<00:04:38.080> where<00:04:38.770> iso<00:04:39.250> 200<00:04:39.970> so

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
shutter speed and ISO where iso 200 so

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.450 
shutter speed and ISO where iso 200 so
