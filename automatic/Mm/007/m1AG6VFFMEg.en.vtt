your electronics take a swim all right
we<00:00:30.269> do<00:00:30.539> research<00:00:31.790> number<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> things<00:00:33.030> from

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
we do research number of things from

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.229 
we do research number of things from
control<00:00:34.500> systems<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:35.309> amount<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.699> materials

program is on robotic fish Robo fish

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.689 
program is on robotic fish Robo fish
really<00:00:45.659> this<00:00:46.049> is<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> facility<00:00:46.650> that<00:00:47.220> we<00:00:47.430> use

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
really this is a facility that we use

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.539 
really this is a facility that we use
for<00:00:48.210> studying<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.839> design<00:00:49.830> and<00:00:50.159> the

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:50.549 
for studying the design and the

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.759 
for studying the design and the
performance<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.239> robotic<00:00:51.659> fish<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.290> I<00:00:52.589> guess

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
performance of robotic fish and I guess

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.490 
performance of robotic fish and I guess
we<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.040> put<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.339> in<00:00:53.489> water<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.479> robotic<00:00:55.229> fish

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
we can put that in water so robotic fish

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.649 
we can put that in water so robotic fish
that<00:00:55.860> sounds<00:00:56.129> interesting<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.510> is

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
that sounds interesting but there is

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.600 
that sounds interesting but there is
much<00:00:58.019> more<00:00:58.229> behind<00:00:58.619> this<00:00:58.830> than<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.309> wires

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
much more behind this than just wires

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.149 
much more behind this than just wires
circuits<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.659> motors<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.019> we<00:01:01.290> take<00:01:01.530> these

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
circuits and motors and we take these

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.040 
circuits and motors and we take these
things<00:01:02.430> down<00:01:02.790> to<00:01:03.119> real<00:01:03.989> applications<00:01:04.710> meaning

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
things down to real applications meaning

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.250 
things down to real applications meaning
can<00:01:07.050> use<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.530> robots<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.450> are<00:01:09.450> behaving

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
can use these robots that are behaving

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.120 
can use these robots that are behaving
like<00:01:10.620> fish<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.280> some<00:01:11.550> sense<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.720> scout<00:01:13.410> out<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
like fish in some sense to scout out the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
like fish in some sense to scout out the
environment<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.790> example<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.450> collect

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
environment for example and collect

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.640 
environment for example and collect
information<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:17.030> do<00:01:18.030> such<00:01:18.930> things<00:01:19.200> through

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
information and do such things through

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.850 
information and do such things through
collaboration<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.760> do<00:01:21.500> experiments<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.620> how

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
collaboration we do experiments on how

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
collaboration we do experiments on how
you<00:01:23.310> know<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.490> speed<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> how<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you know the speed of it and how it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.260 
you know the speed of it and how it
turns<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.620> we<00:01:25.770> want<00:01:25.980> to<00:01:26.100> put<00:01:26.520> sensors<00:01:26.940> on<00:01:27.090> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
turns and we want to put sensors on it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.360 
turns and we want to put sensors on it
so<00:01:27.990> eventually<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.740> could<00:01:28.860> deploy<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.220> in

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
so eventually we could deploy it in

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.210 
so eventually we could deploy it in
lakes<00:01:29.580> we're<00:01:30.120> starting<00:01:30.660> to<00:01:30.960> explore<00:01:31.590> things

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
lakes we're starting to explore things

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.120 
lakes we're starting to explore things
like<00:01:32.520> environment<00:01:33.210> monitoring<00:01:33.980> we're<00:01:34.980> gonna

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
like environment monitoring we're gonna

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.420 
like environment monitoring we're gonna
put<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.409> kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.560> hold<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.950> fish<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
put this kind of hold this fish in the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.760 
put this kind of hold this fish in the
river<00:01:39.230> take<00:01:40.230> a<00:01:40.260> picture<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:45.140> well<00:01:46.140> idea<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
river take a picture of it well idea is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.370 
river take a picture of it well idea is
about<00:01:47.159> their<00:01:47.370> application<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.870> to<00:01:49.229> mount

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
about their application is to mount

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.430 
about their application is to mount
different<00:01:49.860> sensors<00:01:50.400> potentially<00:01:51.330> on<00:01:51.540> these

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
different sensors potentially on these

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.090 
different sensors potentially on these
things

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
things

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.140 
things
let<00:01:53.790> them<00:01:54.170> patrol<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.470> water<00:01:55.740> environment

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
let them patrol the water environment

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.899 
let them patrol the water environment
that<00:01:57.150> way<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.510> can<00:01:57.840> get<00:01:58.430> information<00:01:59.430> like

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that way you can get information like

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.780 
that way you can get information like
oxygen<00:02:00.810> level<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.440> dissolved<00:02:01.920> oxygen<00:02:02.100> level

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
oxygen level in dissolved oxygen level

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.660 
oxygen level in dissolved oxygen level
temperature<00:02:04.310> salinity<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:07.039> even<00:02:08.039> turbidity

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
temperature salinity and even turbidity

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.730 
temperature salinity and even turbidity
and<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.970> kinds<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.539> environmental<00:02:10.349> factors

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
and all kinds of environmental factors

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.610 
and all kinds of environmental factors
so<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:12.000> could<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> school<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.959> Robo<00:02:13.410> fish

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
so what could a school of Robo fish

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.490 
so what could a school of Robo fish
accomplish<00:02:14.190> by<00:02:14.370> swinging<00:02:14.730> around<00:02:15.060> you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
accomplish by swinging around you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.450 
accomplish by swinging around you
local<00:02:15.800> lake<00:02:16.010> or<00:02:16.250> stream<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:18.160> monitor<00:02:19.160> the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
local lake or stream you can monitor the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.340 
local lake or stream you can monitor the
drinking<00:02:19.760> water<00:02:19.880> supply<00:02:20.150> supply<00:02:20.720> make<00:02:21.110> sure

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
drinking water supply supply make sure

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.400 
drinking water supply supply make sure
you<00:02:21.680> know<00:02:21.770> nothing<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.450> suspicious<00:02:23.450> or<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:24.320> the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
you know nothing is suspicious or in the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.760 
you know nothing is suspicious or in the
water

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
water

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.250 
water
so<00:02:25.090> really<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.360> can<00:02:26.450> talk<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> lot<00:02:27.080> of

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
so really you can talk a lot of

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260

just swim on the surface and in this

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.120 
just swim on the surface and in this
particular<00:02:55.160> fish<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.810> top<00:02:57.080> is<00:02:57.260> removable<00:02:57.770> so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
particular fish the top is removable so

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.290 
particular fish the top is removable so
it's<00:02:58.310> not<00:02:58.550> permanently<00:02:59.390> sealed<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:01.300> once

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
it's not permanently sealed so once

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.240 
it's not permanently sealed so once
water<00:03:02.600> gets<00:03:02.989> in<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.410> it'll<00:03:03.770> just<00:03:04.010> fry<00:03:04.190> the
