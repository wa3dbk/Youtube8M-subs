00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.930 

we<00:00:10.500> know<00:00:10.620> weather<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.099> unpredictable<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
we know weather is unpredictable and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.870 
we know weather is unpredictable and
extreme<00:00:12.509> events<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:12.990> always<00:00:13.110> occurred<00:00:13.880> we

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
extreme events have always occurred we

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400 
extreme events have always occurred we
also<00:00:15.030> know<00:00:15.299> these<00:00:15.480> events<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:15.929> becoming<00:00:16.170> more

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
also know these events are becoming more

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.550 
also know these events are becoming more
severe<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.010> more<00:00:17.220> common<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.140> yes<00:00:19.140> these

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
severe and more common and yes these

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.910 
severe and more common and yes these
ships<00:00:19.859> are<00:00:19.980> down<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.250> climate<00:00:20.609> change<00:00:21.920> so

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
ships are down to climate change so

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.640 
ships are down to climate change so
what's<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> science<00:00:23.580> behind<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.650> let's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
what's the science behind all this let's

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.310 
what's the science behind all this let's
start<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.130> greenhouse<00:00:26.369> gases<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.330> you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
start with greenhouse gases as you

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169 
start with greenhouse gases as you
probably<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.830> these<00:00:29.369> are<00:00:29.609> released<00:00:29.880> when<00:00:30.060> we

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
probably know these are released when we

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.319 
probably know these are released when we
do<00:00:30.300> things<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.689> burn<00:00:30.990> fossil<00:00:31.289> fuels<00:00:32.329> when

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
do things like burn fossil fuels when

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.420 
do things like burn fossil fuels when
this<00:00:33.510> happens<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.410> becomes<00:00:34.530> trapped<00:00:35.100> near<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
this happens it becomes trapped near the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.500 
this happens it becomes trapped near the
Earth's<00:00:35.579> surface<00:00:37.640> making<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.850> hotter<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.420> on

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
Earth's surface making it hotter here on

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.190 
Earth's surface making it hotter here on
land<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.100> in<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> ocean<00:00:44.059> of<00:00:45.059> course<00:00:46.020> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
land and in the ocean of course this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.260 
land and in the ocean of course this
means<00:00:46.410> more<00:00:46.770> evaporation<00:00:46.940> more<00:00:47.940> water<00:00:48.180> vapor

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
means more evaporation more water vapor

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.380 
means more evaporation more water vapor
in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.690> air<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.200> more<00:00:49.680> heavy<00:00:49.950> rainfall<00:00:50.489> some

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
in the air and more heavy rainfall some

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.170 
in the air and more heavy rainfall some
places<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.989> less<00:00:52.199> some<00:00:52.770> places<00:00:53.039> get<00:00:53.399> more<00:00:53.640> but

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
places get less some places get more but

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.810 
places get less some places get more but
when<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> rains<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.260> pull<00:00:55.610> while<00:00:56.610> all

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
when it rains you can pull while all

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
when it rains you can pull while all
this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.570> let's<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.140> forget<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
this is going on let's not forget the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.430 
this is going on let's not forget the
heat<00:00:59.030> hotter<00:01:00.030> days<00:01:00.239> meant<00:01:00.570> higher<00:01:00.780> fire<00:01:01.140> risk

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
heat hotter days meant higher fire risk

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.900 
heat hotter days meant higher fire risk
especially<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.280> drought<00:01:02.520> prone<00:01:02.789> areas

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.550 

this<00:01:06.910> extra<00:01:07.270> heat<00:01:07.420> expands<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:08.020> ocean<00:01:08.350> and

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
this extra heat expands the ocean and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.200 
this extra heat expands the ocean and
also<00:01:08.890> melts<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.280> polar<00:01:09.520> icecaps

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
also melts the polar icecaps

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.310 
also melts the polar icecaps
ice<00:01:10.450> sheets<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.290> glaciers<00:01:12.750> sea<00:01:13.750> levels<00:01:14.080> rise

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
ice sheets and glaciers sea levels rise

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.880 
ice sheets and glaciers sea levels rise
increasing<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.340> risk<00:01:15.520> of<00:01:15.640> coastal<00:01:16.060> flooding

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
increasing the risk of coastal flooding

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.290 
increasing the risk of coastal flooding
the<00:01:17.890> dice<00:01:18.100> are<00:01:18.280> now<00:01:18.370> loaded<00:01:18.730> towards<00:01:19.090> more

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
the dice are now loaded towards more

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.360 
the dice are now loaded towards more
extreme<00:01:19.780> weather<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.350> you<00:01:20.950> know<00:01:21.070> what<00:01:21.220> that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
extreme weather and you know what that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.950 
extreme weather and you know what that
means<00:01:21.610> for<00:01:21.730> Australians

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.590 

we've<00:01:25.960> lost<00:01:26.140> homes<00:01:26.940> ecosystems<00:01:27.940> livelihoods

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
we've lost homes ecosystems livelihoods

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.740 
we've lost homes ecosystems livelihoods
and<00:01:29.140> loved<00:01:29.620> ones

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.370 

and<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.440> damage<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:36.860> likely<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.340> get<00:01:37.460> worse

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.060 

so<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:46.320> need<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:46.500> prepare<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so what can we do we need to prepare to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.469 
so what can we do we need to prepare to
live<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.400> world<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.880> more<00:01:47.909> intense
