00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
valve core remover tool so we're going

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:58.479 
valve core remover tool so we're going
to<00:00:43.350> fix<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.040> pump<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> container

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.440 

simply<00:00:59.489> place<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> pump<00:01:00.360> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.290> container

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
simply place the pump in the container

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.380 
simply place the pump in the container
screw<00:01:03.450> the<00:01:03.600> top<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.400 

now<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.440> all<00:01:07.470> pups<00:01:08.630> we<00:01:09.630> need<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> prime<00:01:10.230> the

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
now with all pups we need to prime the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.040 
now with all pups we need to prime the
pump<00:01:10.440> you'll<00:01:10.890> notice<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> hose<00:01:12.050> that

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
pump you'll notice that the hose that

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.720 
pump you'll notice that the hose that
the<00:01:13.200> hose<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.590> clear<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.180> by<00:01:15.180> simply<00:01:15.720> pumping

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
the hose is clear and by simply pumping

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.190 
the hose is clear and by simply pumping
the<00:01:17.730> hose<00:01:17.940> we<00:01:18.300> should<00:01:18.480> start<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.870> get<00:01:19.050> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the hose we should start to get the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
the hose we should start to get the
ceiling<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> house<00:01:20.190> so<00:01:20.730> we<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
do is we would look at our installation

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760 
do is we would look at our installation
chart<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.720> particular<00:01:49.020> vehicle

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
chart and for this particular vehicle

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.460 
chart and for this particular vehicle
which<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> passenger<00:01:50.700> light<00:01:50.880> truck<00:01:51.470> we

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
which is the passenger light truck we

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.680 
which is the passenger light truck we
would<00:01:52.710> look<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.460> section<00:01:53.790> 1<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
would look to section 1 which is

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.910 
would look to section 1 which is
passenger<00:01:55.200> light<00:01:55.380> trucks

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.510 

you'd<00:02:00.460> identify<00:02:00.580> our<00:02:01.240> tire<00:02:01.480> size<00:02:01.870> here<00:02:02.520> which

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
you'd identify our tire size here which

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.900 
you'd identify our tire size here which
is<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:04.090> two<00:02:05.700> 6570<00:02:06.700> are<00:02:06.990> 17<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.580> under<00:02:09.820> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
passenger in light truck section I look

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.920 
passenger in light truck section I look
to<00:02:12.010> our<00:02:12.100> tire<00:02:12.340> size<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.060> tells<00:02:13.330> me<00:02:13.540> that

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
to our tire size and it tells me that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.100 
to our tire size and it tells me that
this<00:02:14.920> particular<00:02:15.490> vehicle<00:02:15.850> requires<00:02:16.420> 20
