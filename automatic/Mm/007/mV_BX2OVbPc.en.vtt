onto<00:00:37.170> green<00:00:37.940> great<00:00:38.940> question<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.390> this

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
onto green great question I think this

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.790 
onto green great question I think this
is<00:00:39.719> probably<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> first<00:00:40.200> time<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.559> has<00:00:40.710> ever

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is probably the first time this has ever

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.910 
is probably the first time this has ever
been<00:00:40.920> asked<00:00:41.629> all<00:00:42.629> right<00:00:42.840> well<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:44.600> think<00:00:45.920> this

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
been asked all right well I think this

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.099 
been asked all right well I think this
is<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.309> controversial<00:00:47.879> subject<00:00:48.269> because

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
is a very controversial subject because

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:50.380 
is a very controversial subject because
you've<00:00:49.289> got<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> lot<00:00:49.589> of<00:00:49.679> people<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.070> say

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
you've got a lot of people that say

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.700 
you've got a lot of people that say
plumb<00:00:51.390> bob<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> greatest<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.589> other

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
plumb bob is the greatest and other

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.610 
plumb bob is the greatest and other
people<00:00:53.039> say<00:00:53.690> plumb<00:00:54.690> bobbing<00:00:55.109> is<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> waste<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
people say plumb bobbing is a waste of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.950 
people say plumb bobbing is a waste of
time<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> times<00:00:57.629> when<00:00:57.839> you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
time but I think a lot of times when you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.709 
time but I think a lot of times when you
find<00:00:58.289> people<00:00:58.589> who<00:00:59.219> favor<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.059> people<00:01:00.480> who

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
find people who favor it and people who

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.779 
find people who favor it and people who
say<00:01:00.929> it's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.199> waste<00:01:01.409> of<00:01:01.530> time<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.429> just<00:01:02.670> an

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
say it's a waste of time it's just an

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.060 
say it's a waste of time it's just an
issue<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.110> ones<00:01:04.320> who<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.620> how<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> do

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
issue that the ones who know how to do

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.700 
issue that the ones who know how to do
it<00:01:05.220> love<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.750> ones<00:01:06.930> who<00:01:07.050> really<00:01:07.409> don't

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
it love it and the ones who really don't

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.690 
it love it and the ones who really don't
know<00:01:07.800> how<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.520> haven't

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
know how to do it I really haven't

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000 
know how to do it I really haven't
figured<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.350> therefore<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.830> it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
figured it out therefore don't like it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.250 
figured it out therefore don't like it
so<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.790> got<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> cover<00:01:13.080> here

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so I got a little bit of a cover here

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780 
so I got a little bit of a cover here
it's<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:13.680> bigger<00:01:13.860> than<00:01:14.040> than<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it's a little bit bigger than than a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.639 
it's a little bit bigger than than a
regular<00:01:15.000> hole<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.510> it's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.780> cover<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
regular hole but it's a cover and I

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.109 
regular hole but it's a cover and I
think<00:01:16.860> hopefully<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.880> here

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
think hopefully you can see this on here

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.929 
think hopefully you can see this on here
I'm<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.290> putter<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.649> and<00:01:21.350> and

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
I'm going to get my putter out and and

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.190 
I'm going to get my putter out and and
I'm<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.149> talk<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.329> plumb<00:01:24.750> Bobby<00:01:24.990> i

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
I'm going to talk about plumb Bobby i

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.130 
I'm going to talk about plumb Bobby i
plumb<00:01:25.530> bob<00:01:25.710> all<00:01:26.460> right<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.539> at<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.899> least

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
plumb bob all right and and at the least

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
plumb bob all right and and at the least
I<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.740> does<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> great<00:01:29.159> job<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.820> least

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I think it does a great job of at least

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.520 
I think it does a great job of at least
giving<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.329> an<00:01:30.450> idea<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> break<00:01:31.289> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
giving you an idea of what the break is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.999

all<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.490> let's<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.390> assume<00:01:33.740> I'm<00:01:34.740> going

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
I'm going to put the plug in the center

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.300 
I'm going to put the plug in the center
to<00:03:18.570> hole<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.320> case<00:03:19.590> because<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.130> is

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
to hole in this case because this is

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.980 
to hole in this case because this is
lined<00:03:20.520> up<00:03:20.610> as<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.790> straight<00:03:21.120> putt<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.720> center

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
lined up as a straight putt the center

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.040 
lined up as a straight putt the center
of<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.110> ball<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:24.209> stick<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.660> riding

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
of the ball is and that stick is riding

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.420 
of the ball is and that stick is riding
right<00:03:25.200> up<00:03:25.350> my<00:03:25.470> shaft<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.010> center<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> hole

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
right up my shaft to the center the hole

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.860 
right up my shaft to the center the hole
so<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:26.880> would<00:03:27.090> definitely<00:03:27.240> be<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.540> straight

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
so that would definitely be a straight

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.090 
so that would definitely be a straight
ball<00:03:28.080> now<00:03:28.830> let's<00:03:29.040> say<00:03:29.250> when<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> get<00:03:30.000> here<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:31.100> I

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
ball now let's say when I get here and I

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.800 
ball now let's say when I get here and I
try<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.310> line<00:03:32.550> myself<00:03:32.730> pretty<00:03:33.390> close<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.750> a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
try to line myself pretty close to a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.479 
try to line myself pretty close to a
straight<00:03:34.080> line<00:03:34.290> from<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.590> hole<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.250> put

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
straight line from the hole and I put

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.240 
straight line from the hole and I put
the<00:03:35.580> putter<00:03:35.790> up<00:03:35.850> like<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:37.800> ball<00:03:38.070> is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
on that side of the center of the hole

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.860 
on that side of the center of the hole

I if the ball is on the right side of
hold<00:05:04.870> then<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.110> go<00:05:05.289> to<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.530> ball<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:08.370> put<00:05:09.370> the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
center of the ball straight up and look

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.620 
center of the ball straight up and look
up<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.400> shaft<00:05:12.669> where<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.090> Center<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.479> hole

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
up the shaft where that Center the hole

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.409 
up the shaft where that Center the hole
is<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:14.050> whatever<00:05:14.860> point<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.729> ground<00:05:16.030> is<00:05:16.210> that

is and whatever point the ground is that

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.700 
is and whatever point the ground is that
touch<00:05:16.600> that<00:05:16.840> shaft<00:05:17.080> that's<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.560> high<00:05:17.680> point

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
touch that shaft that's the high point

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.800 
touch that shaft that's the high point
that's<00:05:18.460> how<00:05:18.610> high<00:05:18.789> that<00:05:19.000> putt<00:05:19.210> has<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.479> be<00:05:19.600> hit

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
that's how high that putt has to be hit

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.210 
that's how high that putt has to be hit
to<00:05:20.530> make<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:20.949> with<00:05:21.160> reasonable<00:05:21.760> speed<00:05:22.060> now

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
to make that with reasonable speed now

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.920 
to make that with reasonable speed now
again<00:05:24.220> is<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.820> really<00:05:25.120> exact<00:05:25.479> science

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
again is it really exact science

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.520 
again is it really exact science
probably<00:05:26.560> not<00:05:26.710> I<00:05:27.539> mean<00:05:28.539> because<00:05:28.660> what<00:05:28.930> you've

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
probably not I mean because what you've

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.960 
probably not I mean because what you've
got<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:29.800> many<00:05:29.919> factors<00:05:30.280> coming<00:05:30.520> into<00:05:30.729> play

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
got so many factors coming into play

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.000 
got so many factors coming into play
here<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.539> got<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.840> speed<00:05:32.139> of<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.770> greens

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
here you got the speed of the greens

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.770 
here you got the speed of the greens
you've<00:05:33.220> got<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.880> got<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.210> speed<00:05:34.510> that

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
you've got the you got the speed that

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.870 
you've got the you got the speed that
you're<00:05:34.930> going<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.139> hit<00:05:35.289> the<00:05:35.380> putt<00:05:35.669> we<00:05:36.669> know

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
you're going to hit the putt we know

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.240 
you're going to hit the putt we know
that<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.389> putts<00:05:38.139> that<00:05:38.259> a<00:05:38.380> hit<00:05:38.560> softer<00:05:39.009> break

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
that that putts that a hit softer break

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.890 
that that putts that a hit softer break
more<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:40.090> can<00:05:40.300> and<00:05:40.539> you've<00:05:40.660> heard<00:05:40.780> the

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
more you can and you've heard the

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.060 
more you can and you've heard the
expression<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:41.410> can<00:05:41.560> hit<00:05:41.620> it<00:05:41.680> harder<00:05:41.979> and

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
expression you can hit it harder and

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.710 
expression you can hit it harder and
take<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.340> break<00:05:42.520> out<00:05:42.729> of<00:05:42.849> it<00:05:42.940> you<00:05:43.330> only<00:05:43.539> really

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
take the break out of it you only really

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.830 
take the break out of it you only really
do<00:05:43.960> that<00:05:44.110> on<00:05:44.139> real<00:05:44.410> short<00:05:44.680> putts<00:05:45.240> because<00:05:46.240> I

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
do that on real short putts because I

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.659 
do that on real short putts because I
could<00:05:47.620> do<00:05:47.710> that<00:05:47.830> on<00:05:47.889> long<00:05:48.130> putts<00:05:48.370> it's<00:05:48.550> going

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
could do that on long putts it's going

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.310 
could do that on long putts it's going
to<00:05:48.729> be<00:05:48.789> too<00:05:48.910> loud<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.150> control<00:05:49.479> distance<00:05:49.960> but

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
to be too loud to control distance but

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.300 
to be too loud to control distance but
you're<00:05:50.440> doing<00:05:50.620> in<00:05:50.680> short<00:05:50.860> putts<00:05:51.099> where<00:05:51.220> you're

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
you're doing in short putts where you're

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.469 
you're doing in short putts where you're
going<00:05:51.430> basically<00:05:51.880> going<00:05:52.060> to<00:05:52.120> try<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.330> fog

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
going basically going to try to fog

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
I go to the center of the ball and put

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.870 
I go to the center of the ball and put
that<00:06:11.020> there<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.470> bring<00:06:11.979> up<00:06:12.130> to<00:06:12.310> where<00:06:12.760> the

that there and bring up to where the

equal to the outside of hole that tells

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.219 
equal to the outside of hole that tells
you<00:06:21.460> my<00:06:21.580> high<00:06:21.699> point<00:06:22.000> so<00:06:22.599> you<00:06:22.720> can<00:06:22.930> pull<00:06:23.139> with

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
you my high point so you can pull with

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.439 
you my high point so you can pull with
that<00:06:23.289> best<00:06:23.919> thing<00:06:24.130> to<00:06:24.159> do<00:06:24.370> is<00:06:24.580> is<00:06:24.789> is<00:06:25.060> find

that best thing to do is is is find

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.060 
that best thing to do is is is find
somebody<00:06:25.780> that<00:06:25.900> you<00:06:25.930> see<00:06:26.229> plumb<00:06:26.680> bobbing

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
somebody that you see plumb bobbing

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.040 
somebody that you see plumb bobbing
that's<00:06:27.220> a<00:06:27.310> good<00:06:27.460> putter<00:06:27.669> in<00:06:27.849> and<00:06:28.030> ask<00:06:28.659> them<00:06:28.930> and

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
that's a good putter in and ask them and

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.149 
that's a good putter in and ask them and
I<00:06:29.110> think<00:06:29.320> they'll<00:06:29.440> pretty<00:06:29.590> much<00:06:29.680> give<00:06:29.949> you<00:06:30.039> the

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
I think they'll pretty much give you the

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.060 
I think they'll pretty much give you the
same<00:06:30.370> the<00:06:30.880> same<00:06:31.120> answer<00:06:31.479> it's<00:06:32.380> not<00:06:32.680> an<00:06:32.770> exact

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
same the same answer it's not an exact

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.460 
same the same answer it's not an exact
science<00:06:33.159> but<00:06:33.610> in<00:06:33.699> many<00:06:33.820> cases<00:06:34.030> if<00:06:34.659> you're<00:06:35.260> if

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
science but in many cases if you're if

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.589 
science but in many cases if you're if
you're<00:06:35.740> if<00:06:36.370> you<00:06:36.580> get<00:06:36.729> to<00:06:36.849> use<00:06:37.000> it<00:06:37.030> you'll<00:06:37.360> give

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
you're if you get to use it you'll give

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:42.540 
you're if you get to use it you'll give
you<00:06:37.690> a<00:06:37.720> good<00:06:37.930> good<00:06:38.349> really<00:06:39.250> good<00:06:41.220> concept<00:06:42.220> of

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
you a good good really good concept of

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.250 
you a good good really good concept of
exactly<00:06:42.639> what<00:06:43.180> what<00:06:43.510> your<00:06:43.659> break<00:06:43.840> is<00:06:44.020> if<00:06:44.169> you

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
exactly what what your break is if you

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.140 
exactly what what your break is if you
have<00:06:44.349> a<00:06:44.380> trouble<00:06:44.620> seeing<00:06:44.919> it<00:06:45.039> and<00:06:45.190> in<00:06:45.789> the<00:06:46.000> end

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
have a trouble seeing it and in the end

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.670 
have a trouble seeing it and in the end
in<00:06:46.300> many<00:06:46.419> cases<00:06:46.840> if<00:06:47.020> it<00:06:47.169> looks<00:06:47.409> really

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
in many cases if it looks really

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.360 
in many cases if it looks really
straight<00:06:47.979> and<00:06:48.190> what<00:06:48.849> happens<00:06:49.090> if<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:49.210> see

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
straight and what happens if you see

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.110 
straight and what happens if you see
you're<00:06:51.370> not<00:06:51.460> sure<00:06:51.639> what

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
you're not sure what

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.850 
you're not sure what
right<00:06:52.389> our<00:06:52.540> a<00:06:52.570> little<00:06:52.750> left<00:06:53.229> I'd<00:06:53.500> say<00:06:53.680> hit<00:06:53.830> a

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
right our a little left I'd say hit a

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.960 
right our a little left I'd say hit a
little<00:06:54.070> firmer<00:06:54.280> and<00:06:54.430> hit<00:06:54.550> it<00:06:54.639> right<00:06:54.729> up<00:06:54.880> the

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
little firmer and hit it right up the

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.450 
little firmer and hit it right up the
middle<00:06:55.150> and<00:06:55.389> and<00:06:55.990> and<00:06:56.560> play<00:06:56.949> it<00:06:57.070> more<00:06:57.190> straight

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
middle and and and play it more straight

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.790 
middle and and and play it more straight
but<00:06:58.150> that's<00:06:58.660> the<00:06:58.870> essence<00:06:59.139> of<00:06:59.229> Club<00:06:59.440> bombing

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
but that's the essence of Club bombing

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.850 
but that's the essence of Club bombing
as<00:07:00.010> as<00:07:00.250> I<00:07:00.850> do<00:07:00.910> it<00:07:01.210> in<00:07:01.360> and<00:07:01.810> it<00:07:01.930> works<00:07:02.139> fairly

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
as as I do it in and it works fairly

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.860 
as as I do it in and it works fairly
well<00:07:03.070> for<00:07:03.460> me<00:07:03.580> but<00:07:03.940> there's<00:07:04.330> times<00:07:04.570> when<00:07:04.750> it

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:04.870 
well for me but there's times when it

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.480 
well for me but there's times when it
doesn't<00:07:04.900> but<00:07:05.350> either<00:07:05.470> way<00:07:05.680> I'm<00:07:06.130> going<00:07:06.280> to<00:07:06.340> use

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
doesn't but either way I'm going to use

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.310 
doesn't but either way I'm going to use
it<00:07:06.610> I<00:07:06.699> gig<00:07:07.000> I<00:07:07.150> have<00:07:07.389> to<00:07:07.510> make<00:07:07.660> a<00:07:07.690> decision<00:07:08.020> and

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
it I gig I have to make a decision and

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.350 
it I gig I have to make a decision and
go<00:07:08.440> with<00:07:08.470> it<00:07:08.650> sometimes<00:07:09.610> I'm<00:07:09.760> right<00:07:09.910> sometimes

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
go with it sometimes I'm right sometimes

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.870 
go with it sometimes I'm right sometimes
I'm<00:07:10.780> wrong<00:07:10.930> but<00:07:11.560> again<00:07:12.100> you<00:07:12.250> keep<00:07:12.460> working<00:07:12.639> at

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
I'm wrong but again you keep working at

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.340 
I'm wrong but again you keep working at
it<00:07:12.910> you<00:07:13.180> should<00:07:13.389> be<00:07:13.479> starting<00:07:13.660> to<00:07:13.930> get<00:07:14.050> more

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350 
it you should be starting to get more

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.050 
it you should be starting to get more
right<00:07:14.530> than<00:07:14.710> than<00:07:15.190> more<00:07:15.430> times<00:07:15.699> that<00:07:15.880> you're

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
right than than more times that you're

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.820 
right than than more times that you're
wrong<00:07:16.210> and<00:07:16.449> it<00:07:17.110> should<00:07:17.139> style<00:07:17.410> hoping<00:07:17.740> you're

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:17.830 
wrong and it should style hoping you're

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.510 
wrong and it should style hoping you're
putty<00:07:18.040> but<00:07:19.169> again<00:07:20.169> if<00:07:20.979> you've<00:07:21.160> got<00:07:21.190> somebody

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
putty but again if you've got somebody

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.180 
putty but again if you've got somebody
that<00:07:21.639> you<00:07:21.850> know<00:07:22.000> I<00:07:22.270> can<00:07:23.110> talk<00:07:23.260> to<00:07:23.470> who<00:07:23.919> plumb

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
that you know I can talk to who plumb

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.939 
that you know I can talk to who plumb
Bob's<00:07:24.430> and<00:07:24.729> does<00:07:25.510> it<00:07:25.660> well<00:07:25.810> get<00:07:26.530> them<00:07:26.710> to<00:07:26.830> see

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:26.949 
Bob's and does it well get them to see

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:29.939 
Bob's and does it well get them to see
if<00:07:27.039> their<00:07:27.220> definition<00:07:27.820> of<00:07:28.620> what<00:07:29.620> they<00:07:29.889> do

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:29.949 
if their definition of what they do

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.640 
if their definition of what they do
figures<00:07:30.520> in<00:07:30.639> with<00:07:30.760> this<00:07:30.880> one<00:07:31.090> in<00:07:31.240> and<00:07:31.419> then<00:07:31.900> ask

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:32.650 
figures in with this one in and then ask

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.020 
figures in with this one in and then ask
them<00:07:32.860> to<00:07:32.949> train<00:07:33.160> you<00:07:33.310> and<00:07:33.460> see<00:07:33.699> if<00:07:33.789> it<00:07:33.910> starts

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030 
them to train you and see if it starts

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.000 
them to train you and see if it starts
working<00:07:34.449> for<00:07:34.630> you<00:07:34.720> it<00:07:35.260> may<00:07:35.440> work<00:07:35.590> for<00:07:35.830> you<00:07:35.949> may

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.010 
working for you it may work for you may

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.830 
working for you it may work for you may
not<00:07:36.160> but<00:07:36.550> I<00:07:36.610> know<00:07:36.699> what<00:07:36.940> one<00:07:37.060> thing<00:07:37.120> so<00:07:37.630> I<00:07:37.660> hack

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 
not but I know what one thing so I hack

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.870 
not but I know what one thing so I hack
of<00:07:37.930> a<00:07:37.960> lot<00:07:38.080> of<00:07:38.199> people<00:07:38.440> who<00:07:38.500> plump<00:07:38.740> up<00:07:38.860> and<00:07:39.130> plug

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:39.880 
of a lot of people who plump up and plug

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.610 
of a lot of people who plump up and plug
pretty<00:07:40.090> well<00:07:40.240> doing<00:07:40.539> it<00:07:40.660> so<00:07:40.990> it<00:07:41.380> should<00:07:41.590> be

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620 
pretty well doing it so it should be

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.840 
pretty well doing it so it should be
given<00:07:41.949> is<00:07:42.070> you<00:07:42.220> wouldn't<00:07:42.490> hurt<00:07:42.610> to<00:07:42.729> give

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:42.850 
given is you wouldn't hurt to give

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.400 
given is you wouldn't hurt to give
yourself<00:07:43.120> a<00:07:43.210> shot<00:07:43.240> at<00:07:43.570> it<00:07:43.690> especially<00:07:43.990> if

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.410 
yourself a shot at it especially if

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.260 
yourself a shot at it especially if
you're<00:07:44.590> not<00:07:45.340> doing<00:07:45.550> a<00:07:45.610> good<00:07:45.699> job<00:07:45.760> of<00:07:46.060> reading

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.270 
you're not doing a good job of reading

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.670 
you're not doing a good job of reading
your<00:07:46.389> putts<00:07:46.570> all<00:07:47.169> right<00:07:47.320> so<00:07:47.560> hopefully

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 
your putts all right so hopefully

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.379 
your putts all right so hopefully
hopefully<00:07:48.280> this<00:07:48.610> little<00:07:48.850> lesson<00:07:48.970> on<00:07:49.150> plum

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:49.389 
hopefully this little lesson on plum

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:53.730 
hopefully this little lesson on plum
bombing<00:07:50.550> can<00:07:51.550> help<00:07:51.699> you<00:07:52.110> make<00:07:53.110> more<00:07:53.289> putts<00:07:53.470> and

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.740 
bombing can help you make more putts and

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.379 
bombing can help you make more putts and
shoot<00:07:53.919> those<00:07:54.039> little<00:07:54.310> scores<00:07:54.550> well<00:07:55.120> that's<00:07:55.240> it

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:55.389 
shoot those little scores well that's it

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:56.339 
shoot those little scores well that's it
for<00:07:55.510> the<00:07:55.600> search<00:07:55.750> for<00:07:55.960> today<00:07:56.139> and<00:07:56.260> I'll<00:07:56.320> be

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:56.349
