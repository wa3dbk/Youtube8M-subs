00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.090
 a video tutorial to change spam 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.919
 on your server the line craft for 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.259
 we're going to use a plugin called 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:15.769
 essentials and first of all you are going to have 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:19.130
 to download a server book and good if 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.810
 you already have to use it we see that it is not 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.240
 say that it is not worth using a server 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.500
 normal and current of minecraft for 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.930
 that you do not have a bukit server or not 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.120
 You know how it is downloaded to go through the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.320
 video that I leave here because I made a 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.930
 tutorial recently and it will be useful 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.760
 well first of all we're going to download the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.929
 file advice description 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.929
 in the link 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.230
 and download is 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.520
 Once downloaded you will have this and the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.050
 trailers 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.899
 OK 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.910
 and once extracted today will come these 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.820
 files that is a folder and three 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.159
 archives you will have your server book and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.730
 what you have to have what you have to 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.210
 have downloaded 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.720
 and to give here to this folder and put 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.540
 plugins 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.490
 and good is empty what you have to 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.880
 do is put these four things that are 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 they have left 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.860
 it's that easy 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.820
 Once that's done, you have to start 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.430
 the server with the bonus in the case of my 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.080
 tutorial then it is like this there is a file that 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.080
 He grabbed a point so you give him 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.619
 and when you have finished loading the map 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.619
 you will have minecraft 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.840
 and in trailers 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.320
 multiplayer and well here I already have the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.870
 server is this 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.940
 you will have normal 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.490
 OK 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.400
 and first of all important that you go 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.130
 to have to do is open the console 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:15.760
 from the server this and write or pe 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.410
 space and the name your name we are going 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.850
 the name with which you have entered the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.380
 I enter the name nimbus good 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.620
 2 as you have seen before it was 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.210
 2 moods well in your case 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.810
 You put yours, I'm going to cheer 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.050
 2 that is to say ope space and your name 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.870
 ok ope space cheers all I've put 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.970
 ok you give him enter and as you see in the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.260
 game says that the console has made you 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.780
 ope let's go now that you have the ability 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.630
 to write commands within the game 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.000
 ok and what do we need this for? 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.930
 because now to change the rest the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.020
 spam let's write two commands there 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.580
 two basic commands that are one is for 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.880
 teleport from argument to spam and 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.450
 is this you write a bar in the chat and 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.450
 you write are 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.569
 without you give to enter and this one 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.569
 automatically transports to the state 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.519
 ok and now if you for example 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.989
 do not think you have a special area 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.600
 in which you want to put your space 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.640
 that is above the cube this 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.450
 then you put in the area where you want 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.460
 that is spam and you write good in the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.380
 chat a bar of these bar 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:41.520
 diagonal 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:44.490
 and you put set spawn everything followed 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.620
 enter and the place of birth has been 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.620
 put by the fallout group good is 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.690
 say that now spam is over there 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.260
 and good if you want to check you do 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.180
 what before writing bar spawn that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.950
 it's teleportation automatically as 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.170
 you are on top of the cube 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.050
 well, this has been all I hope that 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.030
