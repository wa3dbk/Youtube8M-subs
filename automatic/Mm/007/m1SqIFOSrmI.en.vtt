00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.710
 make a video that shows the function of the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.280
 universal control of gvt for those who do not 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.650
 knows the usefulness of the tv key and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.710
 to help the tv with its own name already says 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:27.260
 she controls your television 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:30.029
 but only to set up 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.610
 You have to select tv mode. 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.000
 hold the 1 and 3 key 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.129
 at the same time as the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.010
 button Louisette had flashes by 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.260
 third time you will enter the code 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.809
 which is available on a list of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.480
 codes on the gvt website and a list of 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.530
 Brands for example of mine was 11 53 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.190
 when you finish setting it up 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 flashes confirming that certifies it works 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.660
 the auxiliary function is set to 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.090
 a different way 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:13.860
 she has in control that two little holes 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.670
 here I was squeezing him until I found the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.119
 code in the log so no lists at all 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 from my sony receiver and type it 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.400
 For example, I put a mode or 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.060
 if fashion help 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.960
 hence I can control it myself 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.960
 I'm going to hang up and 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.120
 The tv is without signal 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:53.270
 Logical there I come here selection in mode 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:57.590
 TV and I also turn it off and finally the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.729
 decoder already comes the gbd device 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.490
 The one who reads and that's it is one thing 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.190
 who discovered today despite having already 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.420
 idea that it was for this but did not 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.390
 this code availability 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:24.260
 the very interesting thing because it is over 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:27.260
 summarizing their controls in only 1 and 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.800
 with all the functions of the other types 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:39.410
 source menu entry channel volume to bullshit 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.900
 I'll try to leave the link 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.799
 list of TV codes in the description of the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.220
 video 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.220
 I speak
