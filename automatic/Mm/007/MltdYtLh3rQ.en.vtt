up in my house i have to cut the
branches<00:02:32.430> off<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.150> back<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:34.260> way

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
branches off of the back of it that way

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.590 
branches off of the back of it that way
i<00:02:34.440> can<00:02:34.530> push<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:35.160> against<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.670> wall<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.150> it

i can push it up against the wall and it

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.020 
i can push it up against the wall and it
still<00:02:36.870> looks<00:02:36.900> beautiful<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:37.950> full<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.790> it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
still looks beautiful in full but it

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.900 
still looks beautiful in full but it
fits<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.810> my<00:02:39.930> small<00:02:40.230> space<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.830> i<00:02:41.489> haven't<00:02:41.790> had

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
fits in my small space and i haven't had

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.430 
fits in my small space and i haven't had
any<00:02:42.150> problems<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.810> past<00:02:42.959> years<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
any problems in the past years of a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.800 
any problems in the past years of a
dying<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.280> good<00:02:44.400> sign

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.960 

so<00:02:50.739> another<00:02:50.980> trick<00:02:51.250> idea<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.730> don't<00:02:51.880> know

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so another trick idea and I don't know

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.820 
so another trick idea and I don't know
how<00:02:52.239> many<00:02:52.420> people<00:02:52.480> do<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.650> actually

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
how many people do this but I actually

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.890 
how many people do this but I actually
get<00:02:54.220> two<00:02:54.430> strands<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:54.880> lights<00:02:54.940> over<00:02:55.510> 100

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
get two strands of lights over 100

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.020 
get two strands of lights over 100
string<00:02:56.110> lights<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:57.190> run<00:02:57.489> them<00:02:57.700> from<00:02:57.940> the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
string lights and I run them from the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.970 
string lights and I run them from the
bottom<00:02:58.060> all<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.989> way<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.349> top<00:02:59.380> straight

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
bottom all the way to the top straight

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.370 
bottom all the way to the top straight
up<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.400> then<00:03:00.910> straight<00:03:01.270> down<00:03:01.300> straight<00:03:02.050> up

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
up and then straight down straight up

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.870 
up and then straight down straight up
and<00:03:02.590> straight<00:03:02.739> down<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.250> should<00:03:03.430> do<00:03:03.520> at<00:03:03.640> least

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
and straight down it should do at least

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.540 
and straight down it should do at least
four<00:03:04.209> times<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.840> what<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.709> do<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.220> put<00:03:06.250> them

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
four times and what I do is I put them

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.839 
four times and what I do is I put them
right<00:03:07.060> as<00:03:07.410> close<00:03:08.410> as<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.620> cam<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.250> trunk<00:03:09.640> and

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
right as close as a cam to the trunk and

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.570 
right as close as a cam to the trunk and
um<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.349> reason<00:03:11.500> for<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.099> so<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.519> you

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
um the reason for this is so that you

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.150 
um the reason for this is so that you
can<00:03:12.970> see<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.840> death<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.470> light<00:03:14.680> once<00:03:15.010> you

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
can see the death of the light once you

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.970 
can see the death of the light once you
put<00:03:15.370> your<00:03:15.489> other<00:03:15.670> lights<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:17.470> gleams

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
put your other lights on and it gleams

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.800 
put your other lights on and it gleams
all<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.489> way<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.819> back<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.300> tree<00:03:19.569> and

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
all the way to the back of the tree and

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.449 
all the way to the back of the tree and
it<00:03:19.930> looks<00:03:20.140> like<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.470> have<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.830> lot<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.190> lights

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
it looks like you have a lot of lights

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.610 
it looks like you have a lot of lights
on<00:03:21.610> your<00:03:21.730> tree<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.269> its<00:03:22.810> spark<00:03:23.140> was<00:03:23.290> really

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
on your tree and its spark was really

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.699 
on your tree and its spark was really
nice<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:24.730> love<00:03:25.299> this<00:03:25.480> idea<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:26.319> works<00:03:26.560> really

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709

and<00:04:20.700> make<00:04:20.940> sure<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.900> going<00:04:22.080> from

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
and make sure that it is just going from

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.590

when using larger ornaments place them

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.470 
when using larger ornaments place them
deeper<00:04:37.100> into<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.490> tree<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.240> color

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
deeper into the tree so that the color

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.960 
deeper into the tree so that the color
radiates<00:04:39.110> from<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.470> center<00:04:39.830> also<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.820> your
