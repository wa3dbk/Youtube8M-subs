00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.929
 every moment classes start on Tuesday night 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.259
 the comment we're here but it's not why not 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.010
 the worst thing is that the arbitration of bruno steves in the others does not have better thing 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.489
 Personally all the time of the psc will be more than lose the whole country 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.329
 in fact already part of our land culture 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.399
 who is not entitled monthly natura -6 2% but at what price is also 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:31.249
 I need luck 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.579
 I think I prefer it to the celebration I found 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.970
 that's because your purpose 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.780
 for access because it raises the hand 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.310
 good night 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.320
 I daresay I was by your side. 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.040
 please the initiative 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.910
 thank you 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.390
 but for being a game of cards history already tell me not wanting more in the area 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.080
 practically the same sources 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.740
 marking the exterior recently in a brewery she left the small 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.070
 region in the service sérgio ribeiro 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340
 I talked to the guy to the advanced 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.280
 all of himself explained 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.810
 What's the difference between my life and my life? 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.890
 it shows the production we will have products that use them 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.510
 demonstrated the team 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.870
 the cereal used fermentation tanks I will start the poster is 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.000
 certain 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.140
 and then with pm that will quickly think about the subject what was so and tip 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.740
 thin 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.660
 the difference between them the Brazilian but also decreased 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.610
 my part but action more specifically 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.790
 start the beer with the selection in a game that we can not 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.480
 without force of law 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.160
 this Saturday afternoon 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.460
 last week a special mark on Saturday 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.740
 she is nothing in the bottle 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.979
 to 1 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.230
 negative 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.450
 and in addition they will even be passed to 2-1 returning now 50 students passed to the 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.469
 end we can adopt the income - I will think about the place between the adults 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.420
 around 60 years 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.730
 5- 662 was everything we passed paulo presenting 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.190
 when it approached the end of last year the player surpassed this one 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.950
 of the five stages of the season to define the transaction 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:16.219
 it is clear that some patients who go through this the other 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.729
 the ine will make it last longer because the logistics are sometimes 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.539
 good a little complicated for both parties 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.209
 when we have a differentiated job 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.480
 we deliver another two three times a week to the outlets by 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.480
 There is no need to passione already the Fluminense 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.169
 is the beers do not believe in port elizabeth the customer sends out and the 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:40.429
 market waits 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:45.499
 how she needs some time and a job for him 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.559
 supermarket your points of sale 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:51.949
 she does not settle for living in a bar that sells faster 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.169
 then beer needs it that time. 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.849
 it has quality and legality 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.919
 this shirt 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.099
 later 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.059
 look to help 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.569
 the paraná in series b seems to be a year 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.539
 I thought it was a two-year sentence. 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.969
 the big game of this month 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.469
 they closed and air-conditioned a temperature of 55 in 8 to 7 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.759
 when you open the barrel 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:23.599
 after opening in Bahrain where it consumed in up to 72 hours I just 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.379
 send with a useful life 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.379
 the customer asks to consume 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.999
 the other three burglars 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:38.039
 stabilizing preservatives in those major parties and some even that the 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.519
 executive 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.809
 this is what I'm noticing file this 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:44.859
 We're not going to die out. 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.859
 factory exchange has a revenue sell the products used 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.919
 the recipe of pink borges cvg depends on several factors ne 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.080
 military equipment quality raw material 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.080
 the global 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.220
 temperatures in the rs 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.069
 in this nation 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.099
 How was my visit there, my conversation with her, too cool. 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.379
 highlights however it is even if he wins the colorado 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.219
 a beer the same way then the vacancy 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:20.389
 but here with my sins with the thing the flower association study 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.270
 after all 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.270
 like this Russian manufacturing process 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.160
 this was also one more question I asked him
