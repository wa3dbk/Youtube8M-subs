00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.130 
looking statue but I think in my opinion
it<00:04:52.420> just<00:04:52.660> seems<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.080> be<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.970> little<00:04:54.970> overpriced

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.370 

just<00:04:59.140> because<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.980> all<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.570> paint<00:05:01.780> issues<00:05:01.990> I

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
just because of all the paint issues I

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:11.760 
just because of all the paint issues I
seem<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.800> be<00:05:02.890> having<00:05:03.750> right<00:05:04.750> away<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:10.590> there<00:05:11.590> it

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
seem to be having right away so there it

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.850 
seem to be having right away so there it
is<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:14.550> I'll<00:05:15.550> just<00:05:15.700> show<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:16.120> box<00:05:16.860> really
