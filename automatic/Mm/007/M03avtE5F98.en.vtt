 news in the eleven with some

 on the bench of the first set 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.079

 bench did not play a single minute of 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.920
 Brazilian a barça that already had the 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.340
 first occasion in this header 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.340
 from messi 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.899
 the start of the party and messi in the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.730
 12 minute was trying to test the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 goalkeeper Julian as we said a 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.079
 first period most competed with a 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.809
 Almería that had a few good minutes in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.629
 those that he could even mark as 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.800
 example in this play in which he pointed 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.500
 is to do it 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.680
 Wellington in the 14th minute 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.730
 the ball ends up marching to the right 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.730
 of the goal of claudio bravo 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.580
 what Barcelona was trying with centers of 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.870
 Leo Messi was not fine the Argentine in 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.870
 the first period although it would end 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.420
 scoring a goal in the 33rd minute pedro 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.630
 would be a starter with Suarez 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.540
 and messi sergi barjuán's instructions 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.030
 going back to camp nou and watching as his 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.399
 Almería I ended up losing with 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.330
 very active forcefulness one of the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.380
 best of the match 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.130
 and xavi 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.110
 he was the owner 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.049
 He had opportunities from the second line 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.750
 as on this occasion in which the center 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.630
 de alves extends it to the back end 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.950
 pedro so that top of the first 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.950
 captain today of barcelona xavi hernandez 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.350
 the barça that could not generate 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.000
 too much danger and in one play 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.910
 isolated minute 33 leo messi-get 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.060
 can and to put the 1 to 0 in the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.860

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.300
 excellent the play of leo that with 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.970
 left leg looks for a thread 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.860
 very tight to the goal post 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.860
 julián and scores 1 to 0 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.540

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.840
 by luis enrique 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.660
 more and better before an almería that no longer 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.550
 he arrived so much and if he did it was 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.500
 practically already in the final stretch of 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.310
 Barça party that warned with this 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.310
 auction 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.000
 of Adriano who would end up catching the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.550
 goalkeeper julián 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.310
 and the goal of Luis Suarez important for 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.520
 the 2 to 0 that left the party quite 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.530
 quiet for the fantastic azulgranas 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.510
 the ninth left leg shot 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.360
 Uruguayan goal in this league bbva 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.600

 second part 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.130
 the barça with this second goal left 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.770
 quite touched already to the set of sergi 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.110
 barjuán excellent the action d 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.770
 Suarez moving with the right 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.830
 changing the leather to the left for 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.030
 finish and put the ball in the 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.730
 Goal of the joy of Luis Enrique 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.710
 a ball that the goalkeeper would touch 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.530
 julián el barça from 2 to 0 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.360
 calling a lot in the game the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.760
 command was absolute great match for 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.190
 true of rakitic here he tries the 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.530
 Croatian 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.350
 in the first period of the former player of 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.480
 Seville 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.990
 with many recoveries with a lot 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.990
 intensity 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.310
 the 4th of the barça a barça that won 2 to 0 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.770
 and that was coming with a lot 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.080
 danger every time in fact he got 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.150
 in the area it generated an occasion like 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.920
 this one of Pedro that ends up finishing with the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.230
 topping a rafinha action that had 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.910
 entered the second period as 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.890
 He had also done it montoya martin 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.810
 and the barça that of strategy and 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.170
 out of a corner would mark what 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.670
 would do 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.670
 marc bartra to put 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:37.120
 the 3 to 0 on the scoreboard was 75 minutes 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.639
 3 to 0 and goal of bartra 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.340
 at the exit of a corner to close 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.400
 the meeting when there was still a 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.880
 quarter of an hour the barça absolutely 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.529
 put in territory visitors here the 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.839
 invalidated play 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:57.619
 the goal annulled Leo Messi for lack 

00:04:53.839 --> 00:05:01.270
 Preview of the Argentine and the referee 

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:04.060
 Hernández Hernández would end up changing 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.250
 the goal here we see again how it starts 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.650
 in correct position but before 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.170
 receive the ball the month push and 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.860
 one month and he had this opportunity from 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.990
 the front of the area a lack 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.990
 it was finished removing the guardamenta julián 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.210
 absolutely anesthetized the almeria in 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.280
 the second period especially in the 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:31.800
 last half hour he could only do 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.690
 this and in fact it is a wonderful goal 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.300
 of taking is part but that cancels the 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.550
 collegiate for a previous lack of 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.979
 fernando soriano probably would have 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.979
 been one of the goals of the moment 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.270
 the ball ends up squeezing through 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.570
 the squad 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.639
 could not close the gap on 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.979
 set 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.409
 of sergi barjuán and if the 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.539
 barcelona would score in the last 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.150
 sigh of the party the last play of the 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.430
 encounter against lethal attack of the barça 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.169
 but he puts it for Luis Suarez and the 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.090
 Uruguayan finishes to pleasure to write down his 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:13.840
 tenth goal this season in the bbv league 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.210
 his second shot in this match very 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.159
 comfortable for the liverpool ex for 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.310
 close the meeting and to score the 4 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:23.620
 0 final with which the FC Barcelona 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.750
 this victory was in Week 30 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.789
 at the end blunt triumph of the barça 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.259
 in camp nou the barça exceeded 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.919
 clearly to the team of sergi barjuán 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:36.779
 with the two of Suarez the goal of Messi and 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.779
