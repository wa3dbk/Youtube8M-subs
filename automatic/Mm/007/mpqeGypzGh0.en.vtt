00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.830
 the Netherlands was the youtube his thesis 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.040
 semenya and today I'm here to teach 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.939
 you guys how to create a player with html5 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.170
 in this html5 that made it much easier 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.730
 Our life, right? 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.910
 So I already did a teaching video lesson. 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.340
 how to create a more player was here with the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.610
 player from your club then ok we 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.470
 learn with html5 obviously if the 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.570
 platform if you are using 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.410
 transport candidate 5 I now think 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.410
 that all have will not work 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.360
 good code of the team very little 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.160
 very simple but it will be 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.620
 working here even if you 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.710
 Do you want something more specific you? 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.690
 You're going to have to move here in your 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.160
 The correct code is that for example if 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.000
 people want to automatically you will 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.309
 have to put on high controls 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.309
 You want the one that stays in control. 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:24.399
 leaving the Chinese in li for three 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.399
 lines of code for download not 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.609
 is found on our website click 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.600
 edit and then you depend on you 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:39.439
 using 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:42.829
 here we will have this until this tag 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.979
 BRQ the tag to jump lines was then 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.380
 proof had to dr space with bar 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.920
 close the bulletin that never worked 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.969
 here is our code and one thing 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.880
 important 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:01.850
 if you have two players here a single page 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.079
 he will not be opening the second 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.130
 player 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.709
 So what are we going to have to do? 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.590
 here I'm going to put in another player 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.930
 We'll put it here before the code 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.590
 the first we put april 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.390
 kitten div close business goes on that no 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.390
 end of the first code 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.660
 the buttercup ubÃ¡ closes we can 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.350
 Do the same thing you have here. 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.040
 opening thus and amusing xuxa open bar 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.800
 and a beauty here closes our code 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.900
 even with eight to host a file of 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.160
 audio now has very much the same place 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.560
 You are staying in your file. 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.680
 It's okay to come back 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.590
 here using the web that is a platform 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.950
 to create websites that give the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.560
 site ready it you just move it needs 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.750
 you know nothing of water loses my 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.690
 him but he gives to us is that the wait 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.390
 Our audio files are very quiet as well 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.910
 quiet certain tone you wanted your site 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.190
 you do not have to 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.280
 unless you want to use it by site 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.530
 but I wanted the site clickon 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:27.140
 site or china or saw how the site 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:29.820
 So far he has sent the panel today and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.860
 otherwise it seems that window there that 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.700
 page that we look not seem the 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.400
 beautiful thing site or tamper with it is that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.630
 window I saw that page you here a web 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.480
 you are being redirected 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.660
 to that page 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.300
 now right then here are our 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.670
 site archives 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.860
 I would rather one pass to put 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.480
 the vignette files or the files 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.670
 in audio files 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.550
 it's a messy thing all played by 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.340
 in the river then click here the folder that 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.300
 It's not a new pass It creates pass is 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.550
 c'mon, let's open that far from my 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.760
 The right file for you is to upload 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.310
 ie put here host more than one 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.090
 file you will click here multiple it 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.420
 the last panel very happy at last you 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.880
 understand and if you are joy that I will only 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.260
 worry about fire will sing here 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.529
 look for equipment on your computer and she 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.349
 is doing the d 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:35.209
 so you make a cute project 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.949
 click the name of the file that you 

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:42.219
 just downloaded that you want the link 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:45.049
 here commercial the tail use a control c 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:50.139
 and it already looks like the player as you can 

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:53.389
 see is we going on our page 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:57.079
 click here in Bahia everything is against 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:08.629
 there was beauty here our player update 

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:10.159

 See here 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:16.699
 cute 23 player will always appear 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.519
 so it does not depend on your windows depends 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:27.109
 yours 

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:29.719
 is what explains your windows browser 

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:33.709
 depends on your media player version 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:37.309
 his here for example is not spoiler 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:42.819
 I see so here you can see the 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:42.819
 Its design is the design here of windows 8 

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:55.329
 you can change the size of the file here 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:58.129
 file size no player size 

00:05:55.329 --> 00:06:00.799
 can do many things here is the 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.089
 basic touch even if you know 

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:03.889
 invest a little more than eight months 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.359
 you can have changes and have any questions 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.399
 remains low 

00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:11.169
 if I know it is responding right 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:13.789
 so this is it 's very simple it's pretty easy 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:18.169
 It does not need much for you. 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:19.279

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.619
 so I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.479

 If you liked listening, I helped you. 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:36.139
 now low and falls within the channel 

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:37.879
 I'm coming back to the active blog with my 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.819
 I intend to bet a lot of video lessons 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:43.100
