00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
enough for like a good amount of time

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.249 
enough for like a good amount of time
let's<00:05:41.039> see<00:05:41.160> how<00:05:41.220> much<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.550> used<00:05:41.820> I<00:05:42.259> probably

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
let's see how much I used I probably

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.439 
let's see how much I used I probably
lives<00:05:43.530> like<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.710> quarter<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.580> this<00:05:45.150> whole<00:05:45.419> thing

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
lives like a quarter of this whole thing

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.240 
lives like a quarter of this whole thing
for<00:05:46.080> my<00:05:46.199> hair<00:05:46.440> so<00:05:46.650> I<00:05:46.680> guess<00:05:46.860> I<00:05:46.979> would<00:05:47.070> have<00:05:47.099> to

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
for my hair so I guess I would have to

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.140 
for my hair so I guess I would have to
refill<00:05:47.669> it<00:05:47.849> all<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.539> way<00:05:48.660> to<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:48.900> top<00:05:49.199> umm

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
refill it all the way to the top umm

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.430 
refill it all the way to the top umm
like<00:05:51.150> every<00:05:51.449> four<00:05:51.630> times<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:52.050> straighten<00:05:52.349> my

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
like every four times I straighten my

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.409 
like every four times I straighten my
hair<00:05:52.470> which<00:05:52.919> isn't<00:05:53.160> that<00:05:53.430> bad<00:05:53.849> didn't<00:05:54.210> take

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
if you straighten your hair a lot you're

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.640 
if you straighten your hair a lot you're
probably<00:06:24.479> just<00:06:24.750> breaking<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.260> ends<00:06:25.500> and

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
probably just breaking the ends and

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.080 
probably just breaking the ends and
damaging<00:06:26.159> it<00:06:26.250> constantly<00:06:26.880> and<00:06:26.970> constantly

damaging it constantly and constantly

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.230 
damaging it constantly and constantly
and<00:06:27.690> it<00:06:27.750> probably<00:06:27.990> feels<00:06:28.289> like<00:06:28.380> straw<00:06:28.770> and<00:06:29.240> you

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
and it probably feels like straw and you

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.420
