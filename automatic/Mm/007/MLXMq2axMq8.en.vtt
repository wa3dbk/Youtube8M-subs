00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
shell out of both of them because that's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.700 
shell out of both of them because that's
an<00:02:00.450> undesirable<00:02:00.899> part<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.500> should<00:02:04.619> let

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
an undesirable part so we should let

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.969 
an undesirable part so we should let
this<00:02:04.829> last<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.219> bit<00:02:05.460> here<00:02:05.490> drip<00:02:05.820> off<00:02:06.409> if<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this last little bit here drip off if it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.130 
this last little bit here drip off if it
will

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.390 

and<00:02:15.140> if<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.380> won't<00:02:16.600> there<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:17.690> go<00:02:18.040> all<00:02:19.040> right<00:02:19.160> so

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
and if it won't there we go all right so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.840 
and if it won't there we go all right so
that<00:02:19.850> is<00:02:20.000> how<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.120> separate<00:02:20.630> eggs
