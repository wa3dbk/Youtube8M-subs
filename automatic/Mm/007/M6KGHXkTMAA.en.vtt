00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.170
 good 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.930
 hello friends today we are going to teach you how 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.870
 tighten a threaded direction 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.580
 let's take this scooter and let's 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.060
 first remove what is the handlebar 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.090
 as you see this address now I would have 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.980
 game you see this little game that 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.439
 logically on top of the handlebar 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.930
 you can see the whole thing , let's remove the 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.470
 handlebars loosen the plan comment 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.739
 that this of these directions if they are not 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.930
 sealed address is a bad thing to say 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.670
 they look like all the scooters in the world 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.710
 worldwide any scooter that goes 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.590
 mounted with a thread direction is 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.120
 a normal thing has a maintenance 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.280
 you will have to press it then 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.860
 depending on the tricks you do and the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 cane that you get when listening is worth 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.000
 The first thing I always do is remove the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.160
 handlebar but you can remove or else 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.110
 you can loosen up a bit, I'm worth it in this 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.410
 case what I'm going to do is remove it for 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.440
 that you see well as we press then what 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.830
 that is the direction we remove the handlebar 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.100
 we leave it a grade 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.140
 and now we will need two keys the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.820
 problem is usually that there is not a 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.060
 key is hard to find a key that 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.150
 be so fine to be able to tighten the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.850
 nut down without touching the one above 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.950
 ok we made these keys 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.040
 that are special and you see bestial wolf 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.340
 to be able to do this what we would do 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.200
 it would be the first thing to press it again 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.710
 again we loose the two 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.220
 we loose the top one 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.430
 As you can see I am loosening it and now with 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.500
 the top one so separated we will tighten the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.060
 from below I usually down what 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.030
 I do is tighten it tight with the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.770
 hand that only good is also that if not 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.840
 you have such a fine key 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.970
 the first thing is to press it so hard with 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.000
 the hand is worth as you see right now 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.369
 turn is hard is very hard not you 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.380
 worry because then it will loosen up 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.510
 we hold it tight with your hand 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.390
 although it is that hard and now we press 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.790
 the above 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.700
 up we also tighten it with the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.610
 hand as strong as we can with the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.490
 hand is worth as you see it is still hard 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.370
 and here is the trick that would be to do the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.090
 against nut so that it does not stay 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.820
 neither so strong nor that moves we will take 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.000
 with the key this and we will hold the 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.500
 below and with this one above and what 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.440
 we will do will press the top one and 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.209
 make as if we loose the bottom one this 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.390
 what it will do is that the nut down 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.209
 exert a pressure with the one above and the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.450
 from above with the one below without bothering 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.850
 the balls and releasing so that this 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.180
 can rotate correctly 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.880
 let's do it as you see the plight of 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.640
 above 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.600
 and we loose hold the bottom one as 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.870
 if we check to see how it is now 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.870
 it's a bit hard, we're still doing 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.850
 OK 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.850
 and thomas a 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 cut 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.680
 perfect and now what we would do would be 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.370
 and move on to ride as you see now 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.970
 we have already removed this game so that the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.900
 scooter does not move absolutely nothing 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.900
 we put the handlebar 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.080
 Right 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.310
 and we tighten well what are the 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.670
 screws 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.840
 it is important to tighten especially the two 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.480
 screws 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.959
 the two screws below the one above 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.959
 altogether 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.110
 is the one that least less holds less 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.009
 strength makes 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.120
 but the two below are the ones that do 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.430
 that the handlebar does not move 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.260
 Well, as you can see, I can stand here 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.260
 that we are the bank as you see 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.000
 I am 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.000
 I do not know 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.710
 well we have our scooter 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.710
 perfect 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.600
 and that is not absolutely nothing moves 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.600
 rotate perfectly 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.330
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.960
 this explanation and see you in the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.960
