00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.410
 before I start I want to tell you that the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.919
 next tutorial is for people who 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.690
 be familiar with it but some 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.269
 of the steps you will not understand 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.429
 saying this I enjoy the video 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.260
 hello everyone what happens people welcome 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.910
 about the most welcome call of duty 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.189
 black ops 2 and I made him a new trick 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.050
 to copy the emblem that has some 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.669
 person that we have played recently 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.079
 or some friend then let's spend the 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.439
 trick the first thing we have to do 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:31.110
 is to look in the channel of the person to the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.930
 which we hope to copy the emblem in 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 this case I will copy this that is very 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.059
 very good and nothing we are going to put in his 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.789
 channel and let's see if you have a 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.890
 screenshots and if you have screenshot it is 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.650
 because it is going to be able to leave us 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.020
 the trick and if it does not have screenshot let's go 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.649
 to have to find another person who 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.270
 have screenshot because if not it will not 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.610
 work the trick so now that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 we know it has screenshots we go down to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.340
 where it says emblems and we're going to position 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.320
 we are going to position the selector in the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.689
 emblem that we want to copy and now 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.759
 let's put the following combination 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.579
 I will leave you here written in the 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.680
 screen to xbox and ps3 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.540
 good in bc3 is square circle up 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 square down 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.070
 square is the combination that they have 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.890
 to do well fast if they have connection 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.800
 fast and normal if they have slow connection 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.540
 here as you see I do not get the first one like that 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.240
 that is something of the channel I go back in and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.280
 it looks quickly again to square 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.570
 square top square 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.640
 down square and as you can see it does not come out 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.979
 I get out quickly this there are several 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 tries doing it but I'm going to put 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.410
 fast camera and now we go back when I 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410
 out 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.710
 and well now we see how I give the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.020
 square circle square up to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.030
 square down square and I get out to 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.880
 save the emblem we can put the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.759
 title of the description we want 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.009
 we will have the emblem saved now 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.020
 we go to scott tv and we go to 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.120
 channel of our character and they are going to have 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.890
 there the emblem if you do not keep it 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.739
 try again because sometimes 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.080
 pass that the emblem is not saved and as 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.790
 Come, I have no place to put on the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.040
 emblem that we just copied we're going 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.840
 to marrakech that does not make them go 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.880
 Spaniards because I have the cube in 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.120
 English but we're going to barracks 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.680
 we go to the place where the editor is 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.140
 of emblems and here we are going to select 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.690
 the one that we just copied now we're going 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.970
 to give circle if you do not want to edit anything 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.920
 and if they want to edit it well they are 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.780
 I do not want to avoid it, I'm just going 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.410
 to change a hyper sand color esther him 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.819
 we are going to give circle and we are going to give 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.299
 save changes I do not know what it says in 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.140
 Spanish in English you know 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.360
 Now I do not know what it says because I'm 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.160
 commenting on the background and I do not read it but 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.200
 says something like that and hey 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.540
 they are going to see their character and as they see 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.700
 are going to have the emblem ready to 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.740
 can use it and they will see all the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.720
 people with whom they play so 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.240
 nothing people the truth is that it is a 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.370
 your case if I like to leave a like and we 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.370
