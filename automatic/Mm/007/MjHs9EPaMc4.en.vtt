00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.300
 So hello to all my name is Artem 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.670
 love and in this video today I want 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.980
 talk about anti-aging haircuts 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.140
 against chips that stylists use 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.320
 to make clients look younger 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.680
 and about errors that should be avoided 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.260
 if you want to look younger 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:31.160
 I'll start with a little story when I was 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.440
 as a young master and I worked in a salon in 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.390
 for the next chairs worked with me yet 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.789
 one my colleague and came to him 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.699
 client who came to laying 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:43.100
 it means both to colleagues and asks how would you 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.979
 wanted me to let you discuss 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.929
 styling or women begins to explain 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.530
 says here you know me like a bang 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.379
 on the pubis 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.299
 the rest in the ass so here it is bangs on 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.249
 the lab to steel wool that is the most 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:58.069
 common mistake the so-called 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:00.559
 false top and false heads should 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.329
 avoid it when on top zone don't take 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.210
 some point from which you mean 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.750
 begin hair removes ass god there on 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.600
 forehead bangs. which does not exist 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.009
 it actually begins 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.719
 redirect redirect vs 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.259
 natural hair growth is always 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:21.859
 lends volume and it came to us from 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.359
 business etiquette when a man is a woman 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:26.859
 on the contrary, you need to emphasize your 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:29.689
 status its age 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.789
 but for everyday life for 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.450
 most cases if for you 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:39.020
 relevant to remove age and look like 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.729
 can be more younger then precisely this mistake 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.969
 should be avoided with utmost care 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.280
 and our second mistake is 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.009
 excess volume excess volume never 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.460
 will betray you never make you 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.329
 younger 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.799
 I think that many of our mothers grandmothers 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:02:00.830
 went through chemistry went through hair curlers and 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.960
 too strong stereotype is complicated in 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.930
 societyâ€™s brains about this 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.470
 excess volume it may be a habit 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.040
 but will it give youth no matter how 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.290
 if you are a woman who prefers there 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.240
 excessive volume but want it 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 look younger try once 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.980
 make a haircut not fruit laying 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.930
 curlers but under natural growth and me 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.000
 I am sure that you will be told that you have become 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.370
 look younger 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.830
 error number three is the composition of those who do not 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.960
 matching color a little bit about color 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.000
 but actually make a mistake of color 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.410
 simple enough especially if you paint 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.200
 use dye at home 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.630
 it's worth not getting into your color type and you 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.880
 will look in one case either 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.880
 skin will look sore too 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.120
 the red case will be another face 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.850
 we put some earthy like that 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.520
 unnecessary therefore it often happens that not 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.980
 hit the color all at once plus 10 years 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.200
 want to look younger and choose 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.410
 find the right shades of good 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.989
 colorist not know besides frequent 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.709
 a mistake in the same point carry it here 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.459
 when a woman herself is painted head 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.920
 mean and at 11 chooses to follow another 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.290
 just removes another color and then such 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.459
 hair bump appears here 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.060
 straight with such lines 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.790
 it is often noticeable if it looks like 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.600
 should kid baby shade should be 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.780
 even beautiful and also here 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.160
 I wanted to make it that color often 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.200
 looks unsaturated dreamed so 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:50.360
 bad well he seemed to be here 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.090
 really like that word for word in 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.310
 Generally when old furniture is this 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.840
 old all here and hair antiques 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.180
 oh my god the hair is like this 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.250
 antiques and it turns out but if you 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.880
 want to look younger then head should 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.660
 be dyed dyed fresh and 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.140
 drink on the right shade 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.030
 next we have it is not suitable such 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.880
 error not suitable form in haircuts 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.299
 there may be many women in a certain 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.979
 aged begin to cut such here 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.789
 hat shaped such here are the forms 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.710
 some shorter here still pistils 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:32.060
 here the cap is the volume here again smaller 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.330
 bangs and women of a certain age 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.729
 they are up to a certain up to a certain age 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.400
 old age sometimes even keep it up 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.169
 do and we have the strongest society 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.300
 stereotype has developed regarding these 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.849
 haircut of these forms because we see them 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.419
 as determined by age in women 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.160
 and if you are just watching me now 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.289
 certain age a woman you have 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.539
 such a haircut you just think about 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.729
 tom to look younger 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.729
 not my advice try to move away from this 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.680
 forms just change it make 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.450
 some kind could not be for myself 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.950
 the solution first at first is 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.140
 may be unusual but then quickly 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.030
 get used it can be very cool 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.710
 it can be a new and your new your 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.220
 this is such a very , very often I 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.910
 habits mistake this here such 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.960
 forms 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.700
 not relevant but it is such a silent mistake 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.150
 which no one would think if 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.960
 about the color we see immediately that it's not about 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.919
 think but but still it remains 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:44.060
 so if you have any 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:47.380
 questions write them in the comments and if 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.380
 say goodbye to all bye
