actual bed chair that's handy on a

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
number of fronts so it makes it a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.090 
number of fronts so it makes it a
complete<00:01:04.430> system<00:01:05.470> having<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.619> fact<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:06.920> it

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
complete system having the fact that it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.739 
complete system having the fact that it
is<00:01:07.159> Ipsen<00:01:07.610> means<00:01:07.880> that<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.270> know<00:01:08.390> if<00:01:08.539> you're

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
is Ipsen means that you know if you're

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:09.849 
is Ipsen means that you know if you're
in<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.960> middle<00:01:09.109> of<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.259> night<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:09.710> have

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859 
in the middle of the night and you have

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.230 
in the middle of the night and you have
to<00:01:09.979> crash<00:01:10.189> out<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.520> bag<00:01:10.700> because<00:01:10.969> you've<00:01:11.119> got

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
to crash out the bag because you've got

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.149 
to crash out the bag because you've got
a<00:01:11.270> fish<00:01:11.509> on<00:01:11.689> you're<00:01:12.560> not<00:01:12.679> going<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:12.859> have<00:01:13.009> the

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
a fish on you're not going to have the

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.800 
a fish on you're not going to have the
bag<00:01:13.310> following<00:01:13.789> you<00:01:13.880> out<00:01:14.060> into<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.359> wet<00:01:14.600> or<00:01:14.780> a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
bag following you out into the wet or a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.340 
bag following you out into the wet or a
muck<00:01:15.049> it'll<00:01:15.380> stay<00:01:15.560> on<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.799> bed<00:01:15.950> chair<00:01:16.189> itself

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
muck it'll stay on the bed chair itself

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.590 
muck it'll stay on the bed chair itself
the<00:01:18.350> actual<00:01:18.859> material<00:01:19.639> is<00:01:19.759> you<00:01:20.329> know<00:01:20.450> that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
the actual material is you know that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.139 
the actual material is you know that
shower<00:01:20.929> proof<00:01:21.229> material<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:23.119> way

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
shower proof material and the way

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.730 
shower proof material and the way
they've<00:01:23.539> implemented<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.200> system<00:01:24.560> is

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
they've implemented the system is

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.099 
they've implemented the system is
they've<00:01:25.369> gone<00:01:26.210> for<00:01:26.389> a<00:01:26.450> dual<00:01:26.689> layer<00:01:26.810> system

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
they've gone for a dual layer system

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.649 
they've gone for a dual layer system
most<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.399> technology<00:01:28.909> now<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.149> dual<00:01:29.479> layer

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
most of the technology now is dual layer

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.809 
most of the technology now is dual layer
because<00:01:30.499> the<00:01:31.100> more<00:01:31.280> layers<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.609> have

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
because the more layers you have

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.969 
because the more layers you have
especially<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.270> come<00:01:32.509> winter<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.139> keeps<00:01:33.799> him

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
especially you come winter it keeps him

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.800 
especially you come winter it keeps him
at<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.340> heat<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:34.700> retains<00:01:35.389> the<00:01:35.509> heat<00:01:35.539> better

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
at the heat and retains the heat better

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.870 
at the heat and retains the heat better
so<00:01:36.649> basically<00:01:36.979> what<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.219> can<00:01:37.249> do<00:01:37.459> is<00:01:37.579> it<00:01:37.700> come

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
so basically what you can do is it come

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.910 
so basically what you can do is it come
summertime<00:01:38.359> you<00:01:38.630> can<00:01:38.840> actually<00:01:39.170> just<00:01:39.709> get

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
summertime you can actually just get

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.889 
summertime you can actually just get
into<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.399> first<00:01:40.609> layer<00:01:40.969> and<00:01:41.209> that<00:01:41.659> will<00:01:41.780> keep

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
into the first layer and that will keep

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.050 
into the first layer and that will keep
you<00:01:42.109> nice<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.289> comfy<00:01:43.039> without<00:01:43.670> overheating

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
you nice and comfy without overheating

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.359 
you nice and comfy without overheating
you<00:01:44.420> come<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.929> wintertime<00:01:45.469> where<00:01:45.889> it<00:01:46.009> gets<00:01:46.159> you

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
you come to wintertime where it gets you

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.969 
you come to wintertime where it gets you
know<00:01:46.459> bit<00:01:46.670> cooler<00:01:47.029> it<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.409> know<00:01:48.529> you<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.709> move

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
know bit cooler it you know you can move

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.359 
know bit cooler it you know you can move
into<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:50.420> underneath<00:01:50.990> layer<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.499> keep<00:01:52.249> the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
into the underneath layer and keep the

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.219 
into the underneath layer and keep the
two<00:01:52.549> layers<00:01:52.759> on<00:01:52.969> top<00:01:53.209> which<00:01:53.389> will<00:01:53.539> as<00:01:53.719> I<00:01:53.990> say

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
two layers on top which will as I say

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.550 
two layers on top which will as I say
keep<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.740> temperature<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.389> nice<00:01:56.389> even<00:01:56.990> level

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
keep the temperature a nice even level

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.469 
keep the temperature a nice even level
