on<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.560> I'd<00:01:14.100> known<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.210> old

on if I'd known then what I know now old

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.030 
on if I'd known then what I know now old
have<00:01:15.960> approached<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.860> slightly

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
have approached it in a slightly

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
have approached it in a slightly
different<00:01:17.340> way<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.049> probably<00:01:19.049> would<00:01:19.200> have

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
different way but probably would have

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.289 
different way but probably would have
done<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.470> same<00:01:19.590> thing<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.250> mean<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.060> was<00:01:21.180> in

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
done the same thing I mean I was in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.530 
done the same thing I mean I was in

I<00:01:37.530> brought<00:01:38.280> my<00:01:39.350> engineering<00:01:40.610> sort<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.700> making

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
I brought my engineering sort of making

I brought my engineering sort of making
things<00:01:42.329> experience<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.790> we<00:01:44.790> blended<00:01:45.329> blindly

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
things experience and we blended blindly

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
on and Joe's racing connections got us a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
on and Joe's racing connections got us a
fair<00:01:52.770> bit<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> work<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.490> would<00:01:53.820> guess<00:01:54.119> probably

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
fair bit of work I would guess probably

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.889 
fair bit of work I would guess probably
about<00:01:55.200> 50%<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> frames<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.659> pros

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
about 50% of the frames that the pros

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.190 
about 50% of the frames that the pros
were<00:01:58.170> riding<00:01:58.590> we'd<00:01:59.369> made<00:01:59.610> no<00:02:00.600> matter<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.049> was

three very good builders split the work
into<00:02:11.610> three<00:02:11.910> sections<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.890> these<00:02:14.099> guys<00:02:14.430> were

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
into three sections and these guys were

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.630 
into three sections and these guys were
spot-on<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.290> they<00:02:16.410> were<00:02:16.500> really<00:02:16.860> good<00:02:17.069> and

spot-on and they were really good and
their<00:02:17.910> target<00:02:18.420> was<00:02:18.510> 15<00:02:18.900> frames<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.410> week<00:02:19.560> old

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.590 
seeing in the frame building world it
takes<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.950> good<00:02:23.160> man<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.610> good<00:02:23.850> day<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> build<00:02:24.480> a

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
I'd known then what I know now probably

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.960 
I'd known then what I know now probably
be<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> millionaire<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.660> then<00:02:54.900> eventually

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
be a millionaire and then eventually

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.789 
be a millionaire and then eventually
probably<00:02:56.970> about<00:02:57.269> ten<00:02:57.630> years<00:02:57.810> ago<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.319> started

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
probably about ten years ago it started

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.940 
probably about ten years ago it started
getting<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> point<00:02:59.549> where<00:02:59.730> all<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:01.110> stuff

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
getting to the point where all the stuff

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.850 
getting to the point where all the stuff
from<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.280> Far<00:03:02.549> East<00:03:02.819> was<00:03:03.450> coming<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.080> for

from the Far East was coming in for
fourpence<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:07.380> couldn't<00:03:07.650> compete<00:03:08.060> people

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
fourpence and we couldn't compete people

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.060 
fourpence and we couldn't compete people

were buying aluminium frames aluminium
is<00:03:11.220> light<00:03:11.660> wrong<00:03:12.660> but<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:14.010> was<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
is light wrong but that was the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.420 
is light wrong but that was the
perception<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.260> our<00:03:16.260> market<00:03:16.859> just<00:03:16.980> went<00:03:17.220> down

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
perception and our market just went down

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.810 
perception and our market just went down
and<00:03:17.640> down<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.820> down<00:03:19.579> eventually<00:03:20.579> we'll<00:03:20.730> have

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
and down and down eventually we'll have

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.759 
and down and down eventually we'll have
to<00:03:20.940> close<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.359> factory<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.350> that's<00:03:22.590> when<00:03:22.739> I

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
to close the factory and that's when I

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.400 
to close the factory and that's when I
sat<00:03:23.040> up<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:23.430> based<00:03:24.359> on<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.690> premise<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.079> if

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
sat up here based on the premise that if

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.039 
sat up here based on the premise that if
I<00:03:25.500> was<00:03:25.680> only<00:03:25.920> working<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.549> my<00:03:26.700> own<00:03:27.049> with

I was only working on my own with

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.310 
I was only working on my own with
limited<00:03:28.920> overheads<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.940> could<00:03:30.540> probably<00:03:30.780> you

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
limited overheads I could probably you

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.140 
limited overheads I could probably you
know<00:03:31.410> still<00:03:31.709> make<00:03:31.859> a<00:03:31.890> living<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.459> which<00:03:33.000> has

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
know still make a living on it which has

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.229 
know still make a living on it which has
proved<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.540> case<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:35.100> running<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.700> courses

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
proved the case and running the courses

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.530 
proved the case and running the courses
I'm<00:03:37.400> continually<00:03:38.400> astonished<00:03:39.060> by<00:03:39.480> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
I'm continually astonished by the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.890 
I'm continually astonished by the
popularity<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.799> courses<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.519> thought<00:03:42.180> it

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
popularity of the courses I thought it

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.240 
popularity of the courses I thought it
might<00:03:43.170> work<00:03:43.470> for<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.859> bit

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
might work for a bit

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.039 
might work for a bit
I<00:03:44.280> haven't<00:03:44.850> had<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.540> don't<00:03:45.750> think<00:03:45.870> I've<00:03:45.959> had

I haven't had I don't think I've had
anybody<00:03:46.319> on<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.769> course<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.310> hasn't<00:03:47.459> loved

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
anybody on the course that hasn't loved

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.990 
anybody on the course that hasn't loved
it<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.900> gone<00:03:49.799> away<00:03:50.040> at<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> end<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.880> his

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
it and gone away at the end with his

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.490 
it and gone away at the end with his
frame<00:03:51.299> and<00:03:51.569> with<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.470> mandatory<00:03:52.920> big<00:03:53.400> grin

frame and with the mandatory big grin

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.349 
frame and with the mandatory big grin
fascinating<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.650> love<00:03:55.920> it

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
fascinating I love it

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.910 
fascinating I love it
there<00:03:57.359> are<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.540> number<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.959> frame<00:03:58.319> builders<00:03:58.739> who

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
there are a number of frame builders who

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.910 
there are a number of frame builders who
build<00:03:59.190> very<00:03:59.459> good<00:03:59.730> frames<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:01.079> haven't

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
build very good frames but haven't

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.520 
build very good frames but haven't
necessarily<00:04:01.980> got<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:03.180> huge<00:04:04.139> amount<00:04:04.290> of

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
necessarily got a huge amount of

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.440 
necessarily got a huge amount of
experience<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.370> actually<00:04:05.670> riding<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.180> things

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
experience of actually riding the things

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.900 
experience of actually riding the things
and<00:04:07.109> I<00:04:07.590> think<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.980> brings<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.459> lot<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.670> the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
and I think that brings a lot to the

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.470 
and I think that brings a lot to the
table<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.600> think<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.730> what<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.269> like<00:04:12.330> to

across here into the workshop and just
making<00:06:07.820> things<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:08.330> if<00:06:09.289> I<00:06:09.830> didn't<00:06:10.130> have<00:06:10.190> to

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.770 
that I would still come across here and
play<00:06:15.830> with<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:16.070> machines<00:06:16.270> and<00:06:17.270> just<00:06:17.509> just

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
play with the machines and just just

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.550 
play with the machines and just just
make<00:06:17.960> things<00:06:18.289> you<00:06:18.620> know<00:06:19.219> me<00:06:20.120> knives<00:06:20.570> the

sticks I just get a great deal of

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.119 
sticks I just get a great deal of
satisfaction<00:06:23.750> out<00:06:24.440> there<00:06:24.620> out<00:06:24.770> of

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:40.429 
think is this adequate is it good if

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:41.949 
think is this adequate is it good if
it's<00:06:40.639> good<00:06:40.909> fine

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
it's good fine
