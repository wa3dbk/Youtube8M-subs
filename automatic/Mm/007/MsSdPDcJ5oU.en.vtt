to<00:03:20.680> resolve<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.220> reconcile<00:03:21.849> whatever<00:03:22.630> it<00:03:22.750> is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
to resolve and reconcile whatever it is

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.059 
to resolve and reconcile whatever it is
that<00:03:23.139> is<00:03:23.319> being<00:03:23.380> brought<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.799> our<00:03:23.950> attention

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
that is being brought to our attention

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.819 
that is being brought to our attention
in<00:03:24.579> that<00:03:24.730> moment<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:25.630> certainly<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.049> feel<00:03:26.290> I

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
in that moment so certainly I feel I

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.120 
in that moment so certainly I feel I
feel<00:03:27.609> those<00:03:27.760> things<00:03:28.000> maybe<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.389> feel<00:03:28.569> them<00:03:28.720> less

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
feel those things maybe I feel them less

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.339 
feel those things maybe I feel them less
it<00:03:30.130> takes<00:03:30.340> quite<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.609> bit<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.870> when<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.109> say<00:03:32.290> you

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
it takes quite a bit so when you say you

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.530 
it takes quite a bit so when you say you
feel<00:03:32.620> them<00:03:32.769> less<00:03:32.980> can<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.489> give<00:03:33.880> some<00:03:33.910> sort<00:03:34.419> of

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
feel them less can you give some sort of

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.440 
feel them less can you give some sort of
a<00:03:35.130> before<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.430> after<00:03:36.549> example<00:03:37.150> because<00:03:37.329> at

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
the end of the day it's one thing

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.190 
the end of the day it's one thing
sharing<00:03:39.669> with<00:03:39.760> people<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.180> information<00:03:40.989> you

sharing with people this information you

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.199 
sharing with people this information you
know<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.829> lot<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.040> us<00:03:42.250> out<00:03:42.549> there<00:03:42.579> are<00:03:42.910> going

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
know and a lot of us out there are going

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.720 
know and a lot of us out there are going
but<00:03:43.599> you<00:03:43.690> know<00:03:43.810> I'm<00:03:44.019> still<00:03:44.349> doing<00:03:44.769> this

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
but you know I'm still doing this

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.759 
but you know I'm still doing this
behavior<00:03:46.389> or<00:03:46.569> I'm<00:03:46.720> still<00:03:47.049> doing<00:03:47.380> this<00:03:47.530> or

behavior or I'm still doing this or

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.759 
behavior or I'm still doing this or
something's<00:03:48.220> not<00:03:48.370> working<00:03:48.430> or<00:03:49.090> sure<00:03:49.989> I've

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
something's not working or sure I've

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.559 
something's not working or sure I've
never<00:03:51.010> been<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> person<00:03:52.000> with<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> lot<00:03:52.299> of<00:03:52.329> anger

never been a person with a lot of anger

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.120 
never been a person with a lot of anger
so<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:52.900> may<00:03:53.109> not<00:03:53.230> be<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.470> best<00:03:53.590> person<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:53.980> ask

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
so I may not be the best person to ask

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.780 
so I may not be the best person to ask
that<00:03:54.430> question<00:03:54.910> of<00:03:56.010> what<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.069> will<00:03:57.310> say<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.639> this

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
that question of what I will say is this

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.580 
that question of what I will say is this
there<00:03:58.030> are<00:03:58.150> techniques<00:03:58.629> they've<00:03:59.410> been

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
and and the flip side works as well the

of healing to feel the things as if

of healing to feel the things as if
they've<00:05:12.080> already<00:05:12.289> happened<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:13.729> feel<00:05:14.000> the

happened and in that way we are giving
this<00:05:21.770> field<00:05:22.099> something<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:22.639> work<00:05:22.789> with<00:05:22.819> so<00:05:23.270> it

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
this field something to work with so it

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.080 
this field something to work with so it
can<00:05:23.569> it<00:05:23.810> can<00:05:23.870> mirror<00:05:24.349> that<00:05:25.250> back<00:05:25.610> and<00:05:25.819> in<00:05:26.000> the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
can it can mirror that back and in the

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.390 
can it can mirror that back and in the
quantum<00:05:26.509> world<00:05:26.719> and<00:05:27.139> there<00:05:27.770> are<00:05:27.800> all<00:05:27.949> kinds<00:05:27.979> of

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
quantum world and there are all kinds of

quantum world and there are all kinds of
self-help<00:05:28.879> everyone<00:05:29.659> learns<00:05:29.840> differently<00:05:30.259> so

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
self-help everyone learns differently so

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.589 
self-help everyone learns differently so
what<00:05:30.740> works<00:05:31.009> for<00:05:31.219> my<00:05:31.340> anger<00:05:31.699> and<00:05:31.909> your<00:05:32.270> anger

what works for my anger and your anger

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.149 
what works for my anger and your anger
someone<00:05:32.930> else's<00:05:33.229> may<00:05:33.349> not<00:05:33.680> be<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:33.949> same<00:05:34.129> thing

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
someone else's may not be the same thing

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:38.140 
someone else's may not be the same thing
but<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.669> key<00:05:34.849> is<00:05:35.719> to<00:05:35.960> honor<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:37.610> language<00:05:38.000> of

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
but the key is to honor the language of

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.740 
but the key is to honor the language of
human<00:05:38.599> emotion<00:05:38.960> in<00:05:39.080> our<00:05:39.169> hearts<00:05:39.529> and<00:05:40.750> right

human emotion in our hearts and right

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.390 
human emotion in our hearts and right
and<00:05:42.289> come<00:05:42.560> back<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:42.860> last<00:05:43.039> part<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.339> that

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
and come back to the last part of that

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.950 
and come back to the last part of that
program<00:05:43.969> and<00:05:44.120> when<00:05:44.240> we<00:05:44.330> come<00:05:44.509> back<00:05:44.659> I'd<00:05:44.810> also

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
program and when we come back I'd also

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.839 
program and when we come back I'd also
like<00:05:45.319> to<00:05:45.589> talk<00:05:46.129> about<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.520> power<00:05:46.759> of

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
like to talk about the power of

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:47.559 
like to talk about the power of
forgiveness

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
forgiveness

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.139 
forgiveness
sure
