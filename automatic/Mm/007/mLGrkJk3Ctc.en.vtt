00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
anything in it but it might be a good

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.520 
anything in it but it might be a good
idea<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.480> to<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.050> bare<00:01:43.260> fingers

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.370 
idea not to do with your bare fingers
like<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.980> just<00:01:44.040> did<00:01:44.390> because<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.420> probably<00:01:45.990> cut

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
like I just did because you probably cut

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.650 
like I just did because you probably cut
yourself<00:01:46.800> if<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.160> is<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.420> yeah<00:01:49.160> now<00:01:53.630> put<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
yourself if there is so yeah now put it

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.719 
yourself if there is so yeah now put it
back<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.500> obviously<00:01:56.160> just<00:01:56.370> want<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> make

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
back on you obviously just want to make

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.730 
back on you obviously just want to make
sure<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.360> you're<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> right

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sure that you're going in the right

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.400 
sure that you're going in the right
direction<00:02:00.320> sometimes<00:02:01.320> our<00:02:01.590> directional

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
direction sometimes our directional

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.620 
direction sometimes our directional
there's<00:02:04.410> a<00:02:04.500> very<00:02:04.740> faint<00:02:05.220> arrow<00:02:05.550> on<00:02:06.000> these<00:02:06.240> ones

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
there's a very faint arrow on these ones

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.690 
there's a very faint arrow on these ones
but<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.830> know<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.160> supposed<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.429> be<00:02:08.520> going

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
but I know it's supposed to be going

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.750 
but I know it's supposed to be going
that<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> let's<00:02:11.670> put<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.870> halfway<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:16.760> so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that way so let's put this halfway on so

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.199 
that way so let's put this halfway on so
it<00:02:17.880> matches<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.300> front<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.050> put<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.350> label

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
it matches the front and put this label

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:29.680 
it matches the front and put this label
above<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.630> hole

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.220 

all<00:02:30.690> right<00:02:31.400> take<00:02:32.400> your<00:02:32.460> inner<00:02:32.790> tube<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:34.050> put<00:02:34.200> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
all right take your inner tube and put a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.340 
all right take your inner tube and put a
little<00:02:34.440> bit<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.680> air<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.960> give<00:02:37.200> it

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
little bit of air in it just to give it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.320 
little bit of air in it just to give it
shape<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.950> enough<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.460> actually<00:02:39.210> do<00:02:39.720> anything

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.050 

thread<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.360> through<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.780> hole<00:02:49.880> I'll<00:02:50.880> just

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
thread it through the hole I'll just

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:04.150 
thread it through the hole I'll just
touch<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.840> tube<00:02:52.110> in

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.820 

start<00:03:05.160> back<00:03:05.400> right<00:03:05.640> here<00:03:06.560> worked<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.770> a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
start back right here worked it in a
