00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hey hi to all this best of is in 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.790
 this video i'm going to show you how 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.660
 plug in your macbook pro macbook air 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.940
 or imac 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.350
 as can be seen here at a 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:22.279
 screen so you need this cable so 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:29.750
 which is a female dvi adapter channel 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:34.380
 until noon sports so those who have a 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 imac macbook pro macbook air after 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.040
 2011 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 after 2010 so from 2011 to 2012 the 2013 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.980
 there will be more display port like 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.559
 these will be a thunderbolt 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.489
 so there is no difference in fact 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.129
 you can plug a minidisk 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.180
 the es11 thunderbolt so we end up 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.410
 right now for me to show you 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.439
 how to do 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:10.890
 so here is first of all you 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:17.189
 have plugged so the cable so the one 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:21.540
 this to your imac in the little harbor here 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.130
 a plan very well and then they had 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.150
 plugged 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:32.520
 the second outing like these dvi 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:37.430
 wrong of your screen so you have that at 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.430
 fuck in and a high school 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.869
 once this is done i'm going to turn on 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.560
 a second screen and you can see 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.970
 that my mac is on it then so 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.310
 you're not going to be like that I'm going 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.759
 explain why 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:11.030
 in fact you are going to be like this 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:12.709
 do not move that's nickel so you're fine 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.620
 happen like this you're going to be 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.560

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.450
 macbook pro or a macbook air 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.790

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.840

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.830
 it's going in preferences 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.940

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:45.110

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.389
 apply it and drag it on the 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.400
