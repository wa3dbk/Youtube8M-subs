00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello how are you spring florets 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.540
 we had a long time is to do something 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.300
 rich to eat so today I bring you a 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.219
 recipe that is great to make 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.769
 chocolate sponge cake in the microwave 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.900
 I love this recipe because it takes 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.880
 in doing two and a half minutes and it serves 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.680
 to do for two people is going to be a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.680
 super short video so let's go 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.510
 directly to see how the mess is made 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.330
 let's put in a bowl 21 ounces of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.990
 chocolate that are like 50 grams and 4 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.990
 tablespoons of milk 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.020
 and this will keep the 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.239
 microwave for a few seconds to 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.790
 average power so that we do not burn 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.390
 we remove it to integrate well the milk 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.390
 and the Chocolate 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.530
 Now let's add 4 or 5 tablespoons of 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.640
 sugar that I leave to your liking and 4 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.640
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.130
 we add an egg 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.130
 and we move everything very well 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.770
 now we put 5 tablespoons of flour 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.770
 cake shop 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.720
 and we mix it all up again and I 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.220
 like to add a little essence of 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.560
 Vanilla Ranks for the last time 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.410
 and I 'm going to pass the machine mixer 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.060
 of 9 centimeters in diameter and 4.5 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.710
 centimeters tall for you to do 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.240
 an idea and this we are going to put in the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.460
 microwave for two and a half minutes 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.590
 approximately and I recommend you 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.060
 appears every 30 seconds or so 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.080
 time may vary a bit depending 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.090
 of your microwave 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.830
 I recommend that you let them cool down but 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.260
 As I am very impatient, I am going to 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.260
 decorate with cream a slice is express 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.020
 and chocolate chips if they leave it 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.830
 cool will happen to me and the cream 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.630
 the work opens 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.630
 that's so good 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.900
 and a little bit 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.790
 you can sprinkle sugar on top 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.270
 to accompany it with some ice cream 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.160
 vanilla or whatever you like and this has 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.319
 been all in today's video I hope that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.880

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.709

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.660
