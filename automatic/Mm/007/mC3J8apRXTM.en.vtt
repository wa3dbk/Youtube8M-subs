00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello girls maybe boys 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.610
 so today I will offer you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.719
 the smart basket of the control room me then 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.190
 why not what we see full of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.929
 messages ask me where is what is 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.309
 I take for this May 6th room to all that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.570
 I will give you a few 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.180
 stuff that I buy month since I 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.340
 lost my 35 kg and that actually mixes with 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.230
 everyday to better manage in any case 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.849
 find small shortcuts for better 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.779
 managing the situation is in any case better 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.550
 manage from day to day 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.900
 so I'll start to go pretty 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.750
 quickly so that it lasts too long 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.220
 I like the sauce Benedicta nature and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.330
 light then the ideal in absolute 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.190
 it's making your own sauce 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.660
 but from time to time troubleshooting when 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.010
 we have laziness or this one is not 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 very fat and you will see there a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750
 texture a little bit see white know 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.000
 not if you see that did not go a 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.820
 little empty there so it's not quite 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
 full then after you have I do not know 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.090
 not if you know the vinegar 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.840
 balsamic then there is a reduction 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.370
 balsamic 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 so it's a sauce that's a bit 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.120
 thicker then there is no grade 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.890
 in but it is to scent the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.929
 crudités it's really exceptional me 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.640
 I love it and yamal who makes it but 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.170
 this brand is not necessarily bad 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 but I will put you references in 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 detail below and it also exists in 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.570
 white there is white balsamic vinegar 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.220
 we do not know but there is also 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 the reduction of white balsamic 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 there they call it a white cream 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.500
 so it's very very nice to taste 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.880
 because even on fruit salads 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.380
 it's good raw vegetables you go 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.210
 treat after I will offer you 8 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.770
 in spray form why because 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 the purpose it is not to suppress the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.100
 fat but it is to learn 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.500
 to reduce them and maybe 60 of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 haze or that loan that will help you that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.329
 will help at all to limit 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.759
 quantities 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.710
 so that's a nut-based oil 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.820
 but there are others and do not hesitate 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.829
 to vary because they have 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.659
 different properties and that's great 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.799
 even in one thing an egret if you 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.840
 do it yourself you are you 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.189
 put sauces a difference 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.780
 extraordinary 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.030
 after I also like the sauce for 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 do not like that I use I love the salad 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.770
 green of the shallot of the tone and I put that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.509
 I love then suzi wan does this 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.880
 sauce but you can also find it 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.000
 at Chinese caterers who you 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.969
 proposes this sauce have 30 the same 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.280
 then you have this sauce a little 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.690
 darker soy based that exist 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.760
 a little sweeter a little further east 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.650
 not bad as I find it perfect it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.120
 gives taste and the goal is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.680
 find pleasure in having more than 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 taste you have more something is 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.689
 good the less we eat so it is necessary that 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.280
 our taste buds is actually after I'm going 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.870
 offer you that I find very well 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.510
 it's hemp seeds 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.220
 so I wanted some saas tickets with 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.799
 seed of room this one they are 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.720
 bio is very protein and then that 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.980
 can also serve when you do not want but 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.629
 too much oil because it's still 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.730
 a seed so obligatorily it is a 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.769
 little fat but it's very very healthy for 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.769
 health and I propose you in puts 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.569
 and go to perfume your salads had 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.560
 after you have then at the level of 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.450
 cans 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.010
 there are plenty of boxes the corn the tuna at 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.650
 natural try to take things 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.480
 that you can transform prepare me 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.579
 I like the chorus baskets ones 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.109
 here's the giant green brand at thoune on 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.720
 do not like but I think it's not 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.359
 badly in a while me it's quiet after 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.470
 I small vessels that makes 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.200
 grilled mackerel fillets 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.639
 so it's extraordinary accompanied 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.450
 a salad that can be with 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.400
 potatoes 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.319
 it's up to you to see how you like 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.760
 you have a macro obviously but of 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.680
 it's a lot less fat and 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.819
 then you know that as soon as a fish 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.569
 smaller already there is less 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.859
 pesticides 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.260
 and then next you have plenty of omega 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.000
 lots of good things as soon as you attack 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.150
 fatty fish 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.530
 I also propose to you I am you 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.359
 know for portioned I tell you about it 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.829
 always on facebook I think that more 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.720
 we take small quantities ben me 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.930
 it saves us from showing too much 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.099
 consume that's chorizo Unit 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.199
 that we can buy in this form 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.599
 So you decide to take 5 10 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.030
 15 - you will not exceed the quota 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.190
 buy and then you will not eat the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.479
 big worries are 250 grams and you 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.790
 will still please because it's 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.549
 always nice to have fun then 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.750
 in the sweet game is enough for them 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.659
 drinks to scent drinks 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.729
 cells that orange carrot lemon then 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.159
 I do not know if you see it's more 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:04.139
 orange and so that's something that 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.609
 is very pleasant very refreshing who 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.260
 costs a little bit good there is a small 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.040
 few calories it's obvious but it's 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.720
 very pleasant 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.889
 so we do not find everywhere if you 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.849
 go behind my daughter it's dead 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.250
 because the being as soon as she sends 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.900
 dropped bottles so sorry but 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.699
 it's very very nice it exists too 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.139
 more than lemons do not hesitate there is 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.000
 different perfumes but that one 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.580
 especially good 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.960
 the sugar I am rather for 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.300
 sugar cane bio because 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.039
 in fact the success follows not so much 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.150
 for sweeteners fake sugar 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.160
 because the goal of the game is to eat 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.630
 healthy beyond weight loss do not think 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.479
 not only lose weight lose weight 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.389
 eat healthy and you'll see a day 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.789
 your health will make you well then 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.289
 to sweeten ya around even white cheese 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.889
 fruit salad you have the syrup 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.240
 agave 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.069
 I do not know if you know that 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.199
 looks a bit like being frozen like that 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.150
 it is very natural as sugar 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.430
 inquire on the internet in laces 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.800
 jean hervé who does that but it's I 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.070
 you concede it its sugar well it's 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.830
 very nice that too I love it's a 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.440
 small jar with sugar and spices 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.270
 the base of cinnamon and sugar is 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.650
 very very good it scented you know them 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.900
 cinnamon properties I have you 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.759
 talked on facebook the cinnamon actually 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.580
 it's a little late and anti tale 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.860
 nibbling it's going to be very interesting 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.930
 sometimes and you'll see if we like the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.430
 cinnamon to consume in soupoudré 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.169
 sometimes a little bit in my cheese 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.880
 white coffee with milk or what you 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.819
 want it can really have a 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.240
 election for you to avoid long it 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:32.560
 the pebbles of rice to allow you 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.300
 to make spring rolls with 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.130
 my daughter we put salads and carrots 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.570
 grated cornices of codes and con 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.159
 con corniche years but a lot of things 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.800
 little too fast and we roll is necessary before 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.539
 moisten it so it's extraordinary 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.340
 because you soak it in the sauce 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.479
 what I told you earlier is 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.740
 you will really enjoy yourself 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.680
 go make yourself rolls of 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.229
 magic spring and sugar and me 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.120
 I love this brand is the little ones 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.500
 sandblasted michel and augustin this 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.909
 mark there I love it either in 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.740
 yogurts or what they offer 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.380
 because it's conservative without 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.599
 dye it's really very natural to 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.650
 the end is not so energetic it if 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.969
 calories that they have am really 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.130
 pleasure what I like in this genre 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.500
 packing is that when you open 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.630
 you have two little bags like that 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.400
 and three mini cakes and even if you 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.440
 have a stroke of madness and you finish 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.300
 touba you will only eat that and it will be 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.919
 not the 24 cake in your pack 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.789
 usual or 12 pack cake 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.620
 usual 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.750
 in addition it's very good it seems to me a 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.520
 brand that does healthy things and me 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.050
 Michel and Augustin I did not want 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.529
 the action but I advise you view and 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.419
 to finish 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:34.339
 in nizar and gym the cheesecake 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.839
 white this love with two strokes 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:37.909
 different you have m'engouffrer 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.799
 redness I love it because it's me 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.269
 found with a latte 

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:43.189
 taste the breakfast for you to choose 

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:44.749
 but in any case it's not bad to taste if 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:47.509
 you do not know but I believe that the 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:49.249
 extra great solution that ultimately goes 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.719
 allow us to stop eating it's 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:52.819
 there brush your teeth stole your 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.349
 toothbrush toothpaste and then you 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.029
 brush your teeth and after I believe that 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.309
 you will not want to eat anything 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.899

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:04.069
 to grow in the end I make you full of 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:05.359

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.949
