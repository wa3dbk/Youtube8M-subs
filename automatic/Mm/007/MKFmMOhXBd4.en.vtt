00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 this electrolux is a lt c12 I got the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.210
 I really like every once in a while to get this 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.300
 type of problem 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.429
 to electrolux or the customer when 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.400
 I went to visit and complained that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.770
 machine not centrifuged do not wash 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.900
 I turned the machine on. The panel comes on. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.090
 luizinho when it was to get in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.390
 water would enter the machine when 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.160
 moment that was to enter the agitation 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.630
 that the machine made a motorcycle noise 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.230
 trying to work good and I shaker 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.649
 I not take stirring and advanced to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 centrifugation mode and daughter-in-law 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.750
 in this disclosure once again an engine 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 make noise online do not spin 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.340
 I downloaded the machine down I started to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.739
 make a diagnosis of the problem 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.930
 one thing i did was let go that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.379
 I was stuck mechanically so I took the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.260
 strap off in that mail I took her there 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.659
 out and I turned this policy around with the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.490
 hand and politics some ease by a 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.770
 side to the other or not 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.460
 presenting any type of problem of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.110
 securing the mechanical part will escape the shaft 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.970
 the engine was locked 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.729
 that the machine tried to connect judged 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.619
 energy to make him snore and not 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.780
 get guns by hand in time 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.439
 he was mechanically locked 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.659
 only a problem in taking too much 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.369
 Attention what happened to this machine 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.579
 here this machine worked had a 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.210
 leakage of water through the 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:54.420
 transmission through the last column tried 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:57.540
 Bearing fell here in this revelry water 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.460
 belt and is taken to the engine and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.860
 splashing inside the engine 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.869
 it ended up causing the bearing burning 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.390
 the engine and the burner caused the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.840
 the main motor and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.900
 bearing of the axle here of the engine 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.870
 wow rusted bearing ie 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.709
 damaged the winding and the bearing of the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.769
 motor 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.239
 you pay close attention because when I 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.300
 I went to see the machine was stopped a while 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.370
 it was all dry below that I had 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.670
 vestige had dripping water 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.680
 but if you notice that you have 11 in the brand 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.790
 with 11 ships on a white post of 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 dried water caught the eye of seeing 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.230
 this professional machine put a motor 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.360
 of protest here and with the machine started 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.660
 started to leak water through the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.549
 down here and there by the hand and if you 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.799
 in addition to changing the engine or 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.349
 repair it is necessary to make the 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.849
 mechanics of this brand colt tutors the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:04.530
 change the bearings and do 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:08.110
 it is necessary to change the kit also 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.940
 change the transmission to make the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.720
 transmission or exchange transmission 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.849
 entire 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.640
 ok guys then only an alert 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.829
 when you pick up this machine and the engine 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.600
 is with his problem was not fixed 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.280
 mainly from water that damaged a 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.590
 engine ok 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.980
 A big hug and until the next video 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.980
