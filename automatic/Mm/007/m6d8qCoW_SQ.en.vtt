00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
stuff like that and I'm just not really

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.280 
stuff like that and I'm just not really
into<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:37.979> kind<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.400> stuff<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:39.419> thing<00:04:39.690> last

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
into that kind of stuff this thing last

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.129 
into that kind of stuff this thing last
time<00:04:40.440> i<00:04:40.530> check<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:40.740> out<00:04:40.949> mmm<00:04:41.580> I've<00:04:42.419> got<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> GTECH

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
time i check it out mmm I've got a GTECH

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.659 
time i check it out mmm I've got a GTECH
pro<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.710> it<00:04:44.580> was<00:04:44.729> running<00:04:44.940> for<00:04:45.720> 74<00:04:46.550> to<00:04:47.550> the

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
pro and it was running for 74 to the

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.270 
pro and it was running for 74 to the
wheels<00:04:47.880> mm-hmm<00:04:48.630> at<00:04:49.050> consecutive<00:04:49.530> three<00:04:50.010> times

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
wheels mm-hmm at consecutive three times

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.850 
wheels mm-hmm at consecutive three times
every<00:04:50.580> single<00:04:51.060> time<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.240> ran<00:04:51.479> it<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:51.960> it's<00:04:52.620> got

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
every single time I ran it so it's got

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.719 
every single time I ran it so it's got
some<00:04:53.070> power<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.700> only<00:04:55.190> downside<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.400> car

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
some power the only downside of this car

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.460 
some power the only downside of this car
right<00:04:56.910> now<00:04:56.940> I<00:04:57.120> guess<00:04:57.479> would<00:04:57.750> be<00:04:58.010> the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
right now I guess would be the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
right now I guess would be the
differential<00:05:01.470> I<00:05:01.620> was<00:05:01.950> going<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.130> go<00:05:02.250> ahead<00:05:02.370> and

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
differential I was going to go ahead and

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.159 
differential I was going to go ahead and
will<00:05:02.700> the<00:05:02.820> differential<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.389> satin<00:05:03.810> got<00:05:03.930> around

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
will the differential a satin got around

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.420 
will the differential a satin got around
to<00:05:04.350> doing<00:05:04.650> it<00:05:06.830> unfortunately<00:05:07.830> I<00:05:07.860> can't<00:05:08.100> run<00:05:08.310> it

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
to doing it unfortunately I can't run it

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.219 
to doing it unfortunately I can't run it
right<00:05:08.550> now<00:05:08.790> because<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.180> just<00:05:09.510> put<00:05:09.690> these<00:05:09.780> lexa

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
right now because I just put these lexa

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.340 
right now because I just put these lexa
these<00:05:10.380> vile<00:05:10.800> covers<00:05:11.100> on<00:05:11.220> there<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.870> stock

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
these vile covers on there and the stock

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.110 
these vile covers on there and the stock
wires<00:05:13.620> are<00:05:13.950> not<00:05:14.130> long<00:05:14.310> enough<00:05:14.580> because<00:05:14.880> I<00:05:14.910> have

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
wires are not long enough because I have

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.330 
wires are not long enough because I have
to<00:05:15.360> route<00:05:15.780> them<00:05:15.900> through<00:05:16.110> here<00:05:16.470> so<00:05:17.010> they<00:05:17.160> need

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
to route them through here so they need

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.830 
to route them through here so they need
to<00:05:17.430> go<00:05:17.520> through<00:05:17.699> here<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.210> then<00:05:18.330> around<00:05:18.600> to

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
to go through here and then around to

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.020 
to go through here and then around to
the<00:05:18.930> back<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:19.410> then<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:20.010> know<00:05:20.160> plugin<00:05:20.669> so<00:05:20.940> i'm
