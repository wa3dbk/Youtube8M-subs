00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you the theories of wise some stupid-ass

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.399 
you the theories of wise some stupid-ass
people<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.579> earth<00:01:41.820> believed<00:01:42.570> earth<00:01:43.079> was

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
people in this earth believed earth was

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.490 
people in this earth believed earth was
going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> end<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.670> year<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:46.259> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
going to end this year one of them is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.370 
going to end this year one of them is
the<00:01:46.770> theory<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.220> Planet<00:01:47.670> X<00:01:47.909> Planet<00:01:48.659> X<00:01:48.810> being<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the theory of Planet X Planet X being a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.030 
the theory of Planet X Planet X being a
random<00:01:50.189> planet<00:01:51.020> four<00:01:52.020> times<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.649> size<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
random planet four times the size of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.060 
random planet four times the size of
Earth<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.729> NASA<00:01:54.000> hasn't<00:01:54.570> spotted<00:01:54.810> yet<00:01:55.649> which

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
Earth that NASA hasn't spotted yet which

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.889 
Earth that NASA hasn't spotted yet which
is<00:01:57.890> quite<00:01:58.890> approval<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.240> doesn't<00:02:00.570> exist

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
is quite approval that it doesn't exist

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.039 
is quite approval that it doesn't exist
people<00:02:01.560> say<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.070> planet<00:02:02.340> x<00:02:02.820> was<00:02:03.750> going

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
people say that this planet x was going

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.940 
people say that this planet x was going
to<00:02:04.700> crash<00:02:05.700> into<00:02:05.939> Earth<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.659> all<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.799> us<00:02:07.890> will

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to crash into Earth and all of us will

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.869 
to crash into Earth and all of us will
obviously<00:02:08.459> died<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.629> therefore<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:11.580> end<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
obviously died and therefore the end of

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.910 
obviously died and therefore the end of
Earth<00:02:12.060> what<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.200> stupid

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
Earth what this stupid

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.370 
Earth what this stupid
people<00:02:14.130> don't<00:02:14.310> know<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.760> if<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.720> planet

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
people don't know is that if a planet

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.710 
people don't know is that if a planet
for<00:02:16.709> four<00:02:17.280> times<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.790> size<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.180> Earth<00:02:18.390> for

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
for four times the size of Earth for

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.850 
for four times the size of Earth for
some<00:02:19.040> coming<00:02:20.660> like<00:02:21.660> closer<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.290> Earth<00:02:22.500> we

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
some coming like closer to Earth we

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.720 
some coming like closer to Earth we
would<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.430> able<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:25.730> months

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
would be able to see it like months

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.229 
would be able to see it like months
before<00:02:27.180> impact<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.470> 22nd<00:02:29.130> today<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.610> I

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
before impact is the 22nd today and I

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.600 
before impact is the 22nd today and I
can't<00:02:30.540> see<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.959> skies<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.160> planet<00:02:32.459> eggs

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
can't see in skies so that planet eggs

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.390 
can't see in skies so that planet eggs
can<00:02:32.910> got<00:02:33.540> my<00:02:33.720> asskiss<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.650> hasn't<00:02:35.220> shown<00:02:35.370> up

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
can got my asskiss it hasn't shown up

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.930 
can got my asskiss it hasn't shown up
yet<00:02:35.520> second<00:02:36.480> reason<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:37.200> theory<00:02:37.709> was<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
yet second reason in theory was that the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.729 
yet second reason in theory was that the
Mayan<00:02:39.180> calendar<00:02:39.480> was<00:02:40.110> ending<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:42.290> let<00:02:43.290> me<00:02:43.440> get

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
Mayan calendar was ending and let me get

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.390 
Mayan calendar was ending and let me get
