and so cool feature is if if lava runs
into<00:01:52.680> glow<00:01:53.549> water<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.060> will<00:01:54.689> create<00:01:55.079> glowstone

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
into glow water it will create glowstone

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
way that's the castle mod that I

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.630 
way that's the castle mod that I
reviewed<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:10.830> not<00:04:10.980> it's<00:04:11.160> not<00:04:11.310> gonna<00:04:11.460> be

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
reviewed so it's not it's not gonna be

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.310 
reviewed so it's not it's not gonna be
my<00:04:11.850> like<00:04:12.240> my<00:04:14.090> replacement<00:04:15.090> for<00:04:15.360> Oh<00:04:17.989> for<00:04:18.989> cryin

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
my like my replacement for Oh for cryin

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.870 
my like my replacement for Oh for cryin
out<00:04:19.440> okay<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.010> as<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.310> see<00:04:20.370> there's<00:04:20.700> that

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
out okay and as you can see there's that

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.380 
out okay and as you can see there's that
bubble<00:04:21.299> thing<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:22.650> still<00:04:23.550> can't<00:04:23.790> breathe

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
bubble thing so you still can't breathe

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.150 
bubble thing so you still can't breathe
which<00:04:25.170> totally<00:04:25.680> makes<00:04:25.890> sense<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.940> milk<00:04:28.160> can't

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
which totally makes sense and milk can't

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.130 
which totally makes sense and milk can't
get<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.700> can<00:04:30.180> only<00:04:30.300> gain<00:04:30.510> creative<00:04:30.930> which

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
get it you can only gain creative which

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.740 
get it you can only gain creative which
does<00:04:31.830> stink<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.430> there's<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.450> bucket

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
does stink and there's the bucket

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.620 
does stink and there's the bucket
thingamabob<00:04:34.560> right<00:04:34.860> there<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.510> would<00:04:36.600> be

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
thingamabob right there and it would be

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.620
