00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
because he doesn't have an 8 mil spanner

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.730 
because he doesn't have an 8 mil spanner
with<00:01:52.600> him<00:01:52.690> he<00:01:52.780> can't<00:01:52.990> do<00:01:53.080> anything<00:01:53.259> about<00:01:53.440> it

the direction and stuff and that's a

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.649 
the direction and stuff and that's a
pump<00:02:03.610> site<00:02:03.789> it's<00:02:03.940> been<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.090> nightmare<00:02:04.299> it's

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
pump site it's been a nightmare it's

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.020 
pump site it's been a nightmare it's
been<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.380> know<00:02:05.470> taking<00:02:05.890> 10<00:02:06.190> 15<00:02:06.610> minutes<00:02:06.880> each

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
been you know taking 10 15 minutes each

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.930 
been you know taking 10 15 minutes each
time<00:02:07.270> just<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.630> start<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.940> because

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
time just to start the because

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.970 
time just to start the because
it's<00:02:10.090> wet<00:02:10.239> on<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.570> roads<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.709> thing's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's wet on the roads and that thing's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.550 
it's wet on the roads and that thing's
got<00:02:12.160> loads<00:02:12.579> of<00:02:12.640> compression<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:14.320> have<00:02:14.440> to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
got loads of compression you have to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.310 
got loads of compression you have to
pump<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.130> third<00:02:15.430> gear<00:02:16.200> because<00:02:17.200> it

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
pump it in like third gear because it

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.780 
pump it in like third gear because it
just<00:02:17.470> locks<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.920> rear<00:02:18.070> end<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.760> doesn't

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
just locks the rear end up so it doesn't

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.360 
just locks the rear end up so it doesn't
weigh<00:02:19.150> anything<00:02:19.620> even<00:02:20.620> with<00:02:20.739> your<00:02:20.829> jumping<00:02:21.250> on

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
weigh anything even with your jumping on

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.520 
weigh anything even with your jumping on
it<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.120> pops<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.780> up<00:02:23.040> so

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it it just it just pops it up so

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.950 
it it just it just pops it up so
so<00:02:26.040> yeah<00:02:26.160> that's<00:02:26.340> been<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.520> nightmare<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.330> my

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
so yeah that's been a nightmare but my

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.390 
so yeah that's been a nightmare but my
bikes<00:02:28.230> been<00:02:28.590> absolutely<00:02:28.920> beautiful

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
bikes been absolutely beautiful

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.340 
distances well I know it's not really
long<00:04:37.090> this<00:04:37.270> it's<00:04:37.480> not<00:04:37.540> gonna<00:04:37.720> go<00:04:37.900> tour<00:04:38.170> the

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
long this it's not gonna go tour the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.270 
long this it's not gonna go tour the
world<00:04:38.470> on<00:04:38.740> it<00:04:38.860> but<00:04:40.170> around<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.350> UK<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:41.800> think

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
world on it but around the UK I think

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.530 
world on it but around the UK I think
you<00:04:42.340> could<00:04:42.490> pretty<00:04:42.640> much<00:04:42.730> get<00:04:42.970> anywhere<00:04:43.330> on<00:04:43.390> a

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
you could pretty much get anywhere on a

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.970 
you could pretty much get anywhere on a
to<00:04:43.690> show<00:04:43.960> if<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.110> could<00:04:44.260> even<00:04:44.410> probably<00:04:44.710> make<00:04:44.860> it

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
to show if I could even probably make it

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.870 
to show if I could even probably make it
to<00:04:45.010> London<00:04:45.490> with<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.270> bit<00:04:46.450> of<00:04:46.510> preparation<00:04:46.840> and
