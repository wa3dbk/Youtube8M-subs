 Hi guys, I'm good with you. 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.000
 today I came here with decoration unit 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.609
 flowers is with silver and a stress goes 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.750
 stay super beautiful, very easy to do 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.600
 so the base I used this blue glaze 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.210
 street that he people blue lion only that well 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.170
 lighter only with lighting it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.469
 It was so dark and it will be decorated 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.510
 using enamel treats but you can 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.390
 be using another color I do not know 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.329
 black white that matches with blue and 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.920
 draw if you vote using ex 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.039
 golden is golden and brushes 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.850
 all that we need and we're going 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.539
 forgetting the extra brightness then I go 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.519
 start making pink out with golden 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:09.439
 okay I'll get here I use this record to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.670
 old cd I use to put enamel 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:21.240
 on top or ink it does not matter I go 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:29.250
 put a little here get a brush 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:33.090
 Just like me, and I'll go 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.200
 making the shape of the rose is very easy 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.200
 To make this rose 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.490
 I taught you once. 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.720
 Come on, I'll put it here in the corner. 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.080
 I was formatting 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.410
 there's a little rice so I do not know if it's 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.250
 to see right 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.730
 Rosinha is like that and then we go 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:21.350
 take the pain cap and get thinner 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.350
 that has and I will do some dots here 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:32.340
 not to be like a little flower in the middle 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.530
 Poor thing puts the dots 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.010
 So, in this one , I'm going to get the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.010
 little star 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:51.840
 in this line this is how I go 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:03:00.150
 pass some extra brightness and I go 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:02.870
 paste the star I'm going to put here 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.870
 down 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:16.049
 so here it is now to melt 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:21.510
 I'll's up again the only goalscorer 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:27.110
 that of this part but is round and 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.110
 back making a continuous make a powder 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:40.010
 there are comics like the little finger 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:44.790
 That I'll be doing a little Frenchie. 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:50.690
 I'm going to get this brush that's how it is and I 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.690
 I put it here and it took 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.870
 hit 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.069
 I'm tapping because I do not want to 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:04.900
 that one thing is perfect is want 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:08.790
 stay a little more detail and not the type 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.790
 Francesinha, perfect, no. 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:25.260
 now I'll be passing this the brightness 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.260
 on all lines 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:41.860
 Then I went through this glow now I'll take it off. 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:44.370
 the excess enamel that has stayed here in 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.370
 songs 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.310
 So that's it, folks, that's how it went. 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.460
 end result, I want to ask 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.460
 Sorry why the light is on. 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.760
 strong and you can not see this decoration 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.539

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.889
