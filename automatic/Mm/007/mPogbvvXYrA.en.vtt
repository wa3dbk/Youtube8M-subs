00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.330
 with installation of a biodigester that 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.270
 turns livestock waste into gas 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.590
 methane and this in electric current the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.560
 beef fattening company 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.380
 20x cattle ranch tries to prove that being 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.599
 sustainable if you leave your profits despite 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.640
 be a small family and young fattening 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.439
 this company has become 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.450
 pioneer in Mexico in the operation of 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.550
 biodigesters for cattle producers 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.160
 of meat because the process is more 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.200
 complicated that with other species the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.110
 biodigester here of 20x livestock is 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 the first biodigester in fattening 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.350
 bovine cattle cattle 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.839
 Not only is it the first biodigester 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.960
 That is the only and equis bull in Mexico 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.879
 I believe that more members of the guild of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.039
 the fathers are going to go for this 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.520
 side because it is also sustainable 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.300
 profitable the gas that is produced here 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.460
 it's methane gas and we drive it to a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.290
 motor generator is a combustion engine 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.570
 internal that moves a generator to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.870
 produce current with this we're going to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.460
 save between 30 and 50 percent 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.950
 of the electrical energy that we consume 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 here in the corrals gives us a little 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.800
 of play to be able to share with 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.400
 our neighbors 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.200
 some light and we have the project of the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.330
 we have open we are going to 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.970
 take advantage of the gas also from here to 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.000
 we can preheat the water we go to 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.860
 save 50% also on energy 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.770
 for preheating the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.399
 water heating 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.990
 for the process of the overwhelming gonzÃ¡lez 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.450
 explained that the intention to install 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.250
 this technology was to generate savings in 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 the company that allowed him to be more 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.509
 competitive in the market what has 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.119
 result in annual growths in 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.189
 capacity and sales are really the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.390
 first because there was not much 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.860
 information about biodigesters 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.679
 the fattening of cattle to come there are in the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.770
 pigs in dairy cattle but here 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.720
 this we are only the first all 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.790
 others 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.060
 production areas like pork the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.370
 dairy cattle 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.380
 by gravity they go and give the video story 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.099
 you have to load the love you have to recharge 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.260
 the manually is charged the bid is loaded 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.300
 and I manage with the team machine the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.140
 water that we collect from the rain the 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.840
 rebombea mos 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.160
 and that's a little more process 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.900
 complicated for the end of accounts is 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:41.079
 profitable and in addition to the issue 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.079
 gases to the environment 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.920
 we take advantage to produce light and to 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.900
 can heat the water preheat the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.840
 water for others 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.239
 Livestock 20 x is located in Salinas 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.430
 New lion victory and was born in 2003 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.129
 with only 15 head of cattle in 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.340
 fattening now operates 40 pens with one 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:06.040
 capacity of 1,800 heads is a 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.180
 livestock maquila we the biggest 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.579
 part of our feet are 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.519
 investors invest in livestock is 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.709
 a profitable business, they send us their 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.100
 won, we take care of 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.140
 Production care 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.040
 and at the last we consume them that among their 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.480
 channels or they bring clients in some 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.330
 client and they send their 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.120
 customers their channels if the intention is 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.420
 keep growing and go integrating them 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.160
 reach the final consumer with one with 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.990
 a meat cutting process room and 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.290
 have a finished product already in 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.939
 cooked portions 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.030
 and placed on the shelves of the 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.030
 supermarkets
