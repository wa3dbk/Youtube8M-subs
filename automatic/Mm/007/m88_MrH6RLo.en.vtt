 I like to be stickers on paper against 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.710
 so then I met 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.680

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 to mark the buses buses the personal taxis 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.340

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.340
 I learned with him and 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.239
 at the beginning were the drawings of 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.849

 The dog 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.709
 to that end 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.709
 the intense smoke already several years ago 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.709

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:12.649
 thanks to that work 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:16.289
 cd are taken into account the following were the first to design a 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.419
 computer 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.019
 6 points out what the template pulls out full square 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:23.440
 the letters with the profiles 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.959

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.769
 the first thing that has not stopped computers out 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.829
 take them out the parties in that case scala dark 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.659
 after this series because these hiding places 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.279
 stands 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.759
 it's the darkest 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.079
 textile factory 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.079

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.869
 in this case of the blacks 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.109
 then the next one is removed in the affected eye the letter 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.999

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.899

 surrounded by the farc 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.629
 then work another bit 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.089
 then mark that those digits 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:12.089
 then remove everything 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.880
 everything completely 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.319
 that's why it does not pass by long 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.469
 the letters are covered 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.650
 the sun comes up 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.099
 others look for precisely that 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.960
