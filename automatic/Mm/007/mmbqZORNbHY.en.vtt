00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.529 
we got power button headphone jack
firewire<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.080> USB<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:07.550> then<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:08.209> we<00:02:08.300> look<00:02:08.450> at

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
firewire and USB and then if we look at

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.229 
firewire and USB and then if we look at
the<00:02:08.629> back<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.429> don't<00:02:10.429> know<00:02:10.670> if<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.819> really<00:02:11.090> get

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
the back I don't know if you really get

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.500 
the back I don't know if you really get
this<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.690> but<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.260> have<00:02:15.340> come

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
this in but we have come

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.360 
this in but we have come
there's<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.019> ton<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.319> other<00:02:17.709> ports<00:02:18.189> back

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
there's like a ton of other ports back

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.819 
there's like a ton of other ports back
here<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:22.450> we'll<00:02:22.599> do<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> link<00:02:23.379> DVI<00:02:23.739> I

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
here so we do we'll do a link DVI I

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.690 
here so we do we'll do a link DVI I
believe<00:02:24.810> audio<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.079> out<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.620> here<00:02:27.459> are

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
believe audio in and out is here are

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.190 
believe audio in and out is here are
there<00:02:27.939> the<00:02:28.030> antennas<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.689> airport<00:02:29.079> and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
there the antennas for the airport and

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.110 
there the antennas for the airport and
stuff<00:02:29.379> I<00:02:29.530> think<00:02:30.150> optical<00:02:31.150> USB<00:02:31.750> firewire

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
stuff I think optical USB firewire

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.520 
stuff I think optical USB firewire
Ethernet<00:02:34.530> power<00:02:35.530> at<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.890> bottom<00:02:37.319> right<00:02:38.319> then

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
Ethernet power at the bottom right then

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.550 
Ethernet power at the bottom right then
let's<00:02:39.040> open<00:02:39.159> her<00:02:39.370> up<00:02:43.109> what's<00:02:44.109> this

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
let's open her up what's this

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.000 
let's open her up what's this
oh<00:02:44.640> that's<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.879> antenna<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.390> believe<00:02:47.069> for

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
oh that's the antenna I believe for

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.550 
oh that's the antenna I believe for
cyber<00:02:51.010> airport<00:02:51.430> or<00:02:51.519> Bluetooth<00:02:52.019> my<00:02:53.019> stuff<00:02:53.319> I

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
cyber airport or Bluetooth my stuff I

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.190 
cyber airport or Bluetooth my stuff I
think<00:02:54.159> that's<00:02:54.340> what<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.609> is<00:02:54.639> anyway<00:02:55.200> all

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
think that's what that is anyway all

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.660 
think that's what that is anyway all
right<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.349> let's<00:02:56.590> undo<00:02:56.859> the<00:02:56.950> clip<00:02:57.190> back<00:02:57.400> here

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
right so let's undo the clip back here

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.559 
right so let's undo the clip back here

wasn't<00:04:55.680> actually<00:04:56.640> in<00:04:57.120> in<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.290> AGP<00:04:58.830> slot<00:04:58.980> it

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
wasn't actually in in the AGP slot it

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.790 
wasn't actually in in the AGP slot it
was<00:04:59.430> like<00:04:59.970> half<00:05:00.540> hanging<00:05:00.990> out<00:05:01.140> so<00:05:01.680> the

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
was like half hanging out so the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.100 
was like half hanging out so the
vibration<00:05:02.460> from<00:05:03.090> when<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.390> had<00:05:03.480> been<00:05:03.630> posted

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
had literally shaped the graphics card

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.640 
had literally shaped the graphics card
out<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.290> slot

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
out of the slot

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.550
