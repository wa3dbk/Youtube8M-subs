it's<00:05:07.110> kind<00:05:07.319> of<00:05:07.349> got<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.530> crude<00:05:07.830> enough<00:05:08.129> right

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
it's kind of got a crude enough right

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.240 
it's kind of got a crude enough right
here<00:05:08.750> but<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:09.810> sure<00:05:09.960> does<00:05:10.139> have<00:05:10.349> some<00:05:10.529> size<00:05:10.770> to

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
here but it sure does have some size to

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.369 
here but it sure does have some size to
it<00:05:11.430> see<00:05:12.029> a<00:05:12.060> little<00:05:12.270> bit<00:05:12.449> of<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.599> cortex<00:05:13.080> right

it see a little bit of the cortex right
there<00:05:17.090> I'm<00:05:18.090> guessing<00:05:18.389> this<00:05:18.449> is<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.719> base<00:05:19.250> down

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
there I'm guessing this is the base down
