00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 and good hello to all and all his 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.430
 Qaeda pockets today we are 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.990
 found for a small video 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.260
 presentation of titeuf 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.690
 so to introduce you to my new 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.179
 staff on my rogue so I have more 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.539
 my physical staff a good staff 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.640
 secular archetypes as before so 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.519
 now I am in a bad staff 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.090
 so for those who do not know it's a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.260
 set sram bad it is panoplie queen 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 thieves so here finished condal for 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.450
 so dark his mound that is enough 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 nice 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.260
 you really see multi 1.6 elements 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.850
 but I can pass it in 12 years in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.629
 changing the hammer of glory to gand and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.980
 and putting the bear countries 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.719
 so see if I would put the sword 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.640
 because at pretty much like stats the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.329
 captures more wisdom on the other hand but 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.360
 exit otherwise at the elements level that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.939
 would give so its at dofus level and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.510
 trophies so I have both trophies 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.509
 power then automatically ice 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.119
 of almanac this turquoise dolphin and 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.150
 ex officio then offers amulets 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:28.890
 dustrit cottage so very good so I 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 stalled fm to me it's very strict so 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.880
 always the same example I had before 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.290
 the kloten beats the gide dustrit belt 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.759
 fm is the least 4 then the boots of the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:50.759
 poorly better very good box 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:54.509
 then the hat the hammer of the heavy 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.729
 before so that is not bad to tighten 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.119
 script 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.540
 even though his key peace overall hours she 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.119
 given 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.649
 it gives fixed raid in the magnets 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.160
 but hey what is interesting especially 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.440
 po and and the stats that rock is blowing 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.340
 not too bad 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:21.500
 rock dance with and my bag is cool 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.510
 then the alliance gloor cnpm and the cape 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.020
 watchful males that gives 2 in which 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.880
 is really a very interesting cape 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.730
 and so I have tri gide boots too 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:39.020
 a so few chips zero hungry zero 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.190
 handwritten so I loved it I like to the 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.790
 place of evil but finally for now 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.520
 I do not use them but after I 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.990
 will use I think the Batman but 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.630
 there she me it's going to be a two 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.830
 even so good there dubouch +12 wise and the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.190
 robust but if I take it off admit I 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.460
 take him off game but for example that 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.310
 passage not healthy olza so it's not 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.370
 too bad even good there so I 'm 1 2 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.840
 has pretty much every spell the boom of 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.550
 rocks so it's not bad but here I go 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.170
 finish I will speak soon the skin dofus 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.780
 So suddenly I think I would put in 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.770
 Turquoise office place for not before 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.180
 need the 1 2 for good rock is 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.320
 so I make the master stroke and your 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.680
 stryges it so that's it so it's worth 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.220
 characteristics it still does not give 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.450
 badly I cover 530 of pretty much in all 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.950
 the worlds 5- inch tamal rocks that 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.470
 is a pity it's someone who did not 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.220
 so it's pretty annoying if we do 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:54.620
 every time we can by the mud in the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.450
 details so a pretty good initiative 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.120
 my against the teams who are who 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.040
 are very weak 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.959
 a good tackle 119 it's not bad as 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.760
 that's why the panoply 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.050
 besides also she is of good 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.470
 ithaque tackle on all themes 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.290
 this is it from ithaque on twizz theme 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:23.090
 so that's thirty two more tackles 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:27.560
 franck laval 280 power 80 damage 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.439
 pity in third in drug his 50 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:35.490
 years neutral and ter and 55 eur damage 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:38.819
 fries then go gotta you I was pushing but 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.479
 that's good fart so the rays 12 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.120
 registered 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.840
 so if I remove the mar not touch it 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.870
 I cross my feet 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.090
 then 25 25% to the rays 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:56.430
 r on part contains no click on this 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:01.169
 stock that is a pity so 25% r7 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:05.729
 for his bone 7% fire 25% earth and 22% the 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:09.330
 May 3 for example if I will put the 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.789
 game gide batteries will pass fifteen mounts 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.830
 So I think at 15 years neutral 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.129
 also but in cash flow it's not already 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.969
 wrong 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.939
 Well, it's better than this. 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:24.569
 the spa rave we are not for you 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:29.909
 not for rays thinking so that's it 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:32.819
 so we go up reminded the rucks up so 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:38.129
 summoned them who is really nice to 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:41.490
 do it from the beginning of turn 4 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:46.050
 so there I sing told massa clean he 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.960
 he misses the 180 a I believe and 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.289
 as soon as it will be level 198 so I 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.460
 rouste attraction and so suddenly what 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.919
 would be nice if I lost 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.589
 georges would lose the coop for this turn 4 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.259
 and turns 4 you see the three bombs 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:05.370
 of each element takes care of it and hop I 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:08.610
 last breath last breath more 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.289
 explosion see that makes the 6000's 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.240
 damages 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.240
 so 6000 damage these servers not bad 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:23.250
 so the trunks the blunderbuss going on 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:25.680
 pretty much the extractions too which 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:32.569
 going not too bad as a goal 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:35.849
 you see the most art d enough mongel 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.889
 have by cons of his akbou sparrow CCL 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.709
 are not very beautiful 300 it's not top 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:47.099
 this time it's bad as see 

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:49.459
 560 cc flamiches which will grow to 250 c 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:54.149
 cool too 

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:59.729
 girls too who passes well see some 

00:06:54.149 --> 00:07:04.770
 about 500 critics so the 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:07.289
 Spanish about 350 nuptials and this is 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:11.159
 about 450 cc years old and so this is it 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:15.990
 not bad then I show you a little the 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:21.080
 king more of the hammer even so separate from 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:24.889
 700 to 800 in oc c is 1000 to 1200 cc 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.580
 cc it is not too bad good there against 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:30.019
 I am actually 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:34.199
 but if I take off the sturdy I do 1 2 

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:36.050
 so it can be pretty good here 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:38.669
 I think we went around 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.699
 so I'll see you soon for a 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:44.849
 next video with slaying your stats 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:48.360
 I think and my panda which is 600 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:50.009
 million diop 's are so I think that 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.879
 I will try the ofppt soon enough 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:56.369
 before October it would be cool 

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:58.079
 and then here and then after I will see 

00:07:56.369 --> 00:08:00.449
 christophe dumarest I do not think so 

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:03.180
 leave to maybe fires him with 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:06.569
 launched with a bit the same staff as the 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.869
 rogue had before at the archetype I 

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:13.639
 do not know I'll see bomba on this I you 

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:13.639
 leave and charles everyone
