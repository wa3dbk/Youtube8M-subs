00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.020
 let's sit down and talk about the books we all 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.499
 believe and books sometimes come in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.919
 worthlessness especially if they are read a lot 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:16.529
 people for example at work you gave to friends 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:19.230
 read you back the book 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.200
 especially soft cover well, roughly 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 speaking here in such an unsightly 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.610
 able to bring her here to grid 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.110
 it was convenient to read and hold it 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.890
 it was nice in the hands 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.159
 that's about it we'll talk means for 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:45.539
 we need this here pva glue 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:49.229
 jar brush this nail file this we will 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.989
 pushing through this velor thread 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:55.639
 you can stern thread you can love just to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:02.329
 she was a strong clamp 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:04.589
 homemade two sticks of this stick 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.650
 drilled holes become bottom 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.300
 and bolts to study and the leaf would be now 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.870
 do we pick up the torn book 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.580
 tattered and neatly collected 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:24.090
 so that it was less 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:28.140
 now this book without a cover 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.909
 the cover we will separately put this little book 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:38.189
 we insert our clamp fix 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.189
 At first, lightly, well, after that 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.420
 take the key and a little bit 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.149
 hold down more fundamentally we clicked 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.670
 our book in the clamp 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.609
 look here this edge of millimeters 5 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.780
 must be protruding above kai clamps 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:13.120
 Now we take our nail file and make 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:14.170
 propiliva so now furrows propilivaem 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.470
 deep 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.010
 as soon as the hacksaw blade touches 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.569
 shavings of this we sawed enough 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.829
 hacksaw here we have 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.250
 enough after we 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:33.310
 made cuts 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.450
 we take pva glue brush and apply 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.609
 pva glue 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.329
 right here on this on this butt on these 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.220
 cuts 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:50.060
 we will lay our thread take 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:59.709
 thread a finger like this we pin it 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:59.709
 and and pass through our cuts will give 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.700
 Now 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.700
 here pulled 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:22.260
 here laid pulled a thread in this 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:25.210
 the gap is laid this we delay the thread 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:32.010
 in contact with glue it is coated with glue 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:35.880
 and goes into the sheets carrying 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:42.570
 glue mass so we did one lap 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:48.340
 Now again we put a little glue 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:50.760
 now we go in the opposite direction for sure 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.760
 also 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.910
 put here 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:06.590
 well literally bitch three four passes 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.040
 done right on top now 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.380
 coat with glue however look to 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:22.780
 glue missed final 1 clamp 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:22.780
 only on the end of the book and leave 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:33.300
 so for compressed book 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:40.230
 Look, we already dried adhesive can be 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:43.770
 release the book and clamp here 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:49.230
 We freely out of the clamps ki 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:53.940
 you can of course put glue and glue 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:59.880
 immediately cover it will hold 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:02.900
 but better of course stick instead of her here 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:08.210
 such paper now we glue them 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:14.300
 put glue back on the end of this book 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.300
 here's the book you see it is all sewn 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:26.370
 now we impose our blank and 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:31.250
 we can stick it up of course again 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:36.630
 and and hold the dryer only not much 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:42.030
 literally here we come so she 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:45.210
 stuck and wait again well here's the book 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.490
 height here we open it Ahriman elevator 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.920
 does not crumble 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.830
 root here he stuck now we 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:58.100
 glue this face some kind of cover 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.100
 apply glue 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:09.770
 now take the cover and paste it 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.770
 books 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.110
 ironed 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:25.809
 back we put it on a warm pot 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:25.809
 to dry
