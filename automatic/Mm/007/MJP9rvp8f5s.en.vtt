00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 It's been a long time since we show games 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.120
 paint was quite praises the show 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.280
 Green River space need is because 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.190
 also played in the bridge comes to me in 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.049
 pizzeria there he even opened the game 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.720
 cup this phase 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.390
 this phase is impossible to detect type c 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.100
 has in the 43 bird pass fÃ¡bio I 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.160
 according to the calculations o with a 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.920
 little war bird to shoot down old 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.800
 with the service you can be sure that the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.279
 valencia but let's see then it's billboard 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.279
 space 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.100
 this is the angry birds fish the team could 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 take with the left hand the right but 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.430
 disrupts recording 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 Good, everything is a little game to be. 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.640
 first world all second world but 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.260
 I'll show you more or less how. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.379
 the program runs here random phase 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.410
 beauty then nothing are you on the planet 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.480
 You have to play on another planet. 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.090
 It means our planet, it has a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.360
 orbit bid're seeing is here 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.490
 an atmosphere then for example if I 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.070
 play up 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.540
 he will make the orbit look stayed 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.920
 interesting sometimes can even give the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.009
 back on the planet 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.840
 This bug here opa 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 Look at you, he saw that he only defeated. 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.670
 It seems that I demonstrated it is only this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.640
 pet is the one that you throw him 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.250
 then click where it has to be 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.590
 Look, I'm good, said the young James. 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:44.330
 I wanted to kill with just a little more, right? 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.440
 I will not risk the country a naja 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.090
 good quality 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.069
 the difference of this game is that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.560
 You already are on the other planet, I want 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:56.700
 show what you 're dead different 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.850
 is in the same orbit also left 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:08.119
 find another that I do not know 27 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:14.090
 in a note the same orbit in test tube maybe 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:17.150
 the album that takes from the malicious to him party 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.160
 that takes a look 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.520
 you're on the planet has another here has 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.580
 another here then the direction of affection 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.250
 will totally vary the transport 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.600
 then the other and made the curve and even 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.739
 that's how I did well 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.950
 that same boring 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.190
 yet we see and find in 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.190
 corner 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.780
 It is very bad to stay there already, the grandmother who lives 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.239
 with the woman listened deconcentrated 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.130
 Imagine if you were concentrating on doing 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.170
 only this is good 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.360
 something very interesting that in the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.040
 It's true the tea that likes to play 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.450
 The way it 's talked like this, ah, no. 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.989
 I'll be able to hit this guy that you 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.739
 does 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:14.690
 calls for the hawk said the champion 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:16.940

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.320
 he arrives but the guy is not there 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:27.859
 clicks suddenly a monster appears and 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:29.450
 destroys everything plays so that's how the 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.019
 airplane is true right? 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.790
 so this is the angry birds space is fine 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.890
 cool in my opinion the coolest 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.019
 board and have because there are 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.019
 Different things to do - Hawk
