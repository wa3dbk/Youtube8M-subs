00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
like a team deathmatch round you spawn

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.809 
like a team deathmatch round you spawn
in<00:02:45.680> by<00:02:45.799> your<00:02:45.920> team<00:02:46.099> there<00:02:46.310> is<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> spawning

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
in by your team there is a spawning

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.809 
in by your team there is a spawning
point<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.859> way<00:02:49.010> Eliminator<00:02:49.519> people

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
point so that way Eliminator people

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.180 
point so that way Eliminator people
can't<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.180> like<00:02:50.299> camp<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:51.069> cuz<00:02:52.069> they're

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
can't just like camp you cuz they're

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.449 
can't just like camp you cuz they're
extremely<00:02:52.459> limited<00:02:52.910> range<00:02:57.250> anyways

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
extremely limited range anyways

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.199 
extremely limited range anyways
so<00:02:59.530> obviously<00:03:00.530> if<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:01.340> yourself<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:02.090> been

so obviously if you yourself have been

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.370 
so obviously if you yourself have been
eliminated<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.959> go<00:03:03.109> sit<00:03:03.319> down<00:03:05.019> if<00:03:06.019> you're<00:03:06.200> not

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
eliminated you go sit down if you're not

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.250
