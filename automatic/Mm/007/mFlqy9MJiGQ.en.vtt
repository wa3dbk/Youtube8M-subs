that<00:02:41.380> might<00:02:41.560> seem<00:02:41.860> pretty<00:02:42.099> slow<00:02:42.460> it's<00:02:42.760> pretty

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
that might seem pretty slow it's pretty

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000 
that might seem pretty slow it's pretty
fast<00:02:43.300> actually<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> shotgun<00:02:44.230> since<00:02:44.920> the

fast actually for a shotgun since the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
means that it does have low recoil up

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.220 
means that it does have low recoil up

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
returned finally in modern warfare 2 but

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.339 
returned finally in modern warfare 2 but
this<00:03:00.430> time<00:03:00.610> as<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> secondary<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.840> had<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.110> same

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
this time as a secondary it had the same

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.350 
this time as a secondary it had the same
magazine<00:03:02.590> size<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.220> only<00:03:03.370> having<00:03:03.640> four<00:03:04.030> rounds

per<00:03:04.510> magazine<00:03:04.630> which<00:03:05.350> again<00:03:05.650> meant<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.010> you

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
per magazine which again meant that you

multiplier which meant that there was no

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.470 
multiplier which meant that there was no
point<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.580> trying<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.850> go<00:03:27.910> for<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> head<00:03:28.299> when

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
point in trying to go for the head when

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.300 
point in trying to go for the head when
using<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.870> shotgun<00:03:29.170> like<00:03:29.799> it's<00:03:30.010> modern

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
using this shotgun like it's modern

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.970 
using this shotgun like it's modern
warfare<00:03:30.549> counterpart<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.690> m1014<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.709> modern

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
warfare counterpart the m1014 in modern

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.430 
warfare counterpart the m1014 in modern
warfare<00:03:33.190> 2<00:03:33.519> also<00:03:33.970> shot<00:03:34.239> at<00:03:34.360> 300<00:03:34.870> rounds<00:03:35.230> per

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
warfare 2 also shot at 300 rounds per

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.170 
warfare 2 also shot at 300 rounds per
minute<00:03:35.590> which<00:03:36.040> meant<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.519> were<00:03:36.549> able<00:03:36.940> to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
minute which meant that you were able to

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.300 
minute which meant that you were able to
kind<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.420> spam<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:37.989> shotgun<00:03:38.319> as<00:03:38.739> opposed<00:03:39.190> to

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
kind of spam this shotgun as opposed to

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.460 
kind of spam this shotgun as opposed to
maybe<00:03:39.670> using<00:03:39.970> something<00:03:40.390> like<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.780> spaz<00:03:41.049> 12

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
maybe using something like the spaz 12

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.670 
maybe using something like the spaz 12
again<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.790> m1014<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.900> shotgun<00:03:44.500> it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
again because the m1014 is a shotgun it

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.009 
again because the m1014 is a shotgun it
also<00:03:45.100> has<00:03:45.430> very<00:03:45.730> low<00:03:45.970> recoil<00:03:46.180> up<00:03:46.480> close<00:03:46.720> but<00:03:46.959> it

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
also has very low recoil up close but it

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.080 
also has very low recoil up close but it
has<00:03:47.140> extremely<00:03:47.650> high<00:03:47.769> kick<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.430> extremely

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
has extremely high kick and extremely

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.729 
has extremely high kick and extremely
high<00:03:49.330> recoil<00:03:49.750> when<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:49.959> try<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.200> kill<00:03:50.470> someone

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
high recoil when you try to kill someone

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.080 
high recoil when you try to kill someone
from<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.980> distance<00:03:51.370> which<00:03:51.790> is<00:03:51.910> something

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
from a distance which is something

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.490 
from a distance which is something
either<00:03:52.359> way<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.630> shouldn't<00:03:52.989> be<00:03:53.049> doing<00:03:53.140> with<00:03:53.380> a

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
either way you shouldn't be doing with a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.199 
either way you shouldn't be doing with a
shotgun<00:03:55.829> so<00:03:56.829> which<00:03:57.100> one<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.310> these<00:03:57.459> two<00:03:57.519> m10

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
you think that maybe one just felt

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.270 
you think that maybe one just felt
better<00:04:01.510> or<00:04:01.780> maybe<00:04:02.410> has<00:04:02.739> felt<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.040> one<00:04:03.160> was

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
better or maybe has felt the one was

warfare<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.660> was<00:04:25.810> still<00:04:26.050> not<00:04:26.169> enough<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.590> keep

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
warfare it was still not enough to keep

it away as being the top dog it is a
shotgun<00:04:29.470> which<00:04:29.590> means<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:29.890> you<00:04:30.039> are
