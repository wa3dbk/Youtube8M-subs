00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.230
 [Music] 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.080
 danger this video contains images that 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.160
 may be slightly 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.080
 disturbing but I gave you click 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.639
 link you already knew something that you came what 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.000
 try at home like fruits and vegetables 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.730
 Americans always say soccer 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.029
 be sport for ladybugs fan 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.860
 and you make theater do rap 2000 120 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.680
 boring minutes most of the time 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.230
 American football over manly men 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.530
 why be better but do not know that 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.450
 there are also risks when playing soccer ok to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.399
 times the players do not tell 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.350
 I'm going to deny they touch their faces when they 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.179
 they stick on the shoulder and they even take the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.920
 opponent's arm to stick but 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.079
 there are also times that rough play has 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.749
 brought very bad consequences 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.749
 welcome to bow but these are the 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.730
 peter czech peter cech good goalie 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.510
 from chelsea who plays with helmet and 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.180
 also plays the battery well 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.189
 he was about to die in 2006 in a 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.900
 game against reading when wanted 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.909
 steal the ball from a player what 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.979
 but he got hits head 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 the attacker's knee this left him 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.970
 practically unconscious immediately 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 they took him to the hospital and they had to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.049
 operate it because his skull was fractured 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.580
 after this they told him that 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.649
 less was going to be a year without playing 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.560
 because his life was at risk 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.479
 but miraculously or stupidly already 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.549
 I was playing again three months 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.500
 then with its characteristic helmet 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.509
 black that makes him look like a player 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000
 rugby the truth is that it became 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.100
 android the helmet is only the lid 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.720
 of the batteries and when it is removed it will be 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.950
 of 20 great old folk 4 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.479
 possibly the soccer player with 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.789
 worst luck of all 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.890
 Djibril Cisse national team 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.020
 France in two world cups and player 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 in teams like Marseille Olympique the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.069
 liverpool has the great honor of being one 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.289
 of the few players or maybe the 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.909
 only one that has broken both legs to 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.520
 throughout his career in an entrance 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.500
 with a blackburn player rovers yes 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.629
 he got the worst part when his 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.800
 left leg broke when getting stuck 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.020
 with the grass 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.540
 I screamed in pain this was in 2004 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.120
 but two years later in a friendly of 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.740
 the French team against China and they 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.500
 he had an unfortunate move again 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.510
 where he could not fall well and his leg 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.270
 right fractured leaving it out of 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.430
 the world cup germany 2006 the good 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.350
 of the matter if it can be said good is 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.510
 that he recovered quickly from his 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.560
 injuries both times I was already playing 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.300
 again after seven months 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.400
 another selected from france patrick 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.030
 battiston was in three cups of the world 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.400
 but the semifinal of the 1982 World Cup 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.590
 between france and germany- western 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.600
 so this player is most remembered 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.940
 that bad reputation after taking off all 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.470
 the German defense battiston was approaching 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.240
 to the goal line when goalkeeper 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.550
 harold his image was blown 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.070
 derangedly beating the French in 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.560
 the face with the hip leaving him knocked out 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.810
 the impact damaged him a vertebra threw him 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.180
 three teeth and he broke his jaw 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.100
 while the goalkeeper continued playing as 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.900
 If nothing had happened to Pakistan, 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.450
 was left without playing for five months 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.250
 while recovering from his injuries and 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.350
 this fault was recorded in the memory 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.690
 all as one of the most violent of 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.360
 the story 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.580
 paulo diogo swiss player currently 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.650
 retired is another player who competes for 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.600
 the prize of bad luck had one of 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.420
 the rarest injuries in history in 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.120
 the 2004 when he played in the servef fcc 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.360
 in a visitor game against the fs and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.370
 the haus in the 87th minute gave a pass to 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.230
 his partner who ended up in word like 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.600
 I was excited and liked to celebrate 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.520
 euphorically he was running to the grate of 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.890
 metal separating players 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.230
 the fans to celebrate with their people 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.300
 paulo had just got married shortly 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.250
 before and as all newly married people do not 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.930
 I removed the ring neither to bathe nor 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.270
 to play apparently because 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.400
 finish his celebration did not notice 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.680
 that his wedding ring got stuck 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.570
 in the grate along with half of his finger 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.430
 and of course like two eras of the cake 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.890
 referee went to get the yellow card 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.780
 for wasting a lot of time in their celebration of 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.940
 made the auxiliaries of the team together 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.709
 with him they were looking for his finger in the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.690
 night took him to a hospital 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.609
 zurich but the doctors could not 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.130
 hit her finger and they had to amputate 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.020
 it is the first articulation from that 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.419
 day do not let play with rings bracelets 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.690
 necklaces or any accessory of that 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.080
 kind 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.030
 by decree of the fifa 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.800
 if you feel that you will not go back to sleep 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.599
 I recommend you change to any of 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.669
 the other coconut videos but that 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.400
 will appear on your screen because what 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.400
 it came it was worse, go ahead, do it 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:51.250
 ok wants to follow that it is ok or not 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.290
 in 1996 when the coventry city went to 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.050
 play old trafford house of manchester 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.910
 united david boost had no idea what 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.800
 what was waiting for him when he was running alone 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.840
 the second minute of play in a 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.850
 moment of his career was over when 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.949
 was interposed between two sweeps of 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.080
 Manchester players twisting their 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.360
 leg almost to the opposite side of 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.400
 where the result of this should be 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.380
 it was an exposed fracture of the tibia and 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.540
 fibula of the right leg 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.550
 the bones broke their socks and their 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.620
 skin filling with blood everything 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.560
 there was close to seeing this the goalkeeper of 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.539
 Manchester Peter Michael vomited from the 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.699
 impression and had to go to sessions with 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.130
 a psychologist for several weeks is 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.990
 it really took 12 minutes to clean 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.120
 the blood of the grass before the 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.030
 game could be resumed this injury 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.889
 required 22 operations including the 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.810
 insertion of metal bars and a 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.910
 plastic surgeon had to rebuild 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.250
 the leg to cover the hole where 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.750
 the bone came out even a doctor said 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.419
 that if this injury had not occurred 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.669
 20 years before the player would have lost 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.010
 the leg definitely after a 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.790
 year of post rehabilitation finally it 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.250
 He recovered 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.440
 his doctor suggested he quit his career and 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.650
 He suggested he should be happy 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.450
 to be able to walk and to be alive of beatbox 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.400
 he did not like the idea very much but had to 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.500
 do it if it takes away the desire to play 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.540
