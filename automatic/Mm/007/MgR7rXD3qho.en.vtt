00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.129
 hi to all today so small 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.900
 so review video on my emulsifier 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.910
 I really wanted to talk to you about it 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 because if like me you do 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.840
 cosmetics at home sometimes we have a 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.609
 little bit of trouble especially to do the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.430
 emulsions end me it was really big 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.560
 worries the emulsions actually I'm there 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.260
 could not whip the six minutes 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.510
 that we ask and suddenly my emissions 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.510
 after a few days or waltz 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.590
 phases and and I found that a little bit 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 it's a bit annoying time 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.880
 we are going to spend it so I 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.550
 have just decided to invest in a 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.950
 emulates Zionists so never found on the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.829
 site maton who is my faith frankly 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.450
 awesome in addition to his little cry 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.489
 every time I cook them 12 euros 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.469
 of which 16 with fees so if I get 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.160
 well reminiscent cabin franc discount 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.870
 20% so it really is really 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.140
 an investment that is worth a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 stroke 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.770
 especially when we see for example the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.840
 missionaries so there by cons it's 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.850
 quickly at amazon I will really found 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 null because declared preparation 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.119
 becomes a little too thick 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.190
 solar vegetables went bad more 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.900
 so it's really anything 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.250
 so I bought so it was the sonar 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.010
 as you see so it's already 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.049
 resold on a small base where we have 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.360
 already where do you dress them 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.700
 utensils that are on it and I find 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
 that awesome 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.020
 then it is composed so you have a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.750
 pitcher so that 1400 containing 400 ml 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.310
 so that is not bad with a lid 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.740
 which is good because it is there 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 projections and the lid 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.180
 so find yourself like that you can even 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 so put your whip in there without 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.700
 put it everywhere 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.119
 it also has a spout this is 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.950
 plastic that is really solid and me 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.539
 I even use it squarely so for eva 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.799
 marry so I put myself in the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.500
 pan melt the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.229
 products in I would say safely and 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.570
 so to burn anything here 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.380
 then on the base you will find 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.550
 so the nights sound in itself so 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.560
 so here it works with four 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.090
 batteries but frankly enough hyper 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.010
 economic armand that must make me 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.000
 that I have used it enough 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.489
 regularly and frankly pizzas 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.250
 a suite really not invite so the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.319
 on / off button this is it is very 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.959
 powerful 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.910
 in emulsified super well suddenly me 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.560
 six minutes I spent half 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.330
 long enough to emulsify skulls 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.950
 but a lot of everything you 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.620
 so I think it's really 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.350
 interesting with regard to one and then in 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.120
 product quality especially and so he 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.980
 is sold with four heads tips 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.660
 heads to put on 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.940
 so I can not explain to you 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.859
 now exactly which one serves to 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.230
 peas because I forgot my record at the 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.350
 kitchen so you have four texts 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.480
 so like this so in general 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.820
 I use this one so most often 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.390
 so it's a delicious job here 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.720
 flat like that then there is one at 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.819
 back there are some here that are 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.859
 do more so if you want to do 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.230
 kind the foam texture of 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.079
 questionnaires the dot he just wanted 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.130
 mix or that's it so it's a small 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:33.310
 drummer 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:36.370
 ti drummer another so with so the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.060
 honor bus so you have your fashion 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:45.100
 job description and explained himself 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.080
 each head for each hockey tool 1 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.040
 what preparation is meant for 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.220
 high priests you do as you 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.390
 want to test too but I 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.480
 was interesting to introduce us 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.140
 because frankly given the price here 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.020

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:09.460
