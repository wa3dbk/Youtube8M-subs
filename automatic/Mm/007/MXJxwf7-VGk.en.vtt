hello<00:00:08.290> everyone<00:00:08.680> welcome<00:00:09.340> to<00:00:09.520> another<00:00:09.820> monday

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
hello everyone welcome to another monday

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.470 
hello everyone welcome to another monday
movie<00:00:10.420> i'm<00:00:10.719> mr.<00:00:11.440> blue<00:00:11.709> summers<00:00:12.180> so<00:00:13.180> this<00:00:13.299> week

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
movie i'm mr. blue summers so this week

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.699 
movie i'm mr. blue summers so this week
i'll<00:00:13.690> be<00:00:13.840> showing<00:00:13.990> you<00:00:14.199> a<00:00:14.230> technique<00:00:14.500> that

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
i'll be showing you a technique that

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.920 
i'll be showing you a technique that
really<00:00:15.219> every<00:00:15.459> 3d<00:00:15.760> artist<00:00:16.029> should<00:00:16.240> know<00:00:16.449> and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
really every 3d artist should know and

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.590 
really every 3d artist should know and
that's<00:00:17.200> how<00:00:17.290> to<00:00:17.380> use<00:00:17.560> decals<00:00:18.390> decals<00:00:19.390> are

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
that's how to use decals decals are

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.050 
that's how to use decals decals are
essentially<00:00:20.080> opacity<00:00:20.770> mapped<00:00:21.060> textured

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
essentially opacity mapped textured

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.380 
essentially opacity mapped textured
polygons<00:00:22.930> that<00:00:23.200> are<00:00:23.770> just<00:00:24.130> barely<00:00:24.490> on<00:00:24.789> top<00:00:25.150> of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
polygons that are just barely on top of

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.720 
polygons that are just barely on top of
your<00:00:25.539> original<00:00:25.780> polygons<00:00:26.470> now<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.490> reason

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
your original polygons now the reason

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.190 
your original polygons now the reason
that<00:00:27.880> you<00:00:28.060> would<00:00:28.180> use<00:00:28.390> this<00:00:28.570> is<00:00:28.780> to<00:00:28.990> save

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
that you would use this is to save

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.080 
that you would use this is to save
texture<00:00:29.650> space<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:30.130> so<00:00:30.580> that<00:00:30.760> you<00:00:30.789> can

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
texture space and so that you can

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.380 
texture space and so that you can
decouple<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:32.560> uniqueness<00:00:32.950> in<00:00:33.370> your<00:00:33.940> objects

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
decouple the uniqueness in your objects

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.840 
decouple the uniqueness in your objects
you<00:00:34.570> can<00:00:34.690> reuse<00:00:35.010> textures<00:00:36.010> in<00:00:36.280> other<00:00:36.520> places

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
you can reuse textures in other places

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.090 
you can reuse textures in other places
that<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:37.600> might<00:00:37.840> not<00:00:37.989> otherwise<00:00:38.230> be<00:00:38.710> able<00:00:38.739> to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
that you might not otherwise be able to

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.760 
that you might not otherwise be able to
let<00:00:39.280> me<00:00:39.370> show<00:00:39.489> you<00:00:39.520> an<00:00:39.700> example<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:40.560> have<00:00:41.560> a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
let me show you an example I have a

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.330 
let me show you an example I have a
screenshot<00:00:42.190> here<00:00:42.430> from<00:00:43.300> half-life<00:00:43.660> 2<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.340> if

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
screenshot here from half-life 2 and if

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.250 
screenshot here from half-life 2 and if
you<00:00:45.430> look<00:00:45.610> closely<00:00:45.910> at<00:00:46.239> this<00:00:46.390> particular<00:00:46.660> face

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
you look closely at this particular face

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.130 
you look closely at this particular face
you'll<00:00:48.160> notice<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:49.210> brick<00:00:49.690> texture

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
you'll notice that the brick texture

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.920 
you'll notice that the brick texture
repeats<00:00:50.969> right<00:00:51.969> here<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:52.239> can<00:00:52.360> see<00:00:52.510> two<00:00:52.690> bands

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
repeats right here you can see two bands

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.840 
repeats right here you can see two bands
of<00:00:53.200> dark<00:00:53.730> bricks<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:56.079> this<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:57.070> probably<00:00:57.579> a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
of dark bricks but this is probably a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.060 
of dark bricks but this is probably a
decal<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:59.170> can<00:00:59.320> tell<00:00:59.559> because<00:00:59.739> it

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
decal and you can tell because it

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.299 
decal and you can tell because it
doesn't<00:01:00.399> repeat<00:01:00.700> with<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:00.940> original<00:01:01.180> texture

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
doesn't repeat with the original texture

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.619 
doesn't repeat with the original texture
again<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.460> can<00:01:03.489> really<00:01:03.910> see<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.180> value<00:01:04.299> here

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
again you can really see the value here

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.359 
again you can really see the value here
because<00:01:05.049> we're<00:01:05.259> reusing<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.829> brick<00:01:06.009> texture

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
because we're reusing the brick texture

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.770 
because we're reusing the brick texture
all<00:01:06.609> over<00:01:06.909> this<00:01:06.999> building<00:01:07.240> we're<00:01:07.600> probably

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
all over this building we're probably

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.179 
all over this building we're probably
using<00:01:08.139> it<00:01:08.200> on<00:01:08.319> this<00:01:08.469> one<00:01:08.619> over<00:01:08.799> here<00:01:08.829> it's<00:01:09.159> a

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
using it on this one over here it's a

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.609 
using it on this one over here it's a
little<00:01:09.369> harder<00:01:09.609> to<00:01:09.639> tell<00:01:09.939> and<00:01:10.149> I<00:01:11.139> bet<00:01:11.380> that<00:01:11.530> you

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
little harder to tell and I bet that you

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.529 
little harder to tell and I bet that you
can<00:01:11.799> reuse<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.280> logo<00:01:12.700> in<00:01:12.880> other<00:01:13.030> places<00:01:13.240> in

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
can reuse this logo in other places in

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.539 
can reuse this logo in other places in
the<00:01:13.630> scene<00:01:13.840> 2<00:01:14.109> so<00:01:14.740> again<00:01:15.009> this<00:01:15.130> is<00:01:15.249> a<00:01:15.280> very

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
the scene 2 so again this is a very

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.639 
the scene 2 so again this is a very
powerful<00:01:15.819> technique<00:01:16.209> for<00:01:16.779> low<00:01:16.929> poly<00:01:17.170> work<00:01:17.439> and

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
powerful technique for low poly work and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.559 
powerful technique for low poly work and
it's<00:01:17.829> a<00:01:17.920> huge<00:01:18.189> time-saver<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:19.029> high<00:01:19.299> poly

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
it's a huge time-saver and high poly

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.590 
it's a huge time-saver and high poly
work<00:01:19.810> let<00:01:20.619> me<00:01:20.709> show<00:01:20.829> you<00:01:20.889> how<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.100> do<00:01:21.249> it<00:01:21.600> we're

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
work let me show you how to do it we're

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.800 
work let me show you how to do it we're
going<00:01:22.719> to<00:01:22.810> jump<00:01:23.079> over<00:01:23.319> to<00:01:23.529> the<00:01:24.459> scene<00:01:24.810> 3d

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
going to jump over to the scene 3d

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.469 
going to jump over to the scene 3d
studio<00:01:25.990> max<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.619> I've<00:01:27.130> set<00:01:27.340> up<00:01:27.369> just<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:28.029> wall

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
studio max and I've set up just a wall

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.330 
studio max and I've set up just a wall
and<00:01:28.749> floor<00:01:29.020> with<00:01:29.289> a<00:01:29.319> concrete<00:01:29.679> texture<00:01:30.069> and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
and floor with a concrete texture and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.160 
and floor with a concrete texture and
you<00:01:30.909> can<00:01:31.060> see<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.450> repetition<00:01:31.959> pretty

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
you can see the repetition pretty

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.279 
you can see the repetition pretty
obviously<00:01:33.389> now<00:01:34.389> what<00:01:34.539> we're<00:01:34.659> going<00:01:34.779> to<00:01:34.899> do<00:01:35.049> is

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
obviously now what we're going to do is

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.379 
obviously now what we're going to do is
apply<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.740> little<00:01:35.979> bit<00:01:36.069> of<00:01:36.159> vandalism<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:37.240> this

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:37.389 
apply a little bit of vandalism to this

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.080 
apply a little bit of vandalism to this
wall<00:01:37.679> I'm<00:01:38.679> going<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.859> start<00:01:39.009> off<00:01:39.159> by<00:01:39.219> selecting

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
wall I'm going to start off by selecting

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.599 
wall I'm going to start off by selecting
my<00:01:40.810> polygon<00:01:41.229> sub-object<00:01:41.499> mode<00:01:42.039> hotkey<00:01:42.579> for

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
my polygon sub-object mode hotkey for

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.389 
my polygon sub-object mode hotkey for
and<00:01:43.319> I've<00:01:44.319> selected<00:01:44.469> one<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.859> these<00:01:44.950> polygons

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
and I've selected one of these polygons

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.859 
and I've selected one of these polygons
and<00:01:45.579> that's<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.240> one<00:01:46.359> I'm<00:01:46.450> going<00:01:46.569> to<00:01:46.659> turn

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
and that's the one I'm going to turn

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.139 
and that's the one I'm going to turn
into<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:48.130> going<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.369> turn<00:01:48.490> into<00:01:48.639> some

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
into I'm going to turn into some

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.919 
into I'm going to turn into some
vandalism<00:01:50.039> I'm<00:01:51.039> going<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.310> detach<00:01:51.609> it<00:01:51.929> right

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
vandalism I'm going to detach it right

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.440 
vandalism I'm going to detach it right
here<00:01:53.169> detach<00:01:53.669> make<00:01:54.669> sure<00:01:54.819> to<00:01:54.909> detach<00:01:55.179> it<00:01:55.359> is

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
here detach make sure to detach it is

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.120 
here detach make sure to detach it is
clone<00:01:55.689> we<00:01:55.899> want<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.169> original<00:01:56.259> polygons<00:01:56.919> to

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
clone we want the original polygons to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.690 
clone we want the original polygons to
stay<00:01:57.279> there

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
stay there

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.850 
stay there
some<00:01:59.299> vandalism<00:02:00.100> click<00:02:01.100> ok<00:02:01.399> now<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:03.680> way<00:02:03.829> that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
some vandalism click ok now the way that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.399 
some vandalism click ok now the way that
you<00:02:04.070> would<00:02:04.159> use<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.460> technique<00:02:04.880> for

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
you would use this technique for

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.410 
you would use this technique for
nonlinear<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:07.159> know<00:02:07.280> faces<00:02:07.850> as<00:02:08.030> well<00:02:08.179> let's

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
nonlinear you know faces as well let's

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.589 
nonlinear you know faces as well let's
say<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.629> had<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:09.369> telephone<00:02:10.369> pole<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:10.970> you

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
say you had a telephone pole and you

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.830 
say you had a telephone pole and you
wanted<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.260> make<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.769> decal<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> bunch

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
wanted to make a decal that is a bunch

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.900 
wanted to make a decal that is a bunch
of<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.470> know<00:02:15.530> right<00:02:15.739> posters<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.580> wrap

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
of you know right posters that wrap

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.420 
of you know right posters that wrap
around<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.870> telephone<00:02:18.319> pole<00:02:18.560> well<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.220> use

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
around the telephone pole well you use

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.240 
around the telephone pole well you use
this<00:02:19.580> technique<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:20.090> well<00:02:20.380> you'd<00:02:21.380> select<00:02:21.620> that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
this technique as well you'd select that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.030 
this technique as well you'd select that
detached<00:02:22.760> object<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:23.769> apply<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.799> push

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
detached object and apply a push

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.750 
detached object and apply a push
modifier<00:02:26.560> push<00:02:27.560> modifier<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.160> what<00:02:28.610> that's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
modifier push modifier and what that's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.430 
modifier push modifier and what that's
going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.000> do<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.299> push<00:02:29.540> all<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.959> polygons

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
going to do is push all the polygons

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.530 
going to do is push all the polygons
along<00:02:30.799> their<00:02:31.010> normals<00:02:31.400> by<00:02:31.549> some<00:02:31.849> specified

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
amount in our case I'm just going to use

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.970 
amount in our case I'm just going to use
point<00:02:35.269> one<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.660> want<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.170> polygons<00:02:36.650> just

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
point one I want the polygons just

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.750 
point one I want the polygons just
barely<00:02:38.019> separated<00:02:39.019> just<00:02:39.349> enough<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:39.920> when

good let's go ahead and build that

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.289 
good let's go ahead and build that
material<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:52.700> I'm<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.910> open<00:02:53.030> up<00:02:53.180> my

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
material so I'm going to open up my

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.170 
material so I'm going to open up my
material<00:02:53.660> editor<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.880> I'm<00:02:55.880> going<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.060> apply

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
material editor and I'm going to apply

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.580 
material editor and I'm going to apply
new<00:02:56.420> material<00:02:56.840> here<00:02:57.250> show<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.459> viewport

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
new material here show in the viewport

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.050 
new material here show in the viewport
now<00:03:00.590> I've<00:03:00.739> already<00:03:00.950> gone<00:03:01.190> into<00:03:01.250> Photoshop<00:03:02.030> and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
now I've already gone into Photoshop and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.479 
now I've already gone into Photoshop and
selected<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.470> vandalism<00:03:03.859> that<00:03:04.069> I<00:03:04.130> want<00:03:04.370> to

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
selected the vandalism that I want to

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.539 
selected the vandalism that I want to
use<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:05.299> just<00:03:05.569> this<00:03:05.690> robot<00:03:06.560> spray<00:03:07.190> this<00:03:07.400> is

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
use it's just this robot spray this is

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.000 
use it's just this robot spray this is
from<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.790> 3d<00:03:08.329> total<00:03:08.660> texture<00:03:08.989> library<00:03:09.410> I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
from the 3d total texture library I

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.750 
from the 3d total texture library I
believe<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.549> number<00:03:11.049> five<00:03:12.130> vol<00:03:13.130> 5<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.670> a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
believe it's number five vol 5 it's a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.479 
believe it's number five vol 5 it's a
graffiti<00:03:14.319> I've<00:03:15.319> also<00:03:15.530> extracted<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.220> opacity

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
graffiti I've also extracted the opacity

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.059 
graffiti I've also extracted the opacity
map<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.090> I'm<00:03:17.180> going<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:17.480> use<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.500> we've<00:03:18.859> got

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
map that I'm going to use so we've got

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.199 
map that I'm going to use so we've got
the<00:03:19.160> two<00:03:19.310> maps<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:19.670> we<00:03:19.760> need<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.150> I've

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
the two maps that we need and I've

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.500 
the two maps that we need and I've
already<00:03:20.389> saved<00:03:20.720> them<00:03:20.930> out<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:23.000> back<00:03:23.209> in<00:03:23.329> studio

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
already saved them out so back in studio

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.819 
already saved them out so back in studio
max<00:03:23.870> I'm<00:03:24.049> going<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.260> select<00:03:24.380> those<00:03:25.329> bitmap

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
max I'm going to select those bitmap

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.050 
max I'm going to select those bitmap
graffiti<00:03:27.829> which<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.310> diffuse<00:03:28.609> map<00:03:29.079> and

corresponding mask open cool we can see

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.960 
corresponding mask open cool we can see
it<00:03:38.630> here<00:03:38.780> in<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.079> in<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.380> viewport<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.790> looks

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
it here in the in the viewport it looks

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.120 
it here in the in the viewport it looks
like<00:03:41.030> we<00:03:41.209> just<00:03:41.389> need<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.720> tweak<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.989> UV<00:03:42.560> W's<00:03:42.980> in

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
like we just need to tweak the UV W's in

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.059 
like we just need to tweak the UV W's in
order<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:43.970> make<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.269> work<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:45.489> pw<00:03:47.829> so<00:03:48.829> in<00:03:48.980> order

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
order to make it work so pw so in order

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.110 
order to make it work so pw so in order
to<00:03:49.220> do<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.750> I'm<00:03:50.750> going<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.410> select<00:03:51.560> face

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
to do that I'm going to select face

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.759 
to do that I'm going to select face
since<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.329> is<00:03:53.389> all<00:03:53.720> one<00:03:53.930> polygon<00:03:54.380> I'm<00:03:54.560> just

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
since this is all one polygon I'm just

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.740 
since this is all one polygon I'm just
going<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.010> select<00:03:55.190> face<00:03:55.549> but<00:03:56.419> if<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.599> had<00:03:56.720> a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
going to select face but if you had a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.449 
going to select face but if you had a
more<00:03:56.900> complicated<00:03:57.290> object<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.099> would<00:03:58.250> want

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
more complicated object you would want

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.240 
more complicated object you would want
to<00:03:58.549> use<00:03:58.639> one<00:03:59.389> of<00:03:59.419> the<00:03:59.569> other<00:03:59.599> mapping<00:03:59.959> types<00:04:00.380> so

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
to use one of the other mapping types so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.559 
to use one of the other mapping types so
there<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.519> have<00:04:01.549> it<00:04:01.669> there's<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.209> technique

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
there you have it there's the technique
