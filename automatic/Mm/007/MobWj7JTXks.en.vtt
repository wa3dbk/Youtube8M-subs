00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.330
 Hmm 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.740
 I am 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.950
 Now Tokyo metropolitan area of the road in the laden model the crown athlete s 300-liter engine 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.500
 I'm running 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:39.530
 This time the crown tends to hit a spot on that hybrid 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:44.150
 It is also personally noteworthy that only the athlete left a 3.5-liter armed engine 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.610
 I am doing this and this 3.5 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.390
 to v6 is 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.180
 For the first time established even at as a brand say 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:58.920
 In that it was incorporated 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:06.830
 We think that it may be said that it is the latest specs even if we compare with four rivals 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:11.360
 And it is that run, but still with the exhaust volume that there is a margin of that 3.5 liters a 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.540
 v6 engine such smoothness and after this day 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.660
 I wonder if I say margin of force 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 I feel great in the city 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:27.780
 And that's because it's now at its inception 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.970
 Amazing when you say you want a little accelerated suppressing the great rotation when cruising 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.290
 That response is good 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:39.330
 Shift to lower gear and increase rotation to smooth vise like v6 and accelerate to the floor 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.050
 If you give me that very 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.670
 Feeling flexible 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.060
 You can feel it 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.689
 Although I Do not paint feeling good 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:55.840
 A cutting tree like this in the town is quite comfortable even at pace 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:01.000
 I 'm wearing a tire with that trapezoidal pile, but 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.040
 Whether that probably that feet are firmly body is amazing is me moving properly 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.290
 It is said that 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:13.110
 It was very matured that I could feel from the car well too 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.330
 Well where they are receiving the kind of impression that Do not close to the final form in the name of athlete 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.550
 is 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:27.190
 I 'm doing a great job to pass the toll booth and join the main battle 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.450
 After all this accelerator is already in this moment 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.450
 I wonder if you have not stepped half 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:40.310
 But still got to escape with a breath of time too had enough 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:46.610
 After that at the start of this is still quite precisely that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:50.690
 Even if you choose a wood painting , you can accelerate that as you desire in an instant 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:56.540
 With us perform um at an appropriate number of revolutions 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:03:02.240
 If you feel of opportunity Ohen part of its sides still around here is that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:06.170
 Crown in this crown athlete that I feel that Do it in if inauguration history 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.630
 Now for the first time paddle shift is the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.450
 That 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.430
 When I say that I want to taste that engine engine sound or old things 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.130
 This is very much 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.130
 Well effective Let's accelerate a little 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:32.070
 There is it is a person cafes momentum 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.900
 It is show us the dash there has been a rotation from the paper now 3000 until about 4000 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.489
 Though 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:44.269
 Well, the quietness that you would expect if you would like to leave 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:50.090
 Come hear the smooth sound that of the armed forces from the back of such among quiet 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:51.400
 Or a thing that was very along to the name say tuning also crown athlete of this neighborhood 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.600
 And Do 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.610
 I think to 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.690
 Originally Tsu crown also sedan Tteyuu side of the there are two be only say luxury car 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.970
 There is a reason 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:07.120
 So let's close up the part called sedan of that fr 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.350
 It is a athlete who improved exercise performance well 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.590
 In order this time is extremely Well further that it 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:19.549
 3.5 liters 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:25.760
 A more dynamic drive can be achieved by combining the first star with the launch of at 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:31.850
 It feels like I'm riding that kind of part and I feel that the highway is now 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.610
 I'm running, but I feel like I want to run Yamaichi at that opportunity 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.479
 Will 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.479
 It was a car 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:49.139
 The athlete's 3.5 liter engine is basically the same but 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:51.910
 The launch at is combined and the underbody is also tuned and the athlete further 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:58.120
 I think that the character is deepening 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:01.040
 It feels like that, but on the other hand it's 6 minutes that's different from cars in that everyday scene 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:07.010
 The comfort of being said not to be sacrificed 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:10.210
 After all, it is said that it is the Japanese sports sedan when it comes to lunch 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.210
 I felt it
