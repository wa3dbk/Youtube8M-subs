we<00:00:42.840> should<00:00:42.870> measure<00:00:43.489> probably<00:00:45.890> perfectly

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
we should measure probably perfectly

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.280 
we should measure probably perfectly
normally<00:00:47.339> but<00:00:47.519> ok<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.809> looks<00:00:48.839> like<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.080> have<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
normally but ok it looks like we have a

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.650 
normally but ok it looks like we have a
little<00:00:49.440> too<00:00:49.559> much<00:00:49.589> onion<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.460> right<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.300> 2/3

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
little too much onion all right and 2/3

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.270 
little too much onion all right and 2/3
2/3<00:00:52.500> carrots<00:00:53.989> close<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.980> gonna<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.220> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
2/3 carrots close this is gonna be a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.319 
2/3 carrots close this is gonna be a
generous<00:00:56.699> one

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
generous one

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.880 
generous one
so<00:00:57.629> we're<00:00:57.989> gonna<00:00:58.079> turn<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> heat<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
so we're gonna turn the heat on to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.910 
so we're gonna turn the heat on to
medium<00:00:59.040> high<00:00:59.519> underneath<00:01:00.269> this<00:01:00.590> heavy<00:01:01.590> bottom

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
medium high underneath this heavy bottom

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.990 
medium high underneath this heavy bottom
to<00:01:02.070> pan<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.830> guess<00:01:08.009> is<00:01:08.190> that<00:01:08.310> Nancy<00:01:08.550> did

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
to pan and I my guess is that Nancy did

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.400 
to pan and I my guess is that Nancy did
a<00:01:09.030> combination<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.750> butter<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.080> olive<00:01:10.170> oil

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
a combination of butter and olive oil

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.950 
a combination of butter and olive oil
just<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:12.060> nice<00:01:12.270> flavors<00:01:12.690> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
just because it's two nice flavors to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.529 
just because it's two nice flavors to
have<00:01:13.320> both<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.729> actually<00:01:15.090> kind<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
have both of them we actually kind of

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.300 
have both of them we actually kind of
messed<00:01:15.690> up<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.800> were<00:01:16.890> supposed<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> put
